funny when you made the roll
call, it sounded like prison.
Prison? Yes, because everybody
is in prison. Everybody has been put under arrest. Obviously, the
sheriff as well, he's. But he's there. So how do we get out of
prison? We have to do something.
You know, consequence. We need to understand with self-control,
which is absolutely key to get
out of the mess we are in
altogether. As human beings. We
need to, I think, understand the
fight against the food poisoning, which is more and
more clear for all of us here.
It's. How are you going to deal with that? We need to address
it. Air poisoning. I mean, all
things water. So, you guys, I
don't know the sheriff. Sheriff.
That's not good for you. You see, because you can't bail
yourself out at some point, it's over. The game is over, and your descendants and children pay for
you because you pay for what you
do. We all pay for what we do or
not. There is no escape. Including for me, of course. You
know I'm happy because I know I'm doing something. Aiming for
beauty. It's not even right or wrong. It's beauty or ugliness.
That's it. So understand for
you, your own sake, life,
happiness. That is your reason
for being is to be happy. If you
don't have a move on avoiding
cowardice, hypocrisy, what
disrupts self-control? Monet.
First of the game is going to be over for you as well. It's a warning. I can't do it all the time. But again, here tonight,
today, this afternoon. Thank you.
Do I have let's see. We just finished public comment. So the next item on the agenda please. Calling item number three presentation from ben ritchie.
Informational item ben ritchie from the department of human resources will brief the board on conducting performance
evaluations. MR. Ritchie. Hello.
Good afternoon. Thank you for being here. Sure. My name is benjamin ritchie. I'm a senior human resources consultant with the department of human resources. I'll be providing information for the board on the process for board performance evaluations, for department heads to begin. Oversight boards
have broad discretion in how they exercise their oversight
powers. The charter gives the sheriff's department oversight board the authority to evaluate the work of the office of inspector general and review the inspector general's individual work performance. The board has
the discretion to determine how it carries out this
responsibility. The department
of human resources does not have a defined process for boards and commissions on performance evaluations. The city does have
general performance management system, but it's intended for use by managers supervising
regular civil service employees. The city does have performance management processes for department heads. They include a self-assessment process where
the department head outlines key accomplishments for the year and key goals for the following year. This process is separate, though, from the process for boards and commissions to exercise their independent oversight authority and boards are not required to follow this process when carrying out their oversight duties. One other
information regarding any meetings to discuss performance
evaluations, we would recommend consulting with your advising city attorney to advise what parts of your discussion of the performance evaluation would fall under the government code
for closed session exceptions of public meetings for employee
performance evaluations. Thank
you. And I just want to ask the members if they have any questions of MR. Ritchie to please put yourself on the
roster here. And I just as a
point of comment, I just want to
say that any kind of evaluation should be also a reflection of what we've done as the board, what goals we've set, have they
been realistic? Have we met particular benchmarks? Were we
clear on our purpose, our goals?
So I think that going forward, it's always instructive for us
to take that in mind as we do evaluations. It's takes a little
introspection as well. So any
questions? Comments? Nope. Thank you for being here. None. Thank
you. I know forward. Yes. And hopefully you'll beat traffic when you go home. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Any public
comment on this item at this time, members of the public wishing to provide public
comment on line item three presentation from ben ritchie, are invited to approach the
podium when it becomes available.
Yes. Okay. Sorry. So the main
human resource today is self-control. You see? That's
it. No more exploitation of humans because the name human resources is always kind of
human resources. What is it a job? Okay. Right. Okay. It's self control. Everybody needs
self control. You understand the concept of self control. You own yourself. Nobody owns you. Once you have self control you can't
be controlled. So forget the unintelligence on the top of the
pyramid. Here. It's over for
them. The game is over. You don't want it to be over for
you, do you and your children
self control? Especially when
there are weapons involved? You
see technology, all this crap
which by definition has no self control, technology has no self
control because it is a machine. Okay? Human resources, self
control. Thank you. Yeah I so I
was going to have dan call the
next agenda item. And I think I
need to contact assembly member
joan sawyer again. So we could
take a two minute recess. Or we could maybe move that item
towards the end. I would make a
motion to continue with the line
item five until the assembly member joins. Okay, I second
that. Okay. And seeing no objections, let's do that. Let's
move on to the next agenda item calling line item five.
Inspector general report informational item inspector
general terry riley will give a report detailing the monthly activities of the office of the
inspector general. This report will encompass the recent
conference of the association of
inspectors general, a visit to county jail three alongside
board members and the collaborative efforts with the san francisco jail justice
coalition inspector general.
Wiley. All right. Thank you, dan.
Good afternoon everyone. As dan
stated, we some of the
highlights of this month's activity. One was my attending
the association of inspector
generals annual conference, the
conference was fantastic. It was
we had access to about 65
different professionals specializing in different
aspects of oversight. And so
they they really focused on, you
know, really the agility, the
diversity and just the overall
impact that proper oversight of,
of law enforcement in this
particular case can really have
a positive impact on the community. Now, the association
of inspector generals
encompasses federal, state,
county and city and even some
community based organizations that are all part of that
community. So it's the subject
matter covered, you know, the
full scope of oversight. But
overall, it was a very, very comprehensive and, and, and just
I thought excellent presentation
of current the current state of
oversight locally on on NOVEMBER
13th or excuse me, on NOVEMBER
19th. We my team along with
board members sue and board
member palmer, joined us in
inspecting county jail. Three.
And it was a pretty lively
inspection from the standpoint
that the areas we covered is we
of course, had some intense
interaction with the inmates, but we also inspected the
kitchen and that inspection was
pretty comprehensive in that the person that supervises the
kitchen, I thought did a very
good job giving us an overall
presentation of how the kitchen
operates in wk three, the
inmates that are working in the
kitchen, you can really see how there's some real skill development that takes place, given all the duties that they
are having to carry out, which I
saw as a real positive. And we
also looked at their the maintaining of the laundry. And
I know that that sounds, you know, okay, maintaining laundry,
but, you know, when you're doing laundry for numerous
individuals, it really takes an
organized system. And so we got
to look at some of the industrial washing machines and
the industrial dryers and how
they distribute and redistribute
bedding and inmate clothing. And
again, you know, I think, you know, a lot of the inmates are
actually doing the work. And so you can really see that there's also an opportunity while they're there at some skill
development. Now, getting to the conversations with the inmates
themselves, you know, there had been discussion in our last
meeting about having the inmates have access to one on one
interviews. So one of the first
things we did with this visit is
we announced that we had our
investigator, brett brant, begin
there, and that he was available
to any of the inmates who wanted to have a one on one conversation about the current conditions at the jail. There
were a few who took him up on an
opportunity to speak with them about whatever concerns that
they had, but overall, there
were about 50 inmates, and we had a just a general overall
discussion with them. And I
think anyone who was present,
you could see that there was no
hesitation on their part in terms of being in kind of this
forum of expressing whatever
concerns that they had about the current jail system. And so let
me go over a few of their
complaints. One, and this is a complaint we've heard on both the men's side and the women's
side, and it is the lack of
programing since pre-covid days. So the programing that's going
on with the men and the women in the jail has not come back to
the level that it was prior to
covid. So there was definitely
some complaints about wanting
more programing to be available to them. There were complaints
about and these have been
consistent complaints about the
space and having access to
sunlight. Chief quantico shared
plans that they're trying to
create a opportunity to expand
the inmate access to sunlight.
And so we're anticipating that
maybe by the end of JANUARY that
they'll they'll be rolling out a
new program for increasing the
sunlight for the inmates. So I'm I feel real good about that, because that has been a
consistent complaint by the
inmates. Deputy chief quantico,
who was a captain and has since been promoted to deputy chief.
He also revealed to our group
and the inmates of the intent to
create an orientation video so
that the orientation video would
ensure that the inmates
understand all the services that
are available to them and how to access them. And I guess there's, you know, some concern
that the inmates might not know
everything that is available to them. So I think that that's a positive development to put
together an orientation video. Some of the other ideas that
that we discussed was with with
the board members that in some
of these were our suggestions.
For example, PRESIDENT Icu
suggested that the jail MAY want
to consider a service dog
program and that there is a
number of different facilities
that have service dog programs
that are very, very that have a very positive impact on the
inmates, plus providing a
service in providing service
trained dogs. And so and chief quantico, deputy chief quantico
at the time, said that they were
also planning to bring in the program. But I guess covid hit
and it kind of went by the
wayside. So that is one of the programs that we definitely are going to keep our eyes on and trying to develop there at the
jail. And as I said, we looked at the facilities. Now I think we have to specifically
specifically talk about the inmate engagement that that
occurred. And I do have to say
that, you know, generally what we do is, as the inspector
general, I will start the
discussion with the inmates and many times I'll just ask the basic question of how's everything going? And that just sets it off, you know, in terms of the feedback that we get from
the inmates. And in this
particular case, probably, well,
the first thing that they
mentioned, that is a big problem
is they still feel like whenever there's a lockdown, they feel
like they're being punished for
something they didn't do, something they didn't have
anything to do with, and that
some of these, some of the different incidents are still
triggering lockdowns that are
impacting everyone. In fact, you
know, we've had discussions with
deputy chief quantico about
that. And we have definitely
seen improvements in their
intentionally keeping the operation up and running as much
as they can. In fact, that day,
there had been an assault on a deputy in the jail. And again,
we hope that the deputy is
making a full recovery from that
attack. But as a result, I think
if we had gone back to JANUARY
2023 there, our visit MAY have had MAY have been canceled
because there would have been a full jail lockdown because of an
assault on a deputy. And because of the efforts that they're
making to as much as they can
keep the have whatever incident
occurs impact as few people as
possible. They made a decision
to continue with our visit. And
so I, I saw that as real
progress in terms of how they're
they're trying to avoid the
lockdowns, having such a
tremendous impact on everyone.
Another complaint was of course, as I said earlier, programing
there are it's kind of a two piece complaint. One, they're complaining that they're not receiving enough program
programing, but secondly, when
they are engaging in court ordered programing, the programs
that they're participating in
are really not doing a good job
of getting them the information
that they can provide to the court that they've either completed the programing or they're participating in the
programing. And so the sheriff's
department informed us that that's not really their responsibility. It's a court ordered program. Their
responsibility is to make sure that they have access to that program. But in terms of
reporting and giving inmates the
ability to show proof of their participation in the programs,
it's not the responsibility of
the sheriff and so as the ig, we plan on reaching out to some of the programs and talk to them
and discuss with them like, we need to get this figured out, you can't have these guys participating in the programs
and then not providing them with
any proof of the programing. So
we are that's one of the things that we will be getting to the bottom of and getting that resolved for the inmates. And
then the couple of other things
that are I think are
significant. One, the sheriff's
department had a so a lot of the
inmates have tablets. There was
a problem with the tablets. I
think somebody got into the
tablets and they had to shut the
tablets down. But as a result, all of the grievances of the
inmates had to be handled in
using written paper and so this
delayed the sheriff's investigating their grievances.
And so the inmates were
complaining that they their grievances were being lost in
the shuffle. And no one was was
getting back to them about their grievances. Whereas when they were able to file the grievance digitally on the tablet, they
were in the system and, and they
were being addressed. So we addressed that with, with deputy
chief quantico. And he, he explained to us even before we went in and spoke with the inmates that there they were backlogged with the paper
grievances and that they were, you know, they felt in a couple
of weeks they were going to be able to address everyone's grievances and so I think we got
that resolved with the inmates
and understanding that your grievances have not been lost, and they will be addressed. Now,
the other thing is with the
tablets, you know, in many jails
across california, inmates with tablets were able to make phone calls from the tablets. And in
san francisco, they can't make they can't make any phone calls
with these tablets. So there were a lot of complaints about that. Well, the company that san francisco now utilizes is
nucleus. And the tablets are
well, the contract is almost up,
is almost up. And there is
definitely going to they're definitely going to address
that. Whatever new contract they
enter into that there be a
opportunity for the inmates to make phone calls from their
tablets. So I think that that is
that's another thing that I
anticipate will be resolved now.
Another big complaint was that
when inmates get put in the hall
with the sheriff's department is doing is they go in and they confiscate their commissary, and
the commissary can be edible
items or, you know, in
non-edible items and so what
they do is when they get put in
a hole, they they confiscate all their commissary and other items and they store them away. And
when the inmate comes out of the
finishes, the discipline, you
know, all their commissary is gone. And so there were some pretty intense discussions about
that. And so we discussed it.
And I, you know, there are areas that, you know, we MAY not
necessarily agree with, but, you
know, in running the jail, the
sheriff has the discretion to
kind of set what the standards are going to be, you know, so that if you go into the hole and
they confiscate your, your commissary, you know, that might
be one of the penalties for
going in the hole. However, you
know, we discussed that that aspect of it. And, and I think there's going to be some further discussions as to, you know, because most of the inmates are
not coming from situations where they, you know, let's face it,
can't afford to spend their money on commissary and then
have it confiscated and then not being returned and so that, you
know, we have to discuss there being a different alternative to
that. So but but you know, that is in one of the areas that's within the sheriff's discretion.
And there was also a complaint
and these complaints go to
really the fact that it's an old jail. But they were there was a
lot of complaints about the dust and dirt coming through the
ventilation and inmates feeling like they're not really
breathing clean air. And so on.
In terms of the current hvac
system that MAY be something that we need to address with the sheriff's department and the board of supervisors about going
in and having the hvac system in
the jail cleaned out, because it's probably been a number of years before since they've done any kind of cleaning of that system. And, you know, these
inmates are in these confined
circumstances. And you know, it's not healthy if they're not
breathing clean air. And then
finally, there was a major complaint about the visitation
system in that, you know, in a lot of these things are are
being driven by the sheriff's department having personnel
shortages. So what they
complained about was that when
they when their family members
want to visit, all of the visitation spots are already
taken. And so they're not
receiving the kind of visitation
from family that they crave for.
And I do think that deputy chief
quantico, I mean, you know, he
really does respond. So what we
saw was that we're seeing an
expansion of their ability to
increase the number of opportunities for inmates to receive visitations. It's still
not where it was pre-covid, but
it is getting better. But these were you know, these were all
areas of complaints that the
inmates had. And so some of
these are going to take follow up on our part. You know,
particularly we want to confirm that, you know, they were behind on addressing the grievances. And so in our next month's
visit, we want to make sure we'll have you caught up with the grievance process. We want
to make sure that we're staying
in tune with when the contract
of nucleus is up. And there's a
renegotiation of the tablets, let's make sure that we're aware
of what the complaints are so
that, you know, if there's any negotiation for new tablets that
those issues be addressed. The
confiscate the confiscation of the commissary food, we will
have further discussions with
that. And in terms of the
unsanitary conditions and not unsanitary, but the breathing of
bad air, that's something where
the ig can join with the sheriff
in, in seeking funding for the hvac system to be cleaned out. I
mean, it is a very old jail, and
let's see, we also had a meeting
with so that that comprised our visitation of cj three. I
thought it was very productive
and I and I you know, and I actually can't leave without
mentioning commissioner palmer
who was present. And you know, I
think we have pretty good conversations back and forth with the inmates. And I think what happens when you have them
in kind of this group setting is, you know, initially everybody is
just kind of quiet and there will always be a couple of voices that that want to have
their issues addressed. And then what we notice is that it just
starts a chain and more and more
inmates and to the point where
everybody wants to talk about what, what their problems are.
So we had reached a point where,
you know, we had addressed a lot of their issues. And then commissioner palmer stepped in
and started trying to provide them with some solutions to some
of their problems. And I think
what was notable was everybody
stopped talking and really, you
could just see the connection between commissioner palmer and
the inmates and, and the
discussions and, and to the
point where after we finished
the presentation, there were more I think there were more
folks coming up to you an extra 20 minutes just in the pod,
because just in the pod, because all of the inmates wanted to talk to commissioner palmer
about seeking solutions to their
problems. So, you know, I think
that you found your calling. I
actually wanted to clarify. So the tablet, there was actually a breach into the system. So that's very serious. And that's
why the tablets had to be taken away because it just compromised
the safety of everyone, including those incarcerated,
from using the tablets. And then
the commissary issue goes back to the nutrition that we talked about a lot of them, the
incarcerated, are hungry, so they spend their money and they buy additional food items. So it's pretty devastating when it
gets conference comp confiscated as they're putting in hold. And then there was also, as I
recall, an talking about the number of days when they're on hold and credits on the system. So that's something that needs
to be addressed. Yeah. And
again, like I said, you know,
these are not individuals that come from circumstances where
they just have unlimited money
to buy commissary, you know, and
so to have it confiscated and
not returned, it can be very devastating to folks. And so
something needs to be worked out there with that, because that
just didn't that just didn't sit
right with a lot of people. And member palmer and I spent a considerable amount of time in
the walk in refrigeration, which was pretty chilly, but it was
pretty impressive of how they went through the inventory to
make sure the food is fresh and how things get moved out. So I
think those who don't work inside the kitchen and don't make time for the gym, they actually get a lot of heavy lifting and I was very impressed with the operations there. It
was a great job training and I agree. I think that the kitchen
operation is the one aspect of
the jail that I think really
provides them with some skills
that I see that are transferable
outside, because they all seem really, really dedicated to the
job. Also, and it's actually
pretty impressive to watch. So I
thought overall it was a very productive meeting, you know,
and there was a lot more interaction and I know that
commissioner sue, PRESIDENT Sue has gone to several visits, and I would say that that visit was
probably the most interactive
we've ever had with the inmates.
I mean, people, and I'll say
this, that when we left, we knew what their complaints were.
There was no there was nothing left off the table. By the time
we also made sure that they knew about prisoner legal services, because some had some unmet needs where it would have been, you know, prisoner legal
services. Yes, absolutely. So we also, myself and marshal kane
met with the jail justice
coalition, and we have monthly
meetings with this coalition of
folks and this is where we kind of collaborate and try to come
up with different solutions for
the problems that we're aware of. And so some of the some of the things that we discussed at
this past meeting was one we informed them that, you know, we
are looking at the food contract
with aramark and trying to find some alternatives in providing
more fresh food. And they are
very interested in participating
in a working group that we're planning on putting together,
because what we want to do is as
we approach the aramark, the end of that contract, we want to
have already done the work in
that we want to we want to
really have a working knowledge on what are some of the fresh
food alternatives that can
either compete with aramark or
that aramark can bring into the
fold of the food that they
provide to the inmates? And so we're we're we're actually looking very forward to that
collaboration. And in fact, we
also want commissioner palmer to participate on that on that
committee and finding fresh food alternatives to what aramark is
currently providing. We're also
looking at some of the current
jail programs to assist the
sheriff's department with
identifying some additional
programing. You know, because like I said, the both the men
and the women are craving more
programing. And so we want to
put together a working group that can try to assist with
finding more programing to be
provided to the inmates. And
then finally, we are, you know,
because the subject came up of,
you know, inmates not having an
opportunity to, to have one on
one conversations with the inspector general. So what we
have, what we are going to be
creating is a weekly hour where
inmates will be able to meet,
sign up if they want to have a discussion with the inspector
general's office. They can sign
up to have a one on one conversation with the inspector general about whatever issues
that they're having, and we'll
be doing that once a week, and
we'll be doing it under the
circumstances that all of the conversations will be
confidential. And it would be very similar to the inmate
talking to their attorney. It would be a discussion under
similar circumstances. But we
feel that that will offer them
an opportunity if they have
something that's that of, of real concern and that they can have a confidential conversation
with us and they don't have to
wait for a whole month before
they talk to us. And so we're
looking forward to, to creating
that opportunity. And then
finally in 2019, there was a
survey done of all the inmates.
And so we are putting together a survey that can be administered through the tablets. And we're
going to do a survey of all
aspects of the jail conditions.
And we're coming up with
questions. And in the jail
coalition is going to be participating in that jail
survey with us. And so we're
hoping that by the time they have the new tablets, we can and the sheriff's department has
agreed to implement a, a digital
survey on the tablets that, that
so that everyone can
participate. And we'll look at the feedback that we get from the jail wide survey. I just
also wanted to just mention that most of those incarcerated do
have access to confidential. I
guess, a complaint system at
every visit. Marshall kane's been there along with brant bazan, and they've both taken copious notes. So we get to
engage more. So I want to thank the both of them for doing that. But some have gone directly to
brant, and he's taken their
information, so they've also followed up privately. So I
don't want people to think that everything is out in the open. they feel like they might be subject to retaliation. The
other thing that chief quantico brought up is that they're trying to reestablish the farming program that they have. And I know here in the city, in the bayview with the florence
fang gardens or their farming
program, it's been extended.
It's been very successful for especially for people in food
deserts. So they've been able to
be, I guess, recipients of some
kind of federal funding. And so that's maybe another area that
we need to explore to supplement the food issue. Absolutely. And
I will say that in the year that I've been the inspector general, and this is with inmates having
aspect, having access to brant,
our investigator, marshall, we have not received one complaint
of retaliation as a result of
our visiting the jail and they're speaking out about the
conditions we've not had one person call us and feel like they were retaliated against for what they said about the conditions of the jail, and I
think that's important to there's new leadership in the in
custody division. So and but they are very seasoned deputies who have been there for decades
and recognized by those who have been incarcerated as as people
they can actually go to. So they I found that they actually had a generally cordial relationship.
Yeah. And in fact, we met captain shannon is going to be
the new captain in charge of cpx three because deputy chief
quantico got promoted and is
moving. And so we had a real good interaction with captain
shannon. And he's been there 30
years, very experienced. And so
we think it's going to be a very
smooth transition from captain.
Now, deputy chief quantico to
captain shannon. And then
finally, I wanted to let the board know that in next month's meeting, we'll be presenting a
one year summary of the oig will
be presenting a summary report
of the last year of the office of inspector general. In terms
of what we've accomplished. And
we hope to have discussions with
the board in terms of what are
your goals and what are some of
the challenges that you see that
need to be met by the oig and,
you know, find out what your priorities are going to be for the next year so that we can,
you know, make those very much
the center of moving forward
with the oig. And then as the
board is aware, you know, I did
submit my resignation yesterday
as the san francisco inspector
general, and I think I, I was
pretty clear about why I did it
and what motivated it. But, you
know, if there are any questions
anyone has or wants to discuss,
then I'm a very much an open
book. I you know, as I stated in my resignation, I will be on
board until JANUARY 10th. And so
I am very committed to this work.
And so whatever I can do to make
for a smooth transition, I'm
here to do that. Thank you for
your commitment and I also want to point out that without the help of marshal keane, we wouldn't have the interactive, real time dashboard. As many of
you MAY have noted, our san francisco superior court recently implemented the real
time dashboard for their cases,
and that took a deep commitment
of presiding judge marzullo two
years. So this has been less than a year. And it's up and
running. So that's one major
accomplishment. But I just want to take some comments and
questions from our fellow members. And beginning with
member carreon, great. Thank you
so much. It's very unfortunate that you will be leaving us, but I understand and respect your decisions that you laid out for
us. And, you know, we have been
very privileged to have you with us for this first year, and we are I have to say, I'm very
proud of the work that the office has done, even though that the challenges that were
thrown against it were, you know, extraordinary. But the work that
has been completed is very
important and meaningful. And I
think that's obvious. To the jail inmates that we go and we get to introduce to them, this is the work that has been done and this is what we're planning.
So thank you for all of your work. I, I it's a shame that we're losing you. It is an
absolute shame. But I look forward to you continuing to help the community in a different capacity, whatever
that is in your future. I had a question. What caused the breach
in for the tablets? I think it
was an outside breach. Oh, okay I see. Yeah. Outside software
hack. Okay. Thank you. And
PRESIDENT Sue, thanks. Because I, I couldn't come up with the
word that it was a breach. Yeah, but it was an outside breach. And so that had they shut down
all of the tablets and had to go
to the paper system for filing
grievances, and we actually saw the grievances. They showed us the stack. They were very transparent that there was a big
backlog. Yes. So there, there. So that's why at next month's
meeting, we want to make sure
that that stack is dramatically
smaller. Great. I know when I
did the with you and other
folks, the women's jail visit, one of the things that we had told the inmates was that, you
know, we have an investigator here, and if you want privacy and you want to have a conversation not in the presence
of deputies or around any, you know, folks, that that would be accommodating and there would be space for that. Did that also occur in the last visit with the
with the women? No. In the in the NOVEMBER visit. Oh, yes. That's the first thing we
announced. Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure that so because I think that there's been critiques that, you know, you are having meetings in front
of deputies, which then people doesn't create an environment. But so starting off the meeting that was our first announcement
that we have an investigator here. If there is anything that
you'd like to discuss in
private, let us know. And he is
available to have a discussion with you. And I think there were
a few people who took him up on it. Oh, great. Yes. I know in our visit it was only, I think, one person that did. Yeah. Yeah,
I think that complaint was actually pretty much unfounded.
I think as we've done all of our visits with the inspector general, we've always offered
that. And brant has always been really good at following up with. and I think there was also kind of the implication that the
inmates were not being as
forthcoming in kind of a more
open setting. And I and I don't know if commissioner palmer wants to speak to it, but trust
me, that was not a problem. They told you. They told us everything that was happening.
So, yeah, I think and then like
I said, we took it as a constructive criticism and we
moved on. It. And so we now
start off every visit with we
have somebody available to talk
to you on a one on one. Great. Thank you. So much. Thank you.
Member palmer. Thank you. I yes,
I want to say we're going to MISS You. I hate to see you go, but you know, you got to do what
you got to do, right? And
second. Yeah, the visit that we had and the way you conducted it, the way you conducted yourself, the way that marshal
and the investigator was there
again, I would say that I was looking to see if there was
people not wanting to speak in front of brass. I mean, there
were high level staff there, and so I think that also probably
made them even more bold. And
because it was like you can't get away with this guy standing here. So I can tell on this
lower level deputy that to this
big guy like, so you had you in the room, you had, you know,
higher officials in the room and then you had, you know, us in the room because they was looking at julie like she was going to do something like, you ain't going to mess with me
where she's standing right here. So I was like, wow, okay. So I immediately said, you know who this is? This is the PRESIDENT Of the board and just wanted to make sure that they knew that the grievances that they were
given to us, they can actually
tell their family members to come sit in these chairs right
here and to say even more and to
be even more candid and be more open and get some, you know,
some some, some real time feedback and unfortunately, we don't see them here. And that's part of our mission, hopefully
in the new year. How do we
advertise and market what we are doing right down our general
emails. So we said if you can't be in person or your family member can't, you can always email. They did. And so with that said, the assault that took place, not only was it wrong and unacceptable, but I wanted to make sure that the community
knows that it was by someone who
was mentally ill. It wasn't gang related. It didn't spill over into the rest of the jail. So it
was isolated. And so we were able to come and continue on. And that's going to happen. That's just the nature of
dealing with that population in
the jail. And so I want to also
give props to the jail for handling it in the way that they
did the program. When we talked
about the program certificates
and paperwork and documents, it should be the responsibility of those who are running the
program to make sure that the paperwork is distributed to all
necessary invested parties. It shouldn't be the guy who's
locked in a jail cell on a bunk
with no computer, no printer, no email, no nothing like that.
Should should be, you know, the policy. And so hopefully that
we'll be able to convey that to and not to the office. We're
going to get to the bottom of that. Yeah. And as far as the tablet I think we talked about that. I've used the tablet. It had to have been an outside
breach. So I'm glad we talked
about that. And hopefully we do
we do change the vendor and get
phone calls and texting available. Like I said
communication when you're inside
in order to present a formidable
defense for yourself, especially if you're innocent, you need access to the outside world and all the resources that the outside world has, because there's nothing inside for you
to help you defend yourself.
Yes, there's a law library. Yes, there could be some interaction with your attorney, but there's nothing like accessing people
who are going to, as we say, run for you. You know, and champion
your cause. When you purchase something with your own money, that's your property. And I don't know any other part of the jail where personal property is
just thrown away without documentation. Yeah, I don't
think that exists anywhere in the world. It shouldn't be. Otherwise. It's called theft or misappropriation or something,
right? Embezzlement, something. There's a there's a legal term for taking somebody's property.
Right. So I think that should be
a concern. And it should be a
priority to separate food items
that the jail gives you from the
food items that you just purchased from canteen. Once you
go into an isolated situation, it's not going to take you long to consume canteen items. First
of all, you don't get to buy
that much, and when you're in an isolated situation like that,
you tend to consume more, to
console yourself to, to you
know, pass that time away. So
hopefully, as you said, they
will take a look into that. And
the thing about visit and
scheduling a visit is, which is so important that that, that,
that is fixed is because it's difficult to schedule a visit,
which is I mean, I don't know how many people are going to stay up till 1201 in the morning
to jump online to try to get a
visit slot. That in itself shows love and dedication from someone
out there trying to see their loved one. But what is sad is when it comes to the visiting days, all the slots are not
filled up, the jail isn't busy with visitors coming in, seeing their loved ones, so that
scheduling and then the end
result of it being so busy that they have to say, oh, there's
not enough room. That's what we want to hear. Oh, we just don't have enough space or you know, you got to come back again. Like, that should be the
priority of the jail as well.
One of the things that the ig
spoke on was my interaction with.
The residents and what I, what
we talked about afterwards when we debriefed was that there and
the deputies were are the
sheriffs were also very interested in was creating
incarcerated coaches. Yes. An
incarcerated coach is someone who has been through what you've
been through and can help you
manage your time, whether it's a week or two, a month, a year, whatever your time is, it is
good to have somebody to sit down with you and not only talk to you just as a human being, to
human beings, so you can get
some things off your chest. But to give you a type of time plan, you know how to do your time and
not let your time do you. And so they were very interested in that. And I would love to shop
that around to some nonprofits
that engage in jail services and
maybe some new ones, you know, someone, some some organizations
with some fresh ideas, united
players come up to mind, some other ones come up to mind. That might be a conflict of interest. So we'll talk about that offline. But having that type of resource inside the jail and it and it MAY not come at any cost to the jail whatsoever. You know. But there is from some of the foundations that they receive money from, there is money to, to help in that
situation. An incarcerated coach would keep people calm, would
keep most of the problems down.
And the jail would run a lot more smoother. So it's a win win
for the residents as well as the
staff that supervises the jail.
And I like the idea of the survey. I hope that is in
conjunction with an app that allows them to directly set an
appointment with the ig office, you know, so they can say what they have to say and say. And I
would also like to see you and,
and that's, that's that's about it, I think I think overall everything was good. I think my comments here today was just to
emphasize what we should be asking the sheriff's office to,
to move forward on the last but
not least for the sheriff's department oversight board
moving forward, along with the
ig office, is to have the mayor
and our designee come and speak
to us because we're in the same people's house as she is, right,
or she's not going to be here.
But he, the new elect mayor lori is going to be here. And why not come and talk to us? Because
this is a group effort. This is
a this is a us thing, and there
are a lot of first of all, we
need a budget. And second, we
need a parking permit for us at all times in the city. No, I'm just kidding. But that would
help. So I mean, since we do
volunteer, I almost got a ticket
the other day going to the police station headquarters on
third street, but we won't go there. But yeah, just talking to
the mayor and getting on board with him and seeing what his
program is, not only for the jails and the sheriff's office, but the oversight committee. I heard that he has concerns with
the numerous oversight committee, but I really feel that this one is important. I've already seen the changes because of us. I've
seen the level of the deputies
taking this serious. And we all
know that if you are doing something and you know that you're being watched and an oversight overseeing, you're
going to behave differently than
if you have carte blanche behind closed doors and no cameras and no audio, just human nature. We
already know we've seen studies
you give normal people a badge, and then, on the other hand, you
give normal people some stripes
and say you're incarcerated and you're they immediately create the relationship of I'm better.
I have the authority to do what I want over you, and you have to be submissive. So we want to just make sure that our sheriff's department, our sheriff's office and our deputies, which I think is doing a great job. I haven't heard too much complaint as I have in previous years, about their behavior and whatnot. So I think
what we're doing is good here. I think it should be continued and hopefully that the mayor will come and hear why we should
continue. Thank you. Member palmer. Next we have member mango. Okay. Hopefully I can
make this quick, but I just
wanted to reiterate the earlier sentiments of, you know, just
thank you for your work. And I
know that in day one, you made it very clear that you needed
budget to be able to do the work. And so I appreciate it.
Okay. This my two questions for
clarity. Two questions for
clarity. The assault is that when did that happen. That same
day. That same day. So on
NOVEMBER 19th okay. And then the
second question I wanted to ask
o programing, are they talking about external programing or are they talking about internal
internal. So you have five keys.
Yeah that so they now do five keys. When we first started they were only doing five keys in one
pod. They now do five keys in two pods. But there's not enough
programing. Yeah that seems like an in-house problem. They need
more programing. And so that's
why we discussed with the jail
coalition that we might have to
lend a hand with finding some outside programing that can come
in and come in-house and, and
help. Okay. I guess I don't
understand how outside. I mean I'm I'm down for suggestions of external programing. I'll just
give you one example. So the
latino task force suggested that
they add a hair braiding program to the women. That thing is taken off. I saw that in the
news. Yeah. And so there are
different, you know, outside programs that we can, you know,
find out what's happening. And that could be very, very uplifting to the inmates
because. Right now I get the
sense that they're bored and
they want to they want a program, but there's not enough
programs. Yeah. Okay. That's
helpful to know. I guess my overarching critique and maybe
something food for thought for
just the board. The rest of the
board and for future is I mean, the three big issues that I understand is shutdowns, which I
still don't have clarity on how often that happens. Number two, the lack of programing, which
sounds like it, I just don't understand because it's like five keys is like they get
funding for that. That's their problem to solve for. And then number three, obviously unsanitary conditions. And I
just I think my overall feedback
is like I, I know you mentioned that they are like, oh, it's because of covid, but every neighboring jurisdiction has been able to bounce back. So
that's just not a valid excuse.
All right. In my in my mind, I 100% agree with you from this
perspective, five keys is going strong in some of the
surrounding counties. And i remember being in a meeting going, well, wait a minute, didn't san francisco start five
keys? Yeah, it's a it's a san
francisco program and department
program. It's so there really needs to be some focus on that.
Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just
for the board to consider because I know you're on your way out, but just something that I am thinking about is just
like, how do we have, like, like
I understand when we use vague terms like improvement, I need to understand. I think it's helpful to have benchmarks because then you can understand
measured progress and the speed in which we're progressing. And
that's why I want it, because I
want to hold their feet to the fire. Like, okay, fine, they want to do lockdowns whenever they want. Okay. I need how
often do you do it? Yeah, I think the two biggest
suggestions I would make is we
need to set up a apparatus for
reporting out on when there's a shutdown, because right now we really don't have any idea how often the shutdowns are
occurring. But we do know that when we go to the inmates, the very first thing out of their mouth was the shutdowns and how they feel like they're being
penalized are punished for something they didn't do. So
then it raises the question,
well, how often does this happen? And we really don't currently
have a system set up for letting us know when there's a shutdown. Yeah. And I also think just, you
know, like I understand their issue of being understaffed, but
it doesn't help them, you know, with the lockdowns and having consequences, unintended
consequences. Like, you know, we
also should know how often is
this happening. Yeah. Because you really can't resolve the problem if you don't know the
extent of the problem. So I would say that that definitely is one of the things. And then I
again, I think that we need to
find out why. What are the roadblocks to improving the
programing if you're getting
funding for it. So I was going
to say this also goes back to their it system. If we could have an interactive dashboard. So we know there's a shutdown.
And I know that I signed up on that visitation program just to
see how it works. And it really was like playing the lottery. But after the complaints about
lack of notification or early notification on shutdowns, I know that they had improved because I started getting more
notification on the shutdowns ahead of time, but that doesn't help if a family lives three hours away and they're on the freeway trying to get here. And
yeah, so did you have anything okay with that? Well, let's turn to vice PRESIDENT Richter. I think first and foremost, I
mean, a lot has been said today. I think it's been a very fruitful conversation. And I definitely want to say, you
know, thank you. Ecg wiley. One thing that no one can take away is the fact that you were the
first ecg here in san francisco. And I think it's safe to say amongst my colleagues that you
were the best pick for the
position. And so I think to what
member amigo was, was sharing, I just really want to make sure
that for me that as this board,
we have the opportunity to continue the work regardless of
who's in the position not to
take away from from what you've done and what we've been able to start. But the conversation that I'm really enjoying the most is beginning to start to hear tangible results for some of the
challenges that we are hearing.
Some are new that I think we can really tackle. I think relatively quickly when we're talking about the hvac system, because not only do I think
about the inmates, I think about our deputies as well, too. They're breathing the same air. And I think that's something that should be addressed, you
know, as quickly as possible. I'm also really enjoying the conversation around the
programing. As someone who works closely with five keys, you know, there are charter school really focused on folks getting their geds. But what I'm hearing
is more programs from the outside and community based organizations that can develop a relationship with the sheriff's department to go in and provide services. I can share that in my
work in the nonprofit sector. Before I got to san francisco, I
was working for an organization who had a great relationship with the parole department. And so when folks were being
paroled, they had to come to a meeting at the parole office. And there was, you know, 50 to
60 individuals who were being paroled. And as a part of that, there was 25 community based organizations who had tables that they had to go. And you had to talk to at least five in order to be released from that meeting. Right? So there's some strategies and things I think
that we can do to make sure that folks know that there are programs that are available especially for them to, you know, as I'm thinking about when they come out, giving them something, right. Member palmer
to look forward to for those those that are coming out. So I
would love to be a part of that committee that's looking at the programing. So I think that's a great way to continue to keep things rolling. With the work that marshall and his team has
done is to put together these committees to make sure that, again, whoever is in this role, they have that that access and kind of that, that backbone to come into. Another real concern
for me too, is around the access
to sunlight, just as like a
fundamental right as a human being. So something I know I definitely want to look into, and it's something that continues to come up. We've talked about the jail lockdowns, and I do think it would be great. I don't know if we have the ability or I don't know how often or how quickly we find out. I'm just sharing. When I was on the police commission, you know, anytime there was an ois, an officer involved shooting or something that would
go on. Even us as commissioners would get like a text message or
an email like, hey, this just happened. So then we're also not caught off guard going to
community and they're sharing information about, you know, something that happened. So I
don't know if it's I don't know if we call it a deputy involved
situation or what we can do, but it'd be great to take a look at the technology around that. And
then I think lastly, for me is also the conversation around the
food security had an opportunity to go to an event just a couple of days ago. It was a phenomenal event and it was put on by the
nba foundation, and they are receiving pitches from folks who are designing applications and have these technology companies
to receive funding and there was a young lady who had created an app called produce cycle, and it's basically technology that
connects small urban and rural
farmers together in order to
provide great fresh produce and
food to schools. And so I immediately thought about our
work, and I was like, oh my gosh, like, how can we leverage technology even that? We have to
be able to look at the services and be able to look at the food that we're providing inside of
the jails to our folks, to make sure that it's wholesome and nutritious versus what we've
been sharing as of lately. And then I think lastly, for me as well, too, is I was thinking about, you know, as we talk about the deputy chief, and I know it's been great working with, with with sheriff miyamoto
and chief zhu, but also being
able to look at being able to go in during shift changes. We used to do this at the police department when they were going through shift changes. As commissioners, we'd be able to
go in and just be able to talk
to the deputies to also see what the deputies are seeing and what they have going on, because i just look at it as one huge ecosystem and community, right? They need what are some of the things that they need as well to, to, to ensure that programs are coming in and what are they seeing that also can help us as we are helping the folks that
that are inside and we're addressing some of these complaints. So those are just some of my takeaways and some of the things that I was looking at, some of the things I know definitely would want to work on and be a part of. So just looking forward to continuing to move things forward. Well, you
know, I think what what will do
is in our annual report next
month, we will include a section
on some targets that would be
good for the board to consider
that we think would have a direct impact on the sheriff's
department and the management of the jail, that if we're able to
meet these particular or improve
these particular areas. And I
mean, programing is like staring
you right in the face and I have
my opinions that I don't know if they're appropriate to state in
this venue, but that I think you do need to communicate to this
board in my opinion, what would would I think would improve
programing? And I'll do that. So
I just have to say, I appreciate so much your dedication and
commitment and also earning the trust of the community. I think that was first and foremost when we were interviewing for an inspector general, that there would be no credibility if we
didn't earn the trust of the community. So thank you for your
commitment and your work. And I expect, you know, we're going to cross paths again and
collaborations and, you know,
our reports. One thing I also
noticed is we had a lot of loss of ngos and collaborative organizations that used to work with the san francisco jail. And
I don't know if it's because the people who work for these organizations don't live in the city anymore. So, for instance,
when member palmer and I were in
the kitchen, I remember yolanda
robinson. She handles interfaith services. So when we're talking about specialized meals, especially when the holidays,
she said, I used to be able to
have a rabbi come and from the city, and it's like, well, we have a large jewish
congregations here. We have. And
so she had to go to the east bay
to have someone come. And so that was astounding to me. And I want to know why there is a loss of the supportive services and organizations that we have, the
ngos, the other thing that is really crucial is about the
scheduling with those incarcerated, their meal time,
their activities. And I know there's complaints about
attorney visits, which are
crucial, but sometimes because of the staffing shortage, the
deputies would say, you have to
wait because this is the meal service time and we have to supervise that and we can't
break away and have the attorney visits. And so that becomes a
complication. So I'd like to research that more and see if
there are posted schedules. And that way they can work more closely with the attorneys and also prisoner legal services.
Again, like the visits, it's really like playing the lottery. If you've ever gone online to
try to do it and agreed that the
shutdown notifications need to be improved, but they actually
were improved. One thing that
was very notable to me was, and
I don't know, member palmer, if you remember, one of the member,
the incarcerated, he said, I think that there should be some counseling and it should be male centered. And so how often do we hear about really? It's
stereotypical that men don't want to reach out and have counseling. So I really echo the urgency of member palmer talking about incarcerated coaches and
counseling in there. And that's also why I really wanted to have the service dog program. If you've seen some of that really successful programs, a lot of those incarcerated have never felt any kind of touch from a
human or an animal for years and years. And they've been incarcerated. So really, it's
that sense of warmth. And it can
be your four legged, furry friend. And it also teaches them, you know, responsibility.
And as my belief is that we are
looking for all these services, supportive services pre reentry.
So that means programs education. We and we can't just
say five keys. We should say okay if you don't have your ged
we want you to get your ged. We want you to be able to get certificates for job training so that when you go out. And then we also make sure that the city provides supportive services for
post reentry, because in this, a
really difficult economic environment, even if you had all
the benefits of the world, it's
hard to survive. Let alone when you're still tagged with you
were formerly incarcerated, so
not only with the clean slate program, but all the possible supportive programs that we can
have. And I agree that we need
to have the a mayor or the mayor, preferably the mayor, but or designee come speak to zdob
because as everyone and I've been out there, I mean, you know, some of the supervisors don't necessarily run from me, but when they see me, they know
I'm asking for a budget and
money. So I think that that's kind of a good thing. It just
shows that I've been really dogged about it because some of them kind of run and hide and pretend they're in another
conversation. So and I just have to say, I really appreciate all the collaborative approach, you know, with the fellow members. I think we've advanced so far in the last two years. I mean, just
think about when we were trying to establish everything and we had the ability to create a
framework. We've done our annual
benchmark and tasks. We will do
that again. And hopefully, you know, shore up things. It's
still a grand experiment, but I
think we've come this far. We
all bring different skill set and different value. One thing I also wanted to really highlight
again, that member brewster, really vice PRESIDENT Brychta
really brought up is really the working conditions of the
deputies. So when I had to park far away this time and I noticed the trailers in the parking lot,
I think the public needs to know that's where the deputies sleep at night. Some deputies have
really long shifts. It's too dangerous for them to drive back
home, so they end up sleeping on
the premises. So this is as it
gets cold. And, you know, I also think about those who are
unhoused. But is that really a
proper working condition for our deputies to be sleeping in
trailers in our parking lots? I,
I was about two weeks ago coming in to city hall and going
through the metal detector, and I looked down at the deputy and I said, oh, how's it going? And
she said, I'm in the middle of
my second shift. And I go, so you're working 16 hours? She
said, yes, I'm working 16 hours. Oh my GOD. So and they don't
have a choice. So I mean, they I
think deputy nguyen could especially talk about this, but
sometimes they just try to dress as soon as possible and get out
of the locker room. Otherwise they get involuntarily recruited for another shift. Wow. That's
interesting. Yeah. You know.
Yeah, that's definitely true.
Most deputies are getting 3 to 4 hours of sleep per night and,
well, it's based out of a seven day work week. Two of those
days, they get drafted for 16 hours. And some deputies live
far away. So by the time they get home, they shower. They eat
a little bit. If any, and then
they go to sleep for 3 or 4
hours and they have to get up really early in the morning to beat the traffic, get back to
work. So it was true with the trailers, it's definitely a big
help. And they they could get more sleep that way without beating the traffic. They just go straight to the trailer. They can shower at the jail. There's a showering facility and they could go straight to the trailer
and get a couple more hours of
sleep. So it's a lot better currently. Currently I am
working at cj three, but I'm detailed to recruitment, so
we're trying to get staffing up as much as possible. And from my personal experience, sheriff
command staff are doing everything possible to get us out there and the recruitment booths to hire as much deputies
as possible, and it's very busy.
We'll go to community engagement events, recruitment events, we'll engage with them, and we have a full time recruitment
civilian officer that's hired
specifically to recruit, and we'll engage with them, get their contact information, do
follow ups. I give out my personal cell phone numbers. I'm talking to two potential candidates right now. Whatever
they need to get on board, I'm communicating with them and we
get a good turnout. Like we'll
have you know, 160, you know,
come, 58 will come, you know, to do the physical agility oral
board written tests. And we're
running around trying to fulfill
the oral board interviews,
administering the physical
agility test, and trying to trying to get them on board. Right. So that's picking up really well. And we're getting a
good turnout and hopefully the
staffing will increase. So that the deputies won't get drafted
as much like those mandatory two
days out of the seven. Right. I
just want to address a inspector general. Wiley, you know, I wish
you the best. I saw your letter and you did great work, and i
just want to wish you the best on your your new endeavors. Thank you. Regarding the
sunlight, you know, I'm not I'm not surprised when you gave your presentation regarding sheriff
command staff being open to
constructive criticism because
from my personal experience,
when the jail runs more efficiently, the deputies do
less work. The inmates are happy. Everybody's happy. Right?
So I'm not surprised when you said, you know, sheriff command staff was welcoming constructive
criticism. So with that said,
staffing shortages causes a safety issue, right? Not just for the deputies but for the
inmates. So, for example, if there is a big fight in one pod
and there's not enough deputies to respond to that, someone could get killed. And we have bigger issue than just the
lockdown. So the lockdowns come in place. Yeah, they're locked
down for 24 hours, but someone's not going to get killed potentially. And that could happen when we're so severely
understaffed. You know, safety
for the inmates and the deputies is the main concern. So
regarding the commissary, from my personal experience at work
in kh3, we give them their commissary back after they're done with lockup. I think the
issue comes into play is where when they go to lockup, and this is from my personal experience, they're asking for their commissary back when they're in lockup. No, they're being disciplined for something they did that was wrong. Right. You're not going to get your commissary back. It's almost like rewarding a negative behavior. So I think there's a little bit misconception, misconception there. As soon as
they're done with their lockup, they get their commissary back.
Okay. Right. Programs regarding
the programs, the manager of the
program should be administering that. You know, the deputies have their issues dealing with
the jails. They're very
overworked, understaffed. The whatever program it is, when
they when they complete their program, the program manager should have a checkbox right? Okay. You completed it. Here's your certificate. Here's proof
that you completed it. And boom,
that's take care of that right.
For the dogs, for the inmates. That's a great idea. Like I
would love a dog for the inmates, but for the deputies too, because that's going to make us happier. I got a cocker spaniel brightens my day. Had her for like two years. Love her
to death. And I think the deputies would like to, you know, pet the dog. And you know, when they're feeling down from
being drafted to play with the dog a little bit, you know, obviously they're going to do their stress reliever. Exactly. Yeah. When they get a break they
could you know and that's that's
a great idea hvac system clean up. Yeah I agree 100%. We're
breathing that air too. We want
clean air. So lastly yeah thank you all for everything you're
doing. Great idea about the parking pass. I'm on board with
it. You know. Yeah that's all I got. Thank you. Yeah. We thought
you got to park in the back with all the sheriff deputies. Yes. no. Vice PRESIDENT. Yeah. Just
really quick if I can. I mean, I think thank you for that, deputy nguyen, because I think that just speaks to the ecosystem. Right. In terms of what we're talking about. We have an opportunity to really do something to really change, you know, the jails jail system across the state of california, right, starting here. So just really looking at that ecosystem. So I appreciate that there's just two things that I, that I missed out on. One, really love the conversation around the coaches. I think about us as an organization involved in education. We have educational coaches that are inside the schools that are
dealing with the kids that are truant, the kids that they want to send to the principal's office like, no, you can send them here and we can have a much different conversation because our individuals have been there and understand what these young people are going through. Sometimes they just need to eat. And so I think having coaches to assist the deputies as well to when there's things that are
transpiring and be like, hey, these individuals can, can maintain and kind of take this on with your assistance. I think that's great. And then was there a timeline on the tablets like in terms of when they would get them back? That was one of the things I was thinking of. I think they have the tablets back, but the, the, the, the key thing was that the contract is coming up, okay. To go with a different company. Gotcha. Okay. And
that's what I think they should do. Okay. I would because there
are a lot of I didn't get a
sense that anyone was really happy with nucleus as the tablet
provider. Okay. And that but we
can follow up with that. Okay. Yeah. Because I was just and
that's good to know because I was also just thinking and concerned about the technology. Like how is somebody able to hack into these, these tablets
that we have that are supposed to be secure inside the inside of the jail? So that was very concerning, because I know for us, as a community based organization, like we have to like cyber security is something we have to have in order to even
be provided a contract. So that
was that was it. That was it on my end. And I would just follow
up on that when williams
suggested, you know, providing a
coach to the inmates in terms of managing their time, I think
there was universal and that came from the sheriff's office. Everybody was in agreement with
that and thought it was a great idea. Yeah, yeah, it's like with
the police department does in terms of, you know, being out when they're walking the beat with somebody from D.P.H is there, and you have different individuals that can actually help, you know, de-escalate and do some, some things and have a different area of expertise.
Right. I'm thinking of U.P. Urban alchemy. Right. Who we see
outside. Yeah, which is a program for folks who are former lifers. Right. They have a different conversation with folks who are on the street. So
absolutely, I was going to I was I'm sorry before you, I know you're going to get into that. I
wanted to say that reimagining
jail. Also, I would like to say
that we can reimagine what
punishment looks like when you do something inside of jail,
right? The isolation part of it is to make sure that you get
time to reflect on what you did,
as well as keep everybody else safe, but the isolation itself
or not having properties should
not be the punishment. The
punishment should be being able
to correct your behavior. And as
children, young adults and even as adults, sometimes we need
people to talk to say, what did
I do wrong? And how can I correct my behavior? So when we're taking food away from somebody, which should not be a
punishment, food should not be
weaponized. Just in my opinion, as someone who's formerly incarcerated and someone who deals with people in correcting
their cognitive behavior, right?
Food and necessity, air, water,
clothing, housing like these things should not be used or
weaponized against anyone. So
hopefully we can still have a conversation around what should
be taken away from somebody when they're in isolation in order for them to correct their behavior and their thinking.
Yeah, I agree 100%. Food and you know, the title 15 stuff that
still continues. Like they get
food, water, clothing, you know,
they're not denied their title.
15 they still get fed. Right. It's just that they're not going to get the commissary at the
time. Right. You know, like top ramen that they ordered. They're not going to get that. They're not going to get their their goodies right. It's like almost like icing on the cake. They're not going to get that until they're off of lockup. So I actually had an inmate worker that was solid right? He was a solid inmate worker. Really good. But when I looked back at his charges, I was surprised I
was even him. So I actually talked to him. I was like, how
did you change from this to that? Right. And he told me the story.
He was like, I was wild back
then. I kept, you know, getting
in trouble. I was acting out, I was rebellion, I was rebellious against deputies. I would get in fights with deputies all the time. But it wasn't until I got put in the safety cell going to lock up, having time to reflect
that, I finally reformed myself and I was like, hey, you. I
couldn't, I couldn't even tell them. I couldn't even tell the difference between him from his
charges to, you know, someone
out in the street like being a normal citizen, productive citizen. Right. So I told him, good job and everything, but
that was because of the system that was in place. Again, we don't take away their, their,
their meals. They get their
meals, they get clothing, they get bedding, you know, they get
everything that that is entitled
to them. Title 15 but if they're
on lock up, they're not going to get commissary and they're not going to get, you know, certain free time. Right until, until
until they fulfill their.
Punishment, so to speak. So I
was going to say what was really
heartbreaking is I met one gentleman, he had just turned
18. So he was in the pod. So he came from the juvenile justice
center and he was one of the people who said, I'm not getting my braces tightened when they're
supposed to. So I mean, that's how young he is. And so I also think it takes someone from the
outside who will be caring. And I said, you know what? You know, you know what you need to do. This was a lower level thing.
You can change. Make sure you take advantage of the education
programs moving forward because that's just too much of a life to waste when you're only 18 years old and you have the rest of your life to look forward to. So I just want people to know
that, I mean, if they're able to volunteer and go in, I know my uncle used to volunteer and my uncle's like a world war two veteran. So he's like a young 97 year old now. But he used to volunteer at san quentin to play chess with those incarcerated. It's just, you know, some kind of outside source. One thing I,
I'd like the members to take on an issue, but I will not be forming committees because that would require that I have to do notice or dan has to do notice.
So jan, jana, correct me if I'm
wrong, but so down the road, if
you have an issue that you'd like to take on, just email dan
and I will say go for it and
then I will ask for a report and particular timelines that we think that we meet and I'm happy to be supportive of it. And we and if there are issues that the board needs to vote on, we can bring it up. Then. But that's why I'm hesitant to form committees, because then we have to notice everything. I wanted
to just recognize that chief chu is here, and I want to congratulate a new graduating class from santa rosa. And
that's why chief chu is a little bit late today. He was there to graduation with sheriff
miyamoto. One thing that I'm really heartened about is the junior deputy program. I'm so
proud of those kids, and that's another area where they they show such great maturity and
leadership and those I think
hopefully are our, you know,
future deputies. But, you know, it's really disconcerting to
have this involuntary recruitment because that's no
way for a family life. And
especially I know member karen's been active and I was also on
the commission on the status of women trying to reach 30 by 30.
And dads play a great role. But you know what? When a kid is sick or needs something, they always ask for mom. And so it's harder to get women into our law
enforcement when we don't have
more stabilized scheduling. So
but thank you for your much needed input, deputy. I mean, that's why you're here, to bring in that perspective. You're
welcome. Thank. So with that, dan, can we call. And just to let you know, assemblymember jones-sawyer had just called.
And so I don't know if he's logged on. He said he was actually in his car logging. Can
you resend him the link maybe on the on the text. But we'll take public comment in the meantime. At this time, members of the public wishing to provide
comments regarding line item five, inspector general report are invited to approach the
podium when it becomes available.
this was a lot to absorb, but
okay, so I think you could go back to self-control. You see, because not everybody has the same tolerance for isolation.
For example, when it breaks anger, it's not the same as when you want to reflect self-control. So I think it it's
linked. You don't adapt, you
don't apply the same thing for everybody. You need psychology depending on the case. I mean,
it makes it more difficult. But
look at the four words I heard, the three words I heard the most
is programs, tablets and covid.
So program. So make sure the program who makes the program?
What's the goal? That's it. Because program. What is this
program? Yes. Like robots. So
tablets. Be careful technology.
It shouldn't prevent the guys to learn how to write again. You
see rights read not on a tablet you can use it for. Of course you know it's there. Last thing.
Covid. Okay. Sorry, guys. It's
going to be something as you
might have understood in the
especially in the recent years, especially since the pandemic of an intelligence called covid,
many things are reversed. So let me explain to you quickly. It's going to be a scoop. I said it
to the board of supervisors and the police department already.
So we don't need the public here to watch too much. It's okay. Covid means certificate of
vaccination id from the very
beginning in reverse. It reads
devoxx, which in the language
called hebrew means demon. You
can verify it. So that's it. It
gives you another perspective.
And to anticipate what is
probably going to come again at us from unfortunate
unintelligence over there. Sorry.
Thank you. Member jones sawyer.
Okay. Just go on to the next agenda item and then. Okay.
Calling line item six evaluation of amendment to sd of rules of order discussion and possible
action item review. The updated
zdob rules of order, specifically rule 1.14 a and
rule and rule 1.14 b, which were
approved on MAY third, 2024 with
an agreement to reassess in six
months. So members, we had the forms requesting information, and I wanted to thank member nguyen for suggesting a form.
And it does give us a paper
trail and so I'm kind of agnostic as to if we take action
or not. We continue it, but it's been, I think, a more orderly fashion of asking for
information. And I just want to, you know, ask members not to do public records, act when we can just make simple requests. But
this is this was a vehicle to just keep things a little bit more orderly when we were requesting information. And just to let you know, the requests
that were made on the settlements, all that that's come through and we will be discussing it in the new year.
So do I have any kind of discussion on this matter? Thank
you for that acknowledgment
regarding the forms and, you know, it's nothing new. Actually. It's a standard form. Anybody who requests documents
have to fill out a form you
could go into, you know, sfpd foia requests, any type of
document reports, anything that
you request, you're going to have to fill out a form first, last name. Right. So it's
nothing new, really. I just just thought of that idea based on
other organizations that already
had it. But thank you for that. I think it keeps us accountable to make sure that we're processing the request for
information as well. I had a
question about this. What are we
defining as like a presiding
officer? Because I'm assuming I'm assuming that that means
whoever is running the meeting.
Yeah, we initially we had had we thought we would coordinate PRESIDENT, vice PRESIDENT And
then it was just better to just have the PRESIDENT. So maybe we need to fix that language if we
continue this. Right. It's just
not used any. Well, it is
actually in rule 2.5 I see it
okay. No, it's fine. I move to
approve this. Okay. Oh. Do we have the form here? I guess we don't. Do we have the form? I guess we don't have the form
here. That's okay. I don't I
don't it depends. I'm. I will move to approve this. I don't see why we need to continue it
further. I don't have an issue with the language as long as it was. You know, my concern was presiding officer. But I see
that it is being used. We want to review. You know, how things
worked out after six months. So it wasn't meant to be permanent. But we can make it permanent
moving forward. I just want one second just to read this through
this.
I think my only thing because I know the last time we talked about this, I was like having an issue about like the 21 calendar
days proceeding before the meeting. And if we find it
necessary, if we can kind of
truncate it a little bit, I think at least for me, I just yeah, there's flexibility. Okay. Yeah. It's just that if we are making a request from the sheriff's office, we try to do it three weeks in advance so that they can get the
information for us. Totally. I
totally understand that piece. Except as provided the board.
So, commissioner, do you would
you have a recommendation of just doing it less or is it more
so that less okay. And then the other change, I just want to
just make sure I understand is this is not different from the last time we talked about this, right. No. Okay. Same language.
The PRESIDENT Shall prepare the agenda because previous to this
role, it was the PRESIDENT And the vice PRESIDENT Would prepare
the agenda. Yeah, we still I mean, we still confer in general anyway. It's always been a
collaborative effort. Effort. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't
for the first year, let's say
that. Yeah. That's why we had to learn how to manage that as the
vp for both presidents. But that's a non-issue anymore. So
we don't have that drama anymore. Right? Right. And I guess my the reason why I'm bringing it up is do we actually need to make a policy out of it. Oh, interesting. Well, I mean, the issue is even with the form, it could potentially be viewed as a committee. So I just didn't want to enter into that possible brownout violation. If the
PRESIDENT And vice PRESIDENT Were acting as a committee. So
that was a recommendation that I
just have the PRESIDENT. But i
think that I hopefully have been collaborative enough to just take in whatever people. It's
totally not. It's totally not a reflection on this board, but
even just for future. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's creating a good.
Yeah. You know, and I like to have evergreen policies where it's not based on people, but based on best practices. Yeah. What would you think about ten calendar days preceding a
regular board meeting? Ten. And
you know, before I just want to comment, like, you know, we all agree that there's a staffing shortage in the sheriff's office, and that's no different
than the personnel office. So
the longer I mean the standard would be like 25 to 30 days,
right? I think that's a fair,
reasonable amount of time. So when somebody does a records
request, personnel can go get it. Sometimes, you know, they only have one person working in there. So they need time to find and they're not just getting one request from us. They're getting multiple requests. Right. So I think I maybe I misunderstood because I didn't realize this
rule was written on behalf of the requesting from the sheriff's department. I thought
it was just in general to set the agenda. No, no, it's not just even setting the agenda. So if let's say you wanted a report, right? And you'd say, I want this report, and whether it be from the sheriff's office or another office that works with
the sheriff's office, I still need to coordinate it. And so even if we shorten the deadline, it's unlikely that I would get
the information to even place on the agenda, because the person providing the information wouldn't be available. Yeah, I'm
under the same impression as
commissioner mango because it's literally in the section of meeting agenda. And there is no
in the subdivision b, there is no timetable, right, that's
established. So it seems that
the focus point is only the 21 days for an agenda item, and
there is no mention of any records. Records like deadline
in. Yeah. In 1.14 b so if that's
the intent, I think then we should also include the they
need to, you know, the same language that all items need to be submitted or the request for
material, you know. Yeah. I mean
the form we don't have the form here, but then the form also it's not necessarily immediate, it's just that it's not a public
records request. So then we can be a little bit more relaxed on
the deadline. Yes I understand.
Okay. Well we're still it's back
under now and I MAY I'll withdraw it. Yeah I'll withdraw
my motion as we you know, thank you so much for your points. And then just and just to they're very helpful just to check to see if assembly member jones sawyer is on and if he is, maybe there'll be a motion to continue this item while we I'll motion to continue it so we can give it a little bit more thought.
Second, that okay, any objection. Okay. And then plus we would
need to have pretty much a unanimous vote because it's
still by the number of seats and not by and member palmer is no longer with in the meeting. Is
he on. Oh let me call you back. Oh okay. Let's take public
comment. I'm sorry. Oh no. Oh no. We take public comment for public comment. Sorry. Nope.
You're spot on. At this time, members of the public wishing to provide comments regarding line item six evaluation of amendment
to be rules of order, are invited to approach the podium when it becomes available. There
is no public comment. Should I
call the roll on the motion?
Member mango I have mango is I
vice PRESIDENT Brooker I is I
member carry on I carry on is I member win I win is I member
palmer. Is yeah I had to leave
okay PRESIDENT Suh I there are
five ayes. The motion passes and this line item will be continued
for future consideration. Yeah.
That's a settlement. Yeah. Did
you do to his email and. I'll
take a break. Do you wanna take
a five minute break? I'll take a
five minute break.
Sfgovtv. San francisco
government television.
Oh. Okay. Recalling line item
for presentation from reginald. Do we take public comment on
that last item? We did. I don't know. I can't remember. I thought we did. Oh, we did.
Okay. Okay. All right. Recalling
line item for presentation from
reginald byron jones-sawyer, senior informational item.
Assembly member reginald byron
jones, senior, sawyer senior,
representing the 57th california assembly district, will discuss
his efforts as an assembly
member as well as his individual
contributions to criminal justice reform and potential state funding for civilian oversight of law enforcement. MR. Jones-sawyer, can you hear
us? Oh, yeah, I definitely hear
you coming in loud and clear. Thank you, reggie, for joining
us. And I wish we could see your
face, but I just want to put out there to the public. You've been
a great mentor to me on the california democratic party platform committee. That's when we first came up with civil
justice reform. As well as criminal justice reform. And
you've always been out there. So as a great mentor and you're
still doing the work. That's why I thought it was important for
you to be here. And we have our inspector general. Unfortunately, because of lack of funding, he's tendered his
resignation. But you will help
us. I'm confident of making sure that the work that we're moving forward can be a model for the rest of the state, if not the
nation. Okay, great. And it is ironic that because I never
really thought about how much
interaction I had with inspector
general or even civilian
oversight or or most important,
when you have consent decrees,
which is another form of federal oversight which you never want
to have. And as a as a member of the city of los angeles,
director of real estate, I
worked with lapd as they had to work through all the consent
decrees that they went through,
even though they they had a police commission, which is an
oversight, they still had a
federal oversight mandate on
them that lasted for years. In addition. And so I worked for
the city for about 25 years, and I remember the struggles they
had during that time. And then when I worked for the state of
california, I just now just
turned out this past monday, and
I've been on public safety all
12 years, chair of public safety for seven of those years. And during that time, we were under
a consent decree, and we also were struggling in the state
level, struggling with an inspector general and how to
have an inspector general in the
cspoa most important, our
correctional institutions,
making sure that we were doing the right things because they
were under a consent decree or
for almost all the time that I was there. And I even remember
jerry brown was unbelievably frustrated with not only the
inspector general at that time,
but just the whole process of consent decree. So what I
usually tell people when you
talk about inspector generals, I
always say that it's almost it's almost like a check and balance and for you as, as elected
officials and for the public,
it's someone that has a everyday
window into what's going on. So that they can give you some
ideas, suggestions so that you
can you can make corrections
within law enforcement. If
you're doing this to be a I
gotcha and to punish law enforcement for doing what
they're they're doing wrong.
That is the wrong attitude to go in with. This is really about
trying to prevent them from
doing things that are wrong. And
one of the things I tell people is that's why I was unbelievably
in favor of instituting cameras
in on, on law enforcement
officers and in cars, because I
looked at that as a window for a law enforcement officer, their
supervisors and the public to actually see the interaction and
see what's going on, and so that they could make corrections
before things turned either
lethal or violent or turn into a
lawsuit. And the reason I came
up with that is I was watching
some videos of some enforcement
officers talking to minorities, and I noticed that they would have their hand on the gun. And
when we showed it to those same officers that they had their
hand on the gun and how intimidating that was and how that could cause where someone
would run or someone would
become more aggressive or how
things would get out of control.
They were able to monitor and
change their habits so that we wouldn't have those those terrible interactions that we
were having. And when it comes
to funding an inspector general,
which has been even at the state
level, we and I was on budget
budgets of five which funds the
corrections institutions and the
inspector general. I tried to get more money for them to be
able to do their job. You know, it's like a two for one. You want them to do their job, and
two, you want them to have some kind of authority to be able to
make corrections, but not in a
in a way where they, they,
they're doing the job of law enforcement, but be able to both
of them work together to make
those corrections. Why? One, if
you're talking about funding,
take a look at and I don't know what your what your what your
lawsuit rate when it comes to
the amount of money you put out for officer-involved, adverse
interactions. I know the city of
los angeles and the state of
california. It is quite a large
number. It more than covers the
salaries of the inspector general and all of their staff
that they have. And if they if the inspector general could help
reduce that or eliminate that,
that cost. I look at that as a
cost savings or cost avoidance
because at the end of the day, you're not going to get a lot of funding from the state or the
federal government. In fact, it
will be the opposite. And the
example I give is when we were
cdcr, the california corrections
rehabilitation, when they were under a consent decree. During that time, when we did not have
money in the budget. I know it's
been a long time since we had a budget deficit, but if you remember those hard times when
we had 30 and $60 billion budget
deficits, the over the guy that was over the consent decree
still required the state of
california to put in hundreds of
millions of dollars to make corrections that we didn't have
the money to do it. And it ended where we were taking money from
other places to be able to, to
cover that. And so from my
perspective, if we had just just
gone ahead and made those
corrections on our own at their
own speed, but just made sure we did those corrections or avoided
a lot of the things that were going on, we could have saved
taxpayers so much money. And I
always tell people at the end of
the day, what you're trying to do is stop the lawsuits. One,
two, you want to ensure that you
never and I and I, I implore you
to never wear it, make it get to
the point where you have a
federal government come in and
force you to make the changes
that you need so that citizens in your community can feel safer
if you think that is onerous, you you have no idea what what it could be like to have that
kind of requirement. Put upon
you. And so when I when I talk
to people, one, when you look at an inspector general, please do
not look at this as a way to
slap people on their hand. But if you could figure out a way that this could be an a collaborative effort so that
your department can be the
shining example of what law
enforcement should be in this
country with the help of your inspector general. That would be
great, because a lot of times, and it's unfortunate you have
senior members of law
enforcement that get ingrained in what they're used to doing, and they don't realize that
society has changed. Morality
has changed. People have
changed. And even just talking
to people and saying certain
things to people, you know, as
as julie sue and I will tell you, you can't even just say,
yes, sir, yes, ma'am, because you got transgendered. I mean,
things are so different now. And it's not just woke, it's just
what people want to be called or people want to be treated a
certain way. And you've got to get up to date to what that is
and not become entrenched in
what you grew up with. But what
is what is going on now to be able to be able to law enforcement, to be able to deal
with today's problems now, which
are much more complex and, and
difficult than it was before
tech. I, I, I remember people
who lived on the street. We
would we had really horrible
names for them. We just kind of ignored them. They weren't that
many of them. But look at it now. There are homeless people everywhere and law enforcement
now, how do they deal with that?
In the old days, I'm an old guy. I'm 67 years old. I remember if
someone was mentally had some
mental problems, there was a there was a wagon that would just pick them up and cart them away to camarillo or some way out of sight, out of mind. Well, you can't do that anymore. And
in fact, it's almost illegal now
to just do some of the things we
used to do back in the day. And,
and we can't criminalize people
who are mentally, mentally have
mental challenges or people who
are just poor and, and their,
their way of life is, is where
they have to live on the street and they have to live from day to day, mouth to mouth to mouth. And so law enforcement has to deal with that. Now. And until
we can create our own cadre of people to deal with them, we're
going to have to figure that out. And an inspector general would
be great at being that buffer to
be able to get them, to be able
to deal with just an arm, just using one instance of something
called homelessness. How to deal
with that? An inspector general can can make sure that if an
officer is using a technique
that they were taught in, that
they were taught in the academy,
that MAY not work out on the
street right now, that you can
make adjustments immediately and
not have an unfortunate incident where someone MAY lose their
life or it gets videotaped and
it has this horrible, horrible,
egregious assault from a law
enforcement officer have that
look that this looks crazy on a
on when you when you look at the film, which again, we didn't
have back in the day. So I will
just leave it at that. I know
there's limited to no state
funding. I wish I wish we had
had this conversation when I was in the assembly, when I was on budget, because this is a great
idea. I never thought about
trying to find funding for local
jurisdictions so that they could create their own inspector
general. I think it would be a
great idea, and in fact, I MAY
steal that idea now that I thought of it just now. But to
be able to come up with funding
so that communities like yours
who are actively wanting to
pursue this, the state should
provide some type of matching
funds or funding to, to make this happen. And I know there are people in the assembly now
that if I bring this idea to
them, they MAY take it on as one
of their one of the things that they want to do. That would be so with that, I will reply and
open up for. Yeah, the question
I was going to say a little too long that would be great, reggie, if you could be our
champion. We are so pleased with our inspector general that we've been honored to have for almost
a year now. And I think we've
accomplished more in, you know, the 11 months than someone would
take in three years. I mean, we now even have a real time
dashboard on where people are
incarcerated and our population.
We've done the in jail visits.
We've addressed issues with those incarcerated, the conditions we have a great rapport with our sheriff,
sheriff miyamoto. Deputy mike
nguyen is on our board right now. So he tells us about the working conditions because as I
see it, oversight is you know, it involves the incarcerated and their families, but also the working conditions of the deputy. It's a whole spectrum.
And if everyone's happy, we feel happy. But I'm going to open up to my fellow members and we have inspector general wiley sitting
with us. But we'll have him talk
and then our vice PRESIDENT,
D.O.J. Brewster, he he
previously sat on the police commission. So he brings a wealth of information for us on our sheriff's oversight board.
So with that, I'm going to have inspector general wiley address
you, terry wiley, all right. How
are you doing, MR. Jones-sawyer? Hi. How are you doing? All right. Well, you know, for me,
this has been an unbelievable
opportunity to conduct oversight
and but, you know, to also do it
over an agency that has strong
leadership because the one thing
about oversight that I was
looking for from day one was
what kind of transparency was I
going to find? Was I going to
receive resistance, if any? And
what I, what I was pleasantly
surprised to find was a
department in the in the form of sheriff paul miyamoto, was
someone who was really open to
and welcomed oversight of the
agency. And it makes a huge difference in terms of your
ability to try to bring positive
change to an agency, to life of
inmates and also if they're, you
know, operating outside in the
community, you know, being able to monitor and monitor those
activities. So for me in san
francisco, it's been an absolute pleasure to be the inspector
general here. And although I'm
I'm leaving it, it is
bittersweet. Trust me. So but
you know, what is the budget
like? Oh, it's terrible zero. So
you know how much. Yeah. And how much more do you need as an
example. Well I mean I, I think that to really get the agency up
and running and to have all of the pieces that you need in
place, you, you definitely would
need at a minimum of 5 million.
And so we need ten. Yeah. I
mean, you know, 5 million is, is
really just to get the agency in the state of california. Pardon
me. What was the question? I
said $5 million of budget dust in the state of california. Oh,
we have budget dust. Yeah. Oh, I agree. Absolutely. And, you
know, we were so absolutely nothing. Yeah. We were so
fortunate, reggie, in that we had the help of the department of police accountability. That's very well established right now.
We are sharing the chief
attorney and a couple of investigators. But that's really
not sustainable because you know, the department of police accountability has won awards for their efficiency and not
missing statutory deadlines. So
we don't want them to start missing statutory deadlines to try to cover what we do. And
it's under an mou that they actually look at the more
serious issues with with sheriff
when there are particular complaints. So and the voice that you heard was our former vice PRESIDENT Member, shoji
carreon, who was a former prosecutor. So when she said,
you know, we need 10 million, that would be ideal. But, you know, even with the budget, we were asking for just 2.5 million just to even have an assistant, because our inspector general didn't even have an assistant to calendar things. And we're
borrowing resources. So that's
been a really tough haul for us.
So, inspector general, did you have anything else? No. Anything you can do to assist us with getting 5 million to start would be fantastic. And we will. We
also have now D.O.J. Brewster,
our vice PRESIDENT, and he was formerly with the police commission and works deeply in
the community on programs for those in reentry, but also more importantly, to prevent our at risk youth from entering the
criminal justice system to begin with. Member jones-sawyer, how
are you? I'm fine, thank you.
And I want to say, first and foremost, thank you for your
work. I have been a fan of your work and have been able to follow what you've been doing in
los angeles. I have some friends
that are along the dim circuit, and former state senator isadore hall and senator steven bradford
and member mike gibson. So I
spend quite a bit of time in los angeles and have heard of and been around and been able to see
your work. So I want to say
thank you for what you have done and kind of continue to do. It was great to hear about the
budget dust. I think that is something we should coin and maybe even look into having some conversations with our excuse
me, our assembly members here. I think being able to have a conversation with member haney and member stephanie, I think
would be great for us as we also have a new mayor elect as well, too, as a member, palmer was
sharing to have the discussion with with the new mayor that's put in place to talk about how important this oversight board
is, as well as the position of
inspector general. I was also happy to hear, you know, member jones sawyer, you shared what I think we've been really talking
about today as a group, especially when we had our ig's report was around, you know, collaboration and just the complexity of the role of the ig
and how much good it can do. And
as an entire ecosystem. Right.
Not coming in. And I think formerly being on the police commission, not coming in and, and slapping hands and thinking about discipline as much as it is, like, how can we work together to make the entire system better for everybody that's involved from our
deputies to those who are housed and also looking at, you know,
how things look for them when
they come out. So I just really appreciate hearing the reiteration of how we're
thinking and how we are operating as a body of this oversight board now moving
forward, that those are the conversations that we're having. So I just want to say thank you for your time. And again, just just a fan of your work and what you've been able to do. So hope we can continue to tap into to
you and to the to the resources and connections that you have. As we continue on this journey. So without a doubt and I'm I'm
always willing to help
communities that want to shape. I mean, we have to reshape the way the inspector general even
is perceived right now. It's perceived as a disciplinary tool
and we've we've got to change
that image. And the only way we
can do that is having an example of an inspector general that is
not. And you heard what happened with our sheriff's inspector
general. He was the last one
that just left. But not not the
one before that would not work with the inspector general at
all. And it created and we spent more money and time and
resources watching them fight each other. And it never really helped that los angeles county sheriff's department and their
morale went down. Their their incidence of officers calling
out sick went up. And the ability to have good law enforcement in the community
went way down. And that's
because it was like a I like to always call it it's like two
divorced parents or two parents who are about to divorce,
fighting all the time. They love their children. They all want the best for them. I mean, both sides love the community, want
to do the best for them, but
they fought so much that it just
you. And if you've never been
the I'm. I'm a product of a divorced parents, so I know how
devastating that can be. And watching that happen. And so
that's what happens in our community when both aren't
working well together. No,
absolutely. And I concur. And i can share I think I'm a
millennial, but I definitely know that my niece, who is ten years old, gets disciplined far different than I did when I was
growing up. And so, you know, just even looking at that very basis, right, I think is something that we have to take into consideration the generations have changed, technology is changing, and evolving. So we need to make
sure that we do so with it. When
it comes to, you know, our laws
and, and things that that we put into place right for folks. Right? Right. Definitely. I'm
glad to hear it that this is,
this is really encouraging for
especially in your area. I mean, that's that's why people come to
california to, to do new things and to step out beyond what their comfort level is. This is
great. And I just need you to
know that we have great representation on our board. Coming from the community. We
also invite people from our
reentry programs, people who have, you know, lived the life
and know what's going on and to make recommendations. I'm sorry that member palmer william
palmer, had to leave early, but he comes with the experience of having been incarcerated for
over 30 years and he was incarcerated. He was incarcerated in los angeles,
really in his late teens. And so
he's come out. He's been very inspirational. He's a writer and
artist, and he's tried to make life better for people coming
out. We you know, in our most recent jail visit with the inspector general, this is something that maybe in the
past, we hadn't heard of. But, you know, those incarcerated we
were in the men's pod and they talked about wanting counseling, you know, male centered counseling. So where would you have heard that even five years
ago? Right, right. So, you know,
and member palmer actually
talked about having incarceration coaches in there
just to talk about life in there
and what you can do while you're on the inside to make yourself a better person. So when you get
to the outside, but, you know, a lot of this, I don't think people understand that we need a lot of support services pre
reentry and post reentry because
we live in a very expensive
state. Even if you grew up with, you know, all the possible amenities, it's still tough to make a living and let alone if
you've got that label of being a
formerly incarcerated person. Oh
definitely. I, I, I went to
norway where they have they,
they have a rule that no matter what you do, you're going to get out in 25, 26 years. And so they're there to rehabilitate
everyone. I mean everyone for
every crime. I think there MAY
be 1 or 2 people that did some really horrendous things that probably will not get out because they just they probably
won't get out, but that's 1 or 2 out of the whole system. And
it's based on the fact that during world war two, adolf
hitler incarcerated all of the politicians in norway when he
took over and they were under
extreme abuse during that time when they were liberated, they
went and said that when you get incarcerated, we should think
about rehabilitation. And they
made rehabilitation the number one priority and they changed
the rules. So that people would
get out. And so they worked real hard to make sure you have a skill. You're able to go back in the community to do whatever because they know you're getting
out. Think about what I'm
saying. We know you're getting out. So we got to make sure
you're better off coming out
than when you went in. And I saw
some amazing things where I saw
these guys just sitting in the cell with, with, with the
women's guards and I said, don't
you worry about infractions and things of that nature. And they looked at me like, that never happens because they know
they're going to get out. And it just just something they just
don't do. And their guards in
norway are considered almost like rock stars. They're
considered people who do the good in the community. And they're, they're, they're
they're they're lauded and they
get the right education and backing that they need so that
they're able to give social, the
social science, psychiatry, all of the human sciences that you need to be able to get somebody
out of that criminality. And it
was it was an amazing thing. And
I think we need to do that with our criminal justice system so
that people can get out and do
better. And that's why I was so
proud that when I came in, it was 169,000 people who were
incarcerated is now down to 90 something. Most of those people
had not recidivated. They have
not recommitted their crimes. And it's because we instituted a
lot of things that they're able
to get out and be able to lead a
regular life. We have a whole lot of work to do, but think
about that. At $139,000 per
inmate that we spend, think
about how many inmates we would
need just to fund you if we
could get them out of and back
on the street and become working
members of society. How much
money we would save it's budget
wise, it's a it's a it's a great
idea to be able to, like you said, to be able to find the
resources so that they don't recidivate. And, you know, part
of the other part of the
equation is also having
particular treatment centers for mental health as well as
addiction, because that's not
what the jails are meant for. And there is not the capacity to have full blown treatment while
someone is incarcerated. That's not the, you know, environment
for them. And it causes an extra
strain on the deputies and the staff. Oh, yeah. Well, L.A. County at one time had the largest mental health facility
in the nation, and that was our
L.A. County jail. And it was not
set up for that. And so you you
had people and they had their bunks stacked one, two, three,
four tiers high, like bunk beds,
four tiers high, just stacking
them in there it was. And it probably still is a horrible
sight to see. And so we've got
to do better with our, with
people I call it. We got to send them not to a mental institution or an institution. I like to call it a happy place. We've got to figure out a place where you're absolutely they can get
the treatment they need and
understand that it's not a pill. It's not like you give them a shot and guess what? They're mentally stable now. You can't give them a shot and they're
offered drugs. It's a long, long
process. MAY take 6 or 7 tries
at this before you can get them off or get them well again, to
be able to society. And once we
learn that, then we're going to be able to fund that on an ongoing basis and, and be able
to handle that in a much better.
Well. So I know that you're not going to stop your work, even if you've been termed out. So I
hope that we can count on you as a resource to help us move forward. And I know other jurisdictions are looking to san
francisco to try to establish an
office of inspector general and be able to fund an inspector general and staff in other
jurisdictions as well. Well,
that's good to hear. I was I was
worried that you know, let's be
honest with the with the new
federal administration coming in
and people who don't really believe in what you're talking
about, who actually believe in
the opposite of it, that we would have trouble continuing
the good work that is going on.
So I'm so happy to hear that
there are there are communities that that believe in it and want
want it to happen. So I thank
you. You you have no idea what
you're starting now, I know it
doesn't seem like it'll bear
fruit, but I guarantee you it will and you'll be able to look back ten years from now and go,
oh my GOD, look what I did. And
like I always tell people, like, I tell the people in the
assembly 12 years, I said to do the best you can in 12 years. And they all kind of grumbled,
you can't do a lot in 12 years. And I said, I know of a young
minister that started a boycott
with the bus companies. 12 years
later, he was assassinated and changed the world, and that's martin luther king. So from the montgomery boycott until he was
assassinated in MARCH on washington, he changed the
world. In 12 years. So you can
do it. You can change everything in a relatively short period of
time. Well, thank you for this
partnership. And we look forward
to a continued association with
you and we will give you back the rest of your evening unless other members have any
contributions. Thank you. Other than to say thank you so much
for calling in. All right. Thank
you. And thank you. And now that you're you're termed out, you
might have some time to visit us here in san francisco. And we would welcome you. Yeah, it'd be
fun. Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks. You're welcome.
Thank you. At this time, members
of the public wishing to provide provide comments regarding line
item four presentation from
reginald byron jones, sawyer senior are invited to approach the podium when it becomes
available. Yes, sir. You can change the world in that you
need to be serious. You need to
use self-control. 12 years.
Okay, I could hear everything
that was said, but okay. Okay,
you got to sort out what is not
accurate from history. You know?
So stay focused. And yeah, we
can we can do it. We need to do
it. We're going to do it. It's going to be in san francisco as
an example, not only for the us
of a, but for the entire world, including in my country, france,
because it's a mess there too.
Okay, so never mind. Thank you.
Calling line item seven. Possible revision of JANUARY
meeting schedule discussion and possible action. Consideration of the possibility to either
reschedule or cancel the regular meeting schedule for JANUARY.
JANUARY third. In light of
holidays, holidays, travel. So I
think I have an initial question. So inspector general
wiley, are you available on the
10th or. Okay, I would prefer the 10th as well. Yep. I'll be
out of town on the third. Okay. The country actually. Do I have
a motion. So move. Second. Any
opposition? Seeing none, I think we're good. Public comment.
Sorry. Public comment. At this time, members of the public wishing to provide. Oh, you're
away on vacation? Okay. Yeah.
Oh, good for you. Yes. I'm glad.
I hope you're bringing mom on vacation again. Yeah. Most
likely. It's like I'm still
going through it. At this time, members of the public wishing to
provide comments regarding line item seven. Possible revision of JANUARY meeting schedule. I invite you to approach the podium when it becomes available.
There appears to be no public
comment calling the roll on the
motion member mango I have a
mango. I vice PRESIDENT Bruckner
I. Bruckner I member carry on, I
carry on I member nguyen I minh
I PRESIDENT Icu I. There are
five ayes and no no's. The
motion passes. The JANUARY 3rd meeting will be continued to
JANUARY 10th. Calling line item eight future agenda item discussion and possible action
item. So colleagues on that rule please send any kind of
amendments to dan. Oh, sorry. Member. Karen, did you want to say something? Oh yeah. But if you're done, I just wanted to
add to the agenda and see if we
can get air. Ben here so we can talk about recruitment for a new ig. Yes, yes. That's your agenda. Yes, yes. We will. That's that's kind of forced it
for us. But the other thing was
on the rules, if we do have
possible vote on that, just a reminder dan, that we need ten
days notice on that. And then
any additional items, just as we culminated a calendar, I think
the second time on recruitment might be a little bit easier. We
at least have that job description. We know what we've
been through, and I think we actually did pretty well in the job description. We were just actually really fortunate to
have inspector general wiley
apply even and hopefully some of the people that we did interview will reapply. Yes. And then we
also will have to calendar, you know, interviews and then that will come down. But if we get it done in start the ball rolling
in JANUARY, I think maybe we can look at the first quarter, having someone new on board and the continuation, because I'm
looking at like the fiscal years coming up and then it's already budget time already. Anyway, by
the time we talk about MARCH. So yeah, just send everything and
we will put it together and we
can discuss the year's calendar. And then we also will have, I think eddie jiang will be coming
in JANUARY. We also have the
sheriff's legal office, ronnie
singh, talking about some of the policy changes that have been
incorporated. Right. Dan? Yep.
So yep. I think we're good even for the JANUARY meeting. And so
and then any suggestions? I
would welcome them. So I think
oh okay. You want me to recall. No thanks. I'll just look for a
copy and then so I guess we're
ready for public comment at this
time, members of the public wishing to provide comments regarding line item eight future agenda items are invited to
approach the podium when it becomes available. There appears
to be no public comment. Oh, I
think we have one. Is the last
item here or there is general public comment that will be next. We'll have general
comment. This is for the agenda item okay. But this one. Yes
okay. So push the food growing.
It's key. You are right. Farming
okay. That's it. Anybody who
objects I mean against it show
it. See you can't object about
us. I mean, in jail or anywhere
from growing food. Again.
Farming. There is not better for future agenda. But yes. For
example, you want to save your comments to general comments. Oh no. He wanted to add it's part of it. You could add this. I
mean, think about it at least.
Calling line item eight. General public comment. At this moment, members of the public are
invited to speak to the line nine nine general comment I'm sorry. Nine yes, calling nine. Number eight I mean nine sorry.
CHAIRMAN. Public comment. At this moment, members of the public are invited to speak to
the board for a duration of two minutes regarding matters that were not included in this afternoon's agenda that fall
within the jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. During this public comment period, neither sheriff personnel, the inspector general, nor board members are
obligated to answer questions posed by the public, although
they MAY offer a brief response
if they choose to do so. If you wish to provide public comment, please approach the podium when it becomes available. Please remember that you have a maximum of two minutes to express your
comments. MR. Few, what a
formula! Good luck to you sir.
Happy holiday! It's coming up dutch, because I think DECEMBER
is not going to be like a, you
know, a piece of cake. I know
I've got my source. I know. To
end with. Yes. Make sure there
is something that is troubling
me. It looks like in fact, you are the jail department
oversight board. I mean, you have to talk about the function of the sheriff themselves. The
sheriff is in charge of the government's right to make sure the government is not doing
something no good. It's the
truth. So, you see, I mean, I
don't know, because I think you are targeted to think only about
the jail system, forgetting that the sheriff is supposed to be
responsible. Yes, sir. I mean,
you represent the sheriff. Well,
it's clear enough because otherwise it's like you distort
the real oversight here again. Happy holiday. Have a nice everything else. Happy holidays
to you. Holidays and calling
line item ten. Adjournment. Action item. All those in favor? Aye. Any nays? Meeting is adjourned at 4:43 P.M. Happy
holidays everyone. Holidays."

singh. Thank you and welcome and thank you for traveling from
sacramento. All right. Thank
you. Good afternoon, MADAM PRESIDENT and board members, thank you so much for having me here today to give you this presentation about the california office of the inspector general. I am americk
singh, the inspector general. Am
I supposed to know I'll do it. Okay, thanks. All right. So I
wanted to quickly start off by
telling you who is the oig. The
oig has been around. The california office of the inspector general, has been
around for over 30 years, and most people don't know that. We
originally started off as a
piece of the adult and youth and adult correctional agency, a
state agency that no longer exists. But back in 19, the
early 90s, the late 90s, there were some legislative hearings
that found there was widespread
abuse in the correctional system. And in light of that, the legislature determined that
the california oig should be an independent state agency,
separate and apart from the correctional system. In 2004
2005, there were some litigation
that occurred. There was a federal class action lawsuit
that was filed by a number of incarcerated people, alleging widespread abuse that continued throughout the correctional
setting. In light of that, the legislature stepped in and in 2004, 2005 expanded the
california oig authority and
gave us a number of different monitoring and oversight roles within the correctional setting.
It should be noted that that
lawsuit was filed in 1990, so it
took well over ten, almost 14 years before the correctional system had some real widespread
change and oversight provided by
the california inspector general's office. We did have
some glitches. In 2010, there
was the california senate office of oversight and outcomes. That
was not pleased with some of the
work. The then oig was doing and took away some of our authority.
However, they did add some additional authorities giving us medical inspections the
opportunity to look at the quality of care within the
prison system and then in 2019, following a special review of
the grievance process that we conducted at one prison, where
we found a number of systemic issues within the grievance
process, the legislature amended
our penal code section once
again and restored a number of our responsibilities, including
the ability to do audits on our own and do special reviews of
any area where we felt it was necessary. Of the department of
corrections. So basically, the
inspector general's role is to
review policies, practices and procedures of the california department of corrections and
rehabilitation. So what is our purpose? The purpose of the oig
is to make sure the department of corrections is complying with its own policies, and that they are applying their policies consistently throughout the
state. The department of corrections, although their
their numbers are now down to 33 state prisons at one point was
35 state prisons plus parole agencies, plus having out of state correctional facilities due to the large number of incarcerated people that were housed in different states as
well, and the oig responsibility
came in to make sure that the
policies that were being the
policies that were being applied in one part of the state were being consistently applied in the other part of the state. And our role is to ensure that the department of corrections is actually applying the policies
that they have in place. We also
make recommendations for
improvements as a statewide
agency, we are able to identify issues and make recommendations to the correctional department in regards to a policy that they're applying differently throughout the state. Early on,
we found that with the 35
prisons, every prison was doing their own thing and they were separate, independent, siloed
institutions that were not being consistent when they were following their own policies.
And procedures. What we do is to review those, discuss those
issues and to bring
transparency. So transparency to the governor's office, the
legislature, to stakeholders and
to the public. The services that
the california oig provides are
12. They're easily distinguished
between monitoring, between doing reviews, doing audits, and
then also doing complaint
reviews. Not only do we review retaliation complaints, we also
are the ombudsperson for sexual
abuse complaints. And we also have an intake line and an intake system set up so that the
incarcerated population, their family, the public and
stakeholders can get ahold of us
just really quickly. Our
complaint and intake line, we
were averaging about 250 to 300 complaints a month, and as of
this year we have now we are now averaging 900 complaints a month
that my staff have to review in
2023. We had over 8200
complaints. We will far surpass
that number this year. We attend the incarcerated person advisory
committee meetings. We have
staff members that go out to the institutions at least twice per
year and meet with the incarcerated population, talk to
them about their concerns, talk to them about their issues, and we provide a summary of those visits that are available on our website. We also meet with the wardens at each individual prison. After leaving those
meetings to discuss with the warden issues that we've seen or systemic corrections that they
can make right away. One of our
other roles, monitoring audits, special reviews. We do monitor
the employee discipline process.
We monitor internal affairs investigations from the
beginning, from the time the complaint is received by the
hiring authority or I apologize,
sent by the hiring authority to the office of internal affairs.
We monitor each investigation.
We monitor each investigation
from the beginning through the discipline process, all the way through the state personnel
board hearing. If there is one,
we offer our recommendations to the investigators. We offer our recommendations to the attorneys that are representing the department of corrections. We
also offer our recommendations to the hiring authorities, the
wardens, in regards to the sufficiency of the evidence that they are seeing, whether allegations should or should not be sustained, what the
appropriate penalty level should
be. We are a part of the process from the beginning, all the way
through the end. We also will make recommendations on whether
or not a case should be settled.
Our audits. We do performance
audits of programs within the department of corrections. We
also do special reviews of any area in the prison system that
we feel is needs a special
review, needs some information
to be brought to light. One of our most recent special reviews looked at a backlog of grievances. The department of
correction had a large number of
staff misconduct grievances that
they were unable to review, and
they converted them all into just routine, less serious
matters and sent them back to the prisons for review. We highlighted that area and pointed out to the department where they did not comply with
their own regulations and made recommendations that such
actions no longer be taken. In light of that, the department of corrections did go back and review those allegations to
ensure that they were addressing appropriately any allegations of
staff misconduct. Some of the other special reviews we've done is we've we did a series of
reports on covid and how the department was handling covid.
Covid protocols. And there's a
number of different areas that that entailed where we were also able to make appropriate recommendations to the
department to implement statewide changes for the protection of not only the incarcerated population, but
their staff as well. Just really
quickly, we also have a medical
inspection unit. We do medical inspections for the quality and
access to care for all of the
prisons. The california prisons are a number of them, which are still under the control of the federal court receiver. That
does not impact our work. We do
an assessment of each prison
exactly the same based on
metrics and tools, and we assess the quality of care and the access of care for the incarcerated population. I have
a team of doctors and nurses who
are qualified to go into the prisons and make those
assessments. So what are the components of effective
oversight? There are three
major. There's many different components, but there are three
major components that that help
effective oversight independence, transparency
through public reporting and
access. And cooperation. Looking
at independence. So the
california office of the inspector general is an independent state agency.
California penal code section
6001 25 establishes the office of the oig as independent governmental agency. The inspector general. My position
is an appointment by the governor. However, it is also subject to senate confirmation
and it is a six year term. The
state agency, the office of the inspector general and oversight
agency must be free from
influence. We must be free from the appearance of impropriety, and we must be able to make independent decisions by
independently reviewing policies, procedures and
investigations within corrections without having to
have the oversight by the agency
that we're actually monitoring.
Another key component is transparency through public
reporting for a prison system
and jails. They are entirely
operating behind walls and
oversight provides a window into
those settings. Having the
opportunity and the ability for
my staff to go into a
correctional setting gives us an opportunity to see what's happening behind those walls and
what we do and how we do it. We
put into public reports because,
in my opinion, a public report
is that window into that incarceration, that carceral
setting, our statute actually
requires public reporting annually for our discipline,
monitoring our grievances, our
use of force reviews. And also
we are required to publish an annual report summarizing the
work we've done for our public
reporting. In 2023, we published
17 reports, and in 2024, as of the 29th, we had published 14, but now we're at 15. Reports. This year already, this slide
puts on their warden, vettings, which is an area I haven't touched on, which doesn't necessarily apply into a jail
setting, but for the california prisons, my office is responsible for doing the
vetting for each warden that before the person is appointed
by the governor, we do vetting reports. They're very detailed reports, but they're very confidential and they're protected by privilege. So although they're on this slide, they are not considered a public report. So I just wanted to make
sure that that is clear. So in order for our public reporting
to have impact, we put all of our reports on our oig website.
So this is a screenshot of our
website as you can see, there is
a number of areas on there where
you can go into publications and publications are where you can
find every report that the office of the inspector general
has done, even those that we did
prior to the electronic system. We have them all scanned and in
there. So you can go into the publications, you can find every report we've done for the last several years. This section of
our website also provides the public insight into the cases
that we monitor. Each of the
units, whether it's employee discipline, whether it's use of force, whether it's my intake team or my grievance monitoring
team. Every month they do a summary of cases that they've
looked at, and we publish those summaries in on our public
website for the public to see. A third key component for effective oversight is access
and cooperation. Access to records, access to incarcerated
settings. Access to prison is a
very critical part of oversight. I always say you can't do
oversight from your desk. You
have to be in into the into the
prisons to see what's happening, to be able to report what's
happening. The oig has statutory
authority for full, unfettered
access to all things within the department of corrections. We
have access to their reports. We have access to their medical
records. We actually have electronic access to their strategic offender management
system. So we are able to log into their system and we are able. We are able to see what is happening within the prison
system. Cooperation is also a
very important part of oversight. Having a positive working relationship with
corrections is what makes our
office so successful. We don't always see eye to eye and we
they don't always follow our recommendations, but we have to have that professionalism. We
have to have those conversations, and sometimes we have to make those difficult calls, and we have to report
those difficult decisions that
they made that we do not agree, followed their own policy and procedures. Two weeks ago, we
published a sentinel case
report. It did not go over very well by by the department of corrections. However, they had made a disciplinary
determination on a high level executive who engaged in sexual
harassment. They they opted to
give him his job back and put
him back within the prison system. We absolutely disagreed with that decision. We thought
their reasoning was flawed and we felt that that was a case
that needed to be highlighted, separate and apart from our
normal course of reporting. So
the oig goals are to provide
value. So any oversight agency
that should be a key goal to
provide a value not only to the state but also to the
department. How we do that is we monitor in real time as
possible. We provide transparent oversight. We work with the
department to improve their
performance, and we try to be proactive in responses to their
issues before they result in a
crisis. And we also try to
obtain the best results in the interest of taxpayer dollars, because obviously we are we are being we're part of the general fund. And so we want to be responsive and we want to ensure that we are being champions of
the state as well. So measuring
success. When I was asked to do
this presentation, it made me think about how how do we
measure what we do and how do we know we are being successful. So
what we have done at the oig is
we've set goals. We have a five year strategic plan, and we set
our goals to look at every value
and service that we provide. So we went into discipline monitoring. We've gone into our intake and what we've done is in all of the different program
areas, and we've set goals of what we want to do and can we accomplish those goals and what do we need to accomplish those
goals. And as our strategic five
year strategic plan period is coming to an end, and I was reviewing the documentation, I'm
happy to say that we are meeting our goals. We are monitoring cases. We are hitting
benchmarks. We try to monitor at least 20 to 25% of the cases,
and we are close to hitting that benchmark on our discipline
cases. We're not so close on the grievance process as that is a fairly new program, and we're still in the process of hiring staff to fully staff the grievance monitoring program.
But those are some of the areas
that that we can look to see whether we are being successful.
We also look at whether or not our recommendations are being implemented on our website. We
have an entire tab where we list out every recommendation from every single program area that
we have made to the department of corrections, and we can look
to see and we report whether or not they've complied with that, whether they've implemented it
in part, or whether they've refused to implement our recommendation as well. And then
also a part of measuring our
success is getting feedback from our stakeholders, not just the
legislature and not just the governor's office, but also from
the incarcerated population. So measuring success can also go
beyond the numbers we get. Thank you letters from the incarcerated population for
helping them. We've received
letters from an incarcerated person who is having a mental
health crisis. He reached out to our office via our hotline. We reached out directly to his
prison and to the mental health
officer, and advised that mental health. The chief mental health officer of the issues that we were being that was being reported to us, they immediately
sent someone to his cell. They made contact with him and they gave him the services he needed.
And in turn, he wrote us a letter back saying thanking us for saving his life because he thought taking his own life was
going to be his only option.
Earlier this year, we also had a
complaint call come in to us in
regards to a group of
incarcerated people planning to attack and kill an officer within their housing unit. The
information provided to us
allowed us to piece together because we have full access to
the department of corrections systems. We went into their
system. We did a little bit of
investigation, figured out what was being discussed and where
where this was happening. We
called the prison. We advised them of what we found in the anonymous complaint that we received. Within 45 minutes,
they had a team go to the identified cells, and they ended
up finding a number of makeshift
weapons within the cell, consistent with what we had
heard through the anonymous call they were able to take into
custody the incarcerated persons who were planning this attack on an officer and in essence,
potentially saving her life. So oversight isn't always easy. It
isn't always welcome, but it can
be a valuable tool to bring transparency and accountability.
It can help restore public trust with law enforcement. We don't
just point out what's going
wrong, we also point out what is
working to make sure it is fair
and balanced. Oversight is
tough, but necessary, but with
respect and professionalism, there can be success for both
the oversight entity and for the
law enforcement agency. Thank
you very much for giving me this opportunity, and I look forward to answering any questions that
you MAY have. Thank you. I just
wanted to remind members to log into the system so that you can
be in the queue, should you request to speak, and you would
have received the login number
from dan on your paypal. Do you
see it? Well, yes. And. Thank
you. So member palmer. Yes.
Thank you so much for coming
today. And I was I was I was
there and I remember, you know,
your office coming about and it
was very inspiring for the population to have that type of
oversight access. It didn't
really translate at that time,
at least in my area, that it
made a big difference on the
ground. You know, inside. But as
I'm listening to you today, I know that it took time to grow
and develop into what it is
today that it is having impact because there's much that is
being changed due to your reporting in the hands of
legislators that are taking it more serious, of making sure that what goes on inside of
prison isn't deconstructive, but
constructive with that said, I
have a few questions about what you spoke about. None other bigger than your statutory authority for access, which is
powerful. I think the lack of
that being public is, is, is sad because I don't think a lot of people know that you have that type of authority and having that type of authority, I think in the right hands, especially organizations that work on behalf of, of people inside of
prison could use that type of information and have access to
that information. And, and would organizations that support the
conditions of, of prisoners have that have that type of access to
that information through you?
Would they have that access of information through your agency?
Who would have the access
organizations who help to protect the well-being of people inside of incarceration? So
unfortunately, no organizations
that that are are seeking to
help the incarcerated population
would not have the same access. Our unfettered access authority
is within the penal code, and it
basically directs the department of corrections to give the oig
24 over seven access to
documents, records going into
physical locations matter of fact, it's a misdemeanor for the department of corrections to not comply with our request for documents and records and
access. If there is a third party group who is trying to
gain information, we do try to help and provide information
that can be shared publicly, but
we also have to be mindful that these records aren't necessarily
ours. We have access to them, but we can't always disclose certain information. We do work
with third parties that come to
us, especially organizations and groups and family members, to
work with them, to work with the prisons public information officer, to try and get them as
much information as possible. And one question before I let it go to the next person, could I have you speak more directly into the microphone? So we capture, just like a follow up
question on that too, is so
you're saying that if a private citizen knows something that's
going on inside of prison due to
reports from the people
incarcerated, if they can, they come to you with those
complaints, and after those complaints, would they be able to have access to the
information of what you found
regarding that incident? Yes. In the first part of your question,
yes, any person, any person can come to us with information. If they have information to provide in regards to something that is occurring within the prison system, they can submit a
complaint. They can submit complaints to us anonymously. We
have an 800 number that's established by statute that people can call. We can be
reached through our website, and people can send us a contact
message through our website, or they can mail us a letter, which is also just regular through the
regular snail mail. So we are
accessible to the public. What we do with the complaints, if they are not anonymous, and if
the person provides a telephone number or email address or some other way to be contacted, we will reach out to them. If we need further information and we
will try and respond to them and provide as much information that
we can. Again, we have to keep in mind that some records and information are confidential,
but what we'll do in a typical
case, we do get those a lot when someone is unable to get ahold
of a loved one or they feel like
their loved one is in crisis and no one is helping them, we'll
try to get as much information as possible, and we will respond
to that person and let them know. This is the information that we found. This is the treatment that your loved one is
getting. And if you need more detailed information, we'll direct them to the public information officer and make sure they have a good contact
telephone number and email address for that person. And last question real quick, do
with in in your professional
experience working with cdcr,
would you consider your access and your job description and
authority? The department of adult corrections and the
department of adult parole
operations being one and the same, are two different entities, one and the same. We have the exact same access to division of
adult parole operations as we do for department of corrections. We also monitor the cases
discipline cases that come through department. Dapo, the parole operations, including
discipline cases, grievances
that come through, use of force incidents that parole agents are
involved in. We have the oversight authority over dapo as
well. Thank you. Next, we have
vice PRESIDENT Birkner. Yes. I want to say thank you again for the presentation and taking the
time to come down from
sacramento. Very thorough presentation. I think anytime I
had a question literally next slide it got answered. So I want
to thank you for that. But I do want to just hear a little bit
more from you. So as, as a body
that now has an ig just in your own kind of personal opinion for
an ig's office, that's that's just up and coming and looking at the resources that you guys have, the technology. What are some of the things you would share with us to say, these are some of the things that maybe we wish we had when we started, or
these are the things you should be looking into. I think for us, we've had a lot of robust conversations and discussions about staffing and the resources
that the ig needs to. As you
stated, show what's working. And if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that and just your thoughts, your personal
opinion. Right. So staffing is critical. You do need staffing.
I when I became the inspector general, we had approximately
116 staff members and as of this
week, we are nearing the 235 mark. So staffing is critical.
But obviously that goes hand in hand with funding. Our funding comes from the general general
fund. So but I think the
critical part for us, when we first started out, I started off with the inspector general's
office in 2007. We were still in that build mode. 2004, 2005 is when we really became the model
that we're in now. So I was there pretty much from the
ground up. And I think what we learned right off the bat is we needed to when we were looking at a case, we needed to make
sure we had our our metrics down for the case, the tools that we needed on looking at a case to
make sure we were doing the right thing, like, are we? What
is our end goal? What do we want to report on? Our statute was
helpful because we knew we wanted to report on, like sufficiency of an investigation,
adequacy of discipline. And so
what we had to do is define
those. And it took a few
iterations of our tools to actually come up with how we
wanted that definition. But that that is also critical from the
onset is, you know, you're when you're looking at an investigation, what exactly is sufficiency of an investigation?
And you have to keep in mind that they're not going to hit, you know, ten out of ten always. So is that going to be the benchmark is they have to have a
ten out of ten to be sufficient or is eight out of ten better? So those are the discussions that you really need to have to
start from the onset, so you can have your objective tools in place as you are doing investigations or monitoring discipline and assessing discipline. And that's also helpful as you go down the road. So your tool isn't always changing. So you're unable to compare last year to this year because they're not the same tool. So it's very critical to really start having those discussions and start looking at the cases and make those minor adjustments before you get, you know, five, ten years into the process, we were fortunate that
we figured out our tool within the first few years, and then since then we've been making adjustments and adjustments with
how policies change and how monitoring and how that impacts
our monitoring. So that's that is one of the things that I
recommend that we do pretty quickly right off the bat. And you need to have a good case
management tool to do that. And
whether you do something that's from off the shelf or you have something built or you just use
excel, you have to have a way to document that, to collect those numbers, collect that data, and
then be able to report it because that becomes critical.
Is being able to show show the
numbers, especially if you are in the future seeking funding from some entity. You have to be
able to show your numbers. You have to be able to show. We've looked at this many cases. This is the information we're getting
and this is what we need to be able to make that more robust.
So today we can only look at
ten. But if we could add two more staff members, we can bump that up to 40. So those are some of the important things that
that we needed back in the day. And we really looked at and that's what we did as we implemented moving forward. Thank you for that. I think it's
very consistent in terms of themes and things that we've been discussing and talking
about here as a body, how does
your office kind of work with the more, if at all, the local
municipalities or the local igs, since you all are obviously at
the state and federal level and just looking at the difference
in our ig and our relationship with the sheriff's department versus the relationship with cdcr. So how do you all work
with some of the local igs at
this level? We don't. Okay,
because we are completely 100%
state and we our sole mission is the department of corrections. If there is an intersection
between a local jail, a local
law enforcement agency, we will have communications. I know in the past, as we've monitored some cases, we've had contact
through, like the local sheriff's department, but not
necessarily with an ig office. Not we're absolutely open to
that. And I'm a big proponent of we're an inspector general's
office and we're, we're we're
we're successful. And we have tools in place that are working for us. And we're always happy to share with other igs because there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Just take take what we
have and make it work for your own agency. Is definitely my
motto. Thank you. Next we have
member wechter so yes, thank you
again for coming down here. It's very, very, very helpful. I know
your specialty is oversight of
prisons. What general advice
would you have for people who are new to conducting oversight
of county jails? What kinds of
things would an inspector
general want to look at to gauge how well that jail is operating? Where are the friction points?
Might be where the non friction
points might be. I think one of
the critical areas to look at is well first you need to make sure
that the jail system has some sort of departmental policies.
And procedures in place on how
the jail should be running. So that's the first thing to look
at. And then assessing for example, like use of force is a critical area within an incarcerated setting. Use of
force incidents are critical and
classification is critical. That
might be more so in a prison setting setting, but to make sure that the incarcerated person is in the right place,
use of force I. I keep going back to that. That is critical
to ensure that the jail system
has clear, defined rules, policies and procedures in place and that they're actually following those. And if the rules and follow policies and procedures are are not complete or inaccurate, then recommend
change, recommend change. Look
at the cases and make the recommendations for that. So that's that's definitely a key
area within I think an incarcerated setting that that
should be looked at. In addition
to access to care. But that's
also difficult because as
laypeople, sometimes it's hard to say this person needs to have
medical care when you know, when it's like, where's your medical degree? But fortunately for us, we do have doctors and lawyers who can doctors and lawyers, doctors and nurses who can do that type of an assessment. But
even just as a as an inspector general without any medical training, I think it's pretty easy to see whether or not, you know, an incarcerated person is being allowed to see a doctor or
a dentist or an optometrist as necessary, especially if they're having some type of a medical need. And those are those are
also generally a key area for the protection of the incarcerated population that I
think should be a focus. Thank
you. And I want to get a clear
sense of your relationship to the internal affairs investigation, because you said you received complaints, then
you reviewed the completed investigation. Do you touch that
investigation anywhere else in
the process or provide input
about it before it's concluded
and internal affairs reaches a finding? Right. So there's two avenues for us to be involved with internal affairs. First of
all, when the and when the complaint is generated within
the department of corrections.
So it's the local warden, the hiring authority or the local parole administrator. If they're seeing something like, hey,
there's potentially misconduct happening by this staff member.
And they sent their request for an investigation to the department of corrections. We
will review. And if it meets our criteria, such as a use of force
incident, we will monitor that
case from the onset. So it's assigned to an investigator and
there's an oig monitor assigned to that case as well. We meet with the investigator about the investigative plan. We'll talk
about interviews that will be conducted. We monitor those interviews. We get a copy of the
draft report. We review the draft report and make
recommendations. We'll get a copy of the final report, and
we'll then take that through the hiring authority discipline
process. So we're very much involved with the investigations when it comes through that
avenue. When a complaint comes
to us directly, we will do our own review. And if it's a complaint that involves staff misconduct, then we will refer that to the department of corrections for review of potential investigation. And then my intake team alerts my monitoring team that that's something that that we should consider monitoring. And then of course, it goes through the same process. Thank you. And if someone from your office visits
a prison facility and gets input
from people who are incarcerated, they're not specific complaints, nothing about specific incidents, but
just general input. How would
that be documented? So my staff will will take their notes.
they'll bring it back and they prepare a report from their visit. If it's if it's a planned
visit, they'll there'll be a report that's put together. If
it's just a staff member who's, who's on some type of routine
monitoring, for example, walking
out to a prison yard to monitor and interview. And on the way back you get contacted by an incarcerated person and they
want to tell you something. What we usually do is the staff member will document that. They'll take it back to the office, they'll discuss it as a team. Is it a systemic issue that we need to address is what
needs to happen with it?
Depending on the nature of the complaint. And then we'll reach
out to the warden and we'll discuss it with the warden and let them know, hey, we heard this is happening. Unless it's a
safety and security issue, then my staff member will directly go to the warden and have that conversation right then and there before they ever leave
prison grounds. And if it's a planned visit, how detailed would that report be? And would
that be public record? It would be pretty detailed. And yes, it
is. It is a public record. That's what my intake team does when they meet with the
incarcerated person advisory
council. And we do that. The
report is public. We do a couple, we get about 2 or 3
prisons, and we combine them, and then we try and publish them at least twice a year. We've just actually started that. So this is our first year. Yes. We're just completing our first year of doing that. It is a new program that we implemented. I'd love to take the credit, but my staff actually approached me and felt that that would be more beneficial to the incarcerated population is for us to just go out and be proactive. I was very
supportive of it, and so I think our first six month review has been is posted on our website.
And then I think we have one more prison visit this year, and then we'll do the second half of
the year and get that posted on our website as well. So is it a best practice to document those sorts of visits and the input you receive? You receive?
Absolutely, absolutely. I, I think you it is imperative that
we document every contact that
we have in some form because you
you just never know it. We're hearing it at one location and you don't know if it's happening at a second location. And if we just don't document it or don't discuss it, then we just we won't be able to identify an issue that might be systemic, and it's just not brought to the
attention of the department. And that's part of our role. So documentation is critical
discussion with within our units
is critical. And then of course sharing that information as as necessary with with the
department is also critical. And I know you mentioned vetting
wardens. Do you have any do any review or able to make any recommendations regarding background investigations or
hiring criteria just for the
general cdcr? No, we aren't a part of the general background
investigation or hiring for anyone other than for wardens.
That is within our statute, and
it's limited just to wardens. Ages ago, we used to be able to go back and do a review, almost like a performance evaluation of wardens, but they eliminated that from our statute. So at
this time we just do. We have 90 days from the date we're requested from the governor's office to do the background, the vetting of the warden, and get a final report to the governor's
office. So you don't have any input into the general criteria
for the hiring of staff? No, we
don't. Okay, okay. That's all I
have for now. Thank you so much.
Member. Mango, I thank you so
much for your presentation. Let me turn on the mic. Thank you so much for your presentation. I
just had a question. I know you mentioned your team staff is like around 200. What is the
annual budget? A little over $50
million 5050. Oh okay. We were
55 million. But we're part of the budget cuts. But yes we are. We are just so we're doing the
same work with just a little
over $50 million. Got it. Okay. And then I know you mentioned
this about like, how are you guys measuring success complaints wise? Because I
remember there was a slide that talked about the average amount
of complaints you guys received per month is like around 900.
Yes. So what we do with those
complaints is we prioritize them as priority one two and three, one obviously being the ones
that need attention immediately.
And my staff have to every day we go through the mail, the
emails and the calls and we log those and we have benchmarks
set. And so we need to respond to priority ones within five
days. Priority two is a little bit longer. And then priority three are the ones that are are not a very serious safety or
security threat. Just some assistance that an incarcerated
person needs. And so we keep
those we measure. Our success in
that area is to ensure that we're able to address the concerns in a timely fashion and get a response to the person who's reached out to us in a timely fashion. And so those are the numbers that we are kept.
And to not have a backlog of complaints. And I'm happy to say
we do not have a backlog of complaints at this time. We've I've put a lot of I've redirected a lot of resources into that intake unit so that we
can address the complaints that are coming through, because some
of them are very serious and we can't we can't have those sit around for a backlog for, you
know, 30 days or 45 days,
especially if it's someone who's in crisis. So those are some of the ways that that team, we measure our success there is that we're able to efficiently, quickly respond to these
complaints. And then, as I
understand it, complaints can run the gamut of something like, oh, I didn't like what we had for lunch today. And then something more serious. What's
the I mean, what's the I mean, I'm assuming that misconduct is
probably the biggest percentage
of the types of complaints that
you guys get. Yes, it is. Staff misconduct is the largest number of complaints that we get. We
also get complaints about rules violations or basically an
incarcerated person being being written up for something that they feel was not appropriate. That's probably our second
largest of complaints that we
get. And classification
classification and release that
I'm in the wrong prison. I'm not
at the right level or I should have been released. And they
haven't. They haven't addressed
that yet. We so those are those are our three big areas that we
get. And then grievances would
be filed something separate
because it I'm assuming the
process just takes longer to
address. Right. The grievances usually are something that happens internally at the department of corrections. So the incarcerated person can file a grievance within the department of corrections, and
then it goes through their process for review. And then assignment for investigation. So
I have an entirely separate team who monitors the complaints that
come into the what they call a central screening team. So I
have a team of, of staff that
monitor the screening of the
initial grievances. And then I have staff that monitor whether
the grievance goes to back to the prison for an investigation or to the office of internal affairs for an investigation. So
I have I have all I have eyes on all three of those areas. Got
it. Okay. And then I think just my last question, you mentioned that you have like your own health care workers that will
come in and kind of assess independently of the prisons and
like, is that counted as part of your staff or are they hired like ad hoc? No, they're also part of our staff. So our medical inspection unit that
that is also a responsibility that's set forth in the penal code for us to assess the
quality of care. And so, yes, I
have I have doctors and nurses that are on staff and analysts that will contact each prison.
And we do like a medical inspection. They'll go and
they'll do eyes on at clinics and within the prison system,
the care that's being provided
will randomly pull their medical documents and do an assessment
case review, assessments of how did they handle the situation. And that's where you need the expertise of doctors and nurses to ensure that the patient was
getting the right type of care, the and had the access to the right care and the correct follow ups were being done. But no, that is also part of my staff. Okay. And okay. Last
question. Okay. So you said what
reports end of the year? I think
you guys have like 14 reports,
14 reports annually. Or did I MISS Remember that we have many we do many reports annually. As
of right now we are at 14, 15 officially. As of today, we're
at 15 published reports. And so the grievances that we monitor
by statute that's required to publish a report once a year, use of force incidents that we monitor, we're required to publish a report of what we monitored once a year. The discipline monitoring that statute requires us to publish
twice a year. And so we just published our second report of the year for the disciplinary cases that we monitored between
JANUARY and JUNE of 2024. So we
have a number of reports we publish. We also publish an annual report every JANUARY,
FEBRUARY ish that summarizes all of the reports that we had done
in the previous year. And then we also we also report
individual cases every month. So
every month, as cases closed, we also report those. And those are all on our website. Lots of
writing, lots of writing. I have
a publications team as well. So very robust team. Yes okay.
Thank you. Thank you. Next we
have member palmer again. I
could I could talk to you all
day, but I want other people to
get a chance and I won't. And just remember ask all my questions. I want to ask all my
questions. But bph, you monitor what they do as well. Yes, we do
good. What are the number of complaints that you receive
inside that they're not letting
go of people who would be considered suitable for parole
on reasons other than the title? 15, maybe personal reasons or political reasons. Unfortunately, I do not have
that number with me today, but I'd be more than happy to get
that for you. Yeah. If you if
you were, if your team was able
to notice a pattern of conduct where people who were sentenced
in their sentences being
extended unconstitutionally,
would you guys be able to bring that up as just a suggestion that they change their behavior, or would you be able to bring
that up as a as a recommendation that something be done about it through the courts? So we
wouldn't do it through the courts? What we would do, we
actually just did an audit on
release date calculations that was just published within the
last month. So what we did is an assessment of how the department of corrections was reviewing release date calculations. Were they keeping incarcerated people
in longer than they should be?
Were they letting people out
before they had completed their
sentence? Or as required by law?
So we actually did. We did an audit and we released our
findings. We did find that we made recommendations that they had a lot of procedural errors and areas of improvement that
they could make in regards to doing those release date calculations in our sample size, we did find that they were they were able to correct their mistakes within a reasonable
amount of time. So if we were to
find issues or errors like that,
we could do a special review, or we could do an audit, or we could put together our information and make a recommendation to the department for change or for improvement. I
would like to know your opinion
on on the fact that disciplinary hearings with inside the institutions, like an rv, are a rules violation report, right?
Whether it's a 115 or a 128 that
MAY be require some type of
hearing. I know from what I've
heard from inside that they do a
video recording of the hearing,
which means that they don't have
an audio recording of the
hearing. Do you get any any
complaints that that accused
this process? Not being
sufficient enough to correct a quote unquote, kangaroo court
type of allegation, like what's
said in there can be changed. So
I can tell you, I'm not aware of
them recording the 115 hearings. The rules violation hearings,
whether it's audio or video recorded. I'm just perhaps they are. I was not aware that they were doing that. However, we do get complaints. A number of complaints from the incarcerated
population that there were some due process or violation of
their rights during that hearing process. When we do get those types of complaints, what we'll do is we will pull the records, we will review the records, and then we'll write a response to the incarcerated person with
what we did. If we are to find that there is a procedural error or some error in that rules violation hearing, we will send
that information to the department, to the prison, to
the warden, and advise them of what we found. And I can tell you, we have been pretty successful in having rules violations reissued and reheard
or dismissed in their entirety because of the due process violations or some other violation that we found. So is
that area ripe for an audit?
Perhaps. But I can tell you it
is on our list. Thank you. That
was very helpful. Thank you. Now
we have member nguyen. Thank you
for the presentation and for coming out. It sounds like you
got your hands full with all the investigations, but I want to
ask, what are the percentage of frivolous complaints you get? The ones that are clearly no
merit? The complaints you get
that are clearly, clearly no
merit to them. Maybe, you know, I didn't get an extra lunch or something like that. How do you dispose of those cases? We actually don't characterize
anything as not having merit. We
look at every complaint, regardless of what it alleges,
and address it. If we get a complaint that I wasn't given the appropriate portion of meal,
we will we will review what the appropriate portions are. We'll
see if there's anything in the person's file that indicates
there's a reason for that. And if there isn't, we will respond to the incarcerated person and advise them on what steps they can take within the department
to address that. That concern. So we don't keep any data or anything on frivolous complaints. Obviously, we will get some that are virtually
impossible. Microwave wave
lengths. Are you know, disrupting my sleep. We obviously know that that most
likely is not has merit. But
what we'll do is we'll look in that person's mental health record and we'll write a response to them of they should reach out to their mental health clinician to discuss this issue
so that at least they're getting some response. And if we feel that there's something more
going on, we will also reach out
to the chief of mental health at
the prison where the person is incarcerated to advise them of the nature of the complaint that we have. Okay. Thank you. So you would forward it to the appropriate department for investigation and then it will
go up. And if it goes back down to you, then you do further
investigation. So what we'll do is we'll ask them to tell us what they're doing and if they if we feel that it's something that's serious and they're not investigating it, we'll take that to the next level. We have
that built in within our our,
our responsibilities is we and it's built into actually department of corrections policies. So if we don't feel
that they are doing something that's appropriate, we can take
it up to the next level executives, and we can actually elevate that all the way up to the top if necessary. So it typically it's not often that
that happens that they do their best to address complaints when
they get them. Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Back to member wechter.
Yeah. Just a few follow up questions. The first one is about decertification with post.
Who who would make those referrals? Would it be the head
of cdcr or would it be the
wardens? And then I want to get a sense of do you have any review of those? Can you make any recommendations of those? Do you audit the numbers, etc? Cdcr is specifically excluded from
decertification. Thank you. Do
you look at lawsuits against
cdcr as a potential complaints
or track them, track the numbers
of settlements or judgments as
reflecting potential issues? We
do not we do not look at individual lawsuits. There are hundreds of lawsuits that get
filed against the department of
corrections. Obviously, they're bigger class action lawsuits. We
keep an eye on, such as the, you know, armstrong and plata and some of those. So they're bigger class action lawsuits that have made it through the court system
that that are really driving a
lot of the policies and procedures. Those are the ones that we focus on. But no, there are so many there are so many
lawsuits that we do not we would not have that capacity at all. Then I want to ask about training specifically, not training in general, but the type of training that potentially our board members could avail themselves to, or
the inspector general staff when
he has staff, could could avail
themselves of so we do a number
of different. We try to go to as many trainings as possible. Obviously depending on budget,
the association of inspector generals always has some really great trainings. Nicole, the national association for
civilian oversight of law enforcement, they have a number
of good trainings. We'll also,
although not necessarily we try. And with our local law enforcement agencies or things
that aren't post type trainings,
but investigations, interviewing skills, a lot of those. And then
we try and go see avail ourselves to as many of those trainings as possible, especially when we're assessing an investigator. It's good for
us to know exactly you know what? What entails a good
interview or what entails a good report, how to write a good report. Things like those. So those are the types of trainings that that we try and attend. So would those be post trainings for law enforcement that you're
referring to? Some of them, yes. Are there any others that you
can recommend? Well, I do have a team of attorneys, so they have to do all of their very specific
type of training. And then my doctors and nurses actually have
their own set of training. So we have a wide variety of training opportunities and
responsibilities that we need to
involve ourselves in. Thank you,
inspector general wiley. Thank
you. Hi, MR. Singh. Man, I'm
really this has been really
helpful and interesting listening to another ig explain
their agency. So my question is,
is of your $50 million budget,
what is what takes up the
biggest chunk of the budget
payroll? Well, I know it's payroll, but is it like investigators? Is it legal
staff? Where where does most of
the or what takes up the bulk of
where the given the structure of
your agency of your budget
doctors and lawyers. We have we
have a about 15 doctors on
staff. Okay. And we have many
lawyers on staff and lawyers from attorney one level up
through supervisors. And then my
I have four chief assistant inspector generals and they're all attorneys. So that's
probably our biggest expenses
okay. For payroll and in terms
of the investigators and I know you're covering the whole state of california, how many investigators does your agency
have? We don't have
investigative authority that our limited investigative authority
is over sexual misconduct cases.
Okay. And so the way the prea statute is written, we are we do have that ability to look into
the allegations regarding sexual
misconduct. Okay. And we actually just had signed into law sb 1069, which gave us investigation authority
specifically like spelled out regarding sexual misconduct
cases under certain circumstances. So we'll be
implementing that as of JANUARY
1st. And we are in the process of figuring out what that is
going to look like and how what type of personnel we need to
hire to be able to monitor a
greater number of sexual misconduct cases and potentially investigate sexual misconduct
cases. So then when you of like
the 900 complaints that you get,
the ig then relies on city cdcr
to conduct the investigations through their internal affairs.
Yes we do okay, okay. And then
the last question that I had, I
love your publication team. So
what is the publication team? So
the publication team is four members and a supervisor. And they're all like analyst type
positions. And we hire those people who have a specific
background in ability to write. Most of them are former
educators or current or still
current educators in the english
and literature field. Okay.
Thank you. So I guess I will do
clean up, wrap up. So in terms
of I was looking at specifically
the number of incarcerated on
average, I'm trying to look at
what our budget should be and we hover around, I think 700
sometimes close to 800. And we
wanted to start off slowly knowing that there were budget
cuts. So we were just asking for $2.5 million and hopefully, you know, having two investigators.
So I'm just trying to spread out
your personnel and your budget over the number of incarcerated. Do you have an average? I don't have that average. I can tell you that. There are over 92,000 incarcerated people in the state of california, and the
department of corrections
employees. So the employees,
nearly 60,000 people, of which 26,000 plus are law enforcement
officers. And in terms of trying
to establish uniformity and best practices, have you put that
together, assembled it into any
kind of manual so that there is uniformity throughout the state
and the institutions? No, we
have not done any type of
document like that for the department of corrections that
if I'm understanding your question, we haven't provided
them with anything. What we do is we take what they have and review it and make recommendations. For example, they have a very robust internal affairs manual that we that we
look at and so will review that
and make any recommendations
that we think are appropriate. But at least we have what they believe are their best practices. So we can we can gauge it, gauge their work based on their own manual of best
practices. Okay. Because, well, eventually we'll have a
presentation from the sheriff's office on their updated
policies. But I was just wondering if there was some kind
of other kinds of measures that you already had on your website, but it doesn't sound like you have that available, because every every institution will be
slightly different. That is
correct. What we do is if there
is a best practice that we believe they should be employing within their investigations, we will make that as a recommendation. As part of one of our monitoring reports, for example, we believe that
interviews should be audio
recorded in whichever type of interview you're doing, whether it's a local inquiry at the
prison or whether it's through the office of internal affairs, we recommend that best practices to record record these interviews. And so we make that
recommendation to them. They they do not agree with us on that. They believe the department of corrections, I
should say not they. The department of corrections does not agree with us. They will record their internal affairs interviews. However, they won't
record any of their local investigations that happen
within house at the prisons.
Okay, I think that's about it
for now. One one thing that we do have with our sheriff's
office, and I think it's unique with our jurisdiction, is that
we do have prisoner legal services. So that's something that's afforded to our
incarcerated population. So I think that offers a little bit of avenue to another avenue for
complaints or securing needs.
While incarcerated. Yep. Thanks. Thank you very much. Now I'm going to ask for public comment
on this item. At this time,
members of the public wishing to
provide public provide comments regarding line item three
presentation from amrik singh are invited to approach the podium when it becomes available. Hello everyone, my
name is joanna hernandez. I'm a
parent of an incarcerated loved
one. That was an amazing presentation and I hope that our
city and county really sees that
we need the budget to operate at
least half of the level that the
state is doing. I do want to say
that I would love to try to see
if there's a way of getting also input from people who are formerly incarcerated, because a lot of people don't come forward to share their concerns because of retaliation. As someone who has experienced that for
bringing concerns when things have happened to my own son
incarcerated and the retaliation
happening, maybe not that day, but a week later. So I think it's very imperative that we figure out ways when we're out there trying to get voices, that
we start serving people when they're in reentry plans for people who are like, back on track now and have received
services, what was it that they
could give to make their
rehabilitation better? So I really commend what your office is doing, and I really hope that as a community, we can advocate
to get at least a portion of $50 million to make something happen
here in the city of county of
san francisco. Do we have any
other public comments? No. As to
this one item, this presentation, seeing none, I'd just like to
thank MISS Singh and safe
travels. I know traffic gets bad
on a friday. Going back to sacramento. Thank you so much.
Thanks, MISS Singh, thank you. All right, so you really do seem
like the. Really perfect person
for this job. Just from a person on the other side that you do seem like the person. Perfect person, elected or appointed to
this job. Thank you. We'll let
the governor know. Thank you.
next item, please. Calling line item four. Inspector general,
report. Informational item.
Inspector general terry wiley will provide an update on the monthly operations of the office of the inspector general. This
report will encompass activities activities from the third quarter of 2020 for. His report
will also include visits to cj
two women's facility, meeting with the jail visiting committee
and the jail justice coalition, and the annual conference of
naco. All right. Thank you. You
know, I did enjoy the last
presentation because it's always
helpful to hear from another operation and particularly a statewide operation. And but I
think that one thing that that
speaks loud and clear is, you
know, in order to accomplish a lot of what they have going on is they're sufficiently funded
in order to do that. So with our
OCTOBER report, really the key
activities that we engaged in
this month were we did our our
normal meeting with the jail visiting team that's sponsored by the sheriff's department. We
also do a quarterly meeting with the jail justice committee, our
jail justice coalition
committee. We also attended the nickel conference. But I think probably the most important thing that we did this month is
we visited jail number two. And
the well, the female jail of the
county jail. And I think why I think it's important to visit
the jail. But I think one of the things that motivated us to
focus in on the women's jail was our meeting the previous month
with the latino task force, and
a lot of the statements that
were made at the at that
meeting, which highlighted the
importance of our going and
looking at jail. Number two and
the female population. But let
me start by saying the jail
visiting committee that sponsored by the sheriff's
department is actually a very
insightful meeting because it
brings in folks like MISS
Hernandez, who just spoke, is on the jail visiting committee, and
we hear from a lot of different
sectors. The staff of the jail
that that are part of. Executing
the visitation of the jail. And,
and at that meeting and I also want to highlight and thank
deputy chief quantico, you know,
all of our our meetings with
deputy chief quantico have all
been very, very positive. And,
and, and I think the spirit of every meeting that I have
participated in as the as the ig
with deputy chief quantico has
been one of really trying to be
helpful and really trying to
listen to everyone's complaints,
if there are any. And then trying to find some resolution
to those complaints. Now, one of
the things that, you know, when
we first started, there were a lot of lockdowns and all of these lockdowns were impacting
the visitation of the jails. And our recommendation one was that
that was not a sustainable
model. And before you knew it,
some of the changes that had
been made by and led by deputy
chief quantico was, was where we
are today and where we are today is that even though they're
still suffering staff shortages,
there are still some lockdowns
occurring. They have made a
definite attempt to not let it impact the visitation of the jails. So what we're finding is
that back in APRIL, if there was a lockdown, visitations were
shut down. Today, if there's a lockdown, visitations continue
and we're still allowing the jail is now allowing those those
visitations to still move
forward now. But we're not there
yet because the complaints that
we're still hearing, and I think some of these complaints were
brought out in the visitation. Visitation, the jail visitation committee meeting were that there are still families that
are having difficulty reserving
space. So, you know, you have to
go online to reserve a space to
visit. And families are still having a lot of difficulty. And
so that's where some of the staff shortages and some of the
lockdowns are still impacting
families. So although it has improved, there still needs to
be more improvement and we are going to continue to try and
work with the deputy quantico.
Deputy chief quantico and the sheriff's department in improving that, that the
visitation giving the families
greater access to visitation.
Now, the other area is we also
dealt with the jail, the jail,
just the jail justice coalition. And that's a that's a group we
meet with quarterly. And in that
meeting, you know, generally we
brought them up to speed since our last meeting, which was back
in MAY. So we kind of brought
them up to speed on some of the changes that have occurred. But one of a key member of that
committee is the chair of the
committee is also in the in the
county treasurer's department.
and so and I'll talk about it when I talk about the jail
visit. But one of the things that we're able to do with that committee is it's a great place to try and find some possible resources through the treasurer's department that
might assist with making life
easier with the jails, and which
let me just go to the county jail visit to and I'll I'll tie
that together. But we visited
county jail two and again I
cannot emphasize enough the
importance of the sheriff's
department being openly
transparent. So and when I say that is that when we went into
the women's jail, we received
full access to the inmates. We
were. And I also want to thank
committee member caron, who was
present during that jail visit and also had a lot of
interaction with the female
inmates. But we had a lot of interaction with the inmates. And I can tell you there's some interesting things that
happened. One, the complaints about the deputies were they
were too nice. And we were surprised that that was the
complaint that the deputies were
too nice and that there were
some deputies that were very methodical in the way they treat the inmates. You know, you know what to expect from them every
day. It MAY not be a smile, but
there, there, there conduct with
the inmates is consistent. And
then you have deputies that are
very nice and they speak to them
in a nice manner. And, and there
was a complaint that it throws
them off. So we were like, okay, I didn't expect to hear that.
They were too nice. But that was one of the complaints. But
another complaint was. Because
the women's the number of women that are incarcerated in san
francisco is now down to only 60
women. And as a result, there is only one pod for the women. And
so the problem that that
creates, whereas in the past there was typically more women
incarcerated than 60. So the
jail had two pods for the women
and one pod was, I think the pod where people who MAY have had
mental issues, medical issues, and the people that were in
general population were was the
pod where there was a lot
programing going on and, and
people were really I think the major thing was there was a lot of programing going on in that pod. Well, now since we're down to 60 and everybody is combined,
you now have generally per week,
maybe three, four women that are
detoxing and they're being
housed with the general
population. And when they're
detoxing it becomes the complaint was it becomes a major problem at nighttime because
there are I guess they have a hard time sleeping because of
their going through the detox,
but it impacts the sleep of a
lot of the inmates in general
population. So there was a
complaint about that, and I
would say probably the major
complaint was the fact that and
I don't know if it's a result of
since covid, but there is a real
lack of programing going on now.
Although the inmates have their
tablets and they're able to do some programing on the tablets,
I think that there was a request
by the inmates to have greater
access to having a group
sessions where they can talk
about their problems and, and there's also a complaint that
they now don't they don't have access to five keys. And so
there's, you know, some who MAY
be interested in doing a ged
program or, or going beyond a
ged program or not having access
to that kind of programing. So I
think that that is an issue that
that I think is there needs to
be a discussion on how to
improve the programing. There's
also there was also a complaint
about the cleanliness of some. Parts of the jail. And I think that because there's a they're being forced to be housed with
some of the women that are
detoxing. I think there were complaints about the condition that the showers were being left in, and that although the sheriff's department was
providing someone to clean
things up, there was some real
there was some dissatisfaction
with the manner in which, like
the showers were cleaned up. So
these are all areas that that we need to have some further discussions with the sheriff.
But now the other thing and why
I brought up the jail coalition committee is and the fact that they've got a member of the treasury on the committee is
that there was a big complaint
by a lot of women was not having
the ability to shave. And so
although they have a they have
clippers and, and an electric shaver, there was a complaint
about that. And so we are going
to at some point be talking to
the jail coalition committee to
see if we cannot find some funding somewhere to provide the
women with the, the, the non the
shavers that are there extra
safe shavers to provide to them
and because I, you know, I can tell you that that was you know woman to woman that was a
complaint by everybody that they
do not have you know some of the oh they complained about
deodorant also deodorant and
shavers was a was a complaint.
We also took a tour of the
kitchen and we also looked at
the food that the women are
receiving and the big complaints
about the food was during the
week. They all five meals.
Breakfast is they're all cold
meals, lunch, they're all cold meals. And then they get a hot
meal at dinner. But they are
receiving hot meals for breakfast on saturday and sunday
and hot meals for dinner on saturday and sunday. So one of the complaints was they like they like more hot meals at
breakfast. But when we looked at
the cleanliness of the jail, very impressed with the cleanliness of the jail kitchen,
very impressed with the women
that were doing the cooking and
preparing of the meals. And they
prepare about 13,000 meals a
week. So there's a lot of work
that they're doing. And the beautiful thing about the women that are working in the kitchen
is that the skills that they're
developing in the kitchen are
skills that transfer outside.
Once they finally leave the jail
that they can use in terms of
helping them, helping them get
work. So I would say the biggest, the biggest complaint, just to summarize the biggest
complaint was there was a
complaint about, you know, cleanliness and hygiene and, you
know, they'd like to see some
improvement in that area. And I
think that everywhere you go, there's going to be a complaint
about some of the food and I
think part of it is, is not so
much the quality of the food, but just the, the repetition of
the food. And it's the same food
all the time. Yeah. But I so I definitely think that there are
some areas that we're planning on following up. And also
because we've gotten the same
complaint from the men, we are
contemplating putting together a
committee. To research and see
if there aren't some options,
some fresh food options, so that
when the county's next contract
comes up, which I probably we're about ten months out from the next contract being negotiated
for the food that we might not be able to provide the county
with some fresh food options
that they might want to also
consider because I do think that
adding more fresh food to their diet would make a big difference
in the way they feel about the
food. We also attended the naco
conference between OCTOBER 13th
and the 17th. It was a great
conference. There were a lot of
very helpful courses that we
attended and but I think the big
positive of the naco conference
was just getting an opportunity
to meet oversight professionals
from all over the country, and really talking to them about,
you know, what our challenges
are, what their challenges are,
and some of the things that are going real well with their
operations and so it was it was great. It was very, very great
conference and met a lot of good
people. And we had a really it
was it was a good time. So that
is our report for OCTOBER. And
as I say, I, I'm very I'm really
happy that we went to visit the
women's jail because I think
that. I am moved by the fact
that, that in doing our
assessments of both the men and the women's jail, I'm not
hearing about any I'm not hearing a lot of complaints
about mistreatment and I'm, you
know, I've only heard so far
about people being treated in a very professional manner. And like I said, on the women's side, the complaint was that
they're too nice. So, you know, overall, I think that there can be some improvement. But I also
think that if we can get some
improved programing and a couple
of other little areas, you know,
I think it will be a really
positively operating jail on the
women's side. Thank you. Now it's time for questions and
comments from members. Member
wechter. Yes, thank you very much. I know we're going to hear
a report from dpa later, but in light of what inspector general
singh said about monitoring the internal affairs investigations,
I want to get a sense about what your relationship is now to the investigations that dpa is doing of sheriff's department complaints. In other words, at
what point are you seeing them, touching them? Do you have any advising role? Do you have any input into the findings. Just want to get a clear sense of
that. We meet once a week, so we meet with the head of the sheriff's department's internal
affairs, and it's normally
myself, marshal keene, sheriff's
legal and they're internal
affairs and one of our main, our main investigator. And we
discuss the cases where. So for
example, the we MAY have cases
where we're trying to get information on the case. And so
we'll let them know like, hey, in this particular case we're looking for this particular
information. And so we really try to tie down what information
that our investigators need to complete their investigations.
And if there are any questions that we MAY have about a particular case or even
questions they MAY have about a particular case, but we do that on a weekly basis. And what
about the investigation that dpa
is conducting independently?
What role do you, if any, do you play in that in terms of
observing interviews, reviewing any of the investigation before? It's completed, reviewing the
reports, approving the reports, input into the findings? That's what I'm trying to get at. Yeah.
The dpa and the inspector general are two separate agencies. So we're only concerned with our inspector
general report cases and reports. Okay. So currently you
do not have any input or role in
the investigations that dpa does of complaints against sheriff's department personnel. Is that
correct? Wait, can you repeat
the complaints from the
department of police? No, no. No complaints that go to the department of police accountability per their letter of agreement with the sheriff's department? Those
investigations, when I'm clarifying, is if you have any role, do you review those investigations? Do you have input on them? Do you observe anything? Do you have any
connection whatsoever with those investigations? The cases that are sheriff's departments cases?
Yes. Every one of them. I'm
sorry, not the sheriff's
department. Dpa okay, the dpa
investigations, well, the
investigators, we are assigned
two investigators that are technically dpa investigators,
but they are conducting all of the sheriff's department's
investigations and those
investigators conduct the sheriff's department
investigations only they don't conduct any dpa investigations. Only the sheriff's department's
investigations, despite the fact that they are technically dpa
employees. So I maybe I'm not
saying it properly. So what role do you have with the
investigations conducted by those two dpa employees regarding sheriff's department
cases? What do you mean what we oversee those cases. Well, do
you in terms of oversee, do you review the investigations? Do
you review any part of the
process? Do you observe any of the interviews? Do you review
the report? Do you have any input into the findings that dpa
makes me personally, no. We
marshal kind, who is sort of assigned to the sheriff's
department, monitors those cases
with that are done by the two
dpa employees that conduct the investigations for the sheriff's department. And then on a weekly
basis, we meet with the
sheriff's department, internal affairs, and go through those
cases and if there are any
issues with those cases, but
yeah, so until we get our own investigators, you know, those
investigations are being done by
dpa employees that are technically handling the sheriff's department's
investigations. Okay. And those investigations are being reviewed and approved by dpa
personnel. Is that correct? Yes.
That's per the agreement. Okay, then I know you've talked a lot
about the visits to the jail when you meet with incarcerated
people in the jail, do you meet with them in a private room, or do you meet with them in the pod
where deputies are present? So and I'll just explain. I'll,
I'll describe what happened last
hour. Well, earlier this week we
generally bring all of the women
out in the pod except for those
who MAY be housed separately
upstairs. And we talk to them as
a group. And we just asked generally, how is it going? And
you will get a lot of we get a
lot of feedback. And then I have we have an investigator there
who has taken down all the complaints and everything that's
being said. Then we will if there are individuals who want
to have a more private
discussion, we will separate and have a more private discussion with them. So like what happened
in this at this last visit, most of the discussions were with the
women out just everybody in the
pod explaining, you know, what their issues were. And then we went upstairs because there were
a couple of ladies who wanted to speak to us in a more private setting. So we had a more private sit down with them to
discuss their issues. Thank you. what I'm trying to clarify is if any of these discussions, the discussion with the larger group, the discussion with the smaller group take place in
rooms where there are no deputies present, where there's privacy, where people could talk
without any potential concern of deputies overhearing what they're saying. Right. No, not
at all. No. And why is that?
Well, first of all, we feel
that, you know, the there there is no interference whatsoever by
any of the deputies. None. And
in fact, the deputies step way
to the side and we really don't even see the deputies while we're having our discussions
with the inmates. And so far on both the men's side and the women's side, we have not had
one discussion where we've gotten the sense that they're not telling us something because
they're afraid of retaliation
or, or anything like that. We
just haven't gotten that sense. When member palmer and I went to county jail at san bruno last
year and met with inmates, we met with them in several pods.
But we always met in a private room with the door closed, and I think we had 15 or 20
individuals at a time who I think spoke very candidly in a way they might not have spoken had there been a deputy present.
And so why not make use of those
rooms where people could feel freer to speak? That's something
we'll we'll look into. But at at
this point, I have not seen
anything that has given me the
impression that the inmates are
not being, that the inmates feel
that they can't be fully
transparent with us. And how are
the concerns or things said at
these meetings? How are they
documented our investigator is documenting them, and how does
the investigator document them? He writes them down on a piece
of paper. Okay. Is there a written report prepared? No, we
can't repair. Prepare a report
of that. And I, I did take that that that's not a bad idea to do
a full report on what's being
reported to us. But the manner in which we've been handling
things up to this point is that
we've been taking down those complaints, and then we report
out to this board the complaints
that we received. And we're also addressing those complaints with
the sheriff's department. And
what we have noticed up to this
point is we've seen action from
the sheriff's department. We
have not seen inaction. We've seen action by the sheriff's department addressing the
concerns that have been raised.
So in terms of I mean, I
understand your point, but I think one of the points you're
trying to make is you think that somehow because we're not
meeting with them in a private setting, that we're not getting
all of the information. And I disagree with that. There's
nothing that there's no indications that I have received
that. Like, we haven't had any
follow ups from inmates who are
now who call us after the meeting saying, hey, I got to talk to you about something that I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about in fact,
with the men in the open dorm
after our visit, they were
clapping and applause because they were very, very happy about
our being there and discussing
their issues. And then and then
in that particular meeting, we noticed that there was one inmate who was who was getting
very emotional during the
discussions. And so I then had
one of our investigator, I said, hey, I told our investigator,
hey, after we're done, pull him
to the side and go talk to him and get to the bottom of why he
was being so emotional. And we did that because you can pick up if there's somebody that you
know, you MAY they MAY signal that there's something that they want to talk about. And we pick
up on that. And, and if we feel
that it's necessary to pull an
inmate and have a more private discussion, then we'll do that.
And just like we visited the
women, there were two women that wanted to have a more private discussion. And we had those private discussions. And as inspector general singh
mentioned, they document and
publish their recommendations and the implementation of those. Are you documenting the
recommendations you make to the sheriff's department? And you say the sheriff's department is acting on those? Is that being documented anywhere? Yeah, I can tell you every recommendation
right now that of a complaint that we've received from the inmates since I've been the inspector general since JANUARY,
that we've received from the inmates, brought it up with the sheriff's department, and the sheriff's department has
responded. But is it put in writing anywhere? No, but we
can't do that. So this is my
concern. When and if you leave this position, I think you're going to leave because you have not said you're going to stay. And if I were you, I'd take the judgeship or perhaps some other office that MAY come open. How is your successor going to have all the detailed information
about what you've done? I don't disagree that we can document
and we can we can prepare a report. In fact, we are going to prepare an end of the year
report and it will document
everything that has gone on over the course of a year. I just want to weigh in because I do think it's important, the spirit of what you're talking about, about like meeting with the incarcerated clients in a more
private setting. We can definitely take that into consideration for future. We
just started right. This is the first visit. We're also fighting
for budget. He doesn't have staff just yet. So this is I think it's an important concern
to raise. And we can consider it
for future. And I agree with you
in that because I'm not arguing
with you. I do think that we
should be documenting this, but,
you know, we have a staff of one
administrative assistant and me
that that is funded by the office of the inspector general.
And I wasn't going to ask the inspector general of california if she was the one who was actually having to visit the jail herself. And was she the
one who was having the right to reports herself? And was she the one who was having to conduct
her own investigations? Because
I know that that's not the case.
So, you know, I think that based
on the lack of resources that
we've received, that the city
and county of san francisco have
received a in my opinion, a
tremendous performance by the office of the inspector general, given the lack of resources
before you begin these visits to
the jail, did you talk to anyone else in oversight who does
oversight of jails about their practice, or about the best
practice? From when you go to a jail and meet with people? No,
but I also didn't come into this job without 33 years of
experience as a prosecutor. So I
also want to just interject
because I went to some of the
visits and I did review the notes that you wrote up. Member wechter and member palmer did
not have an opportunity to review those, and that's why I
didn't think it was appropriate
to make them public. But the complaints about the lack of
clean blankets, the skin issues, those were taken care of immediately after inspector
general wiley's visit. And chief
joo was with us as well. And it turned out that the washing machines were actually broken, but it was taken care of immediately and to the
satisfaction of those
incarcerated. As inspector
general wisely pointed out, we have not had repeated complaints
about the same issues. And so I
was actually quite surprised
being at three in the two pods. One of them was the psych pod,
as well as the general
population. All of those incarcerated looked healthy and were actually, surprisingly to
me, seemed content. So I remember sandy, one of the staff
members, a very petite asian
woman and the and she headed the
psych ward and the services, and
she got an applause in the next
pod, the deputy received an
applause as we left, and I did notice the particular gentleman
who was very emotional and had
an issue and the investigator did take him aside. I don't
think it was even in earshot of
any deputy. So he was free to
speak freely and at the time we
also had a deputy who was spanish speaking. So he served
as an interpreter to one of the
incarcerated who preferred to
speak in spanish. So I think we need we need staff. I'm surprised that I'm doing so much
report writing, and I think
member for actually making things more readable to the
public, but also suggesting that the inspector general have a newsletter. So at this point I am satisfied at least there's a newsletter, because rather than
repeating things that are in this meeting and documentation is important, but those
newsletters are the conduit for
public input and increased public input. So I think and I
thank the latino task force because this really started in FEBRUARY when I asked cedric
akbar to be here. And the latino task force also came. So this is an initiation of continued
public input that we need, that
we rely upon to know that we're
doing our job. So well. I want
to see more documentation. I
think it will happen. But in in terms for now, we do have those
newsletters. So we do know what
has been happening. But for the department of police
accountability, we do have those investigators actually making
written reports as well. Yeah I
just want to follow up. I don't disagree with jason's call out about having a paper trail of
just documentation with the jail visits. We can definitely have
that. And then for future visits, I'm looking specifically the latino task force. We're
going to make sure that we have like a more private room, that
where we can, you know, have that one on one with the
clients. Because I do think it's important that they feel like
they can speak freely. So I and I'd like to push I'd like to push harder. We haven't had a report from health and I've been pushing hard on that, especially
for women who are incarcerated, who are pregnant, because we do
have to talk about nutrition. We
do have to talk about access to maternal health. And in the
past, the commission on the status of women and department on the status of women had had input from incarcerated women.
And so that's another issue that
we, I think, need to do more in
the future to actually have more
collaborative work with other commissions. So in particular, the health commission, as well as the commission on the status
of women. So I've looked at the
newsletters, they do not contain specific information that you
got at the jail, said you made a visit to the jail, met with people incarcerated there who expressed concerns, but it
doesn't include what any of
those concerns were. So I don't think everything is in the newsletter. So I think there
should be written reports. I
think there should be public and transparent, just as inspector
general singh said. And, you
know, this is a best practice that anyone in oversight could
have, you know, told you about
last, what I hope is my last question, can you commit to staying in your job as inspector general? That's not on today's agenda. Excuse me? That's not on today's agenda. Well, I'm. I
think it's very relevant to this
board and to the public. I think it's on today's agenda. So you're not going to answer. And he doesn't have to. It's an inappropriate question. I, I
think it's relevant. I think the press would think it's relevant. And I think the public would think it's relevant. I think that you have multiple. Well, you know what? I'm just going to leave it there. That's not on today's agenda. I think that's an inappropriate question. So I'm going to move on to member palmer. Thank you. Mike is on
okay. I do want to also support
private interviews. And one of the reasons why I supported private interviews is because if
everybody is given a private
interview, no one can observe
someone asking for one. And when you ask for one, that means you want to say something that they don't want the deputies to hear. So I think there should be a call for private interviews, and there should be a call for if you just want group discussion. So you have option of being in a group discussion, because it's
probably, like you said, could we clean up the bathrooms a little bit better? Can we have a
hot meal? Those aren't big, big deals. You can say that. And it's probably been said, but if
you have any type of abuse going
on, if you have any type of real serious matters going on, I think those people will want a private interview without it being known that they're asking for a private interview. I also support audio recording that could be reviewed by the board, and I think member wechter
brought it up where we should be
able to hear the context of the
report if we chose to. I believe you did a good job, and I believe you will do a good job as long as you're in the office. And so I'm not really concerned about that at this point. I understand your lack of staffing. So instead of having somebody write down word for word what somebody said, they could easily make a recording and then go back and put that through chatgpt and write a report within minutes instead of handwriting something on the spot where they MAY not get everything down. So I do support
audio recordings that stay in your possession and make sure anything that's not legally
needed to come out stays secure.
The idea that the complaint, a
complaint from some of the residents inside of the jail,
was nice. Like the office, the
deputies were nice, I think. I
think that's good. I have
personally seen a change in
attitude with the culture of the
deputies inside of the jails and so I wouldn't use that as a complaint, but as an acknowledgment that some things have changed for the better. And
I'm sure we can still grow and
get better. I think there should be even an idea of coed housing for trustees, and if you don't know what a trustee is, it's somebody who's been selected from the population and put some amount of trust in that will take care of things. And where the deputies doesn't have to worry about them trying to escape or pass illegal contraband and things like that. So that's that's what the word trustee comes from and why they are selected. So you can have
housing where men and women are housed a little bit better
according to their needs. So that housing wouldn't be an issue as you were describing
women. So many number of them, and not being able to have a pod that isn't being disturbed by people who are going through a traumatic situation as detoxing
or a mental breakdowns. Again,
trustees keep the jail clean and a part of the trustees that
volunteer to keep the jail clean
and running. They do a lot of the manual work, a lot of the tasks that the deputies would not want to do on a daily basis, yet they don't get paid. So in
that, in that regard, they're
saving the sheriff's office budget. If you don't have to pay
these people to do work that you would have to pay a deputy to do at an extraordinary amount of
money, then that saves a lot on the budget. But I also think in
today's time when we're getting ready to vote on proposition six, to end slavery in california once and for all, unfortunately, we have a history of slavery up to this day, so slavery never ended. If that's the case, that we would still pay these trustees some type of
stipend or some type of wage so that they won't be considered a
trustee slaves. And as far as religious and special diet food
requests, did you ever I didn't
hear a really a reporting a reporting on that. Did you check
with the residents and also the staff that are responsible for
religious and special diets? My concern with that, if you can,
the next time, if you didn't
this time is speed up the process in which that process is done. Sometimes that could take two weeks a month. It could just be thrown under the rug. And sometimes people have gone through their whole entire jail process without getting that special diet or religious diet.
So the request process should be done a little bit faster. And the food should be in accordance to the special or religious diet, and not just removing
items that qualifies it from the tray that a regular resident
gets. You could speak on the
yeah, we did and they are provided with special meals
because you have some inmates that are diabetic and so they
have to have a special diet for
diabetics. We did have some I
don't recall there being more
than 1 or 2 that had a religious
diet. Most of the, the, the
dietary requirement where there
were special diets required. It
was generally for a medical
reason. And the most prominent
one was that there were a number
that had required a that were
diabetic and required a special
menu. And there were no
complaints about, well, I take
that back because early on there
were some complaints that the
some of the male inmates that
were receiving special diets,
they were dissatisfied with the special diets that they were
receiving. Yeah. So there there wasn't 100% satisfaction with
the special diets. Okay. So I was I would just suggest that
your office looks into communication with the sheriffs
to saying that in the intake of the person coming in, you ask them 1,000,001 questions. One of them should be, what's your
special diet? Is are what your religious diet is, and it should
be kept on their file so that if they do ever come back again, which some people do for different reasons, some good and some bad, I do think they do that already, but I'll confirm.
Well, from my experience they don't. But and the fresh fruits
and veggies. I think that was a good suggestion on. I think it was you that made that
statement. That is a that is a
diet that is actually created for human beings, even though we've come accustomed to eating a lot of actually like you to be on that, on that committee, I
appreciate that. And then programs for programing inside
the jails, I think, is very important that we resume at
least at normal weight or close to what we had before covid
programing inside of jails are
vital to the mental health and
emotional health and community support health of everybody in there. When you have somebody
locked in a confined space and they have no interaction with the outside community, it is
detrimental to their mental status. I think that should be a priority. I don't think that's something that you can just cut out of the budget because you feel like it, or it's low priority. I think that is something that should be
required by jail rights like jail, you know, resident rights.
It should be under a code of rights that they receive that type of treatment. And on a
regular basis, and can't just be
taken out at at a whim or they don't have enough staff like it
should be a danger to the to the
operations of the jail, not to have those programing fix and fixing the visiting appointment
scheduling. It should be priority two. It's I've heard
that it is going to be worked on.
I am a part of the sheriff's justice jail coalition. The san francisco jail justice coalition. So we have brought that up a number of times, and I have heard that it's going to be fixed, but I hope that you keep that on your radar because, oh, yeah, it's imperative that that visiting room be fully functional. I wish it was 24 over seven that people can get
their visits and get it at a
regular at a regular, at a
regularity. And I will say not to interrupt, but I would say that we not only heard the
complaint during our jail
justice coalition meetings, but
we also heard it directly from many of the female inmates.
That's good. And so if the if the sheriff's office wants to
get on something, you know, make sure that they're fixed so that we don't have multiple complaints back to back. I think those are the vital ones is the food and it's the visiting and the organizations coming in
helping them with programing.
Thank you. Member palmer. Next
we have member mango. Yeah. No,
I'm just agreeing with palmers about the visitation and the
programs being prioritized.
Thank you. Member nguyen. For
all the work you're doing, I
hear you. Thank you for all work
you're doing. Inspector general
wiley, regarding the fresh food
items, the deputies also get
food from the same vendor. The
inmates do as well. And since you're already looking into that, maybe you could look into
the fresh food options for the deputies as well. Please, I will
thank you. I will because we they when we took the tour of
the men's jail, they took us
into the deputies. Your break
room and showed us your meals
in. I don't know if that was a refrigerator or where it was, but it was from the same vendor.
And so if it comes from the same
vendor, is it the exact same
food? It's not the exact same food. Well, that has to be stated. I mean, when you say it comes from the same vendor, that
gives the impression that you're eating the same slop, I mean, the same food that they're eating, it's not the exact same food, but it should be. It's not
good either. There's room for
improvement. Okay. Yeah, there's from what I saw, there's room for improvement. So one thing
that I wanted to bring up and this was successful in the bay
view and we did not adjourn in
memory of the late ted fang, but he started the community garden
in the bay view where there's food desert. So that's known as the florence fang community
garden. So I'm hoping that at ke three we could start up the gardening process again, because that's an important skill. It also allows those incarcerated
to get some outdoor time, but to
be able to grow some fresh fruits and vegetables. And on
that, before you speak on that, there is an organization that's very well trusted from cdcr
called insight gardening. They can help with that. They can be part of the supervision. And
again, those could be the trusty residents of the jail that can
come out and get those also skills. There are soft skills
that you can take off into, take back into the community with you and get jobs with. So the fang garden was recently recognized by the federal government as something very positive for
communities, and I believe that that that entitles it to some
kind of federal support. So I'm hoping that that's transferable
to our ke three and being able
to farm on that land. So what we were planning to do is in the
first of the year is putting a
committee together and, and, you
know, meet every month and figure out who some of the
vendors are and see if we can find some legitimate options so
that when the next contract
comes up, we have some legitimate vendors that can
compete and provide some fresh
food options. So I'm not going to create a committee because that requires notice. And
everything else. So I, I will
let this is the ig. Yes. So I will let you get some
information from the relevant
board members. How's that. Yes.
Any further comments? Do we have public comment on this agenda item at this time, members of
the public wishing to provide public comments regarding line item four, inspector general report, are invited to approach the podium when it becomes
available. Hello folks. Good to
see you guys. How's it going? I was actually going to ask the
same thing about if you get to interview them in private or in
public. Yeah. So in my experience, I mean, even myself,
I've had some form of
retaliation. So I know that it's
in the back of their mind. Right. And I'm not their inmate. And again, we're speaking broadly as an institution, not like at the individual level.
Right. I mean, just today, you know, and again, part of getting
to the truth is building trust,
right? And if you meet them for the first time, they don't know if they can trust you, right? They don't understand might they might not necessarily understand what it is you do. Right. So sometimes it takes a little bit of time. Yeah. But I wouldn't take those interactions at face value completely. Right. Yeah.
So you know and it's funny because we talked today and I let him know I was going to come
here. And a few of them, you know, we got into discussions
and like I said opened up and let me know some things right.
Nothing to, you know, that I'll disclose here. But one of the things that they want to bring
up was how the lockdowns are
affecting their programing, how the lockdowns are because
they're still going on. Right. Not just that, but on the
lockdown, them not having access
to the shower is very detrimental to their mental
health. Physical. You want to
and having to spend part of the day on their bed was. Oh for sure. Complaints that I got and
in that small space like that's
that's hard right? Again, there's a lot of medical issues
that come up with these not being able to shower. They say
you know, if you don't want, you
know, a black toenail don't come to jail. That's what they say, right? Because it's so common they get abscesses on their skin. Staph infection. It's like
a real problem right? On top of
that, like we go through learned helplessness a lot in that class. You know, some of the classes that I teach and it just again, speaks to that. It's just that they're demotivated. You know, it's really hard to make
progress. And we can't really get a breakthrough because all these barriers that are over them. So if that's something we could look into at the very
least. And as far as on health, to be honest, you know, again, I work one on one. I'm a service provider with these folks end up
having high blood sugar or blood sugar issues, blood pressure
issues, severely deficient in vitamin d that affects their
sleep, that affects their
health, sleep apnea for whatever reason, they get in jail and
their sleep apnea gets worse. So
again, I'd want to really give another perspective, right?
They're not I wouldn't say that they're healthy in there, and I wouldn't say anybody should be housed in there. Sorry to going
to bed on a tangent. I think I
had one more hold on. We have to
do our meeting. We do. We definitely do. Yeah. Yeah, I
would love that. So which was
actually a last since you said that you took the words out of
my mouth. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I will follow up with you
next week for sure. Absolutely. We'll get something on the calendar. Definitely. Thank you. And committee member palmer, thank you so much too for your advocacy always. And what you
said here as well resonated a
lot. So thank you all. Have a good one. Thank you. And before
you got back MR. Well I'm sorry,
wilcher, how do you pronounce
your last name? Wechter. Wechter. Sorry. I just wanted to thank you for your questions earlier
as well. Okay. Thank you guys.
Hello. Joanna hernandez, before my three minutes starts, I do
want to say as today marks the first day of day of the dead,
and I would like to take a moment to a brief silence to honor those who have passed away in custody, those who have lost
their lives due to violence and to the fallen officers. MAY we warmly celebrate and remember their lives as today is the
first day of day of the dead.
Thank you. When someone is incarcerated and their parent
child visits are taken away, children are often the ones ending up paying the
consequences. We are. If we are serious about breaking the cycles of incarceration,
shouldn't this be a concern for
all of us with limited cognitive behavior programs available
inside county jail? Three how
can we help create effective
solutions? Could the oversight consider please reviewing these
types of programs offer possibly even observing the programs that are even offered, the ones
offered before 11 A.M. True.
True. Public safety involves having a complete understanding
of what's happening on the ground. Just getting a piece of paper saying we have programs happening, and then actually sitting in there, you won't
understand it. I also recommend maybe interviewing program staff and organizations who receive
city funding to serve people who are incarcerated with the
mystery or not having access. We can understand where our public dollars are being wasted if they don't have the access to do the
actual work. Also, I recommend that this body read the land acknowledgment. It should be
read before this meeting starts every first friday of the month.
As a respect to those who were
here before us. Thank you. Hello
everyone! I'm a little nervous. This is the first time I've ever
done this, but I know if I don't come up here and get this off my chest, no moves will ever be made. Let me start by saying my name is tatiana hernandez. I'm
the coordinator of the barber pathway program with bay area
community resources. I wanted to
share that several organizations, including bay area community resources, latino task force, and san francisco pretrial, and
bay area student barber expo five keys and programing, and the academy barber college have collaborated to start a braiding
project, a 15 week course in san francisco county jail, where we go in every monday. The goal of
the mission is freedom. Braiders is about transformation, transforming lives. We're
dedicated to empowering individuals, one braid at a time through the art of braiding, we foster healing, build confidence, and create meaningful connections. Our
mission is to provide a safe and
supportive space where creativity flourish and lives
are transformed. Healing people,
healing, helping people reclaim their freedom and embrace their
inner strength. When having true partnerships and collaborative
collaboratives, we can make an impact in public safety. With
that being said, we need more programs in the jails and we need to be more honest in your
program was the first thing that
was mentioned when we got there was the braiding program. I
think it needs to be in all county jails. I think it needs
more support. The men and women are behind four walls every day,
so the time they get to be in
the classroom is all they get.
And working in the jails. This is my first time ever being in the jails. That's my mom, joanna hernandez. If you didn't know by the last name, first time
working in the jails, I feel
like I actually get to see and interact with the women and just seeing that little, that little
hour, they get to be out it.
It's inspiring. So I feel like
we need to push more programs. They just don't need braiding. They need more other programs.
Right. But programs in all county jails need to be more of
a push. Yeah. But yeah. Thank
you. Thank you. Hi. My name is
agnieszka lopez. I live in
canada. I'm here to ask you a
quick questions. I'm here to
visit my cousin. And I know
we're not allowed to visit my cousin, but I want to know how
to fix you guys. Fix it. This is my first time here to ask you that question. So when she means by that is, she has not been able to schedule a visit because when she logs on, all the visits are taken. And so she's here
from canada to do a special visit for her cousin who is
incarcerated. But every time she gets a visit, they're all taken. So we could actually handle that through prisoner legal services. They do make special
arrangements, particularly for family members who come from
very far away. So, inspector general wiley, could I ask you to coordinate with that? Take
care of that. Yeah, but I'm his cousin anyway, so that's the
problem. Can you guys fix that? Are you. How long are you going
to be here? I'm here for 13
days. Okay. And oscar lopez, you
know joanna? Yes. She's my aunt.
Okay, so. Okay, just stay till our meeting is over, and we'll. We'll take care of it. Coordinate with prisoner legal services. Okay. Thank you very
much. That's what's up. I like
it, I like I like that that our board could like, facilitate things in the moment and not have to, like, write a piece of paper and ask for permission and get red tape removed. Like,
that's what I think we are. Relationships are about and that's and hopefully we can fill up some more seats every first
friday so they can come in and ask us for some immediate
relief. Yeah. And I just wanted
to say thank you, especially to these folks that come every
meeting because and you sit
through our very long meetings
just to, you know, have a chance and opportunity to, to talk to
us. So I appreciate you guys showing up. And I do want to
also add on this subject that
we're on. It is very important
that we increase the one on one
interaction with the community that goes inside the jail and
just sits with somebody, one on
one and say, how can I help you get through this process? How can I help you emotionally,
mentally, spiritually, and even if there's financial hardships,
like if you're a breadwinner who's immediately taken off the
streets in order to go through
your process, that's a lack of resources that's coming into
that house. And so it is a financial burden. And you are
stressed out as a parent or as a home, as a provider of this home of parents, that of your own
parents. It could be that how do I help keep this going? Even
though I made a bad decision, or maybe not a bad decision that led me in this situation. So it's imperative that these organizations have access, and that is the priority that the
sheriff's office should have. Any further comment from my
fellow board members? Seeing
none. Dan, MAY we have the next agenda item calling line item five department of police
accountability presentation
informational item. Marshal keene, chief attorney for the department of police accountability, will provide an overview of sheriff's office investigations conducted by dpa
for the third quarter of 2024.
Good afternoon, board members. PRESIDENT Hsu, vice PRESIDENT Brueckner, hope you all had a
nice halloween by now. I'm sure all of you are very familiar
with our reports. The format has
been consistent from quarter to quarter this year, hopefully making it easier for you to
navigate. How to view and
analyze our data. Just a quick
qualification. Again, for those who MAY not have tuned in for our prior presentations, the dpa performs investigations of
complaints against sheriff deputies for a very limited
class for a number of limited classes of serious offenses that
are defined by our letter of agreement. The data that we've
compiled today comes from the new case management system that we put online earlier this year,
built on a salesforce platform for the office of the inspector
general, and that data migration
from the previous years occurred sometime mid-year this year. So we had a successful data migration of all the data, which gives us the benefit of reviewing the quarter three
statistics from a multi-year perspective. Again, following
the format that we've used
before. I'll go over some of the
short highlights of how the dpa has assisted the office of the inspector general this
particular quarter, and going to just some of our ongoing and
future projects just to keep
this board updated. So the cases
open this particular quarter, these are the number of complaints that we receive. We receive them through a number of different ways. Referrals from
other departments, most commonly from the sheriff's office,
internal affairs unit, but we also receive them through other
channels as well, through our online portal, we receive
in-person complaints and
telephonic complaints year over
year. As we look at from 2022,
2023 and 2024, we kind of see a consistent increase. It's hard
to identify the reasons behind
particular trends, but most
certainly I think the attention that the inspector general's
office has drawn, as well as the jail visits, the informational
pamphlets that we've created and distributed in jails, and all of
the work of this board has drawn more attention to the work that we do. And the investigations
have certainly gone up in terms of the referrals and new complaints that we received quarter two and quarter three
consistent this year. And as we've also seen in prior years, the latter quarters tend to have a greater number of complaints, at least from a three year
perspective. Similarly, we're
closing more cases year over
year from 2022 2023 to 2024. 2024 will be a year at least from the first three quarters perspective, where we've closed
most cases over the years that
we've been doing this. The other
thing that we try to keep track of is are we closing, opening
and closing cases at a similar rate? And I think we're achieving that because we have
very limited resources and very
limited number of investigators.
So in order to maintain a
certain stasis with our caseload, we have to make sure
that we're operating efficiently
and closing cases at a rate that we're receiving them. Here's a
three year comparison of the
dpa's caseload. For the
different quarters. And like last year, we have 28 pending
cases at this particular moment
in time, which is almost identical to quarter three of
2023. So again, a fairly stable
caseload managed by a senior
investigator and a and a regular
line investigator. This graph is
a representation of the
breakdown of the case findings. This particular quarter, we had
a couple of cases with a significant number of
allegations that one was withdrawn and a couple were
referred after some
investigation led us to the led
us to the conclusion that we did
not have the jurisdiction to investigate that particular case
and that kind of took a lot of the statistics in terms of the case findings per allegation. So
you'll see a disproportionate number of allegations referred
to the other agencies and, and
which were also and I believe those withdrawal allegations all
came from one case, which was a
sexual abuse case that had the
complexity of both a pending criminal investigation as well
as civil action. And I think all
those things taken together led
the complainant to withdraw the complaint. I would also add that that withdrawal was done with
the assistance of an attorney representing that particular
complainant, and wasn't done unilaterally without legal
advice. This graph just
represents a more granular breakdown of the types of
allegations that we investigated and closed this particular
quarter, just on a continuum, to
show you the proportion of the different allegations. Again,
the referrals and the withdrawal
takes up a disproportionate part of the quarter three case
findings. But besides those, it
would be, as we've seen, almost
every report, excessive force in
the form of misconduct comprises
the largest proportion still of
the types of complaints that we
receive. Of course, we do not investigate the less serious
allegations. So our data set is going to be potentially skewed
by excessive force allegations
because it is one of the more serious ones. And dominates the statistics for the types of
cases that we see. Complainant
demographics. For the new cases,
we had 16 new complainants. Again, the complainant demographics are voluntary information that is provided by
the complainants when they make
their complaint. All 16 of them
had declined to state their age.
They did provide us with other data that allows us to see that
more than half of them are male, and exactly 50% of the new
complainants are black or african american, 13% are
hispanic or latino, and 25% decline to state their
demographic. Declined to state
their race. In terms of the complaint, sources, we received
a fairly large proportion that
were by referrals. This particular quarter. We're not
exactly sure why, other than we
have a new, new internal affairs unit leadership with a new lieutenant that started recently
and some new members of the icu
team. And they've been much more
proactive in referring cases to us. So we've seen a larger percentage of referrals, this
particular this particular quarter. Marshall, could you remind us of that acronym?
Internal affairs unit. Oh, okay. i thought you said some other acronym. So okay. I'm sorry. Okay. And in terms of the complaint locations, this
particular quarter, it it's very consistent with the jail population with cx three having
the majority of the complaints, 44%, followed by cx two and cx
one. So nothing particularly unusual or noteworthy about that
breakdown. This graphic
represents for the new complaint
allegations. I would preface new
complaint allegations are very preliminary because this is just
based on the initial reported
allegations and elements of that
particular complaint, almost
inevitably, on almost every case after the case is investigated and the evidence is gathered,
there will be additional complaints. For example, we
don't have the use of force log or incident reports on some of
the use of force allegations
yet. And if there's a failure to document the use of force, that would be additional allegations
that's not captured here. So same with we don't have an
inventory of the body worn camera footage right at the
outset. And the failure to turn
on body worn camera at the correct time or under the
correct circumstances could be additional allegations. But
nonetheless, to the extent that
it's informative, the largest proportion, again for the new
incoming complaints is largely dominated by unnecessary or excessive force complaints or
allegations. So in terms of in terms of the quarter three
highlights and the ways that dpa has been assisting the office of the inspector general, this particular quarter, we continue with investigative support, understand the question as to
whether inspector wiley has been directly overseeing all of the
investigations. We have certainly made all of the investigations available to
inspector wiley, and we consult
with inspector general wiley on the more serious investigations
and investigations that contain
elements that we would benefit
from teasing out. We don't try to bother him with the day to day operations on every single investigation. But to the extent
that inspector general wiley has
been here, we have certainly
deferred to him having access to every single investigation and
all of the materials we provide
administrative support for the office of inspector general from front desk receptionists and phone duties all the way through all of the financial support for
budgetary and finance
preparations and public records
requests, responses. So there's a lot of administrative support that the office of the inspector general would really benefit from having staff to perform.
And obviously that's will be one
of the budget asks we've sent staff to accompany the inspector
general to the jail, visits the meetings and events, and we have had a senior investigator on
hand to document those events,
those jail visits, and we can
certainly put them into a more
report form and document that for the inspector general to
approve in the form of a report, to publish to this board and to
the public, we're currently extracting all of our key
findings from all of our investigations over this year, so that we can present them to the inspector general and have
the inspector general decide
which key findings to bring to
the attention of this board and
prioritize for further action, whether in the form of a
recommendation or some sort of
specific focused monitoring in
that particular area. We've
implemented a team system for
responding to in-custody deaths.
Now, previously, we have been
relying on the very limited
staff that have been assigned to the sheriff's investigations. We've brought in that now to include the officer involved
shooting team and mix the teams
so that we can be sure that
rather than just relying on one
person, we have a team that's available around the clock 24
hours a day, seven days a week,
365 days a year. I can say that in the last two death
notifications, we received very prompt notification from the sheriff's office. I think we
still have some work in terms of automating that notification
system, like the police department does with everbridge, but nevertheless, we can say
that we were notified of the death within 30 minutes. And
particularly in the last two investigations, we had an
investigator and myself on scene within the hour. In fact, the
last 1 in 2, we were on scene within 40 minutes. So we
appreciate the sheriff's office being very proactive and notifying us very quickly. And
we'd like to assure this board that we are providing both an
attorney and an investigator to respond to the scene as quickly
as humanly possible, and lastly,
to also increase the profile of the office of the inspector general, because, as we all know, increasing the profile of
a department and amplifying the
needs of the community will help hopefully draw attention to the
need to fund this department. So
we're working in collaboration
with a vendor to hopefully
develop a commercial that will run during the down periods on
sfgovtv. We're still moving
forward with getting all of the sheriff's investigations onto a cloud based file system that will offer investigators, particularly when we're able to onboard more investigators, more flexibility to be able to access
case files anywhere there is still the project that is currently on hold, but we're
hopeful that when the office of the inspector general can scale
up its capacity to do more
investigations, that at some
point we'll be able to put the office of the inspector general's electronic complaint
form onto tablets, and the complaints can be made electronically. The concern
right now is that if we were to do that, we would get overloaded and flooded almost immediately and we don't have the
investigators to be able to
manage that level of
investigations. Perhaps my
opinions can differ on that. But
the other thing that, you know,
we're contemplating or thinking about is that the tablet offers
us access to the inmates in ways
that didn't exist a few years ago. I noted that in 2019, the
jail justice coalition did a paper survey with a massive
number of inmates. That survey
was able to inform the jail justice coalition about the
particular needs and priorities for improving the condition. For
a lot of our inmates in the
jails, and they were able to
transition into free phone calls
as as well as reduced costs on
commissary. So it's been five years since the last jail wide
survey that we're aware of, and hopefully in the future, we might be able to utilize the technology that's offered by the survey, by the tablets, to be
able to do an electronic survey. One of the major issues that
we've seen over the years is
just an inconsistent documentation of the use of
force. And we've started a discussion with the sheriff's
office, with the sheriff himself, about transitioning to
an electronic use of force log so that these paper use of force
logs are not siloed in paper. That makes it very difficult to
track down, as well as gather
information from. We have a draft of the sheriff's office
disciplinary guidelines. I know
there's a nacole webinar coming
up talking about the importance
of having the consistency of disciplinary guidelines. We have
a draft that we've submitted to sheriff's legal, and we're
working on ironing out some of the details. Once we have some feedback from the sheriff, we
will certainly bring that to
this board's attention as we know from the disciplinary
matrix, that was created for the
sfpd. From the time that the
conversation first started to, when it's fully implemented, took about a year. So it's a
work in progress. And lastly, we
are very close to and almost certain that before the end of
this year, the dpa's sfpd data will be on data sf's data
dashboards, offering the public an opportunity to look at the
reports dynamically rather than
on static reports where the
public will be able to filter the dashboards to identify the
information that will be of value to whatever interest they MAY have, and the data. We're
also as soon as we're able to
launch the data sf or the sfpd
data, we will start work on on
it for the sfso data. So that is
our corridor presentation for the third quarter of this year. Happy to answer any questions this board MAY have. Thank you
marshal. And this time we do have ample time for questions
and comments. So we won't have
to carry this over to the next
meeting. Member wechter, thank
you very much for the report. I want to clarify, when you go out to the scene of an in-custody death, what is your relationship, your team's relationship to the
individuals conducting the administrative and the criminal
investigations? Yes. So, for
example, in the last unfortunate, tragic death at age
two, as soon as we responded to the scene, we notified the deputy at the front desk that we're here for the department of police accountability.
Responding, we are through the letter of agreement, the lead investigative agency for the administrative investigation.
However, as you know from your work, the criminal investigation does take precedent. We arrive
on scene, we're met with members of the internal affairs unit.
They are our liaisons to
gathering the evidence for the administrative investigation.
And we also meet with the
criminal investigations unit. We get a debriefing right on scene
in fact, this last time we were
there so quickly on scene, I think we got the same debriefing. They received as well as with the medical examiner's investigator on
scene. We have a long standing relationship with them, and
we're pleased that we have
immediate access to the scene. And are you able to observe their the interviews? They do,
yes, we do independent
interviews. We're we're afforded the opportunity to view the interviews, but not participate
in in the interviews. And then
regarding the report, the case
findings for q3 2024, is your
office still considering exonerated as the conduct
occurred? But it did not, but was within policy? Yes. The
exonerated it's defined within
the sheriff's policies and procedures. Yes, the conduct did
occur for example, in the use of
force complaint. The use of
force did occur, but it was
within policy and lawful. And so
during this quarter, you did not reach any findings of unfounded.
We did not find any unfounded this time. Yes. And then regarding the number of cases, withdrawals, were all of them
ones where the individuals who
made the complaint said, I want to withdraw the complaint. Yes,
I believe it's I believe it's just one case. As I mentioned, it was a sexual abuse case where
the where the individual had representation from an attorney
and I believe there might be some strategic reasons for the civil case as to why it was withdrawn. Okay. Eight allegations from one complaint.
I also want to say that the next chart, maybe it's because of my
age. I find it hard to read this very small type and distinguish one color from another. I think
it would be helpful to just get the numbers for those in more
readable form, and if someone prints this out black and white, obviously they're not going to see the gradations of color. And
then the new complaints
allegations q3 the graphics is very nice, but it doesn't really give me a sense of the numbers
or the percentage. Maybe it
could be supplemented with that
information. Yes. Yeah. Since it was a small number, we didn't include the number, but we can certainly include the number.
Obviously with 16 individuals, 50% would be eight, you know,
and we had figured that that was
almost self-explanatory enough. But we can certainly add the
numbers as well. Right? When you just have a graphic like this or percentage, it MAY not reflect the fact that there's a very small number of cases that it's
looking at and give, you know, an incorrect impression. Yeah. This is complaint number of
complainants, not cases. But the
n is 16. And do you do you directly supervise the senior investigator and investigator conducting the investigations.
Yes. So with like with the dpa
investigations, we have both a team collaborative approach as well as a multi-tier review of
every single case. So we have an investigator that performs the investigation. We have a and
we're really fortunate also to
have probably the most
experienced senior investigator on these cases, brant begin,
who, you know, has been doing this for, I believe, the past
six years now. So he might be the most experienced administrative investigator for
discipline for sheriff cases,
probably in the city. He does
the initial review works through
the case and case plan with the investigator. He does the
initial edits to the case
finding and case summary report, and then it's submitted to me
for final approval. And who does the first review and the last review of the completed case
report? So I do the last signed
review. Any case of significance
for example, if it's a death in
custody case, you know, we would certainly brief the inspector general about it as well and get
his thoughts before we finalize
any of the reports. And a your responsibilities at D.P.A.
Solely to supervise this unit.
Right now, that's my primary
work. But I also obviously do a
lot of other administrative support, whatever legal
requirements come up, if there's a pr, public records request that comes in or other legal
analysis that needs to be done on hand to assist with that as
well. And do you function as the attorney assigned to this case to do the legal review? Yes. As
you know, the rest of the sfpd cases have the benefit of an
attorney, a managing attorney, and then a chief. So there's
additional levels of beyond
that. But we don't have the staffing for that. Okay. So you're directly supervising those two employees and serving
as the attorney to review those reports. Yes. Okay. Thank you
for clarifying that. Apparently. Anything further? Member wachter
no, no. Member. Mango. Marshall,
thank you so much. I wanted to
ask maybe just more of like a
for the board. Actually, I you know, I'd love for the report. The report is super helpful. I'd
love for us for next year. Not
for any time soon to have a report that's a little bit like where we can, like, impact, because I feel like like the slides about like misconduct
and, you know, the different
types of complaints, you know, maybe that could be more of an appendix. And we spend our time talking about, you know, something I don't know, like the highlights that you were mentioning, like the commercial or something. I don't know, just trying to think about, you know,
how we can how I'd love to, you
know, talk more in detail about
certain topics and then what was
my other question? You mentioned
the commercial part. I'm just interested. Who's paying for that one? It's coming out of the inspector general's budget. It's
I think the estimate that we got
was $30,000, and that would be a
commercial where the inspector
general would explain his role
in this work. What the office does, what it aspires to do. It
would all be produced and then
run on sfgovtv for $30,000,
which is actually a relatively inexpensive for I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, $3,000. Three I was like,
I know, I was like, wow, 30,000.
So sorry. I added that zero $3,000. Yeah. Which, which was which is really inexpensive.
Okay, great. And then the other one was just like for future would be I'd love to see like the jail population somewhere. The stat just to help my brain
understand the scale. And the second part was like I remember asking the past meetings about
the shutdown, the number of shutdowns that happened. Is that something that is in the works?
Not so much. Or like, yeah, we
actually have reports that we receive from the sheriff's office. We also check the jail population regularly. It's posted on the sheriff's website.
So you can see it. I think they
they post their population. I, I
could be wrong about this, but I think it's 5 A.M. Every morning.
Okay. And we've been monitoring
it's been hovering around 1200
to up to about 12, 80, 100 a
month a week. I would say every time we check it. Yeah, it's been above 1200 for the last
several weeks. This is in a
range of a month or a few weeks or that's the daily population
that was taken. Oh I'm sorry, daily population. Sorry I was hearing shutdowns. Oh no. No.
Okay. Yeah I was going to say so. I mean, it's more so just like if we could just put it in your report, the quarterly report, that would be helpful to kind of have. Certainly. Yeah.
And I would welcome an offline
conversation so that we can gather all your thoughts, or you
can send me an email with whether what other details you would like in there. Thank you marshall I appreciate it. So I was going to say you're really good at graphics and just making it understandable to the general
public. So I would really appreciate that the board would really appreciate your feedback
in terms of doing, you know, culminating these reports into
an annual report. Yeah, I'm
happy to help. And thank you.
Next, vice PRESIDENT, maybe we
get member mango in the in the
commercial as well too. Yes. No, she didn't like it. No. But she'll do the makeup. No, but
thank you again, marshall. I think, you know, for the report. I'm actually really glad that we're using salesforce. I think
for me, with being one of the members, one of the things I
always look, try to look into is like, how can we be more proactive versus being so reactive? So, you know, being sure that we have the technology and the resources and things to do what we need to do, but also
being able to track where we are as we're doing it. So it's actually very similar. It's not a question, probably more so just a request, marshall, to add
to the report for me, especially looking at the ongoing and
future projects, just to percentage wise in terms of where we are at. Marshall. Right. Like we have a timeline because I remember last time we presented or it could have been the time before we had timelines like, hey, we want to try to
look at this in q2, q3, I think in order to help us figure out where we might be able to have impact or be able to also help is to sit back and say that, you know, we're looking at the electronic use of force tracking, and we're at 25% completion for that. So what can we do to make sure that it
continues to progress and just be able to see it in terms of numbers? Thank you. Yep. That's a great suggestion. Vice PRESIDENT. And I think it'll
help us as we come to a new calendar year, for us to
prioritize what we want to look at and look at short term goals, as well as long term goals.
Yeah. So we're back to member
wechter. Thank you. I thought of a few more questions on the
complaint sources. The 6% for un plaza. Does that refer to the
library that was not inside the library but outside it was responding. Sheriff deputies to
an incident. Well, does that mean the sheriff's deputies assigned to the library or sheriff's deputies who are on
patrol? I believe these were
patrol deputies. I don't recall any sheriff deputies coming out
from the library to respond.
Right. It's only one complaint.
Out of the 16. Okay? And. I
think it would be useful for us
to see the types of allegations
that are coming from each
facility or place. Okay. Yeah.
The real challenge is figuring out how to represent it
graphically. When we have too
many fields, it becomes a little bit challenging, but I'll work with our tech folks to see
whether or how we can fit more
data fields into the graphics
without the danger of it becoming overly complex, where it doesn't make sense to anybody. Well, it need be graphic, just the raw numbers. I think, would be helpful to see how many are coming from which
jail or san francisco general.
And then I know your office for
many years has has posted complaints summary reports which
are an anonymized summary of the
complaint and I saw that
inspector general singh's
website also reports on that, obviously anonymized. Is it
possible to do that? Regarding
the sheriff's complaints? You you already or would that have to go through meet and confer? They're already posted on the
dpa's website under the monthly
statistics. It has a list of all
the statistics that our sfpd
cases, as well as sfo cases. And then in there there's a summary of what the primary allegations
are. And if you look at the column of the agency, you'll see
some vast majority of them are sfpd, but you'll see sfo cases
there as well. You know, as we
move forward and building out resources for the office of the inspector general, you know, that would be certainly something that would would be worthwhile investing in. So is
that the spreadsheet you're referring to? It's the it's on
the dpa website in the monthly
reports. And yeah, there's this
there's a first a graphical
representation of the data followed by a spreadsheet that
has what the complaint, the specific complaint is and which
agency it refers to. Okay. You have to go down that column to
find sfso to distinguish it from
sfpd. Yes. And right now it's
just a resource issue. We don't
have a data analyst or any, any,
any staff to support building
out additional website and
reports for the office of the inspector general. And, you know, hopefully that's certainly an ask that we'll be able to
take that data off the case management system and create different reports in the future
might be helpful to separate out the complaints against the
sheriff's office. So you could
look at those and not have to go line by line, because it is a separate agency and a separate
set of investigations. Yes. And we're hoping to do better than that, where everything will be
filtered through data sf and these will be dynamic reports. So if you want sfso data, you
can just simply filter out the sfso data and see all of those separated. I was also going to
make a clarification though. Marshall, when you have the
final report coming out of, say,
dpa, there is the auditing process. So we don't have the capacity to do auditing on our
sheriff's data. So some of the reporting is a little bit fuzzier if you will, because it
will not have gone through the
auditing process. Yes, yes. And
as you recall from the auditing presentation, those are very,
very strict standards with a
rigorous peer review system for
those audits to be performed.
And we would need a certified auditor like that on staff in the absence of an auditor, the
comptroller's office does take
auditing recommendations. And, you know, we can submit some proposals after the inspector general has a conversation with
this board on some of our more significant findings or key
findings as to which one this board MAY decide. You would like to ask the comptroller's office to assist on an audit with.
Thank you. I see that we're running out of time, so I am
going to recommend that we table
item six and seven. Thank you.
Marshall. And I just want to make an announcement on the future agenda items. Next month we will have benrishi and
possibly another person from
human resources to talk about when we were doing our
evaluations come JANUARY for the
inspector general, PRESIDENT Icu, we're going to do public comment online, public comment line number five. At this time, members of the public wishing to
provide public comment on line item five. Department of police accountability report, are invited to approach the podium
when it becomes available.
There's no comments for line
item five and line item six and seven have been continued and
moved to general public comment. General public comment. At this
moment, members of the public are invited to speak to the board for a duration of up to two minutes, regarding matters
that were not included in this afternoon's agenda that fall within the jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. During this public comment period, neither sheriff personnel, the inspector
general, nor board members are obligated to answer questions posed by the public, although they MAY offer a brief response
if they choose to do so. If you wish to provide public comment, please approach the podium when it becomes available. Please
remember that you have a maximum
of two minutes to express your comments. There appears to be no public comment. Any other items? MISS? MADAM PRESIDENT? No, just to an adjournment and I would like to adjourn in memory of a very important community member.
I'd like. I'd like to adjourn in memory of arnold townsend. We've
lost a community giant. I did
attend his memorial a few days ago, and he was a commissioner
most recently on the redistricting task force, but always somewhat supportive of me
personally and other people who
wanted to serve the city. I also put him in the same category as sulu in the pacific islander
community. So I think in the future, if I'm ever up for another position, I might just say you know, some of these people, their shoes can't be filled. But those were the people who supported me along
the way. So I don't know. D.O.J.
If you want to say I know he was very influential with all your
endeavors. Yeah. No, I think you
so eloquently put it. I think the contributions of reverend townsend to the city and the
stories that he told, the stories he tells stories for
days. But yeah, hearts, you know, there with his family, I think his legacy and the work
that he's done here in san francisco will continue to live on, you know, through through bodies like ours. And prayers
just go out to his family. Yes.
Thank you. All right. Calling line item ten. Adjournment action item. All those in favor?
Aye, aye. Any nays? Meeting
adjourned at 4:58 P.M. Thank
you. I MISS."
2024-10-04,"news. Yeah. Okay. Ready? Okay,
okay. The meeting is now called
to order. It's 2:05 P.M. The

Communications. Informational item. Announcements and
information to share with the board members and the public. Okay, so first up we have the young community developers. We run bayview. Second, we have
faith and blue. And then we also have faith and blue blessing of the badges and the faith in blue
is pretty much an all day session. It's this saturday, and
so we'd like to poll to see who will be attending, because we
can't have a quorum. And I don't know, janet, if you want to expound on notice quorum at
these public events. So I exactly what do you want me to
say that you need if you're if you're going to have them, it would probably be considered a meeting. And if there's a
quorum, if there's a quorum of people who attend the faith and blue event, is that what you're asking? I think so, I mean, I
have a differing opinion from a different commission in that if it's a an event called by someone else and it's really more a social community event,
that it didn't matter. And always the admonition that people don't talk about business, but your opinion is
that if there's a quorum that
there shouldn't be a quorum, number one, and if there is a quorum, it has to be run by a
meeting and noticed. Yeah, that
was what I sent the email about. Right? Okay. I mean, all right, all right. I just want to remind. So I don't know if we can quickly do this and just see who is interested in the ycd. We
run bayview. When is that? When
is that? OCTOBER 12th. Yeah. I'm
going to. Yeah, I'm getting
ready to go on a trip. So will you be doing that, member palmer, we rarely get a mention.
Okay, okay, so we might not have
anybody there, but I think what I'm going to have people do is
just email dan to make it
easier. And whoever the top
three, I guess in time order will get to go. And then dan will just keep track so we don't
have to. But I highly recommend
if you can go to faith and blue to go to faith and blue. It's held at ck three. And then
there's little overview. You get

right there. So I want to start.
Praise GOD so thank you, julie.
The PRESIDENT, for inviting us
up to share with you guys the
historical movement of our organization, the mighty united
players. It's a movement that
was created by the people, for
the people, by the people, and
with the people from in
particular, the young youth. But now we're all the way as young
as kids, from the elementary to all the way adults from the
penitentiary. And I'm going to have my brothers up here sharing
the minute. And so, I don't
know, do we got how much time we
got to do this, but I don't want to half hour. Okay. We don't
need so thank you. There ain't nothing I ain't got no notes. I ain't got nothing up my sleeve. this is coming from my heart. United players ironically
started in OCTOBER of 1994.
OCTOBER the eighth. The coverage
of documentation that shows the
first fight that happened in san
francisco at balboa high school
in 1994. I was hired as a gang prevention counselor at bernal
heights neighborhood center by a gentleman named mauricio vela.
He took a chance on me as an ex-felon to come up there to
work with young youth who are particularly filipino gang members. So, you know, knowing
the district bernal heights is
in is an 11. He said, rudy, I need you to deal with all the gang members. That's filipino in that neighborhood. And I'm a native san francisco born and raised south of market district six, but I know where they're all at because I was active in
that lifestyle. Caught the 14
mission, went to balboa high
school showing off OCTOBER 1994.
Balboa high school is off the hook. The principal there was
her name was MISS Mona virgin,
filipino lady was trying to find solutions and answers through
the police, through different
departments to help stop and alleviate the violence that was happening at the school because
nobody had the answers. So watch this. This is how GOD works. I'm blessed. I'm an ex-felon. I'm coming to the school. I ain't supposed to even be there on campus. But nobody was stopping. Nobody was an open door policy.
Just come on up to the school. There's no gates at the time up there. Right behind the no gates, just walk on. Every day
was a sideshow at bell. A big
fight ensued between blacks and
filipinos, right during the
altercation between these two
groups. People was getting jumped, people was getting robbed, and people was getting
hurt because nobody didn't have
didn't have the courage to step up. So me being there and I'm
filipino, I'm looking at all the filipinos. This is for pacquiao,
though, you know what I mean? We
was we was warriors then. Y'all just see that brother right there said sir. He going to speak in a minute. That's the original pacquiao. Him and his
twin brother. So fight break out. Nobody's able to defuze the
fight because people ain't had
the courage. So here I am up
there telling the filipinos we need to sit down with the brothers because this is a
school and a place to get educated, an institution. So
they was willing to do it. There was a gentleman named andre alexander. He was the coach of the football team who got the brothers, and it was a big
samoan cat who worked there as a security guard. His name was light from frisco north beach
projects. Shout out to them, he was there. We came together and said, let's get all these youngsters together. The
principal gave us the range to
do what we had to do to end the
violence. He came to blacks. He
came to filipinos, sat in a room.
We even had to get the police to
go get the kid because he was. He was expelled. One of the kids from hunters point to bring him
in. Somebody hold on. Rudy. Oh, man. It's kind of chilling. How you feeling, baby? Given the historical history of up. All
right, so we're in a room.
balboa high school, room 112,
where the players dwell. True
story. With the youth. And I
said, so what's really going on?
Why are you guys fighting? So
they was comfortable enough to share because no police came in the room. The administration had come in the room. It was just
all the thugs, the young cats who was willing to learn and wanted to learn, but wasn't
getting the proper education. So
we sat in a room and they said
a, b, c, one, two, three. Most wars are stopped or fought over
a woman. It was a female. That's
how it started. So, you know,
I'm like, okay, so who was the female? Got the yearbook. We
looked at it and you know, no
disrespect. I was like, damn, y'all finna go to prison and die
for her. You know, make sense out of it. Everybody kind of laughed and they said, you know
what? You're right. Well, ain't
nothing happens here at the
school. They it's like action. I said, well, I gave the power to
the people. What do you want to
do? The youngsters came up with all the answers to the solution
to stop the violence. Bro.
OCTOBER 8th, 1994. Fast forward OCTOBER the 8th is in how many
days? Like five days? Well,
today, the fourth venmo days
will be 30 years. We still pushing, homie, GOD is being
good to us. The youth that
started something that started from the concrete, the roads
out, the concrete. Our
organization man has saved
thousands and thousands and
thousands of youth's lives and
guess what? We worldwide, we got
chapters all over the world now that's helping us stop the
violence in different ways. I'm at bernal heights neighborhood
center 2000, 1994, 2005. I said, and the kids gave me this at juvenile hall. They said, hey, bro, why you always helping out
the kids over there, man? And
excelsior up in sunnydale or over there, man in lakeview. Why don't you help us out? We live right there. Where you live downtown tenderloin. I'm like
you, right? This is in juvenile hall. They locked up. I'm going to visit everybody else. It made sense. I said, yeah, we need to
do what we're doing over there. So in 2005, I took up, asked
mauricio vela. Hey, mauricio,
can I take what I started here
and bring it to my neighborhood?
He said, you sure can, rudy, but
a pimp tell a hoe like he told me. You can take what the program, but you can't take none of the funding. Oh, I said, all
right. Cool. I already made connections with gavin, mayor
brown, whoever I needed to make it with through the duration of
94 to 2005. So I went there. I started with no money. Nathan
nathaniel. And said, how can I
get some money, man, to start what? We started over there because it works in my neighborhood. And the brother name was eugene coleman. I don't
know if you knew eugene coleman.
He used to be in a nonprofit organization where I grew up called can and kip on eighth and natoma, but eugene coleman worked for one of the city departments. Under him was a guy named fred blackwell, who's right now the I guess he runs
the san francisco foundation. They said, what you need. I
said, man, I need some money to
pay my people. So they shot me 25 g's because I was a nonprofit. I got my people who knew how to write grant writers. I got a team, and we was in our neighborhood south of market.
Now we was working out the rec center sixth and folsom, where you brought your kids to where we had our halloween parties.
But as time went on, we started bringing all the kids from the
neighborhood black, latino,
filipino, samoans, whites,
chinese, cambodian, everybody.
And we was at the rec center like two years later they said,
guess what, dude, you got an mou
was an mou. I know about money
makin murder. You understand me?
But do I know about mou? No.
Well, y'all can't be in the rec.
We going to charge you? Charges? They ain't got no money to give
y'all. GOD, we came to the rec.
It was a friday. Me and all the kids coming from bessie carmichael. They locked and
chained the door with the
sheriff's out there. You know
how that felt with us in the rain. And we couldn't go in our own neighborhood park and rec center. I was devastated, grew
up in a neighborhood, born and
raised, still there and I didn't understand the politics and behind. I just knew, man, these are the kids. So you know what
rudy did? Rudy fasted and
started talking to GOD, I
fasted, man. I would go to meetings. This is all based on a true story, man. I would get papers when I'm at meetings and
I would draw with the united players building, look like, and
within a year GOD blessed me
with that building. Homie, where
your players club at? I'm going
to tell you what mine is at 1038 howard street, in the heart of
soma. And I'm going to tell you
how good it is on my id when I was born and they gave me my driver's license on my license,
it already said 1038. I ain't
bsing. This is for real. So we
have a building now, 2007 2008.
We moved into 1038 howard
street. We started growing our
program started meeting and
building with the people. And
guess what happened? I was able
to meet people like matt haney,
jane kim, what's the other brother who's name was there?
Chris daly, who were warriors in the field that fought for our
people and they created the stabilization fund that the
funding that would go from development would go to our community. But I sat at the table just like you did, player, because I wanted to make sure they was being held accountable. And I said, nah, that money ain't just going to go to anybody. It goes to the people.
In 2015, we was able to purchase
our building on my mama and she
in heaven owned the building. We ain't never owned nothing. We
ain't on a border of brick in our neighborhood. But now we owning it for the people. And so
what am I doing at that time? I'm building relationships with
mahomes behind the walls. Because these are my brothers. These are my comrades. These are my barracudas. You understand what I'm saying? Julie? These
are our people. You're looking
at them right here. They was
able to come home after life
sentences right? Bloods, crips
comes north, south, white boys all coming home. Who already
made transition in behind the walls in the penitentiary to give back to build the community
that was being destroyed. It
takes the hood to say the hood
it takes us to save us. Y'all ain't going to do it. We going to do it, but we going to hold you accountable. And so what
transpires at the time, brother
started coming home. 25, 35, 45 years. And guess what I would
do? I would give them the opportunity to work with the
kids killers, working with the
kids who heard that. And there
was some of the most impactful
and most powerful kids. I mean,
people that would help the kids out. But what I started
realizing is the kids was helping them out because the
kids was medicine. Man, keeping
on point. And so we started
evolving. 2015, 2020. We getting everywhere, we transforming.
They sending me all the way to what's that place with the
needle ireland. I'm in ireland.
Boy from the ghetto, downtown
tenderloin, sixth street boy
filipino boy in ireland. Hanging man with the realest. Telling
about what we do. What works
because see, GOD's plan works everywhere. No matter where you at on the planet. Then guess
where I land? Africa. I went to
africa, man. And in africa,
where the struggle is real, they
just need the basic, essential things for them to survive. We out here, we spoiled just like the philippines. My brother
right there. I met his brother
in san quentin state prison in 94, where his brother was in there, one of the first to ever
commit a murder at the young age of 16, filipino in our neighborhood got sentenced to life, but was able to get out after 35. But they deported him and they brought him to the philippines where he's out there. Guess what? Saving lives
and putting people and dumping them in the water. What's that guy's name? Who did that? He would put people in the water. John the baptist, him, his
brother man was one of them cats, though, you know what I mean? Will. But he. And guess
what? He baptizes him in you pee
shirts in the ocean. Swim,
brother man. And he did it at
his time. He was a kid. He was only 16 when he committed his
crime. He grew up, made a transition behind the walls. Right? Found jesus christ, my
lord. And savior, who thank you,
GOD and was able to make a
transition with many other brothers behind them. Walls who came out see prison didn't rehabilitate them. They
rehabilitated theirself. Amen.
And came out and they got the opportunity. Like that gentleman
right there. And so we started
building. And guess what? We
just did bought another building. Congratulations. Right? To the
tv people. You imagine guys from
our neighborhood who used to
destroy and harm our community and our people. Now our stakeholders. Right. Some of the
best people who are my friends
now is the police. You see me shake his hand because I ain't
got nothing to hide no more. I ain't no criminal. That's my
partner right there, chief scott. He from la. That's my
homeboy. I was mad at him for a minute. It's alright. I'm human.
And so what we was able to do
during the duration is do gun
buybacks. That's another thing we do under the umbrella of stopping silencing the violence. Because the number one killer
for children now is gun violence
19 or younger. Domestic violence suicide a lot of people out here
is bleeding inside. And so we was able to start doing gun buybacks with matty scott, with
the chief, with brothers like you, palmer, who came home after
all them years, the youth, we all came together under one umbrella. Moms demand action.
Brady campaign, right. All under one umbrella. A community that
said we ain't gon, you know,
continue to allow people to get killed for senseless gun violence. I'm a survivor of gun
violence in my neighborhood. Ninth and howard. So we try to
gun me down, but I'm still here
and guess what? We was able to
get thousands and thousands of guns off the streets, no
questions asked. And I want to be real clear. I am not against
the second amendment. I am not, but I'm against senseless gun
violence because I know what it
feels like to have a hot one in
your ass. Or even pump some. And so we destroyed thousands and
thousands of guns now, and we're making art out of it. We got
butterflies. The warriors just
purchased right to put it, they say, to show how beautiful that something could transform when
you put light and you put love
into it. I got all kinds of stories I can tell you about that man, but I want to take too
much time. That's just part two.
And so what are we doing this
month? We celebrating 30 years
of life. 30 years of transforming something that
turns something that was ugly to something that's beautiful. The
roads from the concrete, the roads that came from the third
world country. That's what we united players, we GOD's warriors, we GOD's soldiers, and
we going to continue to do what GOD has us to do because that's
who our leader is now. And so I want to thank you for having us
come up here. You didn't know that that this was our 30 year anniversary. This week. We
having a party secret location. I can't tell you. Don't say
nothing. Only the players are
invited. And so I want to make
sure I give a shout out to everybody like you did at the beginning. To people who passed away because there was many people during our 30 year
duration who was with us. That passed away. Young kids as young
as 12 all the way, adults. So thank you for starting it. That way. Respect. We always want to
honor our dead and our heroes because you guys did this way before I did it. I'm just following your footsteps. I'm
just one man that's humble to know that I will follow GOD and
have me do whatever he has me to
do to continue to bring life
into these young people. And so thank you for giving me this opportunity. You know what I
mean? Thank you for having us up here. We are a nonprofit. You can donate, contribute. You know
what I mean? I take et, I take
all that. Yeah. Thank you. Rudy.
I just wanted to let people know
why I invited rudy. And I see members of the latino task force here. We can't do our work without the community where the latino task force. That's my brother right there. Yep. And.
And we can't do this work without the community. And this
highlights the need for public, private relationships to get our
work done. But we also rely on the eyes and ears of the community to let us know how we
can serve you, because we are
the servants of the people of
san francisco. I appreciate it,
I want to I just want to have my brothers real quick. Yes. And
then I also I also wanted to just highlight because member
palmer, as you know, painted the
visiting room, but, you know,
you are the prime example. And others I looked at like eddie jane too, and so hopefully eddie zhang, eddie zheng, rico ramirez, I met all them cats man
in 1994, san quentin prison. It was all my comrades, my brothers. So this is to also
highlight how we want to have services to make sure we break the cycle, because the cycle can
be broken when you have services and organizations like yours. I
just want, you know, I'm so proud of your son. You just shout out where your son is going to. Even though it's my
college rival. Well, fight on,
that's usc right? This they do.
It's my daughter. Oh your daughter. Sorry. So my yeah, my youngest daughter selena melinda corbett shout out to her. My

these guys are my brothers man. They believe in our mission. You
know it takes the hood to say the hood. Our people you know and so and rest in peace mauricio too because mauricio villa yep MAY he rest in peace. Yeah for real mitchell salazar all these guys man from the
mission. Yeah. You know what I'm
saying, rudy, I'd like to share with you some of the ways that united players has impacted my family. And just hearing you
speak it makes me feel emotional
because as someone that lives like maybe half a block, a
quarter of a block from united players, we have been so
directly impacted by all of the
amazing work that you have done, and especially during covid, in such a scary time. I'll tell
you, miesha is just phenomenal.
There are times, regrettably, my children, you know, have been
sick, regrettably a lot, and we
wanted to go to events. And she would notice when my kids
weren't there and she would put stuff away from them, like even
like the little gifts and stuff. And they were so loved. And then
we saw all of your staff. I've
seen your staff with all of
these kids bringing them in. My kids have played with them. We go to all of your amazing
events, which are spectacular, so well organized. Everyone
feels the love. You see all
these beautiful black, brown,
like all kinds of folks and it dispels this horrible myth. As someone that currently lives in the tenderloin, my wife still lives like right next to y'all
and there's such a horrible myth about these communities. When
people say, I tell them where I live, they're like, but you have
a kid. I was like, do you know that tenderloin has the highest population of children? Did you know that? There is you know, there is a sense of community. You know, we're not talking about people who are just
unhoused and having things. We're talking about people who are having pain, who are our neighbors that we are. They are
our neighbors. And you are teaching that and raising warriors that are compassionate
and kind and have a high
intelligence. And I mean, I've
seen the you know, I mean, you probably don't remember me because, you know, like, I'm in my chanclas and like, you know, I'm like my sweats kicking my
kids around doing stuff, but, you know, like seeing the buybacks and like, people bring all kinds of crazy stuff. Yeah. Like there's bombs, there's
grenades. Like there's some
heavy artillery. Somebody brought up. Somebody brought a
rocket launcher. Right. Like and you're just like, this is what was out in the community. I've
seen little kids drop off guns because adults were scared to
drop them off. That's right. And you see how it impacts community. and I love seeing the joy that you have brought to these
children and to see the
development of leadership and
rehabilitation for folks. And
it's just absolutely beautiful. I cannot commend your organization. It has brought so
much love to our house. And I we
if hopefully, you know, one of them don't get a cold, but we hope to be at your halloween
event and I will completely and
misha's just I mean she's a special person. Yes she is. And
I just want to say thank you for
the kind words and I will say
misha is one of the backbones and the heart of united players. She was there with me at the beginning. She used to work for. She used to work for rap. She
ran homie in the mission, right.
And so misha is phenomenal. Carolyn grant phenomenal.
Heather. Phenomenal. I got so many people on my team. It's
like, you know, a winning team that everybody really cares. And we're about trauma informed
care. We're about really dealing with the trauma now within ourselves and the kids to bring
the right way to resolve the way you feel. You know what I mean?
We was taught not to cry. We was taught, you know, hold that in. No, we going to tell you to cry because we making peace
fashionable. Now we want you you know we on some player stuff now on some real player stuff. But
we taking that all that you know
the stigmas of us, how things we was taught and learned to be opposite but to let people know
that it's cool now because our people, black and brown people,
we've been doing that from the beginning of time of healing. We
just was on top that it wasn't
cool, you know what I mean? Yoga sounded weird. I would never do yoga. And now we doing it. Grown ass men. We doing a yoga, you know? But that was our healing. We didn't know that. You know,
we just thought, man, somebody get killed, shot in our neighborhood. We just go through it and got to get through it. Nah, man, we're human beings like anybody else. We suffer, we go through pain, but we got ways of learning how to deal with it. Our emotions and our pain. And so we're teaching it now. We're getting taught, you know, through, you know, through
colleges or people that are
experts in it. But now we're teaching it to the kids. It's old to them. You know. But I
just want to and before I bring them up, you guys talk a lot about me. It really ain't me.
It's my style. It's them who do
it. I'm just the face of it. We know. And they make you look good. So I would like to bring
up some of my good brothers right here. Come on up,
gentlemen. And if you don't mind
saying a few words, please. Good
afternoon, you guys. My name is
cesar. I am from the philippines
in the late 60s and early 70s, I
came to the united states and I
speak no english at all. Didn't
even know what? Yes and no means.
I started going to school here. Sixth grade. I used to get
bullied. Me and my brothers, me and my twin brother and my older
brother. And I said to myself that it's this united states,
and I didn't want to come here
at first. You know? But anyway, I started gangbanging in the
early 70s. I grew up in here in
san francisco, and from juvenile
at the age of 11.5, I ran away
from home and I started
gangbanging with my friends, and I went to juvenile. From juvenile, I went to hawaii, from hawaii, I went to prison. I
spent almost more than half of
my life incarcerated, and I am
now 65 years old. And when I
came to united players. United
players changed my life because
of GOD's doing. Now I'm doing
GOD's work and I enjoy my job. I enjoy being with the united
players and I will always be a
up for life. Thank you. Amen.
Thank you, thank you. My name is
jason lacy and I'm one of the formerly incarcerated that now
work with rudy. When I was younger, I got locked up and served a life sentence. I'm from southern california. Former gang
member crip. I got sentenced to
life sentence when I was 20
years old. I did 25 straight on a basically 15 to life sentence
and my product of sb 260 and 261 when they raised the age of a
youth past 18, which allowed them to revisit a lot of us that were incarcerated as kids, that were getting treated as adults.
They were having hearings, being reviewed as adults, and being
held to the standards to a standard that we shouldn't have
been held to. I'm one of the ones that got a second chance.
They sent me to san francisco because they kept me away from the gangs in the los angeles
area. I got out in 2019. I met
rudy, I told him what I wanted, like what my vision was, is to try to help kids at that turning
point in that youth age that are trying to decide whether or not
to gang bang or to go straight.
and, you know, he told me I asked him what he do, what does he do? And he took me. He took me there to the like, the high schools where they were talking to the high school kids. He took me to the elementary schools.
I've been with him five years, ever since I've been out volunteering, helping out with the little kids from elementary
school all the way to high school. Now I actually get to do
with him the things that I said I wanted to do. I go in juvenile hall, we talk to kids in on probation, we help kids. You know, show them the realization of different aspects of gun violence. You know, that's coming from one side of it to
see where it can land you in prison. It can land you in jail. It can land you. You can be a victim, you can be shot up. And
we come by now letting them know that. You know what I mean? Peace is fashionable. You know, we were once on one side of the gun. You know, fighting for one side. And now we're fighting for change. We're showing people a different way that that it's
okay to help. It's okay to give
back to your community. You know what I mean? That we're all connected and helping community is just like helping yourself,
you know? Let me pass it to my
friend. Thank you. All right.
Okay. Good afternoon. I don't know that I could follow all that. That's a whole lot. That was way too many good stuff, fellas. My name is everett butler, born and raised in south central los angeles. A returnee from incarceration after 26 years. However, in the midst of
that incarceration is when i
changed my life. A full fledged gang member from south central
los angeles wasn't promised to be back out here to tell this story. But before GOD released me, he humbled me because he
knew my heart. I had larsen in
it. I had anger in it. I wanted to get the fellas back. That I
felt done me wrong because I wasn't getting those letters. When the mailman passed by while I was sitting in that cell
alone. But it was me who put me in there, so it took me to travel that path to understand
that it was me who put me there, and it was going to take me to get me back out of there, along with the faith, along with the faith of the creator. So with that being the case, after the 26 years of incarceration, I
paroled to san francisco. I became an alchemist and a player at the same time. I was a player before I was an alchemist because I was a player. Today I
was born. You see what they say worldwide. He said it before, but do or say worldwide. What they say on the shirt player. So no. But back to the situation. Like seriously being able to
travel the path that I traveled. Road of destruction. It helped me get on the path of
reconstruction, helping not only
my own family, but even other families. I understand now the hurt and pain I inflicted on the family that I took a life from. So when you speak of humbling
and I say GOD humbled me before he released me because I encountered transverse myelitis before I went to the board and was released, I couldn't walk for two weeks. I laid in stanford hospital. They took all
the blood out of my body five
times and cleaned. It, gave me five shots of steroids, and sent me to queen of the valley
hospital and said, it's going to be up to you if you walk again. It's going to be up to me. Well, I'm a workout fanatic. I'll be all right. That same day, my leg was still dead. It wouldn't move. One more week passed, I still
fell, got up. I'm still falling and get up. Every this month alone. Matter of fact, in halloween morning makes seven years that I've been home. That's coming up right around the corner, right? I go get an infusion that I'm telling you about for this transverse myelitis on the 26th of this
month. Right. And I'm standing before you. But when I paroled,
I was on a walker. I couldn't
even walk. 890 right here in san francisco. I'm walking up the
hill to the park and I'm like,
man, how do I get up this tall
hill? But I got up, I fell, I
got up, and today I'm on my own. Two feet. Hard dedication and motivation. I'm determined to continue to give back. United players has done more than just
help me. It's helped me help
others. I get more medicine from the kids than I believe I'm gonna get from this injection that I'm going to get from the
hospital. I have so many of the youth that look for me to come to the park. I'll be there today. And, you know, one of them said she speaks seven languages. She changed my nickname from boogie to. How do
you say? Well, how do you say my nickname? Well, your nickname in my new language is boga. I said, okay, how does that work? Okay, so now when she sees me coming through the gate, she's shouting my name and it's so inspirational and motivational. I can't not go to the park and
get my medicine from those kids, you know what I mean? Because it's the kids that leaves the future. And who better to tell
the youth where the bumps are in the road than somebody that's traveled that road before? Like myself? So with that being the case, and once again, shout out and thanks to rudy, because like
I say, I was an alchemist at, well, I worked for urban alchemy. I was a director, I
denounced that, and now I go inside of juvenile hall to speak
with the youth. I'm listening to my name being read into record,
and it's not for the gang that I was from. It's for every butler is here in representation of the
youth today from united players.
I can only pray and I wish and I know that she's in heaven.
Smiling down on me. But I wish my mother was here to see me now because when the day I became that gang member was the day she
didn't want me to be one. But it
took me to travel the road that I traveled to make the decision to not be that gang member. And that was when she passed in 2008. While I was sitting in
that set. So that day I made a
decision today. But today I'm still peeling off those layers of that monster that I have become. So it's what takes the hood to save the hood. It's
going to take all of us to save us. Together we stand divided. We are stuck. Thank you for hearing me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you guys for giving us the time to come and share with y'all. GOD is good y'all. He's been good to us and I just
want to say before we leave, it
does. It takes the hood to say the hood. That's all of us. You ain't got to be from the hood for you to come to the hood to help us. You just got to have a
loving and caring heart. And so whoever controls the mind and
the hearts of the youth control the future. And that's what
we're doing. Thank you guys for having us. Hey, rudy, before you
go. Before you go, I just want to say that a mutual friend brought me to the clubhouse
shortly after I got out in 2019
and introduced me to you in the united players, and you changed
my life. Really? I wouldn't be
here sitting at this seat right now if it wasn't for you. You
have been a mentor. You've taught me the corners to turn,
who to talk to. You put me in in rooms. You've introduced me to
people. People who would have walked by with their nose up in
the air. Probably. But they were good people anyway, you know what I mean? They wouldn't have
took the time out to even get to know me. But you introduced me
to people who otherwise I wouldn't have got to know that. Have inspired me, put me in places, and did a lot of things for me, man. So I want to just
say thank you. It's bigger than every word that's been said. You know, one will be able to comprehend what united players
really are. Even MISTER Lacey
who talked we were in 111 taylor street. I didn't I didn't really too much care for him. We were
in usc, usf going through pace
program. I still didn't really too much care for him, but it wasn't until I met him at upn. I
said, wait a minute, let me take a different look at this, brother. And when he said, thank you to me for the law that I changed to help him get out, I
knew it was bigger than what I felt about people. Amen. It's about the people and what they do and the chances that, like,
we don't know who a person are because we judge them by they
they cover, they skin, they record. But when I saw him with
up, I already knew he was a star. So our relationship changed. And then, like even till now, I beg for a living in
order to live in san francisco.
But when roy butler, who lost
his wife recently. Right. He's a legend. Yes, he is. And when
nobody was donating to him like
he should never have to work a day in his life, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have went to court and won my freedom along with 1200 other people, youth
offenders. Right? So I beg you to give him some money. And you
did. That's how powerful up is. Even when you're down and out, the down and out will come to rudy and up and say, hey, I know somebody who's even worse off than me. Can we help that
person? And that's what the brotherhood of up is about. It don't matter if I couldn't eat today, I'll give my last crumb
to the person who is even more hungrier. You know what I mean? That's what you inspire and I've
said it to you and I'll say it before everybody. You're the perfect person to be the executive director of united
players. What's up player I appreciate them and thank you for the kind words. You know i love taking on that title. GOD
gave me united real players. And in my book, man, that's what you
is player. So can I take a picture of you real quick? It
cost you $5. Man I, I need the
money right here on three, one,
two. Look at you smiling like bullwinkle. I love you, homie.
For sure. Oh, brother number nine. Thank you guys so much for
having us. And we got to go pick up the kids. Yes. And hold on, rudy. You don't you don't get to
walk away that easy. Oh. Where I'm from we say what's
understood doesn't have to be said. That's right. But there's
been so much that has been said about you and the work and what you guys stand for here today.
And I also just wanted to acknowledge, you know, as someone who migrated here to san
francisco, you know, rudy opened up his arms to me and said, as long as you're about doing the
work in our communities, we got you. And I really just wanted to
share with folks. I was actually looking up. Tomorrow we have a peace rally that's actually taking place at thurgood marshall academic high school.
And this is the third year that that we've been doing it. And just doing it alongside other folks who are doing the work. So I wanted to lift up dame and
what he's doing at us for us. Corey monroe, valencia, raymond, john henry, folks that are going in and talking. That's right. Talking, talking to our young folks and toriano what he's been doing with the war against guns MARCH. You know, there are
things that are going on. And as long as I'm in this role, you
know, rudy, I want to make sure that we utilize this platform to highlight what we know is going on in our communities, straight up and down. Besides all the
negative attention the media has given, work that's being done, there's real work and life changing that's being done here in san francisco, and you're a part of that. I just want to say thank you. Thank you'd. I appreciate it, man. Respect to you guys. And I would say there's something in the hetch hetchy water because we are san
franciscans and I don't know if people have seen the film called
gotham the fall and rise of new
york city. So it was screening, and the people who organized the
event wanted to see if there were lessons to be learned that we could bring to san francisco, to bring it back to its
vibrancy. So I told this woman, you know, I said, I want it to be like when I grew up. And she said, well, we're not here for nostalgia. But you know what? People should feel safe. People should be able to go to any neighborhood and someone shouts out to you, asks about your mom and dad, your grandparents, your siblings. That's the kind of san francisco I want back for the kids to be able to grow up and feel a part of a large
community, you know? And I'm not going to get all political because I can't because we're in the people's house. But, you know, district elections sort of started fragmenting our city. We
are one big city. We're one big family, and we embrace
newcomers, people who want to relocate and live here. It's an
expensive place. So we got to be a community, helping one another. So thank you for what you do. And thank you for bringing everett. Jason, just,
you know, just all the work that
you do and hopefully step at a time. We change, you know, the
paradigm of what's going on here in our city because we can do it. It's san francisco. That's right. Thank you julie. Thanks for having us. GOD bless you
all. Thank you. So do we have any public comments for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line? Item three presentation by rudy corpus. Please approach the
podium when it is free. MR. Phil. Have a good day guys. Okay,
sorry, I've been here only 20 years, so it's true they beat me, but okay. The only problem we have here is that you seem to still be confused between
reality and fiction. You see, it's like a movie. Like so
hollywood. You are fine. But we
are not in a fiction anymore.
Everybody. Now I'm here to inform you that everybody is
under arrest. You warned me last
time. I think the charge is
violation of the eternal rules
of existence. For too long, no matter the miseducation you received. And we are all the victim of it. I'm under arrest too. But I know why I'm telling you now. Because you can bail
yourself out. Children are under
attack. Different ways. No
escape. You can't bail yourself out. First off, of course, if you kill somebody, it's over.
It's valid for everybody in the
world. If you contributed to
affect children's health.
Walking on eggs here, you don't
tell kids to wear masks. First
of all, sorry it is not allowed
to inject anything in anybody's
body, especially children. So
what's going on? You need to raise the level of thinking it
goes through responsibility and
critical thinking to change things. It's coming step by
step. I'll speak again. Thank
you. Good afternoon y'all. One of my favorite days of the month. Again appreciate you
guys. Excuse me. Sorry. Appreciate you guys again.
Coming to nlds for that town hall speaking with you guys
again. The opportunity most one of the most important, you know, conversations we can have obviously is where we bridge that gap between community and the work. You guys do. So much appreciated. From the latino
task force. And I just wanted to
add, you know, I had to let rudy know before he left, kind of some of the things I was going
to say. But, you know, we've had gun violence impact us down from my grandfather. You know, that's how he passed away. My father's generation, our generation, you know, me being a victim of
violence as well. So just the work that he does is just so impactful. And during times of crisis, rudy was definitely one
of the phone calls that we made. So yeah, just wanted to highlight just really how important rudy is. How big you
up is mischa just the whole
organization. Just wanted to add
to that. Thank you guys. And
next agenda item calling line
item four. Inspector general report informational item inspector general terry riley
will report on the monthly activities of the office of the
inspector general, including
police, fire, sheriff, memorial, mass, county jail, food
inspection, mission district, town hall, meeting and end of the year findings and recommendations to be discussed
at a future meeting. All right.
Well, that, of course, is a very
tough act to follow. You know,
listening to rudy and the united
players and the impact that they've had, it was it was interesting that when he started off, he said they were it began
at balboa high school. And for
those who don't know me, I've got seven brothers, four sisters and all my older siblings, all
graduated from balboa high
school in the 1960s. And I think
some of the issues that were
going on when rudy was at balboa in 1994 was were going on back
in the 1960s to so but with that
said, it's a pleasure to be here
today, and I in my report, I'll
be sharing some of the things
that we've done in the month of
SEPTEMBER with the inspector
general's office. And as I was saying, as it was said, where it began with us paying our
respects to police, fire,
sheriff at the annual memorial
mass on the morning of SEPTEMBER
8th, PRESIDENT Sue and I
attended the 76th annual san francisco police, fire and
sheriff memorial mass at saint
cecilia church to honor public
safety officers who passed away
this year. It was a very solemn
reminder of the dangers that are
inherent in public safety work
and the ultimate sacrifice many
first responders make to protect others, you know, and while the role of the inspector general's
office is to sometimes be
critical of law enforcement
agencies, you know, our aim is
always to improve the san francisco sheriff's department,
and it does not diminish the
respect that I personally hold for the brave individuals who
keep our city safe. But that was
a great memorial and a very
moving memorial. And I don't
know, I felt the same way that day. I had similar feelings
listening to rudy talk about the
united players and the lives
that they've saved and at that memorial, you know, there are a
lot of first responders who put their lives on the line every
day. So both very emotional
events, you know, we've also
part of our role is we go and
inspect the county jail and one of the things that we did notice is that with each inspection and
having an opportunity to talk to the inmates, they all complained
about the food. So we thought it
wouldn't be a bad idea to go.
Actually taste it ourselves and see, okay, what is everybody
complaining about? And so we went to the san francisco county
jail and, and shared a meal, the
same food that the inmates eat on a daily basis. And I'll tell
you what, what we found, I
actually was pleasantly
surprised at the quality of the
food. Now, you know, it could
probably use a little seasoning, I think. I'm not going to say
that it doesn't need some seasoning, but the quality of
the food surprised me and it
included a fresh salad. The
chicken was dry. It needed a little seasoning, but it was it
was, it was, it was. It was very
edible. The carrots and the beans and the baked cornbread.
The baker that they currently
have at the jail is not doing a
bad job at all. So, you know, I
have to be honest that, you know, I hear the complaints. And then when I went and actually
ate the food, I was I was
surprised it was better than I thought it was going to be. And
so we really looked at three
things when we looked at the food. One, I really wanted to
see what is the level of food safety. And when I talk about food safety, I think it's
paramount that the that the food
is being prepared in a clean
environment. And, and so we took
a tour of the kitchen. I was
impressed by the cleanliness of
the kitchen, the meticulous
attention that was given to the
food storage. They took us to four different storage areas of
the food and all of the food had
expiration dates. So there was
really close attention paid to
the expiration of the food. And
there were real you could you
could see that there were strict
precautions being taken to avoid contamination of the food. So I
thought the food safety was was
at a very high level. Then we
looked at the nutrition, the
nutritional value, and it all had the kind of nutrition that
you would that I think one the law requires. But that you would
generally expect for the inmates
to receive and the taste and overall appeal. Again, the
chicken was dry and could probably use a little seasoning,
but but but very edible. The
carrots were fine. The cornbread
was great. The salad. I'll tell
you what the salad showed the salad showed that. And I think this goes for san francisco. And
anywhere where they're serving
food, that fresh food can make a
big difference in the quality of
the meal. So I will I was, you
know, I'd always like to see as,
as much fresh food served to the
inmates as, as as we could ever make available. But I thought
that the meal met all of the nutritional value, the quality
and the safety that it was being
prepared with. And so I was and
I also was impressed with the transparency because when we
walked into the kitchen, you
could look on the faces of the inmates that were preparing the food that they did not know. We were coming because I could see the surprise on their face. And
I was very, very impressed with
their dedication and the professionalism with which they
were doing their job. So overall,
I was I would say that, you
know, I would give the sheriff's department high marks and again,
that's that's not a comment on
on the taste of the food, but in every other aspect, I would give them high marks. And I also want
to express my gratitude to
deputy chief quantico and the
staff and the inmates staff of
the kitchen, because they really took us around and showed us everything. So it was very
encouraging to see. And they were all very professional. The
other thing we did of note was
we had our meeting with the
latino task force in the mission district. We had a mission
district town hall meeting on
SEPTEMBER 13th, and that town
hall meeting in the mission
district was a very moving,
passionate meeting. You know, I want to thank joanna hernandez,
who set who helped us set the
town hall up. And, you know, anyone who knows joanna
hernandez, she's very passionate about the latino task force, and she's passionate about everything she does. And so we
do want to express our
appreciation for her helping us
set it up. The discussion with
the latino task force was, was
intense. And what I really liked
about it was that, you know, you don't really understand what the
needs of, of a particular
community or group is unless
they let you know. And, and the latino task force, let us know
what what issues they had were
they wanted to would like to see
improvement in the system. It
was just a very, very good back and forth. They let us know what their frustrations and their
fears were with the system and I
thought we had a very, very
healthy exchange in, in the
meeting. And they also had
recommendations and to the point
where we want to do some follow
up with the latino task force, because we thought some of the
suggestions were very, very good
suggestions. And, you know, we want to talk more about it because we also think that some of the some of the suggestions
that they made that by working
together with the sheriff's
department would, would be helpful to everyone. It would be helpful to the sheriff's department, and it would be
helpful to the people who rely
on the services of the sheriff's
department. So, you know, I know
also that board member mango
guava, mango had suggested that
one of the things they do in los angeles is they do a report card
of the entities that they conduct the oversight over. And that was one of the suggestions
that came up at the latino task
force meeting. And so we're definitely, definitely going to
be having some more discussions about putting together a report
card type of, you know, I don't
know if we want to call it a program or our attempt at
reforms or any reforms that
we're attempting to make that we
do it in sort of a report card
or have a report card to, you
know, meet some of the goals
that we're setting and, and then have a report card on on how
we've done meeting those reforms
that we're attempting. So I would say that the meeting at the with the latino latino task
force was it was a very powerful
meeting. I came away. Very, very moved by the whole experience.
And they you know, this month is latino heritage month. And I went to the latino heritage
event here at city hall and it was the first time that I had saw members of the latino task
force since that meeting. And, you know, when I left the
meeting, I couldn't tell if they
were happy with me or angry with
me. But when I saw them at the
latino heritage event, I got so
much love from them and how much
they loved the. Meeting that we
had had. And so it was great. I
was really surprised and, and very, very happy with the with
the welcoming hugs that I
received from everyone. So yeah, but we will definitely be following up with the latino fast task force. And I would end
my report and it's more addressed to the board that I'd
like to propose that we at some point sit down and discuss how
best to present the overall findings of the inspector general for the past year and
establish some recommendations
that we can follow in terms of setting reasonable goals and
assess the implementation of
those goals and evaluate and
approve improvements in the
future. You know, I think that given our limited resources that
we've had to work with in 2024,
and they're not going to probably not going to improve
that much in 2025, I think it's
important that we focus our
discussions on the efforts that
we want to focus our, our, our
future efforts on where we can have the greatest impact as an
agency. And so I look forward to us having that discussion to see
how we can move forward. Thank
you. Thank you. I actually have
a suggestion for future town
hall meetings. I understand the next town hall meeting that we're going to have is going to be focused on pacific islander community. Is that still. Yes, that's my understanding. Right. Another major population that is
involved and impacted by the criminal justice system here in
san francisco. I think it would be really important that we have we have a very diverse board
here. And the reason is because we come from different communities with different cultures. And I think we should utilize the resources that we
have here and have people that
are from those communities lead those kinds of town halls. So
for example, the perfect person for the next one to be the
leader would be commissioner.
Commissioner monga. Right. She is part of the community. She
knows the community. There was a
lot of concern with the language. There was a lot of disrespectful things that happened at the town hall where I know that you have sanitized
it by saying it was intense, but
I had to apologize at some point to the latino community, and they accepted the apology and
they had to tell us to stop, you know, specific people, to stop talking and to listen to them
because they've heard the resume
5 million times. They're not. The point was not to talk about, you know, there's like
ourselves. It was to listen from community and particular
statements were incredibly, I
think, racist. Right. Straight
up I think we need to maximize
how we present to community by
having the people that are of the community, that know the culture that understand language
and implications and would be
able to. I think, really open
the door to having a powerful
exchange that is respectful.
Yeah. You know, I would say, you
know, commissioner carreon, I and I appreciate that you were
at the. That town hall and I,
you know, and I would say that
you know, your presence was a powerful presence. I mean, there's just no doubt about it.
And that you you're understanding of the latino
community. Was was very, very
clear and I don't disagree with
you. I think that commissioner
mango is the perfect person to
lead that that next. Town hall.
But I also think that you know,
among all of us, we're all there
and we're all trying to do the right thing, and we're all
trying to listen to. I see it as a this is an opportunity to
learn a lesson. Yes. That's what
I see it as. Yeah, I, I'm not here to cast stones. I'm here giving a proactive solution for
the future because I think we learned a lesson. And it's wonderful that we did. And you
have gone out of your way to, like, mend those relationships. And you see that result with the warm welcome and all of those
things. So you've done the work and I appreciate the I am grateful for you to do that. I just think we learned a lesson that I think is very important in this town hall. And my suggestion is moving forward. This is how we MAY want to
approach it. And, you know, maybe we just need to plan a little bit more for the town hall. That's all. Yeah, I think it was an excellent meeting
overall. I think we got so much
concrete suggestions. We got
ideas. We were able to listen.
We were also pushed back. And
that's a good thing. We need community to push back and say,
wait, wait, wait wait wait, stop. We want you to listen to. And that was a wonderful thing.
So I say those not to
necessarily critique, but to provide a forward thinking
solution. Yeah. So oh sorry. Go ahead go ahead, go ahead. I was
just going to say I appreciate
the leadership. But also I want to point out this is san francisco. So even if we have a particular community quote
unquote representative based on
ethnicity or whatever, that is
not necessarily the spokesperson for the entire community. Like I would look to vice PRESIDENT
Brewster. He's not asian, but I know that he's very close to the asian community. So I just want
to say that the allies come from different communities. And I would say that to the community,
when we do have the town halls,
I felt cut off at times and I
wanted to speak, and I will push back. I'm not the stereotypical quiet asian woman, but I'm trying to answer a question and
it's easy for to lose a train of thought. And when someone talked asked about the arraignments, I want to say there are possible creative solutions based on our
visit to ke three and wondering
if we could have arraignments at
the jails to alleviate the short
staffing and the time. So I also
want to it's also an honest time to actually correct
misperceptions, things that get
in the media. So I will push back and then, you know, when
they talk, when they talk about
when they talk about communities
that are silenced, it's not just one particular community. And so
I needed to turn to board member mango to talk about the pacific
islander community. That's way
overrepresented in the jails.
That doesn't get media attention.
And that is vastly disproportionate to the
population here. So I want to
look at all of san francisco, and it's not necessarily siloed. We had a full year where we didn't have successful town halls. And that's why I said we
need to go to the community, have them organize it, have it
in a set, a set place. I also
want to raise and I didn't get
to acknowledge the passing of
ted fang, who founded the community garden. So when we're talking about fresh food for the community, the florence fang
community garden in the bayview that's garnered national
attention and wants to be
replicated. This is san francisco, where we are crossing communities. So I don't want to be so siloed. And, you know,
when I mentioned that some members of the community task
force, when I told them that valerie tulley has known me
since I was a kid, that kind of made them push pull back a little bit and not be on the attack mode because valerie is kind of like the godmother of people. So I am about relationships, about san francisco. Not so much,
particularly with ethnicity. And
though I'm ethnically chinese-american, I can't say I
speak for all chinese americans
in the city. And so we do have connections. We have cross connections in different communities for those of us who,
you know, frankly, grew up here and I guess really quick, I just
want need to respond because I think I want to make it very clear allies do not say disrespectful statements or discriminatory statements or
racist statements. That's not a definition of an ally. My point is that we shouldn't be spokesman for people. I think that our spokespersons for a community based on who we are,
as me, as a queer woman, as a
latina person, as someone that comes from a different experience. We all have different experiences. We all
are who we are. I am not a
spokesperson for the all of the
communities that I physically, culturally represent, but what I
do know is that I'm not going to be disrespectful to community
and not listen to them to the point that they have to tell you
several times to listen to
listen, to listen, and to ask
that a community member, a
community member meeting, be led
by the community. They had to say that several times it was
out of line. And the thing is,
I'm not done. I'm not done. I
think this is a learning
opportunity. I came here, I didn't mention names. I didn't
mention comments. I gave a
forward thinking solution. I said it was an excellent meeting. I heard its lessons learned. What I haven't heard from you is an apology to the latino community. And maybe you
don't think that, but that could be because maybe you're not the ally that you think you are. And you know, there's tons of
different folks that can be a
resource to you if you don't want to engage in me because,
you know, you MAY have conflict or you don't like me or whatever, it doesn't matter. There's leaders. We have leader right here. We have a leader throughout. There are different
ways that that should have gone.
So I'm not here to say that we
are to be spokespersons. I think
we need to use the resources
that we have here and for all it could be one of us is not available, you know, like we don't have to be we don't have
to tag each other to it. So that's my main issue. It's
unfortunate that again, the
community specifically asked you to not be defensive. And yet here we are. So please take this
as a learning experience. That's all I'm saying. And then in the
future we can go I appreciate
you member. Carry on. I want to make sure we didn't over promise and I also wanted to let them
know step by step what we're
going to do. I have come up with
agendas for the entire year or
our benchmarks, and I expect to speak with the inspector general
on past commissions, how we've actually come up with things like a report card based on
community feedback. We have, what might be our short term goals, our long term goals,
goals. And then we also meet
things. Now I just want to say that every person here is an
integral part. And so I want people to be self-reflective and
introspective, to think about how much they actually put into this board. And so, you know, we're all busy people and that's
understandable. But if you cannot commit to a board, if you
minimally to attend the meetings, but to actually do the work,
then you also have to think about the community at large and whether or not you can fulfill
your duties. I don't think that's the point. Yeah, I think we're getting a little bit off track as far as I'm kind of concerned. And it's I think it's okay to have healthy dialog,
which we're having right now, but I hope, at least for me,
what I heard and what I hear as a member who lives in community and works in community, is just
being vigilant, being able to leverage the relationships that
folks MAY have in those areas to make things run a little bit
more smooth. I mean, I've been doing community work now for 13 years, and it doesn't matter what type of agenda, nine out of ten times is necessarily put together. Sometimes we can we
can tell how a meeting is going to go based off of questions that are being asked, and it
might get a little derailed, but having individuals who are there that have respect from elders and respect from folks in those communities can sometimes help
deescalate things. So I'm happy
on both sides that we're doing
more, because I think about the first town halls where we had two people who were in the audience or town halls where we had nobody in the audience. So, you know, now that we're having folks come out making sure that it is a space and a place for community to share whatever it is that they do want to share. And we're human beings, and we
have an opportunity and right to also get defensive at times when things are being shared. And I wasn't allowed to be there. And
the only thing I did want to add
to what member carreon was saying is, is definitely making sure that we get things posted much quicker for members of the
public, just so we can have we
can have the majority of members who do want to attend, because I
know we never want to. You know, I think by default, I mean, this is what I've always insisted on by default, we should post things because I don't want to
be the one to pick and choose or exclude somebody. So we did have another unexpected member, and
we actually, you know, set far apart. We didn't discuss any business. I mean, that's the whole point. But I think that it's just really important for everyone to attend whatever they
can attend. Absolutely. And i think, you know, also us not
having to think about if we are
violating an act would make it a little bit easier. So I just
agree, as much as we can not to give dan more work to just get things posted as early as we
can. Like once we know you know what's taking place. But I definitely, absolutely agree. I
think every single member here
probably has access to a
different area of the city, or has relationships in one
district more so than in the other. So being able to really
leverage folks relationships, I think is what I was really is what I was hearing. And I think it's a great idea that does allow and relieve some take some stuff off of other folks plates. Right. It's not an easy feat to run or be the PRESIDENT Of any
board or commission. And so when
we can go to different districts where folks have relationships
allowing that individual to lean
in a little bit more, I think
can alleviate some of that. But yeah, I'm looking forward to the
to the next town hall. It was interesting enough. I literally was sharing with member amanda. I was like, oh, we should do one. And then we're doing one.
Yes. Yeah. And then and then I think, you know, reverend amos brown, he did a beautiful
service for ted fang and his family. So I am thinking that maybe the third baptist church
might be a good place to host the next meeting. Yeah. You know, I just want to say one
thing because I don't want this to go unsaid. That because it's
this. It's really my fault.
Because commissioner carreon,
you know, the you had to be. you'd have to be blind not to see that as soon as you started talking, you could see the
connection with you and the latino task force, and you
zeroed right in. I love my people. Yeah. And you could see
it. You could see that you zeroed right in on the issues
and, and I we really appreciate
that because I thought that you
took it, took it, it could have gone off the rails and you brought it right back on, on
track. And but I also just want to end by saying that one of the
things out of all the town halls we've done, I enjoyed that one the most because of the
pushback, because they gave
serious pushback. And I was like, okay, I'm loving this. Yes,
because they had great
suggestions. They gave a lot of pushback. And sometimes, you
know, we like to think things
are going great. And you know, that town hall said, well, okay,
wait a minute, we got some work
to do with this particular community. So that's why I
enjoyed it so much, because I
walked away feeling like, okay,
there are things we need to do
that can make us have a stronger
presence in the community and a more productive presence in the
community. So yes, I do. Yeah,
we will be better. Yeah, yeah.
And I and I think that will that that is going to make us a
stronger group in the community
by what we learn that that day.
So. Yeah. That's good. We learned something. Yes.
Blessings before blessings I
always say I want to talk about
the food. I think I'm out of
people on this panel. I'm a connoisseur of jail, food,
prison food. And so I was
pleasantly surprised to hear my brother say that it wasn't bad.
I guess it's an acquired taste.
I acquired it and then lost it,
you know? But I've seen people make magic out of prison food,
so what I want to say about the
food in prison, in jail,
particularly the sheriff's department, knows that I've,
I've raised issue with it being on the san francisco jail.
Justice coalition. I'm fairly
new, but I am a now. I've given
up soul food for neo soul food.
And what I mean by that is even
when it looks good and it tastes
good, it MAY not be good for you.
I don't go to mcdonald's. I
don't go to taco bell, not because it doesn't taste good.
And I don't remember my childhood. I just know what's in
the food. I know that the food
that we are served as americans
is not served by the same
corporations around the world.
There are poisons, toxins,
killers in some of the food that
we sell in our stores. I'm not saying that's what they sell, that they serve in jail. I'm just saying that I know what's in american food. If you look at
the stickers when you go to the store and it doesn't have a nine
on it, it's poison. If it has a
4 or 3, a six, a eight, when it starts with those numbers, there's something wrong with it.
You shouldn't eat it. That's my that's my opinion. That's my opinion. The nines are good,
right? So what I'm saying, when
it comes to the food and jail, which the sheriff's department knows that I'm an advocate of changing the vendor and what's
being served. These people are captive audience. They don't get a chance to go outside of their
front door and go buy their
food. So they are relying on us
to give them healthy choices, whether they like the taste of
it or not. And trust me, it does
need seasoning. I wish I could have had some hot sauce and some
seasoned salt while I was there,
but hey, so what I have learned
is that healthier choices,
especially in the canteen, you
have so much processed, sugary
foods for them to and let me say, I'm the last person to say
don't eat no sugar. I've just
recently pretty much tried to cut that complete out of my diet. Sugar is one molecule away
from being cocaine. If you
didn't know one molecule from being cocaine. And we all know
what cocaine is, right? So the
food that they even have in
their choice of buying, spending, their family's hard
earned money on, it's not good. And we need healthier choices. And you'd be surprised what
isn't good food that we intake on a daily basis. So I'm not
saying that what you ate wasn't
good or that it wasn't served properly, or the kitchen wasn't clean and all of that, I. I agree that those those things
probably were true. What I want to focus on is when we are
detaining people, until we are able to prove if they're innocent or guilty, we should be
as concerned about their health
as we are about a newborn baby.
Right? Because they're in our care. They're in our care. They
cannot do for themselves. And no matter what you feel about people that are in jail or even in prison after that point, they
do not deserve to die by food. They're not sentenced to die by
food. There's nowhere in the law
you can correct me if I'm wrong. I'm on a panel with some attorneys. There's nowhere in the law that you are sentenced
to die by what you are served in
captivity. So I don't want to belabor this, but I really want
to put it on the minds of the
board in the, in the in the
sheriff's office and in the jail,
that what is being served in there is high in carbohydrates,
which is not good for the body, what's being served in there?
And no offense to anybody that likes white rice, but the best rice is black or wild. It's
natural. It's better for you.
The salad, which I try to eat as much as possible. When I was in
there, is not at the levels of
which it should be. The I know we love some of our beans. I love some refried beans, but that is not the most healthiest protein that you can serve someone incarcerated. And I can
go on and on and on and on. We won't even mention the desserts, the cookies. We won't even
mention you know, the beverages
that are powder chemicals that
you mix with water. We should
just take a look. I know some vendors. I know some people who
are willing and ready to serve a
healthy diet that not only meets, but exceeds the standard in
which it's set for what's inside of jail. And I hope that we can
take this serious and really look deep into it and make the changes that is necessary. So, member palmer, I'm going to have you work on the food thing. I
saw you chuckle as inspector
whitely was making the report,
and I just kind of could figure out what you were thinking like. And I thought to terry like it
was okay. It was actually
pleasantly good. And I'm thinking, but would you want to
eat it day after day after day? And then you're reaching out to me when you're, like, white rice. Well, I don't always eat white rice. But you know what? White rice is actually healthier than brown rice because the chemicals are are on the on the
husk is washed away as opposed
to brown rice. So the point is,
and I'm going to go back to my resume because I'm an asian woman and people don't believe
me. If I don't say it. But I served on the hospital board at saint francis memorial hospital for nine years as a fiduciary trustee. So we also had our
foundation and community events
or community funding to like,
redo boedecker park in the tenderloin and then to talk
about food and nutrition. So as
I was hearing more about the food, I thought about a cal
graduate, and she has done an
application where they're able to take excess food, fresh
fruits and vegetables, and parcel it to institutions. I mean, if we visit our hospitals anywhere, institutional settings
in our nation, we serve the crappiest food. No wonder people feel horrible after surgery because they're fed like apple juice. And all this sugar. It doesn't make any sense. We have an epidemic of obesity, not just
in our country, but around the
world. You know, it doesn't help to tax sodas a little bit more. But kids should not be fed
sugary drinks. People whose
genetic genetic makeup, you
know, that predisposes them to
particular conditions should not be having all this processed food. The filler and the soy.
And it's poison. The eu is a
whole lot smarter. Cosmetics and food. They've banned particular substances. But and the american
companies cannot sell it with those substances. So our
companies know what to do. They
just don't do it here. And you know, part of it maybe is the politics. You know, people want to get reelected, so they don't want to stand up to these manufacturers. But people need
to eat organic food. But even the organic label, there's a
whole lot of leeway. And that's why I'm really proud of that community garden in the bayview. And that's what we should be leading more, you know, gardens
and schools. And then the whole
parcel of land, you know, this is something to think about with ck three. Again, it's funding.
But I think overall when people
think about health, it actually
saves money in the long run. If you keep people healthy, we're
going to spend less money on health care as a as a society. So speaking of that, I'm sorry.
And speaking of that, there is a
direct correlation between food
and mental health as well. When
you give cocoa puffs and
whatever cereal to your child and then send them to a school building to sit in a chair for
umpteen hours, you think he's not going to be bounced or she's
not going to be bouncing off the walls like we can go on forever. But I want to say that our food can be a healing source as well. And the food that's being served to captive audiences are not
healing. You don't have a better
chance at representing yourself
in a court of law when your mind
is not being fed what it needs to be fed, so that you can be sharp and focused. I did not release myself from prison, nor jail this last past time because
I was not healthy, I was sharp,
I knew, I knew how to fast, I
knew what to eat. I knew what to do. Even in the limited resources that they gave me. I
want to really express that I
lost my train of thought for a second, but I really want to
express that the food, the food
revolution is real and I can't present anything this coming
week. This coming month in our next session. But I would like
to be put on the agenda that, if
not myself, if I if I'm
depending on the rules to be able to afford someone to come
in and, and present what food
really is and I want, oh, this
is what I want to say to I went
in this last time I spent five months in. Right. We all know
what that was. I went in at around 190 pounds. I was actively in the gym. I was actively on my diet. I'm very
healthy and conscious. That's pretty much evident. Probably
you could see when I got out, I
was over 25 pounds heavier than
I went in this was. This is including exercising on a regular and daily basis. And
once I returned to my original
and diet for my body and my melanin content, I lost 20
pounds in about 14, 15, 16, 18
days. Like that's how quickly I shed it. What I gained in five
months. And so it just goes to
show what you intake will also determine the outcome of what
you do in life. Inspector
general, you had a follow up. Yeah I would just end by saying that. So what we did is, is
after, you know, we tasted the
food and I felt that the, the
best dish on, on the, on the plate was the fresh salad, which
just kind of reiterated our
feeling that if there is a way that we can incorporate more
fresh foods into the diet, diets
of the inmates, it would make a big difference. So we inquired
as to when is the contract up? And so the sheriff's department
is currently in, in in a one
year contract with aramark. And
while they're in the while
they're in the midst of that contract, one of the things that
we would like to do is research, just as commissioner palmer just
stated, what are some of the
fresh food options that are out
there that that when they come
up for the new contract that the
city and county of san francisco
should maybe take a look at of incorporating into the diets of
the inmates. And so we're, we're we're going to be actively working on that. And we would
welcome commissioner palmer's
input in that process. So it
will be ongoing. It wasn't meant like we're going to do one presentation because we haven't even delved into health. I had this whole, you know, how I've been harping like, we need someone from the department of public health. So I will be working with chief ju and twisting arms, and you need to
appear before us because we want to talk about the overall spectrum of health that also, like you said, talks about
behavior, outlook and food makes a difference. I mean, I did stories on astronauts. I mean, your mental health is not good when you can't get the food that you want. And, you know, most of our neighborhoods and vice PRESIDENT Brookshire knows this
right in our most underserved neighborhoods, we have food
deserts. So it makes a difference if we at least have community gardens more focused
on on fresh fruits and vegetables. So I'm sorry, vice PRESIDENT Burger. No, you're
okay. I just wanted to say thank you to william for making sure
that we did speak on that in terms of the inspector general
bringing it up. And I do hope
that we take it seriously. The fact that there have been
complaints, regardless if we're tasting the food, we're trying the food, we're cooking it ourselves. If it's being
complained about by a group of individuals, it should be something that we take seriously. I just want to make sure it's on on our agenda, or at least on the inspector's report. You know, as we continue
to move forward, I also want to
say thank you to the ig. My niece is in fourth grade, and I don't even want to taste cafeteria food. I just think that our palates have changed and developed over time. So being able to talk to individuals that have lived
experience and the folks that that we are, that are in our
care just make sure that that we are listening. And I think to PRESIDENT Sue's point, as we
look at overall health, looking just at food is something
specific that we can do and begin to take immediate action
on while we're looking at the overall health. So I just want to make sure we highlighted that and really push member palmer, you know, forward in terms of,
you know, looking into this for
us, good food doesn't have to be more expensive. It's not our ethnic markets. Things are less expensive. It's fresher than if you went to your chain stores. And I want to just add to that. Changing the menu will save the
sheriff's department's budget because you will spend less on
medication. You would spend less on emergency alarms because
people are going to be less violent. I'm not saying this to
say like, I'm just saying this like it's a it's scientifically fact. If we change the diet of the people inside, they will change their behavior as well.
And there is a correlation with
high blood pressure, weight
gain, sugar, diabetes. I can go on inside institutions, not just
san francisco jail, but inside the institutions of america,
period. And in my last point is,
if you looked at the trash can, it's filled with food. That's being wasted in the jail. So if
we can stop wasting food, if we
can stop having to use medication outside of the food,
if we can stop there having to
be other things that happen because of the food that's
causing, we're going to save money for the sheriff's department. You know, we could spend that money on something else. More of this, more of that. And so, yeah, I look
forward to and vice PRESIDENT, I don't know if you remember during our visit, what was kind of shocking is that some of the
people at that same who were talking about the special diets,
they were on, so those who are diabetic or had special dietary
needs, they saw the same kind of
food. But then the chicken was cut up into extra pieces, and it's not the protein that's causing the diabetic problem. It'd be the carbohydrates and all that other stuff. So that was eliminated. But they said
there was no reason to. I guess, mutilate. Maybe it's too strong of a word. The piece of chicken to serve, to be served to those who are on diabetic diets. So.
And I said, well, maybe that was their way of marking the particular food, but they could have little toothpicks with
little flag or something, or different colored tray to serve it on. So that was even, I think, more disheartening to
find that someone who's on a special dietary need got even
more inferior food. I believe
there's a person that wants to do public comment. Yes they
have. I have some questions I'd like to ask the inspector
general about his presentation, if I MAY, before we take public comment. Okay. Thank you for the presentation. You know, you
mentioned that the food met all nutritional values. What nutritional values were you
referring to? Well, you know, I
assume that the law requires
that if you're serving, whether you're in a hospital or a jail,
that there's certain nutritional
goals that the that the, the
food is supposed to meet. And
there was nothing. And now, of course, I didn't have a chart in
front of me or anything of that
nature, but it had all of the
different food groups and the
assumption is that it met the nutritional value that's
required by law. Okay. Thank you
for clarifying that. I was in
here last meeting. So I watched, but I watched your excellent
presentation. It seems like you've done a lot of outreach in the jails and identified a lot
of issues in the community
meetings and the jails. I think the board would benefit from you making written reports to us,
identifying what those issues are, so we can know what
progress you make on them, which
ones we might want you to focus on, because only a limited
number of people accompanied you on that visit, a limited number
of people are at the community meetings. I think those that's
information that should be in writing that we should have. We'll have a record of it and I applaud you for doing that. But I, I think we'd really benefit from a written record. Yes. So
what we talked about as an organization, what would be the
most effective way to, as a new
agency, what would be the most effective way to communicate the progress of the agency to both
the board but also the community.
And so we decided that a
newsletter would be a good way
to communicate what's going on
with the inspector general's
office. And so and I and I
appreciate you requiring or
asking us to do a written
report, but I also assume that you've been reading the
newsletter that I have read every issue. And if you look at if you read the newsletter, the newsletter gives you a pretty
comprehensive report of what
we've actually been doing,
including photographs and
everything that the inspector
general's office has been doing
in terms of outreach, the
inspections of the jails. And we've also been reporting both the positive and the negative in
those newsletters. So we haven't really put out like a formal
written report because we think
for purposes of the public, we don't think that they'd really consume that and that we're trying to put the reporting of
the agency in the form that is a comprehensive communication to
both the board, but more
importantly, to the community,
because, you know, at the end of the day, it is the community
that the, the, the inspector
general's office was created to conduct oversight of the sheriff's department on behalf
of the community. And so I think it's just it's important that
the medium that we choose to
communicate to the community, to the community, at least at the beginning of this new agency, that it be in a form that they're going to consume. And we
just think that if I'm a community member, if I'm a community member, I am much more
likely to want to read a
newsletter than a than a three
page written report. But we have
no opposition to also putting that in the form of a written
report to the board. So I was going to say it was also the brainchild of a member of mango,
and she also worked a lot on our annual report from last year so
that it's more digestible and so that the public can actually
comment and engage our board,
and we can gauge how we're
doing. So the newsletters really serve as the ongoing report
card. And so I would really want people to focus because I called
things from the newsletter. But most of the time, I mean, I'm always in constant contact with the inspector general. And
that's how we kind of come up
with our quarterly reports. But down the road we MAY have something more formal, but down the road, you know, we will have an annual report and I don't want to comment on whatever
interim recommendations there are unless it's adopted by the
full board, and that we are
looking at a full report card going on a dashboard. So will
the next report include all the specifics of the issues that
were raised at the recent town
hall meeting? We can't put one
together. Well, the yes, we can
do that if that is what the
board is requesting. But we will
also we can be more specific in
terms of some of the issues that
were raised at the town hall. I think it would be very helpful. You mentioned that we decided the best way to communicate this would be through the newsletter. When you say we who you were, were you referring to myself and
my staff, which is dan, which is
what dan no, dan and marshall
kind. We sit down and discuss, well, you know, what is the best format and we also looked at the suggestion that was made by
board member mango. But, you
know, I also am not a neophyte
in this business. And I bring 33 years of experience within the
criminal justice system. So I'm a big part of that decision.
okay, so I'd like to comment
too. I think the newsletter is a very easy to read. And, you know, there's different mediums where you can convey that
information. There's a text message, speak, email, speak, professional speak, and to
convey the information that you do with the newsletter. I think the community is very receptive
to it. I've read it. I think it's great. Yeah. And the
feedback that we've gotten from the community has been just
very, very good. A very good
response from the community. And I've also personally given feedback. I don't want the inspector general to spend more time doing reporting where he
can be out in the community. And
if I ever need anything formal,
he'll hear from me sometimes at
10 or 11 at night. Yes. Well, I would like to see more specificity in written form rather than just saying it here, because I think that creates a record and the newsletter is
good, but I think it's primarily
public facing and, you know, I think this board needs to know a
little more about the details of the issues you're hearing about
when you go to the jail, so we can evaluate which ones we want to focus on. I think because
you're acting as our eyes and ears when you go there and we have a somewhat different interests than just the general
public. And I will push back a little bit on that, because I think that what we are hearing
on our jail visits have been exactly what we've been
responding to. As I've said on
every visit, inmates complained about the food. So we went and
tasted the food. On another
visit, inmates complained about
the bedding. We took that up with the sheriff's department and the sheriff's department, pulled all the blankets in the
jail and washed them. The next day. So we are specifically
reporting to you everything that
we are observing and taking in
in our jail visits. And I would say that some of the things are resolved almost immediately. So I think it would take longer to
write up particular reports. And that's why when I even say that there was a general consensus that things were handled, that
means that I'm not hearing from
chief zhou or people were not
bombarding his office because
once a community concern was raised, chief zhou, the
inspector general, will take care of it right away. So I'm confident that along the way,
things get taken care of there. You know, there are longer issues and deeper issues that we're going to delve in. You know, the health issue and then later on policy, use of force,
that kind of thing. But on some of these day to day things, when we did the visit, there was one
gentleman he needed language assistance, and he had a deep
concern. So the inspector general had the deputy who could serve as an interpreter. They
went to the side and had one of
the investigators take down his information, do notation, and
then do follow up. So that's the kind of thing that we were
looking for and hoping how an inspector general would handle
things. So I'm I'm pleased with it. And turn it over to you, vice PRESIDENT. No. And I'll be very brief, because I know we
have members of the public that want to speak because I actually am okay. I think with a report, I think maybe what we do is agendize an opportunity and time to talk about the ig's report, because I think something that maybe comes out quarterly, that's a deep dive that responds. I don't think it needs to be every single meeting, but, you know, something that's quarterly or maybe bi monthly. I'm even thinking about me and
my role. I have to report to my board bi monthly with an actual written report, speaking specifically to matters of the board. Right. So and I think it
would be a matter of teasing out what is in the newsletter. That's just more pertaining to
qualms and challenges that we hear at the board that we feel
like we can face. So I think we can I would I would be absolutely for that and probably something we can agendize, which
is why I agree with that. I'm not opposed to us presenting a
report at all. We have to do it
in the annual. So yeah, I would have you work more. I think you
should give us quarterly written reports, which will be
incorporated verbatim into our quarterly reports, because you should be able to speak in your own voice and not be filtered
through the board, because the independence of an inspector general is really one of its most important qualities. So
you've jumped into it and you've looked at things and made some recommendations, and I think those should go into our quarterly reports, as you have seen them and spoken about them. i do have a couple of other
questions. At what at what point
will you be deciding whether you'll accept the judgeship in
alameda county? Probably at the end of the year, I'd make a
decision on that. But, you know, I don't know if it's relevant to the meeting right now. So if we
can, when is the deadline for
that? Well, yeah. I don't know
if this is the appropriate venue to have those. It's not on the agenda. If you're going to be leaving, I think we should know in the community. Remember, I
just want to focus on this one particular area that we have, the inspector general report. And then we do have a very patient member of the public wanting to speak. So I'm going
to recognize her. Well, I do have another question. I wanted to go to your report last month. Congratulations on getting the accreditation from the
association of inspector general. Glad you're reaching out to other professional organizations. Just want to ask, when you and I met in JANUARY, I gave you name and contact information for many people in the oversight community. Have
you contacted any of them? I've
had a few meetings scheduled and
for example, I had a meeting
scheduled with the sheriff of
new orleans. Pardon me, new
orleans, new orleans. And the day that we were supposed to have the meeting, I think there
was a hurricane or something in new orleans, and she wasn't able to make it. We then rescheduled
that meeting, and then at the very next meeting, something
else came up and she wasn't able to make that second meeting. And
so I've made attempts. But, you
know, I've also met with the
current PRESIDENT Of naco, and
we've had a long discussion on
oversight and his personal
experiences with oversight. Other than susan hutson, the
sheriff of new orleans, have you attempted to contact any of the other people on that list really quick, or do you also mind can you share that list with the
rest of the board members as well, too? Because I think I think it would behoove us I'm just just really quickly I'm thinking if we're asking yes, that would be great, because I think if we're asking the ig who
reports to the entire body and he's having meetings with individuals, it'd be nice for us to know so that we can prioritize as well, too. Yeah, he and I met before he even assumed his duties. He wasn't
even on. No, I just I would like
to just know who's on. I'm sorry. So, so sorry. I contacted you really quickly. This is outside the scope of the agenda item. Wait, wait, wait. I have the floor, and I've asked the question. So member wechter, I just want to focus on what was
in the report. So I don't want to deviate anywhere. This can be
for when we get to future agenda items, but we're outside of the scope right now. And now I'm going to recognize public
comment for members of the public would like to make public comment on line item four inspector general report. Please approach the podium when it is
free. My name is lucero herrera. I'm the interim site director at the young women's freedom center. I'm also an advocate for san francisco participatory defense, co-founder of sister warriors, and also a member of the latino task force. I'm
really just here to talk about
the women who I represent inside the cj two, which I already have spoken about it in SEPTEMBER 17th town hall. I know you went
to the man and had one meal, but what would it look like to have multiple of meals? Because that's not what people get on
the inside. A lot of women are advocating that they don't get hot meals in the morning, and that's the issue. I think we got to do better of how we meet our women halfway, which they don't get the support or the advocacy while they're incarcerated. Someone who was formerly incarcerated at a point in my
life as well. And I'm just advocating for the people on the inside. On the SEPTEMBER 17th, town hall, we are also advocating about a death that happened inside cj two, a young person by the name of amonte
haley. And I just want to bring
up that we got to it got to be everybody's job to do better of how we put the narrative of young people or people who are dying inside the jails to ensure that incarcerated individuals receive the mental care that
they need when tragedies occur,
community based organizations providing programing inside the jail should allow to offer emotional support for those who are incarcerated and the
overcharging, excessive sentencing of black and young brown people inside the institution provide proper
resources and services to support young people on the
inside. I also want to talk about like demands and the kind of accountability for death.
Hold those responsible accountable for the deaths of the individuals who are in the
care of the carceral system to ensure independent and transparent investigation into
every death that occurs within the carceral system, and provide justice support for the family of those who have died while in
custody, including access to legal resources and restitution. Implement systemic changes to
prevent further loss of life within the carceral system, and focusing on improving conditions, mental health, and alternatives for incarceration. I'm here to advocate for the
people on the inside who don't
get advocacy, that don't get the support they need. They don't get the healthiest meals on the inside. And also, canteen is a
problem. Women shouldn't be drinking water out of faucets. They should have fresh, clean water, clean air. And these are the things that I'm here to advocate for. As someone who did
time in jail to someone who goes inside and do programing on the
inside, we got to do better as a whole here as a committee. It
shouldn't just be palmer's job to talk about the food. It should be everybody's jobs here to change the food and the conditions of the inside. So I'm just here to advocate. And really, if you could reach out to me, I work at the young women's freedom center. I'm open
to solutions and not just reform to make it better, but really
look at the issues on the inside
to really get freedom for people and really look at that justice
of the inside. So I'm just here to speak on behalf of that.
Sorry if I was standing here. I'm pregnant. I had to use the bathroom. I didn't want to MISS My public comment as well. So I really want to just advocate for the people on the inside. And would you leave your contact information for our secretary so I can so I can personally reach out to you and apologize for making you wait for so long. That's that's the other thing, too. You know, we have some
women who are pregnant or, you know, but they're of childbearing age. So nutrition
is even more important for women.
And that was one of the reasons
why, when we spoke at the task
force, why I said that we want
to have more meetings with the latino task force, because there were a lot of people at that
meeting that had some real
valuable input. And so it's going to take more than one
meeting for us to kind of get down to the bottom of everything. That was raised. And
so you'd be someone that you know, we'd like to meet with in
the future and sit down and have a real discussion, because I heard it was a good meeting, but we really got to talk about the deaths on the inside. I don't want to throw that under the
rug. It has to be important that we have that conversation. And I
just said, we had a good meeting, but really talk about the issues that really takes
place on the inside for those for the men who are incarcerated and for the women, young women,
trans of all genders and gender nonconforming folks. Absolutely. thank you for your time. All
right. Thank you for being here.
After that, I'm leaving because for its perfect OCTOBER four,
4:00 pm. Fine. And fourth number. Right. Okay. So,
inspector general, inspect.
Okay. Ought to be simple. Yes.
You are under arrest. Okay. The
poison is in all food. You have
to understand. So I've got a solution. It's part of the. One of the things I give, it's going to be in in the packs here outside. One eighth of each park in the city is going to be to
grow food. We're going to put the city to the community's
ambassadors to work, be useful
in jail. They're going to grow
their own food. The best way to have good food first is not to
go to jail. All right. So now we got the solution. You're going to grow your food in jail.
Veggies, fruits, basics. You make the seeds everything you
need for it. The guys are going to love it because they're going to learn something. And when
they go out first, don't worry, they'll be fine, right? You need
ideas, okay? You are under arrest. Remember, the sheriff is
under arrest. You have to really
understand. So you need to learn
fast now or to find the solutions. And whoever is against works against. Keep
rocking against the eternal rules of existence, which I'm
going to clarify here. The basis of this eternal rules of existence is to do whatever in
your life focused on the emotional aspiration towards
beauty. That's it. You can't
fetch beauty. Don't try anymore.
Okay? The light intelligence, light. Otherwise you are a waste
of space. The skies don't like
it. You don't come back in
existence if you keep you. I
will explain more later. You have some answers there. Please. You pay attention after that. Remember how to bail yourself out of the situation. You put
yourself in. Thank you. Have a
great day. Thank you. Next
agenda item, please. Dan calling line item five. Sheriff's department oversight board 2024
q2 report discussion and
possible action item discussion
and possible action on the 2024
q2 report. Due to the sheriff and the san francisco board of supervisors pursuant to san
francisco charter 4.1 37b5
regarding zdob evaluations and
outreach and oig reports
submitted to the zdob. So,
colleagues, I just wanted to
sort of highlight that I am and I should be more clear, distinguishing the inspector general's report versus an
office of the inspector general
report. My position is until we have funding, we really don't
have an office and we have the
single inspector general. I was not an officer in the first
year, and I will take personal blame as a member for not pushing harder to actually use the money to hire people,
because we lost so much money by
not hiring at least another dan.
Because dan wears three hats and we applaud him. But it's unfair
to dan. It's overburdensome. And
then to have the department of police accountability also
extend themselves and we are forever grateful to marshal kind
paul henderson and their staff
for helping us with the budget.
But we find ourselves where we
are now. So my position that I
took when I made the drafts is that we don't really have the
inspector general report. That's why I highlight what the inspector general does and so
hopefully the mayor will take
note. The board of supervisors, who said they were supportive of
having some kind of budget with
us, will take note. And I don't
know I don't know how hopeful I
am for a DECEMBER some piecemeal
kind of dollars floating our way. It might not happen, although I hear from the state,
the tax intake was greater than
anticipated, so we apparently have $2 billion more in the
state than we want. So that might mean that I need to reach out to the governor's office. And can I get my ticket? Can I
get my ticket money back then since since they and then and then and then one of my allies in southern california, assemblymember reggie
jones-sawyer, who was my mentor on the platform committee, and
he has had worked on criminal justice issues. So I might be
begging him to help us find some
money. So am I speaking? I go
ahead, you go first. I was just
I was asking what are we able to
invite the mayor to come and
speak before us about this
issue? I it would have been nice before the election, but even after the election, could she come and. Well, we could.
Whoever, whoever is the mayor after the election or her
executive staff who helped make the decision not to have a
budget for us and expect us to fulfill our charter duties? I mean, if sheriff miyamoto could
come in person. Why, why, why can't the mayor come and in in
the PRESIDENT Of the supervisors
come and talk to us about why we don't have money for. We could
do that. Yeah. I mean, it's not against our rules to ask them. And if they don't show up, then that tells us what they think
about us, right. So. So we could have that. And dan, would you please take note. So we will issue the invitation for our
NOVEMBER meeting. Yeah. I have a question regarding the handouts. I see that there's like a one
page that is red line, and I see
that it says the second
quarterly report, which we're on
that particular agenda item. Who is this from? And is this the only one. Because I just see that for the third quarter, we
have the full document. So what
dan had sent out in the emails
is, is that these are comments from member wechter. So I think member wechter was and there's only just one page for the. Okay. I just wanted to add, I
think in the future I'd like it labeled on top because it just. Yeah, I agree with you. Member. Carry on. It gets a little confusing to have floating pieces of paper. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So the only difference between the two is that my version spells out in detail the recommendations that
inspector general wally made to the board of supervisors at that
meeting. So is that correct? I wasn't at the supervisor
meeting. That's why I just, you know, would like to find out
from inspector wiley. So I was
going to I just wanted to make a comment of I was going to integrate one sentence because
the recommendations that were
made were during the meeting, but that was before the sheriff
was able to speak to particular things. I do not want to. And
you know, as an attorney member and the documents speak for
itself. So I did not want to recharacterize what necessarily
what inspector general wiley was
talking about part of and with all due respect, member wechter,
some of this is commentary about the only way we're going to do
this and that. I don't think that belongs in a recommendation. That's not representative of what inspector
general wiley said. But one of
the recommendations he did have was to redeploy some of the people who were doing the
patrol. But sheriff miyamoto
made a clarification that those
deputies on patrol would not be assigned to the jails anyway because they are part of
emergency services. So that constitutes about 6 or 7
members. So that was sort of a clarification. And we as a board
did not adopt or decide whether
it was appropriate. So I want to just leave it as very general and maybe to add and to
synthesize what member wechter put in. We could just say the recommendations highlighted
problems from the well, no
problems from no. So as part of the report, you have my version and then you have member
rector's comments. And so I was just going to synthesize and
highlight that the recommendations actually
highlighted the system, not the systemic but the continued
problem of short staff and antiquated technology. And leave
it at that, because down the
road, we I anticipate that we're going to have formal recommendations written at the
end of the year. We as a board will adopt particular
recommendations, and that will go to the sheriff, that will go
to the city. And that's going to be our blueprint for the for the following year. I'd like to make a motion to adopt MADAM
PRESIDENT's version, a revised
version without the comments of
commissioner wechter, as she now described what she was planning
on doing. First motion. Is there
a second? Can I just want to ask quickly comment though? Yeah. Clarification. Just on that, because I thought I heard you
start to share that there was
one piece or one sentence I was going to synthesize once. So in in addition, I just wanted to
hear what that was going to be.
If we if we looked on page two.
And so let me just go paragraph
by paragraph. So let's see. Now
I'm kind of oh, do I even have the right page or it's okay. Just which which of the three I
was just, I was just going to I just presented some preliminary recommendations. So I kept the
things in there and let me just
see if I can find I thought if
we didn't, if we wanted to incorporate, we would incorporate one sentence because
I don't want to speak again.
It's meant to be very general, just like our minutes are very general. Yep. Did I misunderstand because I thought you were saying the sentence would be that the recommendations highlighted the
issues with technology. Yeah.
And that's and that's a synthesized. Yeah. That's the one sentence that you talked
about. Yes. You would be adding. Right. Yes. Okay. So synthesis I'd like to clarify something. I
took these almost verbatim from
the recording of the meeting. And inspector general wiley, are these an accurate reflection of the recommendations you made to the board of supervisors
meeting? They're the sentences
that you have here are much more conclusionary. I'm sorry. I'm much more much more conclusionary. Whereas, for
example, you say the only way and I don't recall being that
conclusionary. And I think the
point though, is that what MADAM
PRESIDENT has suggested is just
acknowledges that identifies the
issues without being providing
the specific or one one
particular conclusion, because
we can address those issues in multiple different ways, and we don't want to tie ourselves so
specifically in this particular document, because that's not its
role. And then and then it was a snapshot in time and it might not be on our recommendation
list at the end of the year. So if some things were addressed or there was a clarification made by the sheriff's office. So
something like that, with what
we didn't have full knowledge about how people were necessarily deployed to the tenderloin task force that I
didn't realize. And after all the training that we had, that they were part of emergency
services, so they in general would never be pulled in. So
I'll I'll second the motion.
Yeah. Okay. The last sentence there includes the recommendation regarding technology in the jail and cameras. It has nothing to do
with simon of deputies. And I
thought that was a very useful recommendation. And I don't see
why that shouldn't be included. I think we should be as accurate as possible in reporting what
was actually said. And your
version, PRESIDENT Icu says,
presented some preliminary recommendations. I didn't hear
him say, these are preliminary recommendations. I heard him say that he talked to all the
stakeholders to the sheriff's deputy union, to deputies, to
the sheriff, and that you did a
very exhaustive study, but he's
not done before making those recommendations. He's not done, though. Well, you didn't you didn't say they were preliminary. We're reporting on
a moment in time on what you said in MAY. This is the second quarter report. If you've done
more since then. Well, that can be in a subsequent quarterly report. But this should accurately report what you said
at the MAY board of supervisors
meeting. And if we don't if we don't do that, then I think we're cheating the public of an
accurate reflection of what happened. But it was still
preliminary because he got feedback from the sheriff at the time. At that particular meeting, when he actually drafted his comments to present
to the board of supervisors, he didn't have that piece of
information, and the sheriff was
actually there to make clarifications as well. So that's why I left it. And I didn't want to characterize
particular things as what was set in stone. As, you know, part of the priorities, it was information that he was presenting and again, it's still
something that I think we need to address. It's the recruiting,
the staffing shortage. And then
it's shameful that we don't have
technology to even run plates and driver's license when
they're out on patrol. And so that's something that we're talking about working with
either the cities it or I might impose more on. Vice PRESIDENT
Brewster, but to see what we can
do to actually use a single it
system from the police department, because we're all law enforcement, it doesn't make
sense. So. Sure. No, I was just going to say, general wiley, did you talk to the sheriff, get his perspective before you made your presentation to the board of supervisors? I've talked to him about a number of different
things. So his perspective on exactly what on the issues that
you raised, on the statements that you made at the at the board of supervisors meetings
were more in assessment of just
our observations in terms of some of our inspections. And let
me just let me interject really quick, really quick, because, I
mean, this is a report that's coming from this board in this
body, right? So I think that moving forward, the reports that
we're requesting from the ig, I think will dive into those specifics where we can have those some of those that we're
talking about. But I do want to make note, there has been a motion that's been put on the floor, and it has been first and second. Well, I think if we do not include the details, we will be shortchanging the public and depriving them. I think your point of representation, and it will undermine our credibility with the public. Your point is,
well taken. Yes. And as we call
the vote. Yes. And I was just one last thing as as with past reports, we've also inserted links oftentimes to go to the
original document. So can we get
a vote? Dan we'll do public comment first. Sorry I'm sorry.
Public comments for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line. Item five. Sheriff's department oversight board 2024 q2 report. Please approach the podium when
it is free. There appears to be
no public comment, so I'll call the calling the roll on the sheriff's department oversight

palmer I palmer is I PRESIDENT
Sue I sue is I member vector no
vector is no. We have five ayes and one no. The sheriff's department oversight board 2024
q2 report is approved. Next
agenda item please calling item six. Sheriff's department
oversight board 2024 q3 report discussion and possible action
item discussion and possible
action on the 2024 q3 report. Due to the sheriff and the san francisco board of supervisors pursuant to san francisco
charter 4.1 37b5 regarding sdof
evaluations and outreach and oig
reports submitted to zdob. I
think if I can really quick, I
want to make sure that we got this. For the record, PRESIDENT
Sugimoto members of the body, as well as members of the public, also know, you know, one of the things that we've implemented now with the new leadership roles is ensuring that myself
and PRESIDENT Su and dan all
meet. I think, biweekly, I think is it every other wednesday dan
or what did I say, julie even
ones even the second and fourth wednesday of each month. So as
another point of being able to
again have more transparency and
more ears and eyes, I want you
know, folks to know that we do meet and we discuss agenda and
agenda items that come in and filter through. So I just wanted
to share that that's something that that we've implemented and
are doing. Well, I submitted a
version of this with comments and questions that I think should be answered before this
is approved. And to go back for revision. So it will address
those issues. And. So I had a question actually coming off of your first question about I recognize that you're saying there's nothing that bars.
Right. But I understand really the statement of not submitting
report is of being about the
staffing issue. And, and the
lack of the investigator.
Commissioner booker, you had
mentioned submitting reports to
the board. These would that fall
in this category for you? The
first page, this one, the first
one, it says not submitting reports like, is this what you were suggesting at this point
that the ig. I just want to make sure that you had made this
suggestion of there might be a
potential for submitting reports. No, I think that I
think there was there was two parts. Right. And the first one came from I think when I brought
it up was when on how we as
members present information on things that we're doing in the community. Right. When I was on
the police commission, there was a section on the agenda where it was specifically for the members or commissioners to talk about outreach, things that they were going to and things that they were doing in terms of report. And I think what we're sharing
here tonight, based off of what I was hearing, member wechter share that also resonated with
me, was, again, just that that that deep, thorough and correct
me if I'm wrong, but the way I'm thinking of it, deep, thorough
bullet points on these are challenges. And these are recommendations that I'm that I'm offering based off of my
time here in reporting to you, you all as something that we can
do kind of moving forward. I also wanted to make a clarification for member. Carry
on. So on page two of the prior report and the report, we're considering right now, dan, just
sort of highlights what's in our charter obligations. And I will say oig report submitted to the
zdob and whatever year and
quarter and so for the prior one, I pretty much said none
until such time as oig is staffed with at least one blah, blah, blah and I. And then in the following sentence that the pi report. The inspector general, however, has submitted monthly and quarterly reports, and so that kind of clarifies that they work together, I see. Yeah. And then and then thank
you. Yeah, that's very helpful. and then in this last quarter we
did have a report from the department of police accountability. So that was the most relevant part for this
quarter. So I've read dozens if not hundreds of annual reports
from oversight entities around the country. And when there is a board or commission and you have an entity like the inspector general or an or an
investigative body, the
inspector general would have their report included in the
larger report, but they would be speaking in their voice because
it's really emphasized that inspector generals need to operate independently, free from
influence. They need to make
statements, as they call them. And I think that's something we should uphold and allow inspector general wiley to write
his own report and incorporate it. And make the statements
about what he's done and what
he's looked at and what his
goals and operations are, and that's for that same reason. I'm
not going to put inspector
general wiley's or my interpretation of what inspector
general wiley said in the report. I would direct people to actually look at the original source and just put a general
overview of his comments. Any
future agenda items? Yeah. So is there do we need to have a motion to approve? Yes. This is a separate agenda item to be
voted on action item okay. I. I
vote to approve PRESIDENT MADAM PRESIDENT's versions excluding
commissioner comments. I thought
we just did that for the this is for the third quarterly report.
Third quarter. That was so now we're second. I know it's because that's why I know I know I'm good. I'm glad you specified we did. We did. Okay. So we should probably specify that it's for the third only the third quarterly report okay. Is
there a second second okay. We
take the votes in public comment. Members of the public would like to make public comment on line item six. Sheriff's department oversight board 2024 q3 report. Please approach the podium when it is
free. Seeing no public comment,
calling the roll on the sheriff's department oversight board 2024 q3 report vice
PRESIDENT Brookshire I is I
member carry on I carry on is I
member win I win is I member
palmer I palmer is I PRESIDENT
Sue I sue is I member wechter no. Wechter is no. There are five eyes and one no. The sheriff's department oversight
board 2024 q3 report is approved. Thank you. And the
next agenda item, please call line item seven future agenda items discussion and possible
action item. Actually, before we
move on, member karen caught a
typo on the header for the q2
report. So there's an extra zero
in the year in the in the header
up. Do you see that dan I
believe that would be considered a scrivener's error. So there wouldn't be a need to do a motion again. Yes, precisely.
Thank you. You're welcome. So on
the future agenda items let's
see. Let me just go back for the next meeting. We are going to have inspector inspector general. We're going to have
chief counsel ronnie singh with
us. And I just want to recognize kelly collins here, who is the
deputy. Welcome to our meetings.
And then to highlight again, this was before you got here,
vice PRESIDENT, if you want to say anything more about the young community developers walk,
run. I like the picture. Handsome picture here. Nope. I mean nothing more than just encouraging community to come outside. We're promoting health and transitional age youth and
just an opportunity to bring
folks to the bay view. And we're
going to do a5k, which is 3.2
miles. A lot of folks think it's five miles, but it's 3.2 miles
metric system. But going to be for community vendors will be
out. We'll have food and music.
Race starts at 9 A.M. And yeah, I was also going to say, you know, I would have not known about the new community center had I had not been invited to the graduation. So if any of you want to attend a graduation, it's very inspiring and also especially meet the kids of the graduates too. And then right across is the plaza where our
vice PRESIDENT Had her first headquarters back in the day
when she was starting her
elected career. So you could maybe we could landmark that
place. The baby plaza, and then
health. And then we were going to talk about the food. Right. Health. Yeah, it's a component. But really I still want someone from the department of public health to actually talk about overall health. And then I even had this piece of paper. So when
we were at stage three, we
actually had was this were we at
kj three. No. Maybe this was at
c, j two. But we had someone with jail behavioral health so
we could actually even break
down some of the other health
things. And then df addressing addiction, that kind of thing
because it seems that we can't get someone here to talk. Overall, I wanted the head
person, but we MAY just break it down into components, but I
don't want to wait any longer. And we've been I've personally been begging to have a health
report for a couple of years now, and so and then also, you
know, we'll be laying out that
sort of the agenda, the topics, the priorities for the next
year. And I know. Member wechter you submitted something about the statistics, and the
statistics were actually all
there in a mission local article. So things have been called, I don't want to impose on the city and then go through legal
counsel to get all the data all over again. When I can just take what's already been given to us,
and then we can ask for further interpretation by dpa or however
we want to do it. But I'm not going to have people recreate
work. So anything else I was, I was thinking, would it be okay
for the next agenda that we do
add? I don't know if it's another item or it's another just bullet point, but I think it goes back to like members reports, because I think it would just be cool to have a section where if member vector goes to an event that he can talk about it, and it's always
on our agenda, or member nguyen does some new training that the sheriff's department is doing
that he can actually bring up without having to agendize it. yeah, and of course, we probably should get some sort of a report or let folks know what is going
to be talked about ahead of time
so we can actually budget for the time. Exactly. But I will say that thank you to member wechter. I did tune in to the webinar on jail health. As someone who actually debated health care reform since high school, and I don't want to tell you how long, just suffice it to
say, I'm soon to be in antique
years from when I graduated from high school, I thought some of
it was useful, what I didn't, I
think what undermined some of the credibility is that some people actually were very entrenched in their particular
positions. And I think until we
look at overall societal health, people unfortunately are not going to focus on incarcerated
health. So we I think we need to
think broader and incorporate entire community society. I
mean, if those people who are going to vote, we have to train them to think about everybody.
And that includes our
incarcerated population. I think what further undermines some of the presentation for me is that there were people who were from the abolitionist groups. So if
you probably need to stay within the future agenda. Yeah, yeah.
So that's. Yeah. So it sounds like a good discussion for next time. Yeah. So we can, we can talk a little bit more. But this will kind of go back to the health. And so hopefully DECEMBER JANUARY will have some
kind of health report because I'm going to twist arms a little
harder this time. So with that I
think I'm going to ask a question. I also in early JULY submitted a request for agenda
item for a presentation by amrik
singh, the inspector general of
the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,
on how an effective office of
inspector general for carceral facilities operates and to
suggest how the this board can conduct performance evaluations of our inspector general. What's what's the status of that? I never heard anything. I have not contacted her. We could have
her. I think I think many of us have done evaluations in the past. So it's not particular to
this particular topic. But we
could have her even at the next meeting if we want. But I really want to focus on the policy. I mean, we missed two meetings, so that's why we're a little bit
behind. I mean, I think I had
SEPTEMBER agenda to look at a presentation on some of the
policy reforms. The overhauling that took place two years ago.
And so, if I MAY, it seems like
the I agree with that. I think that's a great idea. So I'm not against that. I'm just thinking of the timing, because when is the evaluation due? We would do
it typically in DECEMBER in DECEMBER. So we could have we would have maybe we could have it next month and then and if
you if we want we could also have another hr presentation just in general to talk about
evaluations, what they typically do and, and the forms they give us and our closed session and then that kind of thing. So and could you share with the full board all the forms that you've received that people have submitted and the transparency.
so we'll know what people are asking for and what their status
is. It's I mean, I just have yours. So yours are the only ones, the only one. Yeah. The
only. Yeah. The two. So it's not one the two submissions. So that
on the statistics and then from
dpa and then aman singh. So yeah
just for the record, what mission local reported was much broader than what I was requesting because I wanted to
see things over time, because
one of the arguments we made in asking for a budget for the inspector general was that it would save the city money and potentially reducing lawsuits, settlements and adverse
judgments. And if we have that data from the past, we can show
what effect his presence has going forward. And that can be a
very strong and potent argument for supporting oversight. Yeah,
I mean, that was one of the topics we talked about at our
last meeting. We made that argument, and I don't know. So,
janet, can I ask you an impromptu question, what's the records retention period for the city on? It depends on the document. So I'm talking about
like these judgments on. So I'm
not exactly sure, but it would certainly be. He was asking I
think for the last five years I'm sure it was ten. So I thought, you know, most places it's seven, seven years. So I
suspect we still have it. Okay.
Really quick, dan, can we do a
very quick follow up with it? I
just think for I'm a big person around decorum. And when I was on police commission, we actually had a cue for when
folks wanted to talk, I think
would really help us evolve and continue to move forward. When
we have folks that are in a queue and lined up and ready to talk and we can go through just
something to inquire about, and
then also also we don't get to log in here, but in the past we've been able to turn on and
off our mics too. But it's not. Yeah, but we're not we're not
logged in. I'm not logged in like being on tv. But tell them to give us the bells and
whistles. Do we have public

with board members and the public."
2024-09-06,"so it has been a couple months since
we last met, so what we were
dpoeing
going to announce last months meeting,
there was a shooting that took place where deputies were shot as they were
serving an eviction notice JULY 3. Thankfully no one was hurt.
No shots were returned and this case is
currently with the d a's office.
Just for members of the public, I know
we are here to show transparency, but also correct any missed perceptions in the public, so the sheriff office does
not go around evicting people and
randomly taking away important staff time.
Eviction warrants and notices are court ordered documents and that is one of
the court functions of the sheriff
office to execute those notices.
Second of all, we also-I want to remind colleagues, if you haven't completed
the mandatory implicit bias
training, please let dan know. Hr is keeping tabs who completed and hasn't completed.
It is a little cumbersome because we are not employees. There are multiple things we have to do to get into the city employee portal
and I had to bug dan several times and
it gets involved so it is little
cumbersome, so attempt when you
actually have extra time. Next, chinatown night took place on wednesday. We were not notified about it.
It was our MISS, but there is also the autumn moon festival which will take
place SEPTEMBER 14. Also, finally, sunday SEPTEMBER 8,
there is the annual police fire honoring our first responders and last
year vice PRESIDENT Carrion and I attended, so it is a good way to honor
our first responders. If you need additional information, I
can provide it for you or dan can provide it after the meeting, but I believe a notice was included in your
packet and it is at saint fucelia
church, 255 17th avenue and it is public event. Any public comment on xun r communications and announcements?"

informational item. Priscilla portillo and maria reynoso will give an overview on victim services including victim rights when serving victims of crime in san francisco."
2024-09-06,"welcome. Thank you very much for having us today.
My name is priscilla por tillo the deputy chief of the victim service division at the san francisco district attorney's office."
2024-09-06,"good afternoon, my name is
maria reynoso. In our presentation we'll provide a
overview of our services, please feel free to ask questions the way or
at the end of the presentation. Thank you."
2024-09-06,is this good? Can you hear me if I leave it at this level?
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,"thank you.
With victim service our goal is insure
safety [Indiscernible] Navigate the criminal justice system and rebuild lives after traumatic event.
Consist of three units, advocacy team,
advocacy team victim adcovts that work with victims of crime.
Victim compensation unit which is a part of the state victim compensation board and that consist of different claim specialist who process and review applications for victim compensation,
and restitution unit, which request
restitution for cal vcv after they paid
on victims expenses. [Indiscernible] We work closely with the victim and support system to assist
in explaining service as well as navigate the criminal justice system. Help identify the support
system.
We assist navigated the criminal
justice system explaining the system
filing a police report. We inform of the rights as a victim of
the crime and also assist invoking their rights.
One of the pillars is assisting victims applying for victim compensation. Victim compensation is a state funded program assist victims of crimes with any expenses incurred due to the crime.
We connect victims to community resources, allowing to identify
resources in the community they feel comfortable with and can provide those resources that our office MAY not be
able to provide whether mental health,
drumming circles, after school programs for themselves and their families. Another pillar is our community outreach education.
We try to make contact with the community before someone is a victim of
the crime so they are aware of services before traumatic event. That can look-"
2024-09-06,for the edification of the public just to talk about marcy's rights.
2024-09-06,"we will have a slide.
This is a brief overview but will go more in depth about marcy's rights."
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,"the community outreach education could be [Indiscernible] Before we presented you mentioned chinatown national night out. National night out there is different
events we present at schools and have partnerships with other
agencies. Breakdown for advocacy unit which consist of different teams.
One team is misdemeanor unit which handles uncharged cases of violent
crime and charge cases like batteries, cases not felonies.
The general felony unit works
specifically with charge cases, robberies, attempted homicides, assaults.
The advocates are working specifically
with those victims. We have community and victim unit.
We work with people who are either dependent or over the age of 65, immigrants. We work specifically community team in
the areas of bayview, excelsior, mission, hunters point, vis valley.
Communities and tenderloin. Communities that don't necessarily have
a trust in law enforcement and wouldn't seek our services so we try to make more contact in those communities so they are aware of services and
we have specific advocates that can assist victims in that area. Critical incident team work with homicide victims.
They work with officer involved
shootings, pedestrian fatalities and loss of life.
We have domestic team who works with [Indiscernible] Stalking the talking is not intimate partner and unknown person the misdemeanor or general felony unit
would take that.
The child abuse and sex assault team works with the db.
We also have a human
trafficking team
and juvenile advocate who are
victims.
In order to better serve people in communities we collaborate with a lot of support systems and partner agencies.
To protect the confidentiality before
we can freely discuss the services provided we request release of information, have them sign off
so we can freely speak to other agencies and be able to better serve them. We also collaborate work
closely with law enforcement, depending on the crime time, whether it be [Indiscernible]
Homicide team or any of the traffic collision unit and local presinths to insure we have the information to provide to victims.
If the victim asks or give us a release
of information we can provide updates
to their family members or friends, who they appoint as the point of contact in their place.
We also collaborate with a lot of agencies.
On a weekly basis attend the street violence reduction team that meetings consist of a lot of partner agencies
from sfpd, wrap around, which is the
program within sf general, adult probation and juvenile probation, the street violence intervention program, so we collaborate with the purpose of the meeting is to avoid duplication of
efforts as well as streamlining service
to better serve the community.
One of our service is navigation of criminal justice system.
When it comes to working with victim
survivors of crime, we go over the process beginning to end, so the
different levels you could say of the criminal process. We also discuss different terms, what the terms mean. We also speak about the different parties involved with the system so
victim survivors are well aware who could be in communication with involving the charge case. We provide court support so if a victim survivor identifies that they want to
attend a hearing or if they are subpoena to testify, we can probably
have a advocate with them, wait in the lounge with them and escort them to the
courtroom and be with them in the room. Depending on the crime type, there are
certain crime types where advovoicates can sit on the stand. We offer transportation to court, so we have a partnership with yellow cab.
We are also able to have or ask a d a to request investigators within the office to provide transportation if
there concerns about maybe coming to
court and also able to provide meal vouchers. When victim survivors come they MAY have to wait for the case to be called and it could-they could be there in the morning and roll to the afternoon.
So we offer breakfast vouchers and also
lunch vouchers as well.
And we also provide information on marcy's rights. Marcy's rights are what we consider
here in the state of california, victim's rights, and they are called
marcy's rights because they are named
after marcy nicholls a uc santa barbara
student stalked and killed by her exboy friend in 1983.
at this time, victim rights did not
exist, so the exboyfriend was released from custody and her family ran into
him and I believe a grocery store and
they were taken back they would not be notified and that is because at the
time we didn't have rights in place, so in 2008, marcy's rights was approved in
the state of california and marcy's
right allow victim survivors to
participate in the criminal process. When it comes to marcy's rights, this slide highlights all the different
rights that solve under marcy's right. Advocates provide the information and initial communications with victim survivors, whether the first call,
whether it is in-person meeting.
We are also able to mail out marcy's rights and e-mail marcy's rights or provide them in person. Some examples are, making sure all parties are treating victim survivors
with fairness and respect. That includes law enforcement, that includes our division and also the public defender office.
One example of how we exercise marcy's rights is connecting victim survivors to law enforcement if they want follow up on a case. Sometimes the case is still under investigation and we want to a update or sometimes it already reached our
office and we want to see who reviewed it, who it has a certain outcomes.
Those are steps to support victim survivors.
Another example is, if a suspect or
defendant is to be released we offer to
be registered or the sheriff locater so they receive a notification if they are released.
We also provide support around victim impact statements so if a victim survivor wants to address the court that is something we can help providing guidelines on possible questions or
also read lose on behalf of victim
survivors in court."
2024-09-06,"along with assisting victims one
pillar is assisting [Indiscernible] As mentioned for victim compensation it is state funded program to help victims of
crime with medical care, mental health service, funeral and burial, relocation
in the event there is a threat.
Victim compensation MAY
reimburse a
victim or survivor with qualifying expenses due to the crime. It is recommended that someone files a
police report in order to apply for victim compensation. Victim compensation board reviews the
application and determines eligibility and unfortunately property crimes are
not covered by victim compensation. The person eligible to apply for victim
compensation are any victims who suffered death, physical injury or
threat of physical injury. Some emotional injuries resulting from
violent crime are also eligible.
All the community does not know, in addition to the victim which is also [Indiscernible] Family members, anyone
who resides in the home with the victim are also eligible. For example a loved one MAY apply for
lost waging if the person injured is no longer able to work and provide for the family.
All the victims can apply for mental health if they do not have insurance. The only caveat for victim compensation, it is a payer of last
resort and if there is other means those have to be used before victim
compensation can assist. The next slide provides a list of what
crimes are eligible for victim compensation.
It has to be a violent crime. I won't read one by one. Again, some of the expenses that can be covered from victim compensation are crimes [Indiscernible] A person is injured and teeth are broken they can
apply for dental assistance.
Funeral and burial including applying for the funeial and burial or
transportation to the native country
and also help with cost of
[Indiscernible] Income loss, if a person is injured and no longer can
work they can apply for income lost."
2024-09-06,"I want to add regarding the california victim compensation
board, advocates can provide [Indiscernible] There is benefit to reference and fact
sheet and also provide the application
but able to support in applying in completing the application so that
could be done over the phone, video conferencing or victim survivor could come to our office or safe community space and we can fill it out together.
There is also that opportunity.
And, next is restitution. Restitution is when the court orders a
defendant to pay for losses or expenses
due to a crime, and these expenses could vary. Sometimes it is property lost or stolen. It could be mental health service and
so on, so advocates provide information
on what restitution is and provide examples what falls under restitution
and can help advocate-we can help victim survivors create a list if they have restitution request, we can also help gather documentation and make sure we submit it to the a d a, because the
restitution is only eligible in charge
cases and also partner with agencies
like adult probation or juvenile
probation department around restitution."
2024-09-06,"the goals of the division
[Indiscernible] Par ticipate in as many events as possible to educate and put our information out there. In the slide you see a few events we participated over the last couple months. We attend sunday streets, national
night out, aging your way, merchant walks. We attended town halls and different
meetings throutd the community to insure our face is out there and the community is aware of services."
2024-09-06,"I want to add, when it comes to community engagement. We are monitoring different crime
trends and based on the trends we might
launch campaigns or efforts to make community members aware of these trends. For example, earlier this year in
FEBRUARY we saw the rise of the
blessing scam and what we did is launched a campaign and partnered with other organizations to lead presentations to community members and community based organizations and we
also created materials so is a blessing scam flier and additional materials around the blessing scam.
Lastly, we want to share common
misconceptions of the victim service division.
so, our division specifically does not
investigate, so if there is a
investigation needed, it would depend
if uncharged we mostly likely direct back to law enforcement agency. Most common is san francisco police department, but sometimeatize is other agencies.
Or if it is a charged case, we MAY loop
in one of the investigators within our
office, depending on what it is.
Also, regarding statements, victim advocates cannot take new statements.
That has to be through law enforcement
or possibly one of our d a investigators.
In terms of translation, we don't offer translation service but we are able to connect victim survivors to advocates who speak their preferred language. If that's not a possibility we can access the language line and lastly, we don't actually have counseling services
within our division, so not able to provide therapy ourselves, but we are able to connect victim survivors to
other resources, maybe the [Indiscernible] Recovery center or community based organizations.
advocates provide crisis intervention, active listening, assessing needs, collaborating with victim survivors to
determine next steps. I think we have one more slide and I want to add, this is information to our office. This is where we are located and we have our lounge where we can have walk-ins so if a community member wants
to walk in or call or e-mail us, when
it comes to referrals we see referrals from various places. Sfpd is a common organization that sends us referrals. Also, community based organizations.
Maybe san francisco general
hospital. Also a self -- identifying victim survivors with reach out to us and
we'll assess next steps.
Thank you. Any questions?"
2024-09-06,"thank you.
I have a comment and question. Vice PRESIDENT Carrion."
2024-09-06,"it is so lovely to see you two ladies for folks that MAY not know.
I had a opportunity to work with these excellent advocates we have before you
here making the presentation,
and it is wonderful to xoe you are leaders in
the position and well deserved. I have to admit, I just gave a domestic violence action plan meeting for a
family that in my own practice and it
reminded me of the work the victim advocates taught me as a prosecutor. I wouldn't have learned that in law school. I would not have learned that being a
attorney, so the work that you all
perform is something that is so needed
and sometimes lacking in a challenging environment. Thank you for being here.
And thank you for your work. My question is, our role here is to assist with oversight of the sheriff.
What happens when victims or victim
families -- if you receive any complaints or concerns that address any
kind of sheriff resource or staff, what
is your procedure or what's the
process for connecting someone that is using your services that brings this to your
attention?"
2024-09-06,"in our experience we haven't that
I'm aware had any yet. We connect to department of police accountability, but for the sheriff
department, we haven't had that yet.
It is great if you all can
share how we should move about --"
2024-09-06,"I will add one and don't know if
this is the last year, [Indiscernible]
Only works if the sf sheriff inmate locater works and there was a period it
was down, so that impacts victim
survivors because they can't register for bilink. I didn't receive concerns around that.
I had to share that information and
figure other ways, but that is the only thing that has come up that has
come up roontly. Recently."
2024-09-06,"we are also go toog have another presentation from the d a
office on. .
A lot of times with delays the victims
feel justice delayed is justice denied
so we'll talk about some of the delays
and what we can do to mitigate and this
also comes to the jails with inspector
general and how we might have more regularly available arraignments on site for say cj3. The transport of those incarcerated and
the defendants is less
cumbersome and not necessary."
2024-09-06,any other comments?
2024-09-06,I had a couple. Go ahead.
2024-09-06,"thank you for your presentation, and I do believe every victim should have
their day in court and hold their
person accountable for who was responsible.
In our court system we believe that one is innocent until proven guilty, so with that understanding, how do you
determine a person is a victim before
the guilt or innocent is hashed
out in court?"
2024-09-06,are you referring to in the criminal process or as advocates and quhoo we work with?
2024-09-06,do you handle the victim after the court or before?
2024-09-06,"it isn't required to have criminal procedure.
We work with people who are victims of
crimes, robbed and beaten and no one arrested.
A harm party with reported reported to law enforcement and they come to our office seeking service and we deem as a victim.
There are situations in which due to
laj nguage barriers that maybe in the
report they MAY not be listed as a
victim so inform how to complete a supplemental report [Indiscernible] A
party that identifies as a harmed party is who we work with, regardless if there was criminal proceedings or not."
2024-09-06,"just to jump in with that, because
this was my bred and butter. Basically it is the police report that names who the person is a victim or not
and it is sent to the d a's office where a determination is met whether to
charge them or not regardless if there
is a charge or if there isn't, whoever is named as a victim that has been that police report has been forwarded to the da's office will have a opportunity to access the resources so long as it is not dealing with property crime."
2024-09-06,"I just want to add, a lot of our
resources are regarding linkage to community resources, orientation of the criminal justice system. If there a victim survivor that doesn't
have a incident report, the resource MAY not be able to follow up with is california victim compensation board.
Sometimes if we see there isn't an incident report, that program since it
a state report requires a incident report so that would be the only barrier if someone doesn't want to
report the crime, fearful of reporting or not reported yet."
2024-09-06,"I think also for the purpose of the
community to know, the victim
compensation board as you earlier said
is a resource of last resort, right?
Because that, it also has a longer statute of limitations, so victims have
a larger period of time usually to
apply for those funds, but also if they
get any reimbursement for their funds, those are supposed to be paid back. It is -- there are some checks and balances to make sure that there is no
windfall in who is getting the
very
limited money."
2024-09-06,"I have a question, just
follow up
for context.
In order to access the services, they
need to be referred by the police
department?"
2024-09-06,"so, not in all cases, so there are cases where a victim is self -- identifying and they MAY not have reported. They can still connect with our office. It MAY be limited what they can access.
For example, they MAY not be able to access the california victim compensation board. It depends on it crime type but we are able to provide the information on what
the process looks like. Maybe now theypt to report and what it looks like possibly after that. What would it look like if it were a charge.
These are steps and parties. Since this happened I am seeking mental health service, here is a list of community based organizations to get
connected to or maybe they MAY want food resources or needs that have come up since the crime has come up and we can support and providing resources for
those needs. It isn't necessarily have to come from law enforcement agency, but we get a
lot of referrals from law enforcement,
specifically special victim units, tciu, homicide and in communication
with a lot of those units."
2024-09-06,"I just wanted to remind the public
that san francisco does have -- called the language ordinance and before
called the equal access to service ordinance. I also want to bring up on the
slide, I
MAY have you tweak it a bit. It says translation, so I like
it to
say, translation interpretation.
I am respectful for the people who are
professionals so translation is written
material, interpretation is the oral language.
And also because of our large chinese immigrant population, I wanted to really emphasize that the chinese language is one written language.
You can go between the simplified characters versus traditional characters, but it is impaurp
to
impaurp to say you are interpreting in
chinese because people need to know spoken language. Some other dialect.
And also, what I learned in working
with interpreters is that, the better
question is not to ask what language do you understand, but rather, what language do you prefer. I know a lot of medical personnel will say, this person understands mandarin
and I will tell them that if they are from southern china, [Indiscernible]
Might be the very first language, then
cantonese for the language of commerce, and then the national language is mandarin. It is third acquired language and I
always say, did you take french or spanish or german in high school and would you like to hear a medical diagnosis or something legal in
one of the languages.
What is your level of comprehension. I know you do the work so well in the
general public to know we have the
sensitivity to have nuance to outreach and sitting for 12 years with
commission on status of women particularly for domestic violence
survivors and victims of human trafficking, vitally important to have
in-language services and then a sense of little of safety and particularly where there are children involved as well.
Thank you for the work you do."
2024-09-06,"I want to say this, because I feel compelled to say this.
I love that you guys have this wrap around service for victims, and families.
I think it is something that I'm noticing maybe there is a existing
program, I'm not sure, but what happens
when the victim is a victim of a
violent crime, by another civil servant, mainly the san francisco police department or sheriff department, are there services for that
victim and their families?"
2024-09-06,if the victim is a civil servant?
2024-09-06,yeah.
2024-09-06,we make outreach and it list the police officer or sheriff office. We do make outreach as well.
2024-09-06,"okay, you are immediately notified
by the police deparchlt department?"
2024-09-06,"usual ly the way we get the
[Indiscernible] So they list the incidents from the week or day and from
there we get the reports and contact who is listed as a victim."
2024-09-06,"got it. Just so I'm super clear, there is no
delay in which you are notified
by the police department?"
2024-09-06,"there could be delay.
We receive the recaps, but individual law enforcement agencies could also
send referrals over, so for example,
the sheriff office wanted a protocol they send referrals and we take them as well. The recaps usually happen within one to two days but sometimes we get referrals from a different organization and
sometimes there could be a delay.
But as soon as we receive it, we do have certain procedures on entering the cases into our case management system
and making outreach and also have a
certain number of outreach that advocates have to make to get in contact with the victim survivor to provide services."
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,you're welcome.
2024-09-06,"just really quickly, I had a statement.
Thank you for the presentation.
I can definitely speak first hand to the outreach the d a office has done over the last couple years in terms of
the work with community based
organizations like ours. Referring individuals justice involved over to receive services so I wanted to
say kudos and applaud the da for that. A lot more to be done, but I think we are moving in the right direction.
What I really wanted to share, I think
member carrion asked a extremely important question and want to make
sure we get in the record dan, it is
how does the da office interact with the sheriff's office.
We can use the platform to enter weave departments that traditionally probably
don't speak to one another pertaining
to those justice involved as we try to eradicate recidivism.
I want to make sure that didn't getalist. We looked at each other and said how do we and now we have a opportunity to say
this is how we do it.
No pun to montell jordan. I wanted to make sure that did want get lost."
2024-09-06,"I think going off that comment,
there is numerous ways right if you
have victims or victim families tell you I am having issue with a deputy or
we had a situation occur and we need assistance.
Online there is a process at the
sheriff website for complaints. You can also file complaints. They have all the paperwork at any of the offices, but also on our website
and our website has the online portal. That information would be available to them.
It MAY be something to consider as this
is a newly formed board, in the
valuation of getting feedback from their clients, victims saying if they had negative experiences with the sheriff or any that information, there is different ways I think we can
collaborate to have more communication
if there have been concerns, because
as-you all can speak more to this then
I can I'm sure, but we all know that
people that are experiencing trauma
have difficulty being able to manage accessing and following and implementing the available resources,
so any way we can assist in making easier and finding out what concerns
are when they are to the sheriff, people might not just know you are
somebody they can tell and that would
have a positive impact for them."
2024-09-06,"we'll also share the information regarding how to file a complaint on the sheriff website with our division, so we have monthly meetings where we share updates and we also have team meetings so we'll make sure they are
aware that as a resource as well."
2024-09-06,"just for my clarity, is your board
only deals with people in san francisco?"
2024-09-06,"not necessarily. Sometimes we have individuals who live
in san francisco, but maybe the crime occurred elsewhere. For example, san mateo county, if they prefer to work with our division
because they work and live in san francisco, that's something we can do, so an example like that.
It is possible, it just requires more follow-ups on the advocate end to get
maybe a police report from daly city police department, things like that,
but we can work with individuals where the crime occurred elsewhere."
2024-09-06,"I ask because, system impacted
people in the system behind walls and gates and bars usually have limited access to people like you. Say someone is from san francisco, are there advocates from san francisco but
in a state prison and being abused and
victimized by staff or other residents, would they have access to victim services to report a crime and get some type of help?"
2024-09-06,"that would be challenging because we
have to be notified of the victimization, and in that case I am
not too sure how that would happen, so that would be a challenging situation. You have anything additional to say along those --"
2024-09-06,"the limitation of having access to the person to communicate would also be
one of the challenges or barriers."
2024-09-06,"my final question is, in the process
of the court procedures, the victim becomes the defendant and the defendant
the victim, what is the process that for you guys?
Would you stop service to the victim because now they are considered the perpetrator and would you offer
services to the person who was accused
but now seen as the victim?"
2024-09-06,"just for clarity, if there is a additional incident or after further investigation?"
2024-09-06,"after all the fact and evidence and proof comes out, if the victim becomes
the pertrairt the victim nob"
2024-09-06,"we work who is the victim.
There are incidents where a person comes in as the victim or survivor and there is a new incident where they are
now the suspect. Our protocol. , who is working with the person when deemed a victim or survivor will not work with that person when deemed a suspect to insure there is neutral
services provided but we would still
work with the person. In the situation you provided it is quhoo is identified as the victim we
would be working with."
2024-09-06,"any further question or
comments?
Do we have any public comment?"
2024-09-06,"thank you. For members of the public who like to comment on item 4, presentation from the san francisco district attorney's office, please approach the podium when
it is free. There appears to be no public comment."
2024-09-06,"thank you. I hope this is just the beginning of our collaboration. There is so much work to be done and as you know, with the commission on the
status of women, the department on
status of women we had the family
violence council so it is multi-pronged approach we can really get to the heart
of problems, but also have data
collection so we can pinpoint resources
and make the use of limited resources. And you're welcome any time, just let us know. Thank you."
2024-09-06,thanks. Great presentation.
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,even your voices are relaxing.
2024-09-06,it is soothing.
2024-09-06,have a good weekend.
2024-09-06,"you too.

2024-09-06,"this is reunion of sorts.
I wanted to recognize that our chief
attorney for the department of police accountability, marshall khine is here

appreciation to vice PRESIDENT Carrion,

2024-09-06,"thank you.
I wanted to say as part of the
acknowledgment for the years specifically with the leadership we had
with this board has been phenomenal and
at least for me and from dp a
perspective and working both in
partnership and collaborative with --"
2024-09-06,breaking things.
2024-09-06,"I know.
I get excited and start throwing things around. In collaboration with all the work you have done.
I really want to acknowledge how much
has been done this year.
It has been difficult and arduous year,
but the missteps that I think we had
from the initial year where we didn't
have the spin down that would have
saved and changed exactly how work got
done with the sheriff board but nav dpaited that with limited budget. the work here has been phenomenal and I want to thank all you and particularly
the leadership we had from the past year.
The professionalism with this board has done, the engagement with outside communities.
Many of you have come in to work with outside groups that are interested in
oversight and learning from the
leadership you have shown has been phenomenal and I just wanted to thank you again.
I know we are shifting leadership, not changing leadership, just shifting it, but I expect great things from all the
work that you guys have done.
Having terry here, the inspector
general wiley here as part of the celebration is meaningful as well, so I wanted to thank you on behalf of the citizens of san francisco, but also
thank you for everyone else that is learning from the work you guys are
doing and putting this together and being responsive, which I think is
really necessary for civilian oversight.
Thank you all.
continued success and thank you again for your leadership over the last year.
I don't like to do names when I'm talking:"
2024-09-06,"I just have to say, we can't thank the department of police accountability
and your leadership and marshall khines work.
Just for the tremendous support in the
transition and not having a budget
having to call the budget people advocating. Making the transition much smoother for our inspector general.
We knew coming in it would be difficult, but not having a budget was even more difficult, but to get the
real estate and the equipment and then marshall and his brainiac ways to morph a system that would be accessible for the sheriff office and filing
complaints and hopefully we'll have
real-time reports and this is out to the executive. We still need a budget.
We are doing really important work, so
I hope that we can find a way where we
can actually get some resources and some staffing."
2024-09-06,"I'm optimistic how well the process worked specifically in the past year in term ozf the things we have been able to accomplish. Even with the limited budget
that we had or the-not limited budget, now it is shared budget to get this work done.
That commitment is ongoing, and the appreciation is ongoing and that's just what I wanted to speak to, so thank you
all of you for your work and overcoming
these challenges. Also honesty, it isn't a small thing,
the ways in which you have
professionalized this practice.
It is meaningful and think will continue to bear fruit, regardless of the circumstances but optimistic what
the future looks like at least for civilian oversight based oen the work you all have done and continue to do."
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,thank you guys.
2024-09-06,"it is also I would like to note that
I see myself still as a leader regardless the title I have and you will get my opinion and my
perspective and my expertise. I currently serve as the vice
chair of
the california-PRESIDENT Of the
california larasa lawyer association and [Indiscernible] Law revision commission and discussed potentially becoming the chair in that commission
and I value and honor this work and I
know that having somebody like brookter and vp will be the best thing we have since you bring so much from day to day practice as well as a police commissioner.
I have been asked from folks, you are not a prosecutor, why do you do this job?
I am like, because I believe in
community and I believe in having the
voice that I bring to the table
as a queer latina as a prosecutor and survivors as a different forms of
crime, and as somebody that really cares deeply about the people that do the work day in and day out and take it home with them and the people that try
to recover and live their best life and heal from trauma, because we can all
talk about healing for trauma and what that looks like is very different for
so many people and it is unfortunate
that our criminal justice system continually failed victims and victim families in particular.
I continue to be awe and complete respect of those that show up and do
the work and awe and respect of victims
and families and people working diligently to rehabilitate them sevl said and put themselves in community forward, so I'll still be here."
2024-09-06,"I'm glad you raise the issue because
it isn't a small thing to have --"
2024-09-06,I'm also a single mom and have my own law firm.
2024-09-06,"it isn't a small thing to have
participation and leadership that looks
like this board, specifically with the complicated subjective decisions we
deal with every day when we are talking
about our justice system and our
incarceration systems to have voices
that are most impacted by those processes be in a leadership role like
this board taking participation is something that is not lost on the rest
of the state and rest of the country that your voices are being heard in a
way that this board is constructed means something. i hope you all have as much pride as I
do in the work that is ongoing by
playing a leadership role and I know titles that leadership shifts and changes, among you all throughout the process, but it isn't a small thing and just know that your voices and your work is being heard and seen and I
think it is making a difference. Thank you."
2024-09-06,"MAY we all move forward together? I'm really pleased the impact we are
making on the state as well as nationally and so, don't want to be political, but I think we MAY have a
bigger national voice hopefully
crossing my fingers."
2024-09-06,"being seen. Absolutely being seen and I expect positive things from the work
you guys are doing."
2024-09-06,"thank you.
Are we still on public comment?"
2024-09-06,"I just want to make a couple
comments. Congratulations PRESIDENT Su.
I have known PRESIDENT Su many many years in different capacity, professional and personal and I'm very
very excited to have a larger role with
the sheriff oversight board now in my position as chief counsel.
i also want to briefly acknowledge everyone sitting up there and just for a moment just take a look at each other and realize what a reflection of san
francisco this really is.
As a native san franciscan, born and
raised, child of immigrant parents,
looking at this board is exactly what
positions of leadership should look like.
Without that diversity, without that basic environmental historical cultural
knowledge, you cant move the needle
forward,b and I have to say, you have made several amazing decisions this year in the thoughtful processes you
are putting in place in the sheriff's department.
One of the most brilliant was finding the new inspector general terry wiley.
I have been working with terry since
day one, as assistants chief and now chief counsel.
We now brought on kelly collin interviewed by inspector general wiley as a young lawyer and went to city attorney.
I have to say, two things, one I want
to acknowledge jana clark an amazing ally to me in the sheriff department
and also for the sheriff oversight
board, but also to the work of dpa, marshall khine, paul henderson have
done mammoth things with very little
resources, and it's no mystery there is
a great amount of respect for both of them as former colleagues, but it is
very very clear to see the importance
of transparency, the importance of collaboration, the importance of acknowledging things that are wrong and being willing to fix it.
I used to joke when I was a prosecutor
when I worked for my former employer, and we would talk about police misconduct and he used to say, the
person who is hardest on a cop? A person who knows a gold standard cop
and so those who don't know, I am
married to a lieutenant in the
department and a gold standard lieutenant at that, and I have to tell you, there is nothing that is more
important to me as chief now of the sheriff department, but to make this the best sheriff department that we
have in the nation.
I expect a lot of hard work.
I expect a lot of questions.
I expect a lot of asking for results. I welcome those challenges, and I am
really really excited to see this
continued board do the good work, but
to new vice PRESIDENT Brookter, I'm
excited to work with you more
and I know will still voice her
position and again, PRESIDENT Su, congratulations. Well deserved and I'm very excited to
work with you in a more deeper and more impactful role."
2024-09-06,"thank you.
So, on to the next agenda item."
2024-09-06,"6, inspector general report.
Informational item. Inspector general terry wiley will report on the monthly activities of the office of the inspector general, along with 2024 q2, which includes holding the first oig town hall meeting, preparing and presenting the fy 2024-2025 oig budget to the board of supervisors, visiting the sfso jail facilities, examining the jail conditions and challenges to visitation, and participating in events to promote the office of the inspector
general."
2024-09-06,"thank you everyone.
Just as a follow up to the comments
that have been made, I can tell you that the support that the inspector
general's office has received
from dpa
and specifically executive director paul henderson and marshall khine, I don't know where we would be without
the support that I received
from those
two in particular, and it is very much appreciated.
Getting an opportunity to work with
ronnie singh has just -- you everywhere I
look it is great people that I'm working with, and everybody is all
moving in the same direction,
so it has
been a real great experience. My report. The monthly report I will provide is
summary of activities for the past three months, JUNE, JULY and AUGUST,
because the board did not meet or convene in JULY and AUGUST.
It will be a little longer then my typical report.
It has been a very busy period
for us. As you know, as you are aware we have
not received funding and approval to hire staff, carrying out the charter
functions of the inspector general's
office, such as investigating complaints and conducting audits. Despite this, we have been focusing efforts on areas where we can
make the most impactful improvements to those
effected by jail conditions, including the inmates, their families, the
sheriff staff working in the jails, and
based on the feedback from numerous stakeholders.
Additionally, I have been actively promoting our office through events and
public engagement to garner support to advoicate for resources and demonstrate
our value to the community.
Lastly, the first 6 months in office have involved extensive collaboration
with the mayor's budget office, the dpa
finance plan who I really want
to note,
nicole armstrong and shareese for their
just tremendous help with the budget process and in preparing all our submissions and presentations for this year's budget.
So, first I want to talk about jail conditions.
One of the core responsibilities of the inspector general office is to monitor
the san francisco sheriff's office operations, including the provision of services to incarcerated individuals through audits and
investigations, and to insure compliance with applicable
laws and policies and that starts with
really understanding the jail conditions and dynamics
effecting those
conditions.
The recent extended lockdown in the jail -- when we dpot up and running there
was surge of exteneded lockdowns we had
to get to the bottom of what was causing the lockdowns.
MAY 14 at a special board of
supervisors hearing, I reported my preliminary findings and recommendations related to the lockdowns. Our work exploring root causes and finding sustainable solutions
to avoid future exteneded lockdowns continues.
Over the past few months, we visited
county jail 1, county jail 2.
JUNE 26, in san francisco and I visited
county jail 3 in san bruno on two occasions, APRIL 23 and JULY 26 and I
want to thank PRESIDENT Su, vice
PRESIDENT Carrion, board members
brookter and -- for joining these visits
and chief ju, chief adams,b captain
quant co and collins and staff for facilitating the visits and I do want to say that when you take on the job of
inspector general and doing oversight
of the sheriff department, and having
30 years experience in the criminal
justice system, you wonder, what kind of -how are we received by the agency that
we are seeking to conduct oversight of,
and I have to say that I have been a
combination of pleasantly surprised,
but also very impressed with the san francisco sheriff's department
leadership in terms of their
willingness to be openly transparent, really at every contact we had with the sheriff department up to this point. In these visits, we had a opportunity to talk with staff and inmates to learn about general problems, and to let them
know that we exist to support them and
give inmates the ability to initiate individual complaints.
On the most recent trip to cj3, captain quant co, providing me and members of our staff and board members with access
to talk to the entire
population in the cj3 annex.
The annex is comprised of a spacious
open door style pod. Each pod can accommodate about 60
inmates and there are approximately 6 pods in cj3. Each with its own connected door to a courtyard.
Currently only 2 pods are in service housing inmates.
These inmates in both pods
appeared
very well groomed, and in good health,
I was-the one thing I did not expect as the inspector general was to go visit
inmates in the county jail and towards
the end of our visit receive applause
from the inmates.
And the applause was that they were
very happy we were there.
We gave the impression we were there to
look after their wellbeing and I think
the applause came from appreciation of
the inspector general and I was very very surprised to receive the applause
from the inmates.
As I said, we saw inmates very well
groomed, but I think that they also had typical complaints. One is food. I don't know if I have been to a jail
where they loved the food, and san
francisco jail was no different. But, the other thing I have to say about the sheriff's department, when we
received complaints from inmates, for example, there was some complaint about
the bedding that they were
sleeping on,
because the sheriff's department
washing machine broke down, which made
it difficult to do the regular washing of the bedding.
The same day we were there, the washing
machine had just been repaired, and
once they complained about the bedding, typical of what we have seen so far
from the sheriff department, captain quantico requested all the bedding in the pod be collected and washed and those are the kind of things that as
the inspector general as we are trying
to make sure that the inmates and
everyone that touches the system is
walking away from the system feeling that their interests have been looked
after, that was a prime example of some of the things we have seen up to this point and that I'm talking about in
terms of their willingness to respond. Now, some of the other things we found
in terms of the conditions that we are
keeping an eye on, like I said, even though they are complaining about the
quality of the food, we are planning to
go to the jail and sit down and have a
meal, and see what they are talking about.
And look whether or not that is a area
where the food quality can be improved if necessary. There is also complaints about some of
the drinking, the quality of the
drinking water, and I think they are
attempting to address some of the technical difficulties with the water
system and I think those have since been corrected and we have not heard
many more complaints. really those were the major complaints
that we received when we were there.
As I told the inmates, I listened to the complaints, but what I'm looking at
is inmates that appear to be properly
looked after and I think with the applause we received, I think that that
kind of supported some of our
conclusions.
Captain quantico also explained that
because the pod that we visited was predominantly hispanic or latinx, and
so we had questions, why is this pod
predominantly latinx, part of
it was
they were predominantly spanish
speaking for one, but also, because and
the reason they were in this open pod -- open area was because they were
there for low level offenses. Many were there for low level offenses
so they were being housed in a less
restrictive housing environment. I was actually happy to hear that.
That that was the reason.
They had lower classifications.
As I said, we have seen county jail 1,
county jail, and county jail 3, and by
far the inmates in county jail
3 in the
open area that we visited they were the
happiest inmates in terms of their
current arrangement and so, they all expressed that they all preferred the dorm style setting that the annex
supported and were much happier there
then in the individual cells.
Now, some of the problems inmates reported as I say, they have been
addressed by captain quantico, who
again I think he is just doing a really
good job with cj3.
We continue to see improvements to most
of the serious problems that we were
seeing earlier in the year.
Now, what are these complaints though really rooted in is one of the questions we looked at.
Like, what is the root of a lot of -- we visited all the jails but what is the root of the complaint?
What we found that many of the
complaints were rooted in staffing
shortages of the sheriff's department. From community meetings and reports
from both staff and inmates, it is
clear to the inspector general's office that the most pressing complaints and issues related to jail conditions are
rooted in staffing shortages. This is a problem that has been growing
over the past few years, but is particularly acute now, and really all
most reaching a breaking point that we found. Sworn vacancies and when I say sworn
vacancies, these are officers
who are
sworn sheriff deputies.
Vacancies increased -- they were around
100 vacancy in 2020, and today in 2024
they are about 200 vacancies.
The staffing shortage has been exacerbated by the rapid increase in the jail population over the past 2
years, and the complexity of the new population in that we are seeing a lot
more inmates that are have mental
health challenges.
They are-they are drug addictions, particularly, the problems that are
caused with inmates addicted to
fentanyl, and the mixture of these types of inmates coming into custody
made it much more complex in terms of the types of inmates that the jail is having to manage and the combination of
having a more complex number of inmates
to manage combined with staffing
shortages is just a mixture
that it is
really unsustainable if there isn't some -there is a lot of pressure to
address the staff shortages, and the current situation is not really sustain able if
you want to continue to have a jail where we dont see a lot of violence and
a lot of complaints from the
inmates.
Now, as I said in terms of the sheriff's department, I feel doing a
good job of trying to respond to these
challenges.
Captain quantico and management of the
jails redirecting staff to priority operations.
Has really helped keep important
services operational, because when
shutdowns and when we had a lot of
rapid shutdowns, the inmates also lose
access to services that are typically provided.
What we found with captain quantico was
able to work out is okay, even though
we have to have a shutdown, which priority services to inmates can we
keep up and running?
What we found is that, they have been
able to maintain some of the priority services despite lockdowns, so maintain
these service levels requires an over-reliance-one of the problems we
also saw was that, trying to maintain
these services requires over-reliance
on overtime, which takes a huge mental and physical toll on the staff and to
the city and county of san
francisco.
As we reported on several different occasions, the over-reliance on overtime and impact it has on the staff
and the cost to the city and county of
san francisco is not really sustainable
over a long period of time.
Now I can report the sheriff office recently added 13 new deputies and has
15 trainees in the academy expected to
be sworn into service soon, so the
sheriff it apartment has responded by
really increasing their efforts to
streamline and speed up background
investigations with a new system called guardian.
The hiring of prop f retirees to
conduct the background investigations,
so when we first made our first visit
to the jail, the sheriff department hai think three individual s doing all of
the backgrounds of the trainees, and
that number has since with
addition of
prop f, retirees they are up around 8 individuals that are doing the
backgrounds and we have seen a large
increase in the number of trainees that
have made it through background
investigations and are now in the academy. Additionally, they are ramping up recruitment efforts with
colleges and the military. We will continue to be committed to
regularly visiting the jails to monitor their operations and get feedback from the inmates and staff, so we will
continue to report out on what the jail conditions are, what are some of the problems we are seeing and what are some of the solutions.
I think it is important that we not
only be an agency that identifies
problems, we also want to be part of providing solutions to the sheriff department and I have to say that, a
lot of the recommendations that we made to the sheriff's department, they have
been acted on.
We also toured the san francisco
sheriff operation at zuckerberg general
hospital on AUGUST 22, I want to thank
board member brookter for attendeding
the visit with us.
Because we wanted to get a better idea
what is going on at zuckerberg
of the sheriff operation and first I have to
say, I was extremely impressed
with the
quality of the leadership from the sheriff's department at zuckerberg. They were extremely knowledgeable about
the issues they face, and they are very challenged by using more invasion in
order to meet those challenges, because
what we found was that first of all, the sheriff department provides
security for zuckerberg general hospital by contract.
They also have-there is also private
security provided by allied universal
that adds our gives support to them in
terms of the security at the hospital, but the security guards are unarmed and
so any time there is a serious situation, the sheriff department is
required to deal with those
situations.
And the visit was prompted by feedback from the community and complaints from the nurses union earlier this year about frequent assaults at the hospital.
But, I want to thank chief ju, deputy chief mcconnell and captain
crow for arrange the visit.
We got to see the sheriff department command center, many different posts
around the hospital and it is a huge campus.
The ward where in-custody patients are housed and treated and psychiatric
emergency service section.
What we found in terms of the challenges were the same challenges we
found at the jails, the same challenges
we found anywhere the sheriff department has jurisdiction is that
there are staffing shortages.
As I say, zuckerberg is a sprawling
campus with a very diverse array of
people from all walks of life working
and visiting daily around the clock,
and so the challenges there to the
sheriff's department are tremendous.
We also saw how those staffing challenges are impacting the staff stationed at the hospital to the point
where every morning the command staff must evaluate how many deputies are
available to make difficult decisions
for covering some posts but not others. Often they are not able to
cover all of the posts that they are contracted to cover because of staffing shortages and
so they have to make strategic
decisions as to what is the
best way to
utilize the staff they have available, and that's why I started off saying,
what I found from the deputy -- the
supervisors at zuckerberg, I was
impressed with again, their knowledge,
their ability to determine what is the
best way with the personnel that they
have to manage the safety of zuckerberg
general hospital. But, again, I would say they need more
personnel at zuckerberg to
properly do the job.
So, we are also over the past three months been involved in a lot of events and activities to promote the new office of inspector general. it is important that establishing a new
agency that we garner community support for the agency, and I have been taking every opportunity to raise awareness
about the office of the inspector
general informing the public in both
local and national levels about our work and advocating our resources and advocating for resources and support. I want to thank all the members of this board for your efforts to elevate the profile of the department and draw
attention to our needs.
There have been countless
public events
that PRESIDENT Soo attended, and
basically promoting the office of
inspector general and the need for
community support and PRESIDENT Soo, we
really appreciate your active
participation out there
publicly. I also developed capable connections
with other leaders in the field.
Allowing to exchange ideas and
collaborate and advocating for necessary oversight.
I recently went to new york
city for a one week conference and because we are
san francisco, I get daily e-mails from
other inspector generals around the
country, and the typical e-mail.
Terry, what are you doing in san francisco?
I mean, on many different levels, and
so it dpoes goes to show that san
francisco is known for its invasion, it
is known for being a leader and so there is a lot of people around the country who want to know what we are
doing and how we are handling situations, because one thing you do
find out is that, staffing shortages with law enforcement agencies is a phenomenon across the country and so we
are not unique in the sheriff's
department having to meets staffing
challenges.
We also on JUNE 11, we hosted our first inspector general town hall.
Again, I want to thank PRESIDENT Soo,
for attending the town hall.
I think board member brookter -- pardon me?"
2024-09-06,brookter.
2024-09-06,"I was going to let it slide,
terry.
[Laughter]"
2024-09-06,[Indiscernible]
2024-09-06,we call him dj.
2024-09-06,"that's what I normally do, but I'm
being very official right now. But, we-"
2024-09-06,"or vice PRESIDENT Now.
[Laughter]"
2024-09-06,"but, I really appreciate the every event that we have done publicly.
We had some member of the oversight board in attendance supporting us, and
we really appreciate it.
On JULY 17, I also attended the national bar association's national
convention and I lead a panel
discussion of many prominent panelists
from many different -- we had civil
rights attorneys, district attorney,
gunet county in atlanta georgia, and a
number of other different folks from different aspects of the criminal
justice system and I represented san francisco and I was the only inspector
general and we had a very very important discussion on law enforcement
and oversight of law enforcement, and
again, in part of the-once we opened the-once we finished our presentation
and opened it up for questions, then all the questions seem to come to me.
What are you doing in san
francisco?
But, it also let the country know that
we exist and we are here, and that was
a big part of why I do those events.
On AUGUST 6, we also participated in national night out events.
Notably we were in the tenderloin at decker park and western addition at the
ella hutch center where we participated
and we'll continue to do those types of activities to let the folks of san
francisco know that we are here.
I want to announce SEPTEMBER 13, we are
having another town hall in the mission district. It will be the mission district town hall meeting where we are going to be
focusing on the latinx community, and
informing them about our
presence and establishing a close relationship with
the latinx community and also want to
express special thanks to joanna hernandez helping us secure the meeting space, promoting the eexcellent and just being a tireless advocate on
behalf of inmates. This will also give us a better
opportunity to know the latinx
community and their needs. All most done, folks."
2024-09-06,"can I request that be sent invite
for that event be sent to all board members? I don't think we have it on calendar now?"
2024-09-06,"I will.
And we also prepared invitations in
english and spanish."
2024-09-06,that could be sent to all the board members that would be great.
2024-09-06,I will.
2024-09-06,"and then jana, could you coordinate with dan so we actually notice it in case we have a quorum?
I think it is important that the board
members are more emersed in the community, so don't want to limit the
number of board members who can
attend."
2024-09-06,"so, I do have to say that two weeks
ago I attended the-a conference
sponsored by the association of
inspector generals in which I
received
my official certification as a inspector general.
It is a 40 hour course where
you have to
-you have to have a certain
knowledge of auditing, inspecting, oversight of
law enforcement, all of the different disciplines that are required of a inspector general.
You have to have a certain proficiency and when I say a certain proficiency, I
have to take a very hard test and I passed. [Laughter]
I wanted to show everyone --"
2024-09-06,alright!
2024-09-06,"my official professional
certification as a certified inspector general.
Very proud of this."
2024-09-06,"certified.
[Applause]"
2024-09-06,"when he told me he completed the course and thought he downloaded a certificate.
I was like, what is that. [Laughter]"
2024-09-06,very impressive.
2024-09-06,"the budget.
I want to end with talking about the budget. Since starting this role, I have been
working with the mayor's budget office
and the dta finance team and budget legislative analyst to develop a reasonable budget for this next fiscal
year that the mayor and board of supervisors MAY approve.
On JUNE 14, we presented our budget
needs for the 2024-2025 fiscal year to
the board of supervisor budget and
appropriation committee. I understand the public is anxious for
us to get this office fully operational. We are too.
However, in light of the tremendous
budget deficits that san francisco is facing, budget cuts are expected.
Were expected and full funding we felt
at that point was unrealistic, so
strategically what we did was, we
presented a sort of piece-meal budget
where we were requesting that the mayor
give us partial funding for
this fiscal
year, and then continue to
build on the agency till we get to the point where
we are in a better fiscal times and we
could be a fully funded agency.
That was not the response we got from
the mayor's budget office, and
that we
were not funded at all, and so -- the only-the reason we have been able to
accomplish everything I talked about
has really been in part of the tremendous support that we received
from executive director paul henderson and department of police
accountability, because without their
support, we would not be where
we are. The person that-if there is a-if you have to give somebody most valuable player at the end of every
sports year, they award the person the most valuable player, the most valuable player for
the inspector general today is marshall khine.
Can you join me in giving him a hand? [Applause]
So, for the public, when you are a
inspector general you do need somebody that you can turn left or turn to the right, and they are there to give you
the kind of support that often times
makes you look good.
Marshall is one of those kind of guys
that I can always rely on him for his honest opinion on things.
If I give him an assignment, it comes
back and marshall is expecting me to
say-to come with a lot of red marks on
it, and I am like, this looks great!
I will have to say that so it looks
great, because he does a very very good
job, so I have to highlight his work.
So, as a brand new agency, we
understand that we will probably grow
incrementally, and we'll just keep plugging along.
When we get to the next fiscal year,
we'll be there to again, make our
argument that this should be a fully
funded agency and we play a very
important role in the oversight of the
sheriff's department, and we'll keep plugging along. Thank you."
2024-09-06,"thank you.
I do really want to echo what
terry said about marshall.
Helping coordinate the visits and also, investigator [Indiscernible] Coming
along with us and taking notes and sometimes marshall takes notes so we as
board members don't have to and can really observe and listen and the beauty of having the notes too is that they can bring it the attention of the sheriff's office to ask on things that
need to be corrected and sometimes the small corrections make big impact. I was also impressed with the number of deputies who are fluent in spanish.
When we were at one of the dorm pods in
the annex at cj3, there were some-not english proficient and so the deputy
was able to provide interpretive service.
We also had I think deputy lei has been
there 25 years and the incarcerated in
that pod gave him applause. Where else in a particular jail are you going to hear applause to the deputy? Then there is a petite woman and dont remember her last name, sandy in what is known as the psychiatric ward. I didn't know what to expect when I
went there and I was pleasantly surprised everyone was very engaged. I didn't know if they would be
medicated and they were all applauded
sandy because any time they had a need sandy was responsive. The difficult part is the physical
conditions because we have aging infrastructure, so the annex actually
when I heard it was a horrible place, I was pleasantly surprised. It isn't ideal, but then when you look
at cj1 and 2 in the city, I don't know
if you know measure to build a new jail
and so people voted against it thinking
there will be more people incarcerated
when I viewed it as better conditions for those incarcerated and working conditions for the deputies.
You notice the difference with the round facilities that makes it easier for the deputies to do their work and
allows more freedom for the
incarcerated to move about and to socialize and so, we have gotten away from the linear jail.
That really makes a big difference.
One thing I did want to just really
highlight is, from a safety perspective
at cj1 and cj2 and vice PRESIDENT
Carrion was with us, a lot of those cells actually need meal ports to make
it safer for the deputies and so even just getting some of the doors replaced
is very arduous and so, chief deputy adams just tries to make things work
and it is pretty amazing and then, to
get a paint job, to just get paint so
she has been frugal getting that done.
I encourage all the members when inspector general wiley has a visit for
members to go on visits, because it really is a learning experience and
then also how the incarcerated are housed, because if there are particular people who should not be housed
together, it is like a moving puzzle.
we have been at cj2 before and I expected to see the women on the top floor again, but they had to change
around the population based oen the needs."
2024-09-06,"they do a very very good job.
I know I spoke about ronnie singh
briefly, but what I do want the board
to know that with my comments about
when we started as inspector
general what to expect, what I have seen from ronnie singh as the legal
representative of the sheriff's department, what you want from somebody
in that role is somebody who
understands that knun none of these agencies are perfect, but you want someone who wants the organization to
be at a gold standard, because then
when you bring suggested changes that
make the organization a better
organization, you will get the
kind of open response that typically receive
from ronnie in the times I have been here.
I am very happy she ended up receiving
or being named the head of the sheriff's department legal department."
2024-09-06,"I have a question.
We touched budget is primary issue and concern.
Have you developed or contemplating
developing a systemmatic way of
documenting any potential failures or stressors or challenges that have been
caused because of the staff
shortage? The reason -- obviously in context, I think we have done incredibly well with
what we had to the point though that,  -- I think the board worked very hard I think there is a lot of volunteer work
and I think there was a lot of folks,
whether they were staff at the pda or
whether it was dan or what not, going
above and beyond, right? And, we also don't want to brurn out
the people we have.
We also dont want to [Indiscernible] And labor rules, and we also want to be
able to really think about who is the lack of funding hurting?
What are the concrete ways you
can see that? Obviously that is internal conversation what the systematic
approach would be but interested your thoughts.
If you are taking steps and if you haven't that is something i like to
request."
2024-09-06,"so, one thing that we feel is very
important is that, we are inspector
general office can make a huge
difference in terms of a city and
county's ultimate outcome, we can
prevent lawsuits, and it is preventing
litigation is where the city and county
can save millions of dollars.
When we see inspections and investigation that there are situations that are rising, that if we dont get on
top of, could result in a incident, and could end up in the city and county can
end up in litigation. We are looking at things like that
where we can show that by the
importance of the role of inspector general is one way.
We are also looking at -- quite honesty
vise PRESIDENT Carrion, we have looked
more to focus what we can do to improve the sheriff's department with the little resources that we have.
For example, right now we are  -- I have
marshall working on a just
doing a pay comparison between the sheriff's
department and all of the surrounding
sheriff's departments in terms of -- at
the end of the day, one reason that people want to come to work for you is
if you are paying well, and so we are
doing a study to show that where the
sheriff's office is in that pay scale
and why there are other counties that
are ahead of the curve in terms of
hiring and why san francisco MAY be not
having as much success. I think there are studies that we are
looking at things like that.
In terms of what we can do to improve the funding of the sheriff's department by the city and by the board of
supervisors and the mayor, I thought we
made a very very heavy push for
funding, and so I am hoping that as we
enter into the next fiscal cycle that,
they are going to be more open
to
providing funding.
Some of the early preliminary indications is they are.
We are getting early signal s things will be better. I dont know if that answers your question?"
2024-09-06,"it partially does. I think what I understand, correct if I'm wrong, you have a process where you
are having some analysis that you are
studying different ways to be able to
mitigate the cost of the city, but my main concern is, I see the importance
of the role. And we have that. The commission is created, we have the
inspector general, but now with having a under-resourced institution, we have
these missions and these goals and statutory deadlines that they be getting done because somebody is
working 80 hours, right? That is marshall.
Or whoever the inspectors-if
you is a inspector with too many cases they are
not able to look at it with precision and detail these kinds of cases requires and as someone who lead the investigations and gone through hundreds if not thousands of hours of
detailed body worn camera of 35
personnel in person, and that kind of
thoroughness that these cases need, and I know dpa is doing an amazing job and
I know we will continue producing the
best work possible, but the
fath fath
fact we have no funding will have practical day to day consequences and what I'm highlighting to you is that,
in addition to the larger kind of
policy and general population investigation that you are doing
already with your survey and
you can
quantify, qualify, right, the lawsuits
or what the range has been statistically of lawsuits, but what
does it actually look for the up operation of the office and that might be something that could be brainstormed.
In the future I would like to hear something of what -- this is how now we
had some time we are really seeing
these impacts on how I'm able to operate this."
2024-09-06,"I can tell you this, initially when
we dpot got up and running, what we
saw actually was a drop in the number of complaints, and we didn't
know if
it was because now the ig is here, so people are operating a little
differently because the number of complaints dropped, but I would say
recently, we have seen an
uptick in the
number of complaints.
If the increase we have seen recently continues, then we are going to be
subject to suffering the same problems that the sheriff department is suffering.
They don't have enough personnel to meet the increase in the number of
inmates coming into custody. The result is, they got staff
that are working overtime and they are having to
pay expensive overtime costs and that
long-term isn't sustainable. Without greater funding, you could see the ig office headed in the same direction.
Without proper funding and more cases and not having enough personnel to deal
with the number of cases that it will
not be sustainable.
We will be more then up for putting forth the effort in laying that out for the board of supervisors and the mayor."
2024-09-06,"I was going to say, moving forward
the way I see potential reports and member has been great at making the
reports look really good, I am looking at some of the reports we did while I was oen the commission on the status of women with a family violence council. The first couple were very raw and we got more data, but we were able to have
a matrix in terms of issues that needed
to be addressed immediate, some maybe longer term, but the imp pact when you
think about overall, right now we are focused on the working
conditions, the jails and everything. If we look in terms of the human impact
and don't want to sound we are so grand, but if we have movement where we have services and we have lower recidivism.
These are human lives that if they are
able to become meaningful productive people we should be able to have those services. I know the sheriff --"
2024-09-06,they are meaningful productive people.
2024-09-06,"just saying that every time we turn
around it is like, oh my GOD, [Indiscernible] I am thankful for the dedicated members who even during covid
would push hard to have some of those in-person services and some have not been brought back fully.
I'm talking what we see in long-term
and ideal situation and now
with the
governor we san quintan will be more a rehabilitative setting. That's what I see.
I will not be in the position forever
and I don't know how I got so busy
together but I pulled many all nighter in the office.
As I get older it is harder to recover and balancing my job and this board and my other commitments.
I just have to say, it is such a joy
working with marshall and terry and paul.
I was just commenting to a former commissioner on another board that it
is just amazing and doesn't feel like work. They are working really hard, but it is nice to feel we are making a impact.
Think where we started."
2024-09-06,absolutely.
2024-09-06,as we were drafting a ig job description and hr was great to work with.
2024-09-06,here is a blank page.
2024-09-06,"yeah.
We still are creating and so as I have you all here, I want you to think, this is like the beginning of the school year again. As we put together what we want to do for an entire year, I like to do that
again to make sure we hit particular benchmarks. Right now we are getting to a point
where we can actually discuss policy and use of force is always a big thing
and I am so grateful I get to work with ronnie singh in talking about
particular policies with the sheriff's
office and I know there was a recent over haul, so it is good to know that
we have someone who crafts policy so well and if we have different input we
can put that in there, but I know that
so people in the leadership are very responsive and then just one more point before I forget.
I think it has been moved to next month. It was SEPTEMBER last year, but the
faith in blue that held at cj3 where members of the community go out.
You can also work on the simulator.
Those who have never been in a simulated situation. It is really important I think for us
to get as trained as much as possible
so we understand as we want to make recommendations for policy that we understand the perspective of the peep people in the field doing the work."
2024-09-06,"I will add, when we first started,
the sheriff's department was doing -- having shutdowns, but there were no continuation of services. It was just everything was shut down,
and then once we came in and started evaluating the reason behind the
shutdowns and the impact that shutdowns
had on the inmates, fast forward to today, they are still having shutdowns,
but they found a way to
continue the primary services to the inmates in
terms of inmates taking classes.
And inmates now continuing even though
they are on lockdown, having some of the major services they are able to continue those. Another example was when they were
having the lockdowns it was impacting
visitations of the families.
Now, if they have a lockdown, they now
continue the visitations.
We have seen -- I'm not going to stay that these responses by the sheriff's department is exclusively because of
the ig, but I do think our presence has
helped facilitate some of those changes
that are -- because as I say, the sheriff department is responsive to our suggestions."
2024-09-06,"I think the FEBRUARY meeting we had where the community started
coming with joanna hernandez and some of the people
who had the non profits, I think that
was a important step to really have
word of mouth that we are responsive and want more community input."
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,"I was tracking all these changes no matter how miner because I think sometimes when we have so much work to do, which I think we have so much work
to do and diverse body of work to do,
the small changes I think are one thing
we show progress and show how to be effective working with other people and are easy to forget."
2024-09-06,we try to present a lot that in our news letters.
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,"we cover a lot of the changes and
things going on."
2024-09-06,"just going to say, I want to make sure I didn't lose my train of thought I think I'm hearing. Especially around the budget.
Not just to show the things we are
doing really well, but what are we not able to do because we dont have the budget to do it? That is what I'm hearing is that good balance. Like marshall is phenomenal and if we had two more marshalls, these are things we are not able to take care of because we dont have two more
marshalls. I think able to track and not add more
work, but just being able to share especially pertaining how the legislation is written we are not able to do these things because we dont have
a full team. We are able to do this and unable to do this.
That is what I was hearing in
terms of what I think my colleague was sharing and just wanted to make sure I was hearing correctly. And also just two seconds. Just want to chime in. Just in terms of what we are able to
see at the hospital, zuckerberg.
That was extremely eye ope. Ening.
The lack of daepties are only able to cover 13 on any given day.
When you talk about logistics around contingency plan, deputies are taking
time off and those retiring and call in
sick that day.
Just the maneuvering of what they do around campus was phenomenal to sit down and digest and take in.
I want to share, the biggest question I asked and you are right because marshall and brent are taking arduous notes.
I was happy and said do folks here feel safe? Do the people in the community feel safe?
Do the folks receiving service feel
safe and folks that work at zuckerberg
fell safe and the deputy said yes when we are here especially the workers at the hospital given and surrounding area walking folks to their cars. Sometimes late at night.
They talked about how they interact with sfpd when folks are dropped off by
folks at the police department. It is technology.
These guys are using a mifi inside the hospital. Community based organization we provide
young people with mifi to use at home
and we have a world class sheriff's
department that is having to use a mifi-"
2024-09-06,what is a mifi?
2024-09-06,"how folks connect to the internet. It is small device that only allows so
many devices to attach to it.
Instead of having a router and
connectivity to the internet so
connectivity to the internet -- very spot."
2024-09-06,[Multiple speakers]
2024-09-06,going to be hard to find a radio shack.
2024-09-06,just wanted to chime in on those two things.
2024-09-06,"I was going to ask you and I want to turn it over to you too.
If we could have some kind of matrix so
we are actually keeping tabs and also,
I like to be able to have our board
vote on formal recommendations that you have summarized for us as well, because
I don't want it to be haphazard and I know you had a interim recommendation
that brings to when we discuss the
2024q2 report for the board. As you made recommendations
during your
presentation, later on when sheriff
miyamoto made comments, so it is like redeploy people or taking people off of patrol say, the tenderloin, but it is not necessarily that easy because some are designated for emergency services
so not meant to be in the custody division and need to be out there
anyway as part of emergency services. It is generally 6 people.
That also goes to employment satisfaction because some of the deputies want different experiences and want to be -- and some want to
rotate. That's another big consideration.
I just my vision and I think the rest
of the board shares, when we look at
oversight, it isn't just for those incarcerated and families, but also the working conditions of deputies and
their wellbeing."
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,"I just wanted to add.
I came to the cj3 visit."
2024-09-06,that is the big pod. The dorm.
2024-09-06,"it was a
[Unable to hear speaker] [Microphone not on]"
2024-09-06,yes. Yes.
2024-09-06,"the second thing I wanted to note
pause I'm very hot on this is, lockdown
that occur.
The reason being, I think it is
important that there is some maybe like
tracking that we have, because I think that I understand when yfs talking to captain adams, she was like, there are different levels of shutdown.
It isn't the shutdown of the 2000's."
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,[Unaudible to hear speaker]
2024-09-06,okay.
2024-09-06,"the reason being, because I think it
is just to help paint a picture of the
broader context when
unfortunate
incidents like the sheriff  -- assault."
2024-09-06,"the assault on sheriff, yeah.
And that's a good suggestion, because
when I started back in JANUARY, the lockdowns were like everything was
locked down, and there was no
continuation of services. Everything was locked down. Then once we started going in and
again, I'm not attributing it to the ig being there and this MAY be something the sheriff department did on their
own, but once we started going in and
inspecting and seeing the impact in
talking to the inmates and hearing the
impact the shutdowns were having on
them, I think that they have since
found a way that now everything is not being locked down. They are able to keep some services
going and visitations going and those
MAY be different levels of -- that is why
I say your suggestion is a good one."
2024-09-06,"ypt to note, I understand the sheriff staff shortages. They are trying to do what they can. I understand that --"
2024-09-06,yeah.
2024-09-06,I want to make sure --
2024-09-06,right.
2024-09-06,"there is history that.
The other thing I wanted to know -- I
actually forgot it."
2024-09-06,"maybe we could have chief adams have
a monthly report or something on the
levels and I don't want to add extra
work, but hopefully we can automate so much of this stuff.
Again, it is just horrible that if the
it system isn't running that a deputy
on patrol can't run a license plate or drivers license and so, the this is another thing. One thing is I want to talk to the new city county it chief, because we
shouldn't have separate systems and I know executive director henderson you are at the police commission meetings.
We should be able to buy-in and have a share and should have a shared system. We shouldn't have separate systems and now that a lot more of the deputies are on patrol as well, sometimes we need to share information anyway and we know
from the justice panel how things slip through the cracks back in the day with
things where women get murdered because the communication wasn't there because it was siloed.
I like to see -- that saves money and we
can have a budget to have investigators
and staff and not MISS Statutory deadlines."
2024-09-06,"yes.
I just have a few things to say of
course.
Thank you for your report. I'm in contact with people
inside the jail quite often.
We do need a new jail with sunlight.
It has already been ordered through the courts that sunlight is very important to human beings.
If you can imagine being in jail, 5,
10, 15 years, I know people in there at least 10 years and not in the sun. These are melinated people.
Can't speak for all people but I know melinated people need the sun because
the sun is a energizer for your melanin. Asking san francisco to create a new
jail with architecture that allows
sunlight to be obtained by the
residents is essential.
That's not up for debate or a political
stance or not a touch on crime
or weak on crime philosophy, that is human right to have sunlight.
There is no where in the law anyone should be punished by throughing in a cave and deprived of human necessity.
That isn't what you are convicted of
and held for until we decide whether you need sunlight or not so that should
be a priority for the sheriff and mayor
london breed if she is reelected or whatever mayor elected coming up.
Sunlight for human beings. Lockdowns are lock downs with you are locked down. Let's get that understood.
If you have never spent time in your
bathroom and given hot meal once in two sack lunches to eat and that is all you
do for a week, you don't know what a lock down is anyway. For the people not locked down and say there are different type of lock down.
People who are locked down, lock down is lock down. Whether for covid or somebody did something or somebody got hurt.
It is lock down and human beings are not designed to be on lock down. That should be a human rights violation. There are other first world countries around this world who don't put people
on lock down as we do in the united
states and specifically in california in most cdcr.
We won't go there, but we have already seen what that is. The food revolution is justice for people.
We are already knowing that on corner
stores in the tl and other deprived food deserts they are serving poison
out of the store that you get -- [Indiscernible] Red dyes.
When you go into jail and forced to eat
what they give you and no nutritious
value and melinated people what they are serving is anti-health that is a prpt. You cant represent in court when you starve of nutritious value or type of value deemed necessary for your type of body. There are all different people who have different types, it isn't just because
I'm lactose intolerant or glucose thing. There is food certain bodies need in order to be healthy and thriving and functioning to represent yourself in court to save your life.
That is a human right.
Last but not least, deputies and the construction and function of
the jail
system in general, I had a opportunity
to read law enforce ment the history hof law enforcement in america
while in
jail and surprisingly what the system
we have is a system designed to be
better then the stock hold system like
put in wooden blocks and be humilinated
so decided we need the old system where
you get to talk to GOD and that rehabilitate you. We see that doesn't work.
We need social justice, architectural scientist who understand what a good system in holding a person until he or
she is brought or have their
day in court and justice is [Indiscernible] That is not behind bars.
there are people who can control and
need extra security, but in general,
people don't have to be locked up to be
held for court like again, 5, 10, 15
years in that type of situation. It isn'tue main.
It is system based off-I won't go into
detail, but based off a mindset that is incorrect. Inhuman, unhealthy and scientifically wrong. Just wrong.
In all of our redesigning of all these things, we really need to look at everything and even deputies they have a job to do and they have done a good job. I hear reports things are getting better and so on so forth, but free
staff, people who have a community
investment to make sure our community
members inside are getting the adequate resources and services to make sure that they are developing and when they
get out like julie said, are productive
citizens following in the system of community, right? We can hire free staff.
You don't have to have a gun to help people or escort from point a to b.
Last but not least, some of the qualifications on becoming a deputy we
have to look at and reevaluate are they
necessary as for example, being
disqualified if you smoke weed.
We is as legal as alcohol is.
Alcohol doesn't show up in your blood if tested because you have a faster way
getting out of your system but you shouldn't come to work high or drunk or
any type of mental incapacity.
Even anger and having problems or take
it out on people there. Reevaluateing what creates allows to
qualify for a deputy and really
advertising and marketing to the
communities that are patrolling
our neighborhoods and super vising our jails so people who want tomake a difference in the system are inputed
and those who are old school and are
there to take out some type of childhood trauma or weed it out so we
can have this type of hiring.
There would be more people who-I wanted
to be a sheriff as a kid, but bob marly told me didn't shoot the deputy, but he shot the sheriff. As I bring this to a close, we have to take a better look how we are treating
people who are being held and some are innocent until proven guilty, are held
as they wait for their day in courts or
days and months and years in
court. That's all."
2024-09-06,"that is a lot of food for thought.
Thank you member palmer.
Do we have public comment?"
2024-09-06,"for members of the public who like
to comment onite in 6, please approach
the podium."
2024-09-06,"good afternoon. Congratulations to you two.
My name is joshua, cochair for [Indiscernible] Latino task force. Looking forward meeting with you soon.
Just one thing I didn't hear was the
recent death at cj2.
I was a case manager.
[Difficulty hearing speaker]
I think wanted a update to if there is
not, I understand it is early.
When there is what would be accessible
where and yeah, so I think that is good [Indiscernible] Also secondly, if you don't have the proper funding, is that going to intervene with this
investigation or going forward?"
2024-09-06,"yes, so, naturally this is something that just happened and we are
not able
to publicly comment on the current

2024-09-06,"item 7, department of police accountability report.
Informational item. Marshall khine chief attorney will
present on sheriff investigation for
2024 q2 by the department of police accountability. MR. Khine."
2024-09-06,"good afternoon board members.
Hope you had a restful summer and congratulations on reelection PRESIDENT
Soo, and PRESIDENT Elect brookter and again, thank you for all of
your work
and input and insightful suggestions
outgoing vice PRESIDENT Carrion. Echoing appreciation for how committed and engaged this board is
seeing you at all these events nights and weekends. Really appreciate how committed you all
are to this work. I have 15 minutes.
I will try to accomplish it in 10 minutes.
This very exciting data report for q2.
This will cover APRIL, MAY and JUNE of
2024.
We'll move through in 3
sections. First, stats, we'll go over trends, these are small numbers. Again for the benefit of the public who MAY not tuned in before, the department of police accountability currently provides investigative services for complaints against sheriff deputies and very limited classes of misconduct allegations.
This is through a operating agreement that exist between the department of police accountability and the sheriff office and we are continuing this work
while the inspector general is working
on getting the funding to hire the investigators to take over the work. But, just so the public is clear, this does not represent the universe of work
the office of inspector general will later talk on.
Only a small subset. The remaining complaints are being investigated by the internal affairs unit within the sheriff's office.
We'll go over highlights on the ways the department of police accountability
has been supporting the office of
inspector general in quarter 2, and up
coming and ongoing projects.
For the cases opened and closed in
quarter 2, we see a larger trend for increasing trends of cases from quarter
1 to quarter 2, and as you can see from
the chart, the cases have increased year over year over the past 3
years.
Fortunately now dp a has three years worth of data.
For cases closed, again, from previous
years we are closing more cases with 15 cases closed in quarter 2, consistent
with the 15 cases we closed in quarter 1, but significantly larger number of cases closed then in previous years.
I think it's accumulated expertise with
staff now in handling these type of investigations. I wanted to acknowledge the hard work of senior investigators brent who has really helmed the investigative efforts
and oversaw a number of investigators that have performed the sheriff
investigations over the past 4 to 5 years.
Since the department of police accountability contracted or agreed to
take over the limited classes of sheriff investigations.
Our case pending is not really
a very
informative chart because this
fluctuates week to week and day to day.
We have seen a surge in the cases the inspector general referred to and taken
in about a dozen cases and an additional tragic death investigation.
The case load has significantly
increased these past couple weeks. Throughout this particular quarter, I
think we covered around 20, 25 cases.
We are struggling to manage the case
load, but as it is right now, i think
it is still manageable, but hopefully
we won't see a continuation of surge
and the trend will level out.
This is a representation of the case findings for 2024 in quarter 2, we
actually did not find any sustained
allocations out of the 50 allegations
the vast majority were exonerated. We are continuing to utilize the finding of insufficient efforts or not
sustained infrequenly isn't a finding
that is preferred for the simple
reason, it is really a finding that
doesn't offer findings.
Being able to either sustain or
exonerate or some cases make a
unfounded find ing determination is far preferable because that means our investigation lead us to a much more conclusive and positive result then
simply relying on insufficient evidence.
I also want to take a moment to explain the term, referrals because referral is
used in a number different ways within it department.
Could be a case referred from another agency for investigation. Ahn timeatize is from the sheriff
office when the case comes into the sheriff office as complaint the internal affairs unit will evaluate whether or not that falls within the class [Indiscernible] Letter of
agreement and make the referral to the dpa.
Evaluated through intake, conduct preliminary investigation.
Sometimes the cases come from the public. If a case comes from the public and determined not to fall within the scope of our jurisdiction, we'll refer to the appropriate agency for investigation.
In many occasions, we will need to initiate an investigation in order to make determination as to
whether or not
that case is one that we have the
jurisdiction and authority to investigate, and sometimes after
considerable amount of time and effort,
we would have opened the case,
identified the type of allegations and
referred back to the appropriate department or prefer to the appropriate department because we don't have the jurisdiction to investigate
that type
of allegation.
The next slide is I understand very difficult to see from a distance, but it provides a much more granular breakdown of the type of allocations from the q2 closures. You all have copies of the report.
If there is any questions that arise from this particular slide, please feel free to reach out.
The only real take away is that the
vast majority of misconduct allegation
s continues to be unnecessary
or excessive force constituting 29 out of
the 50 allegations.
Demographics for case closures
in q2. Self-reported from the populations that
cases that were closed.
15 cases closed in q2.
13 of them provided identifying information, 2 anonymous.
Only two provided age information,
which is why we only have two sections
identified as one in the [Indiscernible] 51-60 group.
What we do see here in terms of the racial breakdown is, in quarter 2 versus quarter 1, significant increase
in the proportion represented as hispanic or latinx which is consistent with the trends. We have been hearing about
increase in
the hispanic latinx population so now comprising a larger proportion of the complainant demographic then we have
seen in the past and of the identified
genders 67 percent are male. Some additional information about the complaint sources from the
cases closed
in q2, from q1 to q2, we have seen a significant increase in the number of cases that have come in online, which is something we definitely want to see and want to see more of.
Q1 we saw 50 percent of the complainants made complaints by
phone and 50 referrals from other agencies, primarily the sheriff office.
In quarter 2, from the case closures, now that again these case
closures are
all delayed, statistic because it can
take generally 6 to 9 months or longer in order to close a case, so there is a delay when we implement a system when we start seeing the stats reported in the case closures for that particular quarter.
We went online with the complainant
system fairly roontly and now seeing 33 percent reporting online.
The digital reporting system as
you
know and I described are preferable for data purposes. It allows to define the data required to be put in the system to file a complaint. It allows to create dropdowns so we are
able to remove subjectivity how the data is tabulated t. Takes the time out
of having to defifer difficult to read handwriting and more efficient because
it eliminates the need to enter
data
multiple times. This is a new slide we didn't have the q1 report so that we are little
more up to date on how the information is
flowing in on the new complaint from quarter 2.
Here, unlike in the case closures we are seeing the locations where the
cases are coming in or originating prom
is far more varied in different
locations now we are seeing some locations we haven't seen complaints
from before where the sheriff provides
security at poke street. We had a small representation from city
hall from 70 oak grove and san
francisco general hospital.
We also have a breakdown of the new complaint allegations of the type of allegations. Nothing large enough for anything to
rely on statistically, but for your
information.
I will move through the q2 highlights pretty quickly.
In terms of support for office of new inspector general.
Q1, we had announced the launch of the new system.
I can update this board that we
successfully migrated the historical data from the sheriff investigation into the new case management
system. We implementing the new system into the investigative workflows.
A lot of the data that is reported in this report was harvested from the new
case management system. And inspector general referenced our finance team played a large role in supporting the office of inspector general in the budget process and budget presentation.
We also recently used in the last
quarter the platform of the california
civilian oversight alliance conference to elevate the profile of the new
inspector general having him headline a panel about oversight and the
importance of racial equity and
inclusion in oversight.
It was a very distinguished
panel with [Indiscernible] Berkeley office of
director of police
accountability.
Lastly, ongoing future projects.
We are still working on a cloud based file system that will offer a lot more
flexibility in the way that we manage our cases.
We are going to implement-we recently
implemented that oen the dpa
cases for sfpd investigations and once we worked out any issue with that, we will try to implement that for the sheriff cases, which will allow the investigators the flexibility of accessing their case
files anywhere they need to out in the
field in remote work without need for vpn.
The electronic complaints in setting up
jail kiosk and putting in jail tablet, the inspector general MAY have mentioned before that that project is on hold.
we don't want to open the flood gates for complation until we have the staff to accommodate the investigations but that is in discussion with the sheriff
office and certainly seems feasible.
We are also working with the sheriff office in a major recommendation on
updating their use of force tracking systems, and the use of force laws,
which are all tabulated from paper documents siloed in different locations
within the jails. Centralizing electronic system will hopefully improve our ability to have insight into the prevalence of use of force within the jail because we have found and reported back to the sheriff
office many occasions where we have
inadequate or erroneous use of force
documentation in the use of force laws. We are also working with the sheriff
office in trying to create and
eventually launch standardized
guidelines to create a more transparency and consistent system for
the sheriff to implement
discipline while of course the individuals that receive discipline are going to be
afforded the con[Indiscernible] The
guidelines allow the public to see for any particular -- the range of disciplines that the sheriff would likely impose. Of course, sheriff maintains full discretion, but having a set of guidelines will hopefully achieve a
better level of consistency, as well as
inform the members of the department
what to expect for variety of different
improper conduct and misconduct. The dashboard that referenced before
has moved significantly forward.
We are hoping to move away from static reports.
Where you just see data on a piece of
paper or in a presentation like this
and being able to move all that data into a dynamic system where you are able to filter out the information that you need close to in real time.
It will be data that we'll try to
update on a weekly basis.
Dpa will move first with the sfpd data
and we expect that to move forward quickly and I'm hopeful bay the end of the calendar year we are able to do it
with the sf data.
And then last but not least, we are still continuing to work on the project
that was suggested by board member
carrion.
The work hours and complaint
correlation study.
We have been in contact with the data analyst from the sheriff office as a
suggestion of sheriff miyamoto. Lucas jennings is a fantastic data analyst. We went through the data collected the past 2 years and there is still a lot
more work we need to do.
We collect the data relating to overtime and deputies complained about,
we need to be able to create a baseline
that's of the hours that all the deputies that worked did not receive a
complaint about so we are able to draw
some comparative analysis as to the
frequency where long shifts potentially is related to higher frequency of complaints, but we will not know that
until we go through a fairly cumbersome
data collection process and as
has been referenced before, the time sheets and
overtime sheets are managed by paper, so also will be a lot of work to tabulate. We are working on faiguring what the
asks will be and then requesting those
resources from the sheriff office.
That in a nutshell."
2024-09-06,"great. Can I add something to the work hours?
I think I like to know years of experience.
It is a little more difficult, especially with newer trainees. We come from a generation now where
people are oen the electronic devices
and can't necessarily read body language and assess particular situations before they escalate, so I
think it might be helpful for training purposes to know your experience."
2024-09-06,"I will make a note. That is a excellent suggestion we heard
from the sheriff staff that the new
generation of deputies coming in often times have far less experience because many while on-boarded during the covid
period were working in a lockdown
facility, which is very different then a facility where they have to interact with the inmates on a much more regular basis.
They look at initial experience of much more open jail setting, so I think that
is a point very well taken."
2024-09-06,any questions or comments by my colleagues? Excellent report. Thank you.
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,we have more complaints and particularly the excessive force complaints?
2024-09-06,okay.
2024-09-06,something for us to look forward to.
2024-09-06,"I also want to say-I really appreciate the evolution of the reports visually.
I think this is really accessible and pretty clear-cut to the point I can look at it and anticipate what you were going to say and that's exactly what we want for people that are not able to
come to these meetings kwr still want the information so I want to acknowledge that."
2024-09-06,thank you.
2024-09-06,"this is just for future.
[Unable to hear speaker] Next quarterly report."
2024-09-06,would you like us to have questions q & a?
2024-09-06,yeah.
2024-09-06,"the next meeting?
If you want to bring --  -"
2024-09-06,"I will ask my questions quickly.
Slide 5 and 6, what are the reason frz
the cases being exonerated?"
2024-09-06,sorry?
2024-09-06,the slide 5 exonerated.
2024-09-06,yes.
2024-09-06,the majority is misconduct.
2024-09-06,"yes. We reach a point we are able to determine based on the evident that it
was the actions taken by the person who
is accused of misconduct, the actions were within policy lawful and
justified.
The vast majority are use of force
incidents and the body worn camera we
are able to gather footage is
increasing as well as our
ability to utilize the surveillance camera footage.
Gives a lot more insight what occurred.
Often times the allegations the force was unnecessary and we are able
to see
what preceded and how it was precipitated and how the deputies handle them sevl and the level of force they utilize.
We will go from what preceded the incidents on the video from witness accounts all the way through to medical
records to see exactly what the effects
that use of force were in order to
arrive at a exonerated.
If we are unable to determine if the use of force was justified and
that is rare occasion, that's when you end up
with a not sustained or insufficient evidence."
2024-09-06,"I'm just seeing the same carryover
trend from the quarterly reports that misconduct tends to be the highest, and
it gets exonerated. The likelihood of anything happening
from clients reporting is sounding very
slim to none, so I just wanted to kind of highlight that."
2024-09-06,"yeah.
Certainly I think use of force is
historically the most common allegation against the deputy.
That falls under the misconduct
category, and use of force at least on
whether of not use of force was
justified, lawful and within policy,
those cases often times do get justified and exonerated. There are occasions where use of force
is unnecessary and that would be
sustained allegation or use of force
was excessive where it exceeded what was required in order to accomplish a lawful or legitimate purpose
and those are sustained."
2024-09-06,anything further?
2024-09-06,"MADAM PRESIDENT, we will have to continue lines 8 and 9."
2024-09-06,"yes, thank you dan."

Yes. It's great being up here. Kind of a floppy microphone for
you. No problem, well, good
afternoon, everyone. So I will
start off by, discussing,
probably what has been the biggest news regarding the sheriff's department. And, and
we're talking probably mid MARCH
through late APRIL, that period
in which, there were ten
deputies assaulted and one
civilian, an employee, assaulted
at, at the jail in san bruno, in
response, the sheriff ordered two jail lockdowns, the first being from APRIL 12th through
APRIL 18th and the second being from APRIL 28th through MAY 1st,
and that was to investigate the
cluster of assaults. Over the past two months, I've been
gathering input from numerous sources, about the recent jail
lockdowns to better understand,
the cause and contributing factors to the lockdowns, but
also the impact of the
lockdowns, and with the lockdown, the impact the
lockdowns have had on inmates,
families of the inmates, the jail staff and on programing
services, his the attorney client, communications and
visitation, and then we looked
at ways to address, the
underlying problems to avoid the lockdowns of the whole facility.
and to reduce the length of the
lockdowns and mitigate the collateral impacts of the
lockdowns, as a result of all of
this, on MAY 14th, the board of supervisors called a meeting in
which they asked for, the
inspector general, sheriff
miyamoto, public defender, chief
angela chan, and, oh, the deputy sheriff's association PRESIDENT,
ken lamba to present on this issue. And basically give our
perspectives of the assaults, the lockdowns and just the
overall, situation. One board member, mike nguyen, was also
present. And provided his thoughts during public comment,
that entire, three hour event
was on, sfgate, gtv, and as
PRESIDENT Su indicated, it's
probably a worthwhile, view of
kind of where we are with the situation with the sheriff's department. It ended up being a
three hour, hearing, and so the
what, what the inspector general
provided were the following.
First, we looked at and we let the board of supervisors know
the complaints that we have been
hearing, and one, of course, the complaints about the extended
lockdowns, and the profound effects they were having on the daily routine of the inmates, specifically their ability to
shower for, you know, hygiene,
spend time outside the cell and just get some fresh air and
sunlight, there was a reduction of programing opportunities,
limited, limited access to commissary and service providers
and really preventing them from
visiting family and loved ones,
it interfered in many cases with their ability to interact with
their attorneys, and caused, and
this was really the big one. The
biggest complaint was, was from
inmates who had nothing to do
with the assaults. And yet they
were suffering lockdowns. And so they felt like they were being
punished for something that they did not do and had had nothing
to do with. So we looked at,
well, what is what is some of the under what are some of the underlying reasons that are causing, well, we understand what are causing the initial
lockdowns, but what is causing
the length of the lockdowns and
the clearly understaffing was
one of the big reasons, for the extended lockdowns. Currently,
the sheriff's department has
195, vacancies for sworn
personnel, and that number MAY fluctuate from week to week, the
custody operations in are the
custody operations division is
at about 78. Staffing so they're
at 386 deputies out of 494, so there are approximately 108
deputies short of their custody
operations, when ken lamba of
the deputy sheriff's association
presented, he gave a snapshot of the staffing levels over the
past six years. And in 2019, the sheriff's department was and
this was pre-covid, the
sheriff's department was down only 48 deputies. And so they
were, at 766 deputies, 2020,
they were down 76 deputies. In
2021, they were down 109
deputies. And between 2021 and 2024, they were down 175
deputies and currently today
we're at that 175, what we also
concluded that was that clearly they need to fill those
positions. But what is created
the situation that's currently created is an overreliance on
overtime, and it's mandatory
overtime of the deputies, and we
found that the deputies are
working an average of 28 hours
overtime time per week. The mandatory overtime and long
hours overtime tax fatigues and
stresses, the staff causing morale problems and mood
disorders. And clearly, this can lead to chronic health and
mental problems so that the
overtime is very taxing on the staff and the overtime is also
very costly to the city and county of san francisco. So
decreasing staff over the years has exacerbated, has been exacerbated by significant
increases in the jail population
in, probably the over the last
two years, we have seen an
increase from about 800 inmates
to about 1200. Today and we also see that in the future,
continuing to rise, now the increase in the jail population has led to, of course,
overcrowding in the jails. And
required the sheriff to open up
a new jail annex to address the
overcrowding, it stressed it
stretches staff, to cover more
areas, the additional jail annex areas, well, additional jail
annex areas are available, but will require more staff to open
them up, if they keep moving at the pace they're moving in terms
of the increase in the jail
population, and all of it decreases the quality of life of both the deputies and the
inmates. So the causes, as I said, that we heard of the
lockdowns in APRIL, were due to increase assaults on on deputies , the sheriff locks the jail
down following the violent incidents to address first, the
incident and investigate whether
the incidents are isolated or or determining whether they're
dealing with a more pervasive problem. Is it something that's a more organized assault on the
deputies, the sheriff's
department MAY need to deploy staff. Well, generally, what
happens when you have an assault at, because they're already
understaffed. They have to do a redeployment of staff so that they can conduct the
investigation and that, in the
end, results in the shutdown, because of the redeployment of
staff, and collective bargaining
agreements, require or specify a
minimum staffing level in, in
designated areas and shifts. And
so the sheriff has to meet those , those specific minimum
requirement s, which is the
result. And as a result, he has to redeploy personnel in order
to meet those requirements, now,
the sheriff's department also onboarded nearly 300 new
deputies over the past four
years, many of those deputies started during during the covid
lockdowns and do not have a lot
of experience with in open
setting of inmates, and that is has been a little bit of a problem in that the deputy, the new deputies just don't have as much experience, dealing with
the inmates as, the or the
deputies that were hired
pre-covid, also, there's been a
big change in the composition of
the inmates, primarily due to bail reform as a result of bail reform, the concentrated inmate
population in san bruno, coming
out of the pandemic, pandemic
era as a result of bail reform, tends to be those in those
inmates that have that have, that are in there because of more serious and violent offenses, whereas the
individuals that are, there for the lower level offenses that in the past MAY have been housed at
santa at at san bruno are now
they're staying an average of about seven days. And so the
result is the long term, inmates are there for more serious and
violent offenses. And a more
difficult, population in, to
manage. And, and as a result,
they pose, a more serious consequences to the deputies if
anything gets out of hand. And,
as a result, we also saw, that
because there are so because of
there's been a ramp up, in the city of the arrest of drug
offenders and, and, well, really drug offenders, what you find in
the, the population has changed
in that you see more individuals
in custody who are detoxing or
mentally unstable, because of
that increase in, in the ramp up
outside and the arrest of those
individuals. And so that poses their own unique challenges in
that now you're dealing with the population, as I said, they're
detoxing, there are more individuals who have mental
health issues. And the personnel and the jail is really not the
best equipped, best place equipped to handle this kind of
population, there's also funding issues with behavioral health in
that behavioral health is not
able to provide 24 hour services to those individuals who are
detoxing or having mental health
issues, and that is, problematic . So what are the recommendations that we
discussed? Well all the recommendations that we
recommended to the board of
supervisors to consider, one would be the redeployment of
staff. You know, I know that there are quite a number of
deputies that the sheriff has
redeployed to assist with, the drug enforcement and the issues
going on in the tenderloin. And
that has taken individuals, out
of the jail and onto the streets
. But by being on the streets, they're not performing. Those
are non-core functions as, of
deputy sheriffs, the core
functions of deputy sheriffs are
, to control the jail and manage
the jail. And so in order to reduce the reliance on mandatory
overtime, then our
recommendation is to redeploy that staff that's currently on the streets, back to the jails
and not for an extended period
of time, but at least to give
the sheriff an opportunity to,
increase the staffing levels, the other is to increase the
investment by the city and
county into recruitment efforts of the deputy sheriffs or the
sheriff's department, for
example, currently, the san
francisco sheriff's office has one dedicated employee to full
time recruiting, while, the san
francisco police department has
12, individuals who are exclusively dedicated to
recruitment. The deputy sheriff's association
association also recommended,
some salary incentives, by
having new deputies start at
step two as opposed to step one,
also, they could consider coordinating their efforts with
the police department and do a national recruitment effort, help with relocation expenses,
possibly, we saw another problem is that they need to speed up
the hiring process. The sheriff's department has an
insufficient number of
individuals, of background staff, investigators to process
applicants. So currently they
have nine full time and two part
time background investigators. But there were occasions where
those background investigators
were redeployed because of understaffing at the jail. So
those, so the work that they
should have been doing, doing background investigations that
had to stop so that they could
be a backfill, for the
understaffing with the jail. And
so we recommended that they consider outsourcing their
background, investigations by
either, giving handing over the background investigations to the
department, to the department of human resources, san francisco's department of human resources,
or consider outsourcing the background investigations. So,
for example, san mateo sheriff's
, outsource, their background investigators. So they have six
full time deputy sheriffs doing
backgrounds and then they have
15, individuals that they've outsourced doing their backgrounds. And so that's
another, way to speed up the
hiring process, but, you know,
at the end of the day, they need an increased budget to add
individuals to their recruitment
team, we also looked at their
operation in terms of, the programing that occurs inside of
the jail. And we found that,
they're also needs to be some
budget increases to improve, the pretrial division services,
diversion services as, to add more case managers to the
pretrial diversion services, of
course, jail behavioral health because of the change in the
population with the inmates,
there needs to be more, staffing
of behavioral health, to deal with, you know, those
individuals that are going through detox, mental health
issues, but also reentry and
discharge, and, finally, to
upgrade the technology, to support the ability to better monitor the jails with less
manpower. So that was our
assessment to the board of
supervisors, we also continue to meet with community based
organizations. So we met with the san francisco jail justice
coalition. We're trying to meet with them once a quarter because they're very involved with the
inmates. And so we, met with
them at and, we also found that
they are able to provide,
assistance with the assessment of, of real time what's going on
with the inmates, so that that
there we attended their meeting and, and got some pretty good
feedback from them, we also met
with sonny schwartz and eileen
hurst, sonny sonny schwartz was
was the program director of the jail under, sheriff's mike
hennessy and vicki hennessy,
their administration's. And
eileen hurst was, a, upper management person in the
sheriff's department during that
era, they were absolutely, a
wealth of knowledge in terms of really looking at the operation
pre-covid. And, sonny schwartz
was, was just had all kinds of
information on the programing that was going on. So we were
able to get a real good look at
what the programing looked like, in past years, compared to what
it looks like today. And eileen
hurst was just, able to provide
just such an in-depth history, lyrical perspective of the
sheriff's department. So I find
that they those two will continue to be really, really
strong resources, that, you
know, as we deal with, with and face problems that we have to
assess, they're great resources
to go to and kind of get an idea
of how these issues were dealt
with in the past, we also,
participated in the california civilian oversight alliance
conference that was hosted by the department of police accountability here in san
francisco. So, it was a great
conference. I was one of the
panelists, along with the naco PRESIDENT, anthony fennell and
the berkeley director of police accountability, hansel aguilar.
And we focused on and had a
conversation about racial equity
in police oversight. And the importance of racial equity and police oversight. I thought was
very valuable. Program that we
participate in that day. And I
want to thank PRESIDENT Sue and board member palmer, who both
attended and engaged in the discussion with everyone about
these issues. And so it was
really, really a valuable,
program to participate in. And then I'll end by saying that,
unfortunate. Early on MAY 28th,
we had a death in custody, while
the inmate was constructively in the sheriff's department's
custody, he was actually under the care of doctors in zuckerberg general hospital. So
he died at the hospital, and, he
had some severe medical
conditions, and I can't publicly comment any further on that
investigation, but we're continuing to follow the
investigation. And I would note that within 20 minutes of his
passing, we were notified by the sheriff's department of this incident, which bodes well for,
that kind of communication going on between the inspector general and the sheriff's department.
Thank you. Thank you, do we have any questions or comments from
members? Member. Okay. Thank you , MR. Wiley. It was really I
really appreciate the context. It was a very thorough lay of
the land of all the things that are going on, a few questions
for me. You spoke about the lockdowns. Did they mention how
long the length of the lockdowns
is and how often it occurs? Yeah weekly basis, monthly basis that
that was well, it it varies
because it's really incident. You know, if there's an incident
that creates the lockdown and so
there's no, specific time, although we did hear that there
were daily lockdowns at 11 A.M.
Or 11. Yeah, 11 a.M, but I wasn't we weren't able to confirm that there's a daily
lockdown at 11 a.M, like, that really meets what we call a
lockdown. And we consider a lockdown to be. You can't leave your cell. You can't even groom
and shower. You're in your cell,
now, we did find that the APRIL
12th through the 18th was a six
day lockdown. And so. So, which is pretty lengthy. Six days of
no programing, you know? And so
we're, we're we're still trying to figure out why that was so
long and, and, and APRIL 28th
through MAY 1st was a four day
lockdown. And so those but I will say this, that the assaults on the deputies were serious
assaults and did require some
investigation by the sheriff,
and, but we're still figuring
out why so long. Okay. I mean,
I'm going to ask either from your team or the sheriff's
department for a number, okay? Because I want to know in
context of how often that happens. And I know you
mentioned, that there is a difference between long term clients versus short term clients, long term clients being
that there was a finding that
there were probably more serious cases. I do remember an angela
chan from her, the public defender's office, that she mentioned that a lot of these cases are like, are also
attributed to the backlog of court cases that does contribute
to it. So part of it is, you
know, with covid, it's the
system slowed and these cases were not being adjudicated. But
what we're really what we're seeing today is that because of
bail reform, individuals that probably three years ago would
be kept in custody are now being
released. And so the result is the majority of the individuals
that we've seen in custody are there for the more serious and violent offenses. Yeah. Okay.
That's good to know. Okay and then I know, you know, I
mentioned this before and I
agree that the understaffed is a
huge issue for everyone is and I just wanted to mention that I
think that in peril, I am of the belief that we also need to
parallel path to bring that jail
client population down. And whether it's like looking at the
population that has less serious crimes or like, I don't know,
missing minors to kind of help
them to get out of the system,
because I think it attributes to the overcrowding issue. You spoke about the understaffing issue, the backlog of cases. If we help bring that client
population down, it's going to
help everyone. Right. And then, I also know, I know you
mentioned the deputies, the
shortage when you work when they were comparing, I don't know if that number is coming from you or from the sheriff's department, but what is that
compared to? Like you mentioned,
20 and 19, 48, under staffing,
2020 grew to 7621 to 2024, 175.
What's the benchmark? Well,
first of all, these numbers were provided to the board of
supervisors by the deputy
sheriff's association. And the numbers appear to us to be
consistent with what we also
were finding, now, we did not have the month of the year by
year breakdown like they, they
had. But, we're we're seeing
this pretty consistent, increase in the number of, of deputies
that the sheriff's department is down and it's, and it's
attributed to a combination of
things. It's attributed to,
there are individuals that are just up for retirement, and but there's also individuals who are choosing to leave. Right,
because of the, a lifestyle. I
don't know if lifestyle is the right word, but, that, you know,
it's a stressful environment. totally. And then even, like,
working overtime, nobody wants to work overtime if they're
stressed out. So I, I understand I guess I'm trying to
understand, like what is it
comparing it to. Is it like, is
it comparing to 20 1020 like I
that's what. Well we're not we're not really comparing it to
anything. We're looking at
really pre-covid like okay,
pre-covid, when you look at those years like 2007, 2008,
they were fully staffed and but you get to 2019 and you started
seeing that the, the number of
people that were leaving was far outpacing the number of new
hires. And and from 2019, each
year, that number continues to grow. Now, it's a phenomenon
that all departments across the
country are suffering. So you go to any police department around the country and they are having a hard time filling the vacant the vacancies, and the sheriff's
department is no different than
than what's happening all over
the country, which is why so many departments are investing
in the recruitment, I mean, there's a department that was
offering, new hires, 50,000, $50,000 bonus just to take the
job, and so we're seeing the same thing happen with san francisco. I mean, they're really struggling trying to find
candidates. Yeah I don't know if
that answers your question, but, but, I mean, I, I guess I
remember with the sheriff's training that they were speaking to that about the like a lot of
the like almost half the staff
is going to be retired out. Yes. And this is going to become a bigger problem. And I agree i understand the like the severity
of this issue. Right. Like it impacts the jail population as
well. Yeah. I mean there's got to be a bigger investment in the recruitment. And one full time
deputy is that that that's a you know, you need more people
recruiting. Thank you. Any other
questions or comments from. I
have a few myself. Palmer. What constitutes an assault that
requires a lockdown? Well I mean
I think that when a inmate
assaults a deputy and the, the
deputy is, needs assistance. That's an assault. Now, I know that the sheriff had a press conference in which they had
photos of the results of some of the assaults, and one one
assault, for example, the inmate
knocked the deputy, down, and he fell flat down on the cement and
had a softball type not on the
back of his head, so that was a
serious assault in another in
another deputy, the inmate did
him, through his uniform and broke the skin through the
uniform. So it was a very
serious bite, I mean, those would be typical of what we
would consider a serious
assault. And I don't want to minimize assaulting, law
enforcement personnel, because
that's a serious situation, and I didn't want the public to think that what they see in the movies and on tv, where people are getting shanked and killed. So I wanted to differentiate
reality and fiction, and so if
these are the, the nature of assaults where they're getting
beat bit or pushed down, that seems to be again, I'm not
minimizing the assault, but that seems to be a clear cut investigation. This person pushed this guy down, or this person got bit by this person,
so that wouldn't require a six
day lockdown, right? That's what we're trying to get to the
bottom of. Okay that, I think
that that is the big question is
that why does the jail have to
be shut down for six days? And
why? Well, that that is, that's
that's a question. Yeah. So, so far in your reports, we haven't heard of any assaults to where a
deputy got stabbed or choked out
or his life, like, directly was
in danger, not that we're aware
of. No. Okay are the assaults,
the assailants, are they
mentally ill or detoxing? Are is
there any evidence that shows that they MAY be a part of,
street organizations, we don't
have that specific information in terms of the specific
individual assaults. And on the individuals that committed the
assaults that that's, that's
still part of an ongoing investigation. And also, can I
just quickly jump in there?
Also, we should tread lightly on talking about the details, because it's still an open investigation. Right? So there's certain questions. I don't think that the inspector general can
answer because it's ongoing, and especially if it's personal
information about the inmate. So I just wanted to know I just want that for all of us. Right. And that's why I just wanted to characterize what things are, because people outside of what we do for a living are experienced in our personal
lives. MAY their thoughts MAY run like, oh my GOD, the deputy is in there getting killed and we just want to make sure if
they are, we want that action to be taken, to, to avoid that and to prosecute that, another
question is the units because in the jail there are certain
categories of people that are
housed together. So, some are people who are sex offenders are
housed together. Some people who are murderers are very violent or house together. And then there are low level offenders that are housed together to, for their own safety, so the units
that are not involved in any of the assaults that are taking
place, how are they treated and
are they put on lockdown as a,
as a I don't want to say retaliation or just safety, but are they suffering the, the
consequences of what some one, one other individual has done
well that, that that was one of
the major complaints by inmates that we spoke with. Right. Because they called me they
called me to complain about
that. So I wanted to just put on record for those who have reached out and said that, hey, we're not doing anything. Why
are we being put on lockdown, so there was a report that there
was a protest in front of cj
two, and it was reported that the jail went on lockdown
because of it. That was relayed by someone who was a resident in the jail. So I don't know if
that's the reason why it was on lockdown. So was the outcome of the engagement with the protesting citizens, that there complaints be heard? And what
was their complaint? Yeah, I, I
have no information that the jail was ever locked down because of a protest outside the
jail. Okay. And I have just two more questions. I know I'm
taking them a while, but just, one solution that I like to
offer for the reduction of the
jail population. Because, yes, I too, am a part of the san francisco jail justice coalition. And one of the things that we suggested, especially
for probation and parole matters , because they can get filled up
with people being violated and just flashes where they're just being investigated are long-term, where they be sent
back to prison, maybe asking the
city to look into secure
transitional housing facilities where these people can be
diverted from our county resources, since it is a state,
probation, parole at least is a
state facility, or agency, maybe we can create secure,
transitional housing facilities where those matters can take
place there. And my last statement are as far as
staffing. I think that staffing,
based on what you have said and based on the word on the street,
is the popularity of being in law enforcement, especially during the social justice movements that have been taking place, have giving law enforcement a bad rap in
general, that could be pretty
much, you know, agreed upon, so
I think it is necessary that all of us, including this board,
make very, intentional strides
to promote what is going good in law enforcement. The changes
that have occurred, that people
concerns are being answered and not just falling on deaf ears
or, just just knowing that, the
people who had marched in protest for so many years, especially after george floyd and so on and so forth, that
they see positive results, moving forward with our law
enforcement. And that way, I
think would garner more, more,
desire to become law enforcement
and to, to help with that popularity. Well, you know it.
I'll just add this one little
piece, MR. Palmer, along those last lines that you said,
there's also two things we
found. We also found that, since
the inception of the inspector general's office, we have seen
the number of reported assaults,
by deputies dropped by at least
50. So we're seeing fewer
reports of complaints against
deputies. And what we also found
, in our evaluations was that the sheriff's department has
gone a very long way in terms of
using de-escalation type
approaches in managing the jail, so those were all very, very
positives, positive developments
that we saw. So, member palmer,
I recall that at, the last meeting, you had mentioned that
you, understood that there was a very positive culture change with the sheriff's office, particularly in custody services
and that's consistent with a news article that came out where
someone in custody is going to
be transferred to another facility, he was happy about
that. Only because of the underlying population now more
serious people who are have
mental illness. As well as drug
and drug issues. So I think that
that's very attributable to, sort of the community kind of
policing community input, the reforms that have been put in
place, so I would like to
encourage that. And I also think
that recruitment is for all of us to do this is a beautiful city. We want to maintain a beautiful city. And that means
that all of us, do the work that
makes it positive. That's why we are all sitting here, as
essentially volunteers to help,
you know, make the city a better city, if others don't have
questions, I'll jump in. Okay. Member wechter yes, I have a number of questions about this and some other things. Okay. First of all, thank you for doing such a comprehensive review of this complex issue. I really appreciate the fact that you met with MISS Hurst and sonny schwartz to get a historical perspective, because having lived through the, michael hennessey years, which
saw dramatic improvements in the
sheriff's department that make it one of the most progressive
in the country, I really appreciate the fact that you talked with them to get that important historical
perspective. You mentioned that you recommended redeploying the
staff. That's currently assigned to patrol duties. How many
deputies potentially could be
shifted on a, let's say, an emergency basis to relieve some
of this mandatory overtime? How many of those who are on patrol
could be shifted to the jail? Well, that's another thing we're
trying to figure out because
there are 130 that are eligible
for redeployment, but there's not 130 being deployed at any
one time. And the sheriff is also taking them from four different divisions and not just
the jail, but the, the core
mission of the sheriff's department is the management of
the jail, so we feel that if there is any redeployment that that's where the priorities
should be. So do you have a
sense of on any given day, how many deputies are assigned to
patrol? Could instead be at the
jail helping to relieve this drastic reliance on overtime? Those those were some of the
questions that came out of the
board of supervisors meeting
that, we have requested, the
sheriff provide us with those with that information and has
that information been provided
yet? Not yet. Okay and then you also mentioned us speeding up the hiring process. And I heard much part of that hearing. Heard MR. Lambda talk about potentially outsourcing
background investigations. Is there a sense of how long a background investigation takes, given the staff the sheriff's
department has versus how long it would take if they outsource this? As san mateo county does, and what the cost for
outsourcing would be for each,
each applicant. Yeah. I as I understand it, the outsourcing
would be no more expensive than
paying the salary of a of a of a
deputy sheriff, so I don't think there would they would the sheriff's department needs is additional funding, so that they
can either hire more people to do the background background
investigation or outsource the
investigations, but but I think that, for example, san mateo sheriff is outsourcing it because they've got manpower
issues. And in order to fill those manpower issues, you've
got to get the backgrounds done
to get the candidates. And right now, I think that that's where
the sheriff's department's
hiring process is lacking, because you can go find the candidates all day long. But they've got to go through the
backgrounds and those agencies
that are able to, as fast as
possible, get their candidates through the backgrounds. They
can, hire them before somebody
else can hire them, because most
of these candidates are in were san francisco's in competitive situations with other
departments. Okay. And then
could you give us an update on the status of your budget request? The mayor recently released her budget. Well, we'll
be making our budget presentation on JUNE 14th to the
board of supervisors. Okay. Can you brief us on what the status
is? Well, the mayor has
basically cut the, inspector
general's budget and basically
did not provide us with a budget. Okay. Is looking at the budget, from the mayor's,
budget. It shows they are
allocating, 1.15 positions. Is
that correct? Yes, but that's
not that's not completely
accurate because there was a, there was a mistake when the numbers were submitted and they
put my position and dance positions in the wrong places.
And so the numbers came out a little different. But at the end
of the day, when you look at where all the numbers are supposed to be, their funding,
the ig and dan lang's position
for next year. So the mayor's budget, if I'm correct, is only funding two position yours and
dan's. Yes. No. Support staff, no investigators, no attorneys,
no auditors. Is that correct? Correct. Then how would you be able to fulfill your charter
mandated mission, well, that'll
be difficult. So so I'm not clear how the charter mandates that there be one investigator
in your office for every 100
deputies. How can the mayor not provide the funding when the charter says it must be
provided? Well, I'm. I'm honestly not going to get into
the politics of it because as
the inspector general, I'm tasked with building an agency
that can conduct proper oversight of the sheriff's
department and, and, you know,
the charter, requires, that we
be allowed, one investigator per
100 deputies, we anticipated that this was going to be a
tough budget year. So we, we
submitted a budget that,
strategically, would allow the city and county to phase in our
agency. So so instead of asking for all the investigators all at
once, we asked for, funding for,
I believe it was three
investigators and, and so it was a really I think our total budget came out to 2.5 million,
that would at least get us some administrative support
investigators and a, one attorney. And that would allow
us to get off the ground. And was your request for the
attorney was that for an 81, 81
assistant chief attorney? Yes and normally an assistant chief
attorneys, supervisors, an entire division. The public
defender's office has, I think, 4 or 5 of them, each of them supervising a division. Yeah but
what given what we have to do, you know, this is an agency that's just getting off the ground. You're, basically
setting out an agency that's
really existing, when you look at what that with that particular lawyer does, that's an that's in an existing agency.
We're not in existing agency. We're trying to build an agency.
Okay as someone who worked on the campaign to establish oversight, right. I'm really
shocked and outraged that you're not getting funding for the
necessary positions of investigators, auditors and
support staff. I think that's essential. The voters very
clearly stated they wanted an office of inspector general to do independent investigations,
systemic evaluations, audits of the sheriff's department. They did not want the department of
police accountability to do it.
So I'm surprised this has not been more in the public consciousness, more in the press , because it seems to be saying we're going to ignore the
charter now. Now, I do support
your your the hiring of staff. I
do not support the hiring of an 8181 assistant chief attorney.
This is sort of going beyond just the inspector general's
report right now. So I'd like to focus. I think I think I think
this is very critical. This is critical for the entire operation of his office over the
next year. And we've been following we've been following his budget presentations and we have been speaking with
supervisors. So if you'd like to, you know, continue that, i would encourage you to also contact the supervisors and the mayor's office. I intend to and
as I say, I will very strongly. I think I wanted to correct you that you said that the voters did not intend for the department of police accountability to also handle this. I just want to make it clear to the public there is a letter of agreement, and that
particular voting did not weigh in on whether or not the department of police accountability should or should
not be doing the job. So I don't want to disparage the department of police accountability because they have been doing a good job. They've won awards both for their auditing as well, right
now, what what the inspector
general's office should be doing is not only handling those
complaints, but also what's with the sheriff's office. So it also continues to burden the sheriff's office when the inspector general can't take on and review particular complaints
with independent investigators. Correct? I understand, but the charter did say the inspector general would investigate all
complaints right now. Dpa is investigating a certain classification of complaints.
Certain number the charter said
oig would investigate all complaints. Right. But you're making but you're making a commentary on dpa, which is
silent in that charter amendment. So I don't want to
inject particular things or make it appear that we're disparaging the department of police accountability. No, but the mayor's current budget seems to intend to fund dpa to do the duties of the inspector general, rather than funding the inspector general to perform those. Right now, the mayor has asked to share two
investigators. So, and right now there are investigators that
currently handle sheriff's complaints. So that is the status of it. Now, we're hoping that it changes because the office of inspector general should be independent and separate. But going into this,
we already knew that there would
be a period of long period of
transition, 1 to 2 years. I mean, ideally it would have been one year if it were the kind of staffing that we were looking
at, but it starting a brand new agency and also doing the hiring. We never expected it to
be in in a short shrift that we would actually get the whole agency and independent investigators. So, we appreciate
the transition time because we don't want to MISS Any of the complaints and we don't want to MISS Statutory deadlines. Well, not funding for the next fiscal
year won't even allow them to start the hiring process. It
doesn't take this long in other agencies that have been newly established and people in the oversight community can testify
to that, but not giving you anybody doesn't even let you
start the process of
recruitment, which I think is very necessary. And essentially
saying that the ig won't even be operational investigating
complaints for over a year,
there's no possibility whatsoever. So I'm very
disturbed by by this budget. And
i think we should all be. And I think everyone who supported creation of sheriff's oversight
should be very concerned and
outraged by this. I did one of the questions your newsletter said that you made a trip to washington, dc, I did. Can you tell us more about that? Yes, so
they had a day on the hill,
where you are given an opportunity to meet with your
local, legislators and, and my the whole purpose of the trip
was to go back and, make a
connection with our local
legislators. So, for example, I,
I, got all of the information
of, MISS Pelosi's legislative
director and, barbara lee's
legislative director,
congressman eric swalwell, although he's not in san
francisco, is, a good friend.
And so it was an opportunity to speak with his office, but really, the main purpose was to
go out and find, get more
information about, any grant
funding that might be available to the inspector general's
office, and things of that
nature. And so it was it was
very, very good trip, and just
and just also connecting with, the, the legislators and, and a
big surprise is we thought we were just going to go to the capitol and, and then a day before the meeting started, we
were told we were starting off at the white house. And so we
met with, a lot of the white
house staff and, so, I mean, I,
I, it was a great trip. Who
sponsored that, the national bar
association sponsored the day on the hill. And what they did is,
because I'm a member of the national bar association, they
set up the trip and, set up the meetings with all of the
legislators. And so we were able
to go into the back halls of congress and meet with a lot of congressional staffers and who
could not have been nicer. Did did the national bar association
pay for it, no, because I was
going on behalf of san
francisco. So san francisco paid for it. Yes. Okay. And was it focused on civilian oversight,
the purpose of the trip was to
go and talk. You know, I'm, I'm
in a in the stage of trying to
get an agency off the ground,
and in terms of, of funding, you
know, I'm looking at grant funding. I'm looking at all
areas of funding. And clearly,
that's going to be important to get an agency off the ground. And coming from a background and, with the district
attorney's office, many of those offices operate by not only government funding, but grant funding and federal grant
funding. And so I went back there to find out what kinds of grant funding programs are
available for agencies like the inspector general and who else
from san francisco went on that
trip? No one. Oh, okay. Okay in the future, you might want to check in with folks at nicole who have gotten a grant from the
us department of justice to do a study regarding oversight. And
they MAY be able to give some information about grants that are available. And I think oversight works best when it
works cohesively and works together. And, you know, there's
a lot of knowledge there. And there's a very good long standing oversight agency in washington, dc with personnel
who who have worked for the federal government, who probably could contribute to that effort. Yeah. No, I sit down with,
anthony fennel, the PRESIDENT Of naco, and we had a long discussion about, grant funding
and, possible opportunities for
to seek grant funding and that it is about personal
relationships. I think, vice PRESIDENT Carrion can also
attest it's really the unity bars and the different bar
associations that have really ships with our electeds at the
federal government. So it really is important for you to be
present there and make the best.
And I really appreciate the fact that you're thinking outside of the box and that you're seeking a very broad range of support. I
think that's beneficial for us
in so many ways. I also, I am also bothered, disturbed,
disappointed to be frank, that we haven't gotten the funding that we need to do this important work. Right, but you
know what? Our ancestors have fought through it. We will fight through this too, right, and we will get to the place that we need to get. So I appreciate all of the work that you and the team is doing. And it's unfortunate that in, in essence,
not it's not that you were not funded. It's, it's you're kind of being underfunded because now
you're taking away a position that you currently have. Right?
Because if it's only going to be for you to you currently have three people. So instead of giving you money, you've actually been taken. It's been
taken from you. So that that to
me is what is more, damaging and concerning because I think it's
a pretty magnificent, and, you
know, and as a past prosecutor
myself and an attorney for 15 years and being in all these different leadership positions, the work that it takes to do this kind of detailed analysis
and to learn from the mistakes
and the strengths of others is not a two person job. No, it
simply isn't, and we live in a
very complex city with a lot of
resources. So to see that the safety of the people who come
here to do business, the people who live here, the people that build their families and, you
know, their their communities
here are not being adequately,
listened to, right. Like, I mean, this went for the vote. This this is the people's
decision, and here we are. Here we are after all of the work that is done to then actually be
put in a deficit is incredibly problematic. And I ask all
community, to go to that board
of supervisors meeting because
this is if you want to be safe,
if you want inmates and different clients to be treated
with respect, then in each of us
needs to show up and each of us
needs to be able to say, this is unacceptable. But this is also,
you know, a holistic question as well. We've talked for years and years or the board of supervisors has talked years and
years about forensic auditing. And it's not just words, because
we had the auditor come speak at the last meeting of what entails
an official audit. And we see a
lot of waste in the city, which
is very disappointing. And you know, I'm going to ask you further questions about behavioral health, about the detox situations. The budget
should not be coming out directly from the sheriff's office. And the jails are not necessarily appropriate place to
have those services. And there's an overall shortage of staff and
the management. So but I'm going to go to member nguyen to see if
he has any questions or comments. And then to you, vice PRESIDENT Karen. And then down the line, just a comment. Thank you for all the work you're doing. It sounds like you're really busy out there and I am showing up to multiple meetings going to washington and it's, it's admirable. So thank you for
that. Right and thank you, member. When for going through extra training and getting your
toe certificate. So that's that's a whole nother thing. I mean, to demonstrate that there is a movement and career
advancement within the sheriff's office, I think will help overall in the recruitment.
Thank you, vice PRESIDENT Karen.
Nothing further. Thank you. Member buckner. No. Thank you,
and I definitely echo my colleagues. Thank you for all
that you've done, you know, thus far. And, you know, this is just the beginning. We got a long ways to go. I think one of the
things that I did want to ask, I think that would be helpful for
all board members. And I also
think for the ig is if we could work on some sort of a template
through the chair, in terms of information that we get from the
ig, I think it's a it could be a little rough and tough when we're ripping off questions that you're not prepared to necessarily be able to answer.
And I also think it would help us in formulating information that's going to be shared with members of the public. That's coming from from the ig, because I would like to hear more of the statistics and highlights around
how we've already been able to make impact, with the shortage
and under resources that we currently have, I just think
about how, you know, we have to continue to show the work that we're doing with the limited resources, with the limited
manpower. This is what we're able to do. We can do more, should be doing more in the charter has called for us to do more. So I'm in total agreeance with everyone there. I did just want to state for the record, I
was a little weary when I start
thinking about how changing up, the recruitment process, just
thinking about as an employer,
not hiring people for the sake of hiring people or deputies, but actually the right deputies and the right people, because
that also can alter the work that we're doing. If we're really just looking to have
bodies, on the department could actually cause more detriment
and more trauma and more harm to
what it is that we're trying to do. So I just wanted to put those two things out there and also apologize for all the sniffling. But there is a high
pollen count and, yeah, it's one
of those days for me. Just a quick question. Who wrote the description of the department that's in the mayor's budget book? Was that the mayor's office, yeah, I have to. I don't
know exactly what you're, on
page 297, 298 of the mayor's budget. I don't have it in front
of me. I have to look at that to. But I'll look at it, and.
Yeah, if you if you could let me know. I'm curious where that because some of the text seems a little strange. Okay. Yeah, I'll
let you know, so I guess, we had been talking about templates, one of my favorite words. And so I, I've been trying to not call
the inspector general at seven at night or even ten at night, and we've had lots of conversations. So we are working
on templates and also for the sheriff's office so that we have, consistent reporting. And this also gives an indication
particularly we have the cfo here today about the kinds of
technology that we need so that
we don't take up more staff time to call numbers, you know, and
so and we want to be consistent so people aren't guessing on
particular reports, so I wanted to just drill down a little bit
on, bail reform. And just for
the record, I am an attorney. The department of insurance bail
is a form of insurance. So I heard so much that bail was an unregulated industry. Just want
to make clear, under the 1937 bail bonds act, the department of insurance regulates bail
agents. And although there isn't a whole lot of bail now. So you
see a lot of the businesses kind
of folding. But as a consequence, the bad part is there are these fly by night organizations, pretending to be
nonprofits, acting as bail
agents. And that is unlawful. So I just wanted to put that out there and actually, taking money
and not actually bailing a person out. So that's
disturbing. So I, I just want a little bit more clarification on that, because with bail reform, you're saying that the people who would have been previously held are being released, but and
then you're left with the more serious crimes, but then wouldn't that have caused even
more of a higher jail
population. Well, so what what
I'm saying is that, yes, it it
did cause a higher jail
population, but it caused a population that was easier to
manage and it's, even though
there are, lower numbers than in
the past, although there's been
a significant increase in san francisco because of the ramp up
of putting more police on the
street and making more arrests,
but those those individuals,
that were in jail, in the past,
it it made it the, the, the types of individuals that were in custody were a more
manageable group of folks, and
what I mean by that is somebody who committed a burglary, for
example, might still be for bail
reform, might still be in
custody. And whereas now with bail reform, a lot of these individuals are now being let out and the only ones that are
being left in custody are the ones that are committing the
robberies, the carjackings, the, the felonies. We still would
have had those that population and it's they still would have been in there. But it, it it makes for a different population
when they're the majority that
are in there. Yeah. And are you saying that if, if there were the, the lesser, the quote
unquote lesser, crimes that were
committed by certain individuals , that it would have evened out the population, I don't know. No. What I, what we're saying is
that now, now you have, and I think you have to really look,
everyone speaks about the article that the one inmate
wrote, and this was an individual who's been in and out
of custody for the last ten years in san francisco, and he
wrote an article in which he
said that today, it's a much
more difficult place to do time
in, because because of the types of individuals that are in there now, in general population, you have more individuals who are
detoxing, who have mental health
issues, and although they have a wing that deals with those individuals who have mental
health issues, you still have individuals that MAY not be housed in the mental health issue, but they have some
instability, some mental instability, and they're being
housed in general population.
And so it makes it just a much more difficult place to do time
in, which is why you had the one
in the gentleman, I believe his name was jerry wilson wrote the
article that he would rather go
to state prison than stay in the
san francisco, county jail. And
a lot of it has to do with the population that's currently, the
configuration of the population that's currently there. And I think it was sort of a balance,
a risk analysis for him because
he does enjoy the more positive environment of the sheriff's
deputies. So as he's moving, he's expecting a better
population, but he's unsure of how the deputies will be
treating him in a new facility,
so the other thing in terms of budget, maybe we can get a little bit more creative, we the city doesn't have or has a shortage of the health facilities, the substance abuse
facilities, and some of that
money is unused. If that money
is unused, that should go to the inspector general's office as
well as the sheriff's are monitoring those particular
situations, so let's do a little
hunting and line by line. I'm
all game. I'm game for it wherever we can get some
funding, and, and you know, and also advocate for zero based budgeting because unfortunately, the way government budgeting
works is the bigger the more money you have in the pot, the
more powerful you appear to be. But it's either use it or lose
it. And, we have been very lean
and mean, maybe much to our detriment, to be churning all
this information out. And then
I've purposely set out an agenda where we're actually getting
additional training as members, because we don't even have a
budget for our anticipated 80 hours of training that we want.
We had 20 hours compressed from the get go, and I think we all really benefit from the training. And not to disparage the police commission, but they're not required to go through any training, which is a little bit shocking when you are
creating policy and I know member bruckner was an esteemed member of the police commission, but I think it makes a big difference when we have training and we and we when we are
checking in with the union and to demonstrate that we are trying to understand their position because our oversight is not just about the
incarcerated population and the affected families, but also the well-being, the physical and mental well-being of our deputies and the working
conditions, I also wanted to
just point out to the public, we knew this from training, and we kind of take it for granted, the sheriff's deputies in the jails
are not, they don't have weapons. So their best tool is
actually their voice. How to
de-escalate. Unless you
de-escalate population, you know, any kind of arguments
before they escalate. And so one
of the benefits of them being in patrol in the tenderloin, that
makes a difference is that they're able to talk to the individuals, because some of these people have been
incarcerated before. So they're kind of known entities, whereas they might not have a
relationship with a police officer. They'd rather talk to a
sheriff. And sometimes that can
avoid, a more serious issue or, you know, even an arrest if
someone is compliant. So I just wanted to make it clear to the public, people are thinking, well, why are these deputies being assaulted? And why can't they defend themselves? And they
really, that is like the absolute last resort, but they do not have weapons with them when they're in the jails. And
in fact, any of the deputies who are visiting the jails have to check in their weapons before they enter the jails. So and we
look forward to I think, we are going to have more regular visits among the members. I know because we were all so busy, it was a little bit difficult to
calendar year. So I'd like to do that more, and then, so and then
also member palmer, I'd like to make sure that we hear more from the jail justice coalition on, and I really appreciate the
families also having come in FEBRUARY to talk about the
effects of the lockdowns, I
personally signed up on the visits to see what kind of information I would get ahead of time, notifications if there was a lockdown and if there was a visit interrupted. So I think
the notices have gone out more efficiently, we're also looking
at possible text messages. We understand a lot of families live, you know, two, two hour
drive away. So it's a it's, you know, disappointing to say the
least. As they're on the road and then they get a lockdown
message. So thank you so much
for that, and so with that I'm going to open it to public comment. Thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT. And for the record, vice PRESIDENT Carrion is present and arrived after the
call. The roll we have a full board for members of the public who would like to make the public comment on line. Item two, inspector general, report. Please approach the podium when
it is free. We have no public
comment. Thank you. Let's move
on to the next agenda item. Calling line item three. San
francisco sheriff's office presentation informational item
patrick lerm, chief financial officer for the san francisco sheriff's office, will present
on sfsu budget and priorities. Thank you for being here, and
welcome. Good afternoon, inspector general wiley, PRESIDENT Sue, vice PRESIDENT
Karen. Commissioners, members of
the public. My name is patrick leung. I'm the chief financial officer for the police. Our
sheriff's office. Today, I will be how much? How the difference is how the police department got
more money. The most pleasant
changes. The commission meetings start at 2:00 here versus 530
for the police, today I will be presenting our information
technology needs. I want to pull
up the. Thank you. First, I want
to begin by saying that the
sheriff's office. We're still a very heavy, heavily paper based
organization, one example of
that is our time sheets, we
don't have any electronic system. There isn't anything
that interfaces with the city's payroll. We do it the old school
way, pen and paper. And that
does cause some inefficiencies. But at the same time, it is a
very cheap way of doing business at the expense of additional
staff time, what I'm going to
present today depicts
opportunities for us to gain some operational efficiencies.
And that in turn, will help us
alleviate some of the, at least reduce some of the staffing
shortfalls that we have by
increasing, some of the, increasing the efficiency of the
work that we're able to do. So
some of the information technology priority projects
that we have, the first one on our list is the new jail management system. We started this several years ago, and
we're beginning in phase two,
the second item is hiring
professional staff to replace some of the sworn personnel that we've transferred out to other units. The next one that we have
is replacing our aging networking infrastructure and
hardware, next in line is also
the funding for a national
incident based reporting system,
compliant MS. System, record management system. And then the
last category is the expansion
on the use of, body worn cameras
. I want to start out with our
jms project, the jail management
system. We started this project a couple years ago, and we've so far we've completed phase one.
Phase one includes analyzing our business processes and documenting the functional
requirements. It's, simulating
the functional requirements of the test environment and then
also defining the scope of work
for phase two. And there's four
components of that, the business analysis requirements, all of
the data migration of shifting from the old system into the new
system, some of the interface
analysis to work with all the other subsystems that exist
throughout the city. And also within our department, and then
also the training framework and training plan, since we're going
into a new system, it's going to be a very different process than
what deputies are used to. And
so a lot of that having a successful implementation
requires adequate training. And
one thing to note is that we did
have some delays because the old
vendor for the jms was acquired
by a new company and it took almost a year to finalize an
assignment agreement that I am
happy to say that that has been
completed, and we expect phase
two of this project to commence
in the fall of 2024. In this next slide, what what it's shown
here is some of the workflows
that, and the project timeline
for phase two. A lot of the success on phase two will rely
upon the coordination. And,
what's important to note here is that as we progress through each period, there's more multiple tasks that are being worked on
simultaneously, and a lot of the
success will require not just coordination of all the different functional teams, but it also requires some additional
staff support as we implement
our new jail management system, we have to understand that we
don't stop our day to day
operations. And this project is just work in addition to what
we're currently doing. So with the new jms, it does require
additional resources and some of which I'll get into in the later
slides. But overall, this slide
represents the our timeline for
phase two in our jms project.
Our information technology support services. We do need
some additional it professional
staff in order to, have a successful jms implementation
implementation, but also to have successful implementations on
some of the other it projects
that we want to have funding for. And we also want to
successfully implement. So some background on the informational
information and technology
support services unit. It's responsible for all of the information technology and technical needs for the sheriff's office. Some of the functional needs includes compliance to cal D.O.J. Standards for criminal and custody records, maintaining all
the data reports and dashboards, maintaining our physical networking infrastructure,
support our electronic, mobile,
mobile devices, and also our computers, and also providing
help desk support for end users.
Currently, our staff is a mix of professional and sworn staff. I
will say that after I've joined
the sheriff's office, I've seen three deputies and sergeants be
transferred out of the it's
unit, and they've been transferred back to custody
division throughout that time, I haven't seen any we haven't hired any additional staff. And what that means is now there's a
significant gap, capacity gap on what services are its unit is
able to provide, with the implementation of the jms and
with the reduced staffing. And
it's that has had operational
impacts to the sheriff's office.
I haven't seen an it unit shut down in any department that I've
been in at the police department, human services,
emergency management, I've seen
it pretty regularly that at the sheriff's office, the it's unit
has to shut down, because of
staffing availability. And when
that happens, if you're a user and you need your password reset
or if you're having computer issues, you just have to wait.
Which which is glaring to me
because we're not an 8 to 5
department. We operate 24 over
seven, and having an it unit that shuts down sometimes days
at a time, and a lot of that is
controlled. Or the cause of that
is really because of the lack of staffing, both in terms of not
having enough professional
staff, but also in terms of not having enough deputies. And in
years past, we've had to rely upon deputies to fill some of the professional staff positions. That has the
potential to be civilianized. But at the same time, we don't
have of the budgetary support to
enable that. And what we've seen
in more recent years is that because of the significant
shortage in our sworn staffing, that we have no choice but to transfer out deputies back into
other units at the expense of
operation. The our operations from some of the supportive
units, especially our it unit. One of the things that we also need support on is our networking infrastructure. The
city has adopted a hybrid work
environment, and some of the some of this requires adequate
infrastructure for when we
transition to a new jms or when
we adopt a nibrs compliant MS. It will require some infrastructure upgrades in order
to help us utilize some of the
new capabilities and the existing system that we have has
reached the end of the product
life cycle, and the vendor no
longer provides support. So we
do risk. We do have a high risk of failure and some of the downstream impacts to operations is if the system goes down, it will require a significant
support effort from both our it
staff in order to get the system up and running, but it will also have an impact on operations if the system goes down for a
extended period of time. And, I want to reemphasize that we are
a 24 over seven, facility or our department rather, and any
suspension to any of our
supportive functions does have very significant impacts in the
way that we can do business. And
we did see that. We did have first hand experience with that,
not with our department, but when the department of emergency
management, when they open up the new call center, their system went down, unfortunately.
And they did have backup plans with, you know, the old fashioned pen and paper. But it
did have a it did have an impact
on their operations. And that is
something that we want to avoid.
I did speak to on the last page. I did speak about our networking
infrastructure upgrades, and the next topic I want to speak about is the record management system.
Several years ago, the fbi, they
transitioned to the national
incident based reporting standard and this is for uniform
crime reporting. In the past,
uniform crime reporting, the
standard was based on summary reporting standard. What that
means is any type of incident,
what the data that gets captured is only the most severe offense
is recorded, as part of the data
set for each incident. So so if there's an incident that
involves multiple offenses, you don't really get that full
picture. All you really get is if there was, let's say that there is an incident involving a homicide with additional
assaults, robberies, etc, you
really only get that most severe
offense as what occurred for that incident with the
transition to the cyber standard
, what it allows departments to
provide is it associates the it gets rid of the old hierarchy
model and it in turn it collects additional measurements,
including where the crime takes place, what form it takes, the
characteristics of victims and
perpetrators, and also all of the offense, information that's
associated with that incident.
One of the benefits of, not it
not just having nibrs compliant, data. One of the benefits for
the MS. Is also avoiding double entry in some of our legacy
systems. We don't we want to be
able to avoid having to copy information from one system to
the next, to which we do on some
of our operational, systems, just because of lack of
interoperability. One last topic
that I want to discuss is our
body worn camera program. In 2017, the sheriff's office
started a pilot project to outfit deputies with body worn
cameras. We were able to expand
the program and at this point,
we have contract authority to deploy 340 cameras. However, we
lack sufficient funding to
deploy all 341 of the benefits
for body worn cameras is that it
helps support accountability and
transparency. And there was a study funded by the national institute of justice. They
conducted a randomized trial,
and randomized trial study at the los angeles metro police
department and what they found
was that officers at las vegas
metro police, those who wore body worn cameras, had fewer use of force incidents, fewer complaints against their
officers and the city was also
able to see reduced costs to resolve, the use of force
complaints. And so one of the
benefits that we want to see is
having all of our deputies
outfitted with body worn cameras , one, to help improve our
safety for our members, but also to help improve the accountability and transparency of the department. We are
looking at, some other
opportunities for funding, not just in our budget requests.
There is a grant program from
the department of justice, the office of community oriented
policing services. They have a
body worn camera grant. That is one grant opportunity that we're
exploring, and we intend to
submit an application for, it
does require a 50% local match. And that's something that we're
trying to get gain support for.
But it is a funding opportunity
that we're exploring. So I've
discussed a lot of our information technology
priorities. I do want to have
touch back on the budget discussion and how it relates to what we submitted at, and what
some of our next steps are. I do
I first want to discuss some of
our budgetary pressures. We've heard under many circumstances,
occasions that we've experienced
significant staffing shortages, not just on the sworn side, but
also on our professional staff,
I can say that during the last couple of years, we've also had
many increase in the cost of
doing businesses, business.
Rather, we've seen increases in
the supplies in, cost of food to
feed the jail population. And
we've also seen, a significant
pressure on our budget budget
deficit because of increased use of overtime. And that's
attributed to not just, the number of deputies that were
understaffed by, but also from,
retirements. It's also from the,
any type of incident that occurs
that is not budgeted for, but it's like unforeseen
circumstances. So the one that
inspector general inspector
general wiley had reported out with the attack on deputies,
that would be one, instance of
cost that we've incurred that was not budgeted for. When we
experience a, a lockdown at the jails that also requires
additional staffing. And the way
that we're able to do that is
through overtime. We do lack, a significant number of deputies.
And the only way that we can supplement staffing at this
present time is through the use
of mandatory overtime, backfill,
in terms of the technology
projects that I've, that I've
identified in this presentation, the funding, the funding
requests and opportunities that
we've looked at. The first one
is the court process, the committee on information
technology, the city has an annual process where each
department submits their technology requests. And
unfortunately, the department
needs often exceed what's
available, with with the current
submission, we did request for $2.9 million for our jms
project, we were able to receive $1.5 million in allocated
funding through the court process. And so at this point,
we do have to kind of reshuffle some of the, some of what we're able to do in that project. And, we are exploring other funding opportunities, not just from
grants, but also with working with the mayor's office, and the
board of supervisors. And for a
lot of the technology projects, some of which, as I've described
in the in the other slides with
the body worn camera project and
with some of the other projects,
we are looking to, some grant opportunities, either from the
at the fed level or at the local
or private level, because we do recognize that we are at the
city is in a downturn and the unfortunately for budget
dollars, it's limited. And we do want to be respectful of that.
And I thank you for your time. If there's any questions, I'd be
more than happy to answer them. Thank you, do I have any questions or comments from
members? Welcome to a hard
working team with little
resources, member rector. Which
model body worn camera is the. Is the sheriff's office
currently using? I don't know the specific model, but I do know that it's, the body worn
camera is through axon or axon is the vendor, I should say. And do you know how old they are? They are a couple of years old,
I know that one of one of the grant programs that we're looking at, the cops office
grant, it does allow for the expansion of the body worn
camera project. And it also will
allow for, replacement of existing cameras. So that's one
of the things that we're looking
to apply for, it does is, at least in terms of the body worn
camera grant from the, from the
feds, they do provide these new programs or expansion of
programs, hire than replacing
existing hardware. But given
what our program, given the program that exists for us right
now, we are looking for both
opportunities, both the expansion, because we do want to
have body worn cameras for all of our deputies, and we also want to replace the existing
cameras that we have. And you
mentioned the cops program grant requires a 50% local match, but what would be the amount of that? And is there any money in the current budget allocation
for that? So no, it does depend
upon whether or not we're we
apply, for just the number of
cameras that we have deployed or whether or not we're able to
expand the program to the entire , sworn staff that we have in
terms of the program, the grant
will allow up to $2,000 of
funding per camera, so for the
local match, I have to double check whether the 2000 is the
total amount or whether it's
just the fed portion, but, if it's if 2000 is a limit at the
very least it would either be $1,000 local match or if the 2000 represents the federal
portion, then the total local match in that instance would be
2000, it is a scalable project.
So if, for instance, if we were
to apply for 200 cameras, right,
the local match would just be
for that amount versus if we were to expand it for the whole
entire, sworn staff, let's say
it's 750 cameras. That's more than three times that amount,
but we are still in the early
phase of developing the grant application, and some of those numbers still have to be worked out. And does the department use
axon axons, cloud based storage
service evidence.Com, I believe
so. And do you also use that for
the, cctv camera footage within the jails, that I don't have any
information on? I don't believe
that axon that that axon is the
vendor for the closed circuit tv. Do you know anything about the state of the technology of the cctv cameras, how old they
are, how the how those how that
footage is stored? And, how long
it's retained for that? I don't have any information on that. I, I will say that, for the
security systems at the jail, that is another project that
we're we were hoping to find
funding for. That is a
significantly higher amount. And it isn't considered just an
information technology project.
It flows more in line with a capital project, because of all
the physical cameras involved and some of the wiring, etc.
That does, and it's not just the
cameras, but also the, access to
the doors and, with that type of
project, it does require
additional, funding for all the
capital improvements, but in terms of what the current
process is, I don't I'd have to,
I'd have to get find that information and get back to you on that. I believe. Just so you, I do know that axon is not the
vendor for cctv. They are completely separate and different. They only do the bwc through evidence.Com. Thank you.
And you mentioned the nih study,
and that it showed fewer uses of force. Did it provide any
information on what, assaults on
deputies, that I don't recall,
but the study, it was two it was either 2017 or 2018. I can send
you a copy of the report if
you'd like. Yes and he also mentioned reduced cost to
resolve use of force complaints that that include, payouts and
civil suits or judgments. From what I remember of the study,
what it compared was, is, when
there was a use of force or when there was a complaint against an
officer, the investigative time, to see whether there were merits
to the complaint, that it was
significantly less for those who
were body worn cameras versus those without. So the savings,
the potential savings from that
study, that was a comparison, I don't know whether or not it was
whether whether there was any information on attacks on on
officers or deputies in that
study or it's not something that I can recall. Okay. Thank you
very much. Thank you. Member nguyen, just just to add, yeah,
I do agree that when the system goes down, it could be very problematic. When inmates get released, they have to be updated in the system. So by,
deputy waiting to do that, it could go way past their their time off, and it could go into overtime. And also when the
deputy is trying to cite somebody out for a ticket, they have to log into the system for registration information for the
for the ticket. And if the system goes down, that could be extremely problematic as well. And then they have to do additional steps to contact dispatch. And it's very
problematic to get that information through the radio.
Whereas if they were to get it
on their mdt, it would be a lot,
a lot quicker, a lot more
simple. So, we definitely do
need more funding for that. I think you had also mentioned at one time, and this was a pilot program, the report writing, and I know it's always kind of an
avalanche, like what takes priority. But you had mentioned there was a pilot program for more efficient report writing by
the deputies, but that was just a pilot. Right now we're going
on a very old system where we're
doing reports on pdf format and
to open like several pdfs and, the pdf actually crashes
sometimes because, because the
way the system is designed. So so, you know, like, maybe we
could, update to like, a
salesforce system where, we can streamline that process. So again, like the additional
funding, is the solution to the
problems for updated report
writing system, one of the areas
for the report writing system a
the MS. System. So the san francisco police department right now, they're currently
implementing their MS. And we do
have some we are intending to schedule some conversations with
their, their it staff and also
the vendor of their, the system
that they will implement, the
benefit of an MS. Is that it does include a module for the
report writing and at least
conceptually, if, we're able to adopt the same system that that will also gain some efficiencies on not having to do double
entries, that some of the data
that they would enter would populate, into carry over into
our system and also into the jms
system that we would adopt and
that are at least, have some staff savings because there's
less time for people to have to
do data entry, vice PRESIDENT,
carry on. Just a comment. When
you said that, as somebody who
is constantly forgetting user names and passwords, I cannot
imagine working in an environment where you would just have to sit and wait to be able to do your job, that sounds absolutely absurd, thank you for
the work that you're doing. It's unfortunate to hear this report
because it seems very dire. It
at least from my perspective, of in terms of the technology of
being writing in paper and all
of those things, so you have
your work cut out for it, but it looks like you're you're also game, to use the inspector
general wiley's word, so thank you for the work that you're
doing. And I appreciate the thorough and presentation. Member brichter know, I think
there just seems to be a consistent theme here of
resources and the reports together and funding. But but I also, you know, enjoyed hearing
from member nguyen, though as well too. Hopefully we're also trying to think outside the box.
I mean, being in a city like san francisco where we have access to technology companies that are
global, for them to also be able to help potentially chip in and help us with our systems so that we can, you know, continue to maintain and run our city much better, thank you for the
comprehensive. Oh, actually, let me go to member palmer first.
No. Great member. Well, thank
you for being here. I appreciate
the comprehensive report and it just emphasizes what we already
knew when the it chief first
came, I guess, you know, I think the crucial part is really the
testing period, because as you have a hodgepodge of things and
things that might be aging out or the vendors have just, you
know, left and, and not offering support, you hope that the computer systems are talking to each other because otherwise it's like band-aids. And we definitely do not want a situation like the san francisco unified school district, where they spent millions and millions
on, you know, a payroll system that just flopped and they have
to go back to square one after
spending millions and millions,
let's see anything. Oh, so I guess the other thing is, is there a possibility of
recruiting, civilian? It staff from, say, city hall? I mean, we have a lot of it staff with within city hall that could actually bridge the gap right
now. So in terms of it is a
possibility. The although it's
dependent upon the department of technology, tech department on
technology, what their availability, what their
workload availability is on how many workers they have available, available. But I
think for us, one of it for at
least that it's somewhat a short
term solution, because again,
when in in order to support the long term health of the
department, you want to have a
stable workforce, right? If we implement a jms and we're
relying upon the vendor or we're
relying upon, det, those aren't our employees. And so once the project ends or once they're unavailable, they get
transferred, etc. We're stuck
with a system that either we don't know how to use or we don't know how to support. And
so having, full time department employees helps ensure the
longevity of us as a department, being able to support the
system. But it's also one of
the, one of the barriers that we
face is part of it is just the
lack of funding to help support
some of the hiring. We have used
prop fs, retirees as some of the
stopgap solutions, they have
recent retirees who've come back to help provide at least some
relief, but they're limited to 960 hours in each year, and I
believe we have two, two of
those prop f's, helping out with our information technology
needs. And it again, I think it
is somewhat of a just a stop gap
solution, preferably we would want somebody that we can hire for the long term, because they're going to be the ones that are able to support us,
once the system is up and
running, but also because when you're relying upon a vendor or
you're relying upon, even
another city department, that their needs can also change and
also their priorities aren't
necessarily the same as our
department priorities. So with our staff, we can deploy them to where we specifically need them, you know, and we're constantly having to wear different hats,
putting out different fires, and if we have our own employees, we're able to do that more,
effectively because we can deploy them specifically to
where we need, not just based on who might be available or what
they might just be contracted to do. I agree with you. I mean, this is also the stability of the workforce, but it also lends to succession planning too. If you don't have the permanent employees, the more seasoned
employees who you know are, say,
five years out from retirement, don't have the opportunity to transfer skills to the newer
hires, we just, you know, with
our system for the iag, marshal
kind did a fantastic job, and saving us lots of money, taking
the salesforce, dashboard, that
was for the department of police accountability and sort of
making some tailoring. And now
it's usable for the ig, but it would be so much easier if you
just had one system and the data was right there. So anytime I
would ask chief jue if we could have a report, and by the way,
we still need to work on a template, although, you know, the report that chief jue gave,
really focused on the particular data that we needed, but we wanted to just make it more official and consistent. But to
be able to just push a button or do some data searches and have a report spill out rather than
calling different units and pulling out the paper, entering
things, I think in the long run
we'll save money. But so it's really incumbent on all the residents of san francisco to actually talk about funding
priorities. I know each supervisor also, they have town
halls talking about budget priorities, but it seems like
the sheriff's office is always left out. It MAY be because and remember, you'll have some perspective on this. The police department and you as well.
because having come from the police department, they seem to get a lot of funding. And even when we were looking at reports for domestic violence, human trafficking, it was so much easier because the justice system was implemented. And then there was justice system 2.0 and the sheriff's office was still
left with paper. And so that's
why once we formed as a board, we consistently push for more
funding for the it systems. So
anything else, seeing none. Let me ask if there's any public
comment for members of the
public who would like to make public comment on line item three san francisco sheriff's office presentation. Please approach the podium when it is
free. Pairs. We have no public
comment. Thank you. The next
agenda item please calling line item for rescheduling JULY
regular meeting discussion and possible action discussion and
possible action on whether to reschedule or cancel the JULY
regular meeting. So colleagues, when we looked at this annual
calendar from the get go, we decided we wanted to keep the
particular dates, and JULY 5th
falls on the friday right after
JULY 4th. And so we thought it was prudent to just solicit
input to make sure that we had a quorum for our JULY meeting, and
again, I'm going to remind everyone it's really a crucial time because we're talking about budget and resources. So I think
that, if we if we meet consistently and even if we don't take a summer break, which I'm advocating that we don't,
that we can get some more
dollars for both the sheriff's office and the office of
inspector general. So but just wanted to check to see if people were still available for JULY 5th or they wanted to re calendar for the week after. So
I have a question. I guess to me
is, what is it that we would be doing in JULY 5th that could not like, you know what I mean? Like
what what do you think is some of the pressing agenda items that would need to be, so if we
go back to the calendar that we
had approved, so JULY is really all the different reports, and
then we also, although this
would be official meeting, we, I think three of us and I was thinking about you, vice PRESIDENT Carrion, as well as member mango to do a jail visit county jail to with the inspector general. But also we're ramping up towards the fall months where we're going to have more community engagement.
So that's typically in, AUGUST. SEPTEMBER would be national
night out, and then in SEPTEMBER we're going to have faith in
blue, where we actually do have
some simulated training as well
as presentations at county jail three. So I just thought it was
important to meet. And then, if
there are particular reports and any kind of updates that we could do on the budget, I thought it was just important to be here. But, typically that the month that we would take off if we took off would be AUGUST. But
I'm just looking at JULY now,
whether or not we want to meet
JULY 5th or the 12th, some people stay in town anyway, so it doesn't really make too much of a difference. I'm going to stay in town, but like, you know, sometimes it's nice to
have a break, but I, I'm open to okay, other people's schedules. I'll be out of town JULY 5th.
Okay. And member brooke. Are you. Yeah. I'm okay. I'm good with 12th. Okay you rather move it to the 12th, then? Okay. I
definitely won't be able to make it, but if there's anything I
can do to help with the budget priorities. I mean, are you
talking about both the fifth and the 12th either. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. And then same fifth and
12th. I'll be out. JULY 5th to
JULY 20th. Okay. And then I will
definitely be out for the JULY 4th weekend, so you'd rather
have the 12th if we were able. Are you okay for the 12th? Vice
versa. Okay. Jason or I probably
will not be available on the
fifth. And the 12th is iffy.
Okay, so. So, I mean, if we were to take a break, then we would not. It would be typically AUGUST. So maybe we don't take a
break in AUGUST and we do it in
JULY. Yeah. And that will give additional time for the sheriff's office to do their
report for us. Okay I think so.
I think so, so, member kerry, vice PRESIDENT Kerry, would you like to make the motion? Yeah,
sure. I move for us to, cancel
the JULY 2024 meeting, due to the unavailability of all of the
members for quorum. And do we
have a second? A second, any
public comments for members of
the public who would like to make public comment on line item for rescheduling? JULY. Regular meeting, please approach the
podium when it is free. It appears there's no public
comment. I think there was one. So can I just ask for clarification? You're just canceling it. You're not moving
it to JULY 12th, is that right?
Correct there. There are members
who are also unavailable. JULY 12th. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. And we have a
member of the public for comment . Oh, okay. So I'll call the
roll on the motion to cancel the
JULY 5th meeting. Member I mango
is I member bruckner aye. Bruckner is I vice PRESIDENT
Carrion I carry on is I member
win I win is I member palmer I
palmer is I PRESIDENT Su I su is
I member wechter I vector is I. There are seven eyes and no nose. The motion passes and is
approved. Thank you. The next
agenda item please calling line item five future agenda items discussion and possible action
item. Does anyone want me to
just kind of talk about the
calendar items that we have up? So in, JULY we're going to have
the reports. We can have the
reports in AUGUST. In AUGUST we were also going to look at the
topic of prosecutors and victim
services. I think that's all the more worthwhile now that the
mayor has actually increased the victim services, particularly on
sexual assaults and sexual harassment. And then in
SEPTEMBER, we were, finally hoping to delve into policy. So
looking at our use of force policy. And I will also check in with ronnie singh, general
counsel for the sheriff's office , OCTOBER, we're getting back to
more reports, and then,
NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, I was I kept
it open. So that would also be if members had some submissions
or other burning topics, but otherwise we could actually
revisit some of the topics that we looked at earlier in the year for follow up. I think what's important is, you know,
oftentimes we bring in topics and then we don't have a follow
up. And so I'm also hoping that
members of the public would also indicate if there's particular issues that they would like us
to revisit or follow up. Sounds
like a good action plan. I'd like to see a presentation. And
this had been scheduled about a year and a half ago and was postponed on judgments and settlements from the sheriff's
department for perhaps the past five years. That's something many counties in the state have been compiling and reporting on,
and I think it would be useful for us to know that. Okay, I
will check with chief jew. But also I think that this also goes
hand in hand. Also with the board of supervisors, general audit and oversight, because
it's pretty shocking when we're sitting there asking for just a
fraction. Well you know, of what we want as a budget. And then there's pages and pages of settlements overall with the
city. So that so that's also
goes hand in hand with, with budgeting. So I think we talked
about the city attorney giving us anonymized data about the
total amount of settlements for things other than motor vehicle
accidents. So I know, member wechter, would you fill out the
form and submit it to dan and then we will formally submit it to okay. Also, since we're going to have to do a performance evaluation of the inspector general probably by JANUARY, I think it would be useful to get
a sense of the best practices
for the criteria. I'd like to I think we should hear from amrik
singh, the inspector general for the state of california who conducts oversight of the
california prison system. Who's very knowledgeable and I think
could provide some very useful information on how to look at
that, how to start setting up
our criteria. Great. Any other.
Okay. Do we have public comment for members of the public would like to make public comment on line item five future agenda items. Please approach the
podium when it is free. Yeah. Sorry. There's, appears to be no
public comment on that line. Chair, I apologize, I am going
to be making a request on a possible future agenda item, but
I'll wait until public comment.
Oh, this is this is the time for
the time. Yes okay. So I okay,
then I would appreciate, the,
the opportunity for you all to
have at a future meeting a discussion, under discussion and
possible action item requesting the tear gas incident that
happened at the san bruno jail,
I'm from san bruno, but I'll speak a little bit further. More on under public comment. Okay. And I understand that that's still under investigation. So that's why we didn't comment on
it today. So that's noted. So
dan, next agenda item please.
Colleen line item six. General public comment. At this time,
the public is welcome to address the board for up to two minutes on items that do not appear on this afternoon's agenda, but are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. during public comment, neither sheriff's personnel nor any board members are required to
respond to questions by public, but MAY provide a brief response
if you would like to make public comment, approach the podium when it is free. As a reminder, you have two minutes to give public comment. Thank you. Good
afternoon everyone. Thank you so much. So my name is jennifer blanco. I'm a trustee for district one for san bruno park elementary school district. And this incident happened in my
district. And so this is why I'm
here to ask. And to request to
have this. So when I do, do know that there the investigations
have not concluded yet. I totally understand that. But
when it is, I am requesting that
this come before this board, I
just want to share with you a little bit more information
about what's going on in my community. I do know that there is that there has been a, that we are drafting or we have sent already a joint letter to the
sheriff, asking to discontinue the tear gas, exercise
activities in our community. We
do know that, regarding I don't know, in the media, in the
newspaper, I do believe that
there are more than 30 children and there is more than what's being reported in the media,
with the families that have been impacted and affected by by the
exposure of the tear gas in our
community. And so we have sent a
survey to find out exactly,
somewhat estimated amount of the families that were impacted and
affected by the exposure. And
so, and we will be we are, requesting also to have the
sheriff's, department be better
neighbors with the city of san
bruno. So thank you for the time . Happy friday today. Thank you
so much for all your work. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. A little nervous, but
no, don't be nervous, my name is
jesus rios, I work with the latino task force, along with
other organizations like roadmap to peace, moves, and a couple
others. But I just wanted to share a couple thoughts, and thank you for the presentation. That was was a great presentation, but, I go inside the jails as part of my role right now. We do programing inside the jails, and I just
wanted to talk about the budget cuts. You know, our community has felt a lot of budget cuts, from different organizations,
different parts. And, I was going to talk about that, but we
just did a group, in cx two for
mental health month last month. We did it on JUNE 3rd, and I'm
just sitting there with the people, you know, they still are people, even though they're inmates, you know, and we talk about a lot of stuff like that.
So, I just want y'all to not forget about the nonprofits and the community, the community
work, you know, these people are still being released to the
community, we help them in the community. And I think it takes the sheriff's police department community, all of us, to work
together and to try to find a
better solution, just seeing the smile on those people's faces,
you know, makes my day, even
even if it's just for 45 minutes to an hour sitting there with them, talking to them, you know,
making game plans of when they get released and stuff, I think that's really important, but I just want to say thank you for that presentation again. Was that the event where you guys
brought the. Yes, we invited you, but, you know, you're busy,
man. Busy man. I met you when I
was over at latino task force. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Got you, got you. MR. Sorry, I missed that. MR. Wiley's in the washington, but he's also in the community,
but I just wanted to show him. I wish more people from our community showed up because it's not the lack of it. You know, we had a good showing in FEBRUARY, so you're always welcome. And I think, we share your concerns
and we definitely, want to enhance the nonprofit organizations. They are great
partners in what we do,
particularly pre reentry and supportive services for reentry
and well noted about language
access and the programs because, people who know me know I've
worked on language access for a long time, even with the very first ordinance here in the city . So I truly believe that we have to have better language
access in our jails. And the programs, so and also, you know,
explaining things to families of incarcerated members so they
understand what's going on as well. Definitely. And the annex, how y'all spoke earlier, I was just there on thursday is filled with, people from honduras,
mostly central america and a two part of that mental health day. We were able to feed them, we
brought a 60, foods, basically a pre-made foods. And, they were
able to eat that, so they got to taste a little bit of home. So thank you all. I just appreciate y'all having this meeting. Thank you for being here. And thank don't be a stranger. I will let everybody know that one question
about agenda item five. We'd had again, we'd had a community
meeting scheduled that glide
last year. Is that next time I think we should just make sure that we're done talking with the
community before we, like, start talking over them, okay. Yeah. And MR. Wiley also had some
comment to say before, yeah. I just wanted to let everybody
know I was at the latino task
force, offices last week, and I
think we met while I was there,
but the latino task force, as is
on their own, is providing
programing to the inmates in the
annex, so I just wanted to let folks know that they're not
being compensated, but they're
providing programing. And I think it's very admirable on
their part. So member rector yeah, my question. We had a public, community meeting scheduled for glide church last
year. Is that, being
rescheduled? If there's if there is kind of the community wants
and the board need, but it
appears that even though we tried really hard for the community meetings, a lot of community members now say that they feel safer being in city
hall. So we can check back. Dan,
do you want to check back with glide and see if they'd like us
to be, I'm curious which
community members like a particular like, is it a certain population? Is it like an interest group or. It would be. It would be, pretty much the people who serve glide in the
tenderloin area. And we remember we were doing I think she's asking, like, all communities. Right. Yeah. I guess my
question, to be clear, is who are the committee members that you're referencing that feel
safer in city hall, well, when
we were doing I mean, even with the latino task force, they said to me that we'd rather be in city hall. And you guys are, you know, having meetings all over the city, but we would just rather have it at city hall and
it could be possibly, you know, public transportation lines and city hall might be more central.
I see. So I leave it out. I'm not wedded to anything. I just want to make sure that we're accessible to the public, and we
meet them where they feel most
comfortable. And I'm a believer in field trips. I also, you know, would like to visit more areas and especially like even
the nonprofit. It's about the services. I mean, it was great to be at the southeast community center, and I hadn't been to the
new one. And I'm like, wow. And you know, there's a beautiful
cafe there as well. So, so I'm, you know, I'm open to suggestions if you'd like to. I mean, I'm of the mindset that we should be going out to the community versus having the community come here to city hall and taking time off, like, you know, most people are working on
fridays 2 to 5. And then the second piece is like, it's not.
I mean, I know we had our town halls. It's a little tricky because we have our town halls that we try to do in each district, and we didn't have like the greatest attendance. But I wonder if, like, we can just meet where the impacted communities are already doing their meetings. So for example, if the latino task force is already meeting on a wednesday every month, we just plop right
in. I agree with you. I think if they're having a particular meeting or it's a particular church, and then we go there and
after services or something,
we're there to share information . You know, the meeting was was canceled because we didn't have
a quorum. But I did go there in case anyone showed up. And they had over 40 people who had
signed up to attend. So I think
there is a desire for us to go to that community and be present in evening hours, when it's
easier for people to come to a meeting. And I also wanted to
add, I think we should be prioritizing the impacted communities like not all districts. We don't have to be like the ones that like would
care the most, I wonder if this is a I'm not sure if it's a question for the sheriff or the inspector general, but can we
get kind of a map of where do we
who has the information of reentry and who has the
information of where? What are
the districts that have more of the family members and
population that have been
previously incarcerated? So part of that is also, I think, on
that the dashboard of where the
crimes happened to. So so, it it
pretty much parallels. So we can we can do like southeast
corridor, tenderloin, I think it might be helpful just to get that information. So then we can just identify concretely, okay.
These are we're going to prioritize these because they're a higher number of so inspector
wiley, could we call on you to pull that information together?
And also, particular maybe
community groups who might want to invite us and be part of their meetings, something that's already with us, set population.
Yes. So what? I will gladly do
that. And I, reached out to
supervisor walton's office, and tracy gallardo provided me with
a list of all of the community based organizations in his
district. And so I've invited
all of them to a town hall next
tuesday here at the, and I reached out and spoke to people
and everybody, thought it would be a great to have it here at
city hall. And one of the, so
we're having a town hall here on
the 11th from 4 to 6. So so,
jana, let me call on you. There were two meetings, so there's
going to be a budget meeting as
well as the town hall. So, opinion from you whether or not
it would be problematic to have a quorum there because I intend
to go there. Be at both the budget hearing as well as the
town hall here at city hall. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And I was
just going to say that we do
need a, a list of people who are
in san francisco who are dealing
with transition, reentry and other community organizations
that deal with reentry. People so, I even suggested when I was
on this, reentry council, I still am, but I did suggest
doing the chesa boudin administration that there should
be a reentry, office with the
mayor. Like that's such an important part of our community.
Now here in the city, and not to
have an office of reentry in city hall that makes sure that
those those vulnerable people
who, owning protection of going
back is, a whimsical decision by a parole officer or probation officer should have some lines of protection to prevent them from false allegations and abuse
of authority, etc, etc. So I think just on beginning that
would be just getting contact with those organizations and
having, touching basis with them. And then also member
palmer also call on you with the
jail justice coalition and the member organizations. If you can
call on them to ask for suggestions on what you. But in the meantime, I will, contact the reentry council because I
actually like them to make a
presentation. Yeah. And the judge justice coalition did want to see if we could change our hours, because these hours are
bad for them to come to our meetings. So maybe they can
maybe we can create a town hall
where we are there and we can
show up with them as well. Can I
just add one suggestion? In most, you know, in most
counties, probation controls a lot of the reentry money. That's
true. So it might not be a bad idea to have the head of probation, come and present to
the board. Like, how what are
you doing with the reentry money ? And I just wanted to ask, can
we ask the mayor's office to
come and present to us? We can
again. We can ask. Yes, yes. If they come, that's a different
story. I thought we better in JULY, but we could do it in
august. Also, you know, people are out and about and it's
summer months. And so I take every opportunity to beg for
money short of putting out a tin
cup, so I would call upon it's, you know, it's all of our jobs
as well to say that we can't do our best job when we don't have any resources from day one. We have made that very clear,
inspector general, even at his
acceptance speech after he was sworn in. Provided I have the
adequate resources. So but, I
think, you know, we've done more work in the past few months since you've been here than some
people would take a year or two to do. So commendable. And really want to take the chance
to thank marshal kind. He's on a
well-deserved vacation, but for
all of his support, oh my GOD. And one final note I did attend
both days and I know member bruckner, you're always so busy
running an organization with so many employees, but that
california coalition of
oversight, the california oversight, california civilian
oversight. Civilian oversight
alliance. Yes, it was great because it was talking about
shared resources, opinions and from different organizations. So
not just in the bay area, but also nationally, but definitely
the bay area. There's a lot of sharing. And even as we're
dealing with statistics, I know
there's still disparities with the black and brown communities,
but we are measuring against the population of san francisco, and
it is not just measured. It shouldn't be just measured
against the population of san francisco, because we are
regional. So our nine bay area
counties. So I'd like to see a
little bit more efficiency on just even our nine bay area counties, how we're working
together. I think everyone has a
really good relationship. And in particular our san mateo sheriff
also, that we have a san bruno,
representative here too. And I think we do enjoy a relationship
with the san mateo sheriff's
office. So anything else? Yes.
So, I guess I can call the meeting adjourned, and we do
have a photographer today, I
think he had to go. Oh, he had to go. He'll be back. He's not
here. I finished, we finished early. I was afraid that we
would go over time. And so that's why a little bit later, officially calling line item seven. Adjournment action item.
All those in favor? Aye any
nays? Meeting is adjourned at 4:24 P.M. Thank you, dan, for
your proactiveness."

agenda item, please calling line item two. Inspector general
report informational item inspector general terry wiley
will give a monthly report from the office of the inspector general. So, inspector general
wiley has taken ill, but in his
place, chief attorney, marshall keene from the department of police accountability will give the report. Thank you. Marshall. Good afternoon. Board members.
Good afternoon, inspector wiley
was actually scheduled to be on a public safety panel this
afternoon with, chief scott and sheriff miyamoto, but
unfortunately, from his trip to washington, dc this week, he
became ill and is unable to
attend, today. So he asked me to deliver to this board just a
very brief summary of his work this month. I want to highlight the fact that inspector general
wiley brought our team down to, county jail number three
following the lockdown to have a visit with the inmates. We were able to meet with groups of inmates, take down a list of issues that they complained
about with regards to the conditions. We also had an
opportunity to meet with the command staff at county jail. Three, to learn about some of
the challenges that they face
with regards to staffing. And we have a number of action items to
follow up on, we brought senior
investigator brant begin to take complaints, and he received some
complaints that we are also going to be investigating as
well. We want to thank, chief ju
for, organizing the organizing
the trip down there and the visit. And we want to thank captain quantico and sergeant
pion for making every aspect of the jail facilities accessible
to us. We were able to see every part of the jail when there was a complaint about the, sanitary
or unsanitary conditions of the
administrative separation rooms, we were immediately able to go
up there and take a look at the rooms. And the conditions that were complained about were related to a sewage, issue that
had been abated shortly after. So we were able to very quickly
see that the rooms were very
clean and sanitary when we were
there, we will be scheduling regular visits. Inspector general. The inspector general
intends to, alternate between the two facilities in san
francisco and san bruno and will
be announcing those schedules to this board so that this board
can, can sign up to join these
visits and engage the inmates to hear firsthand some of the
issues that they complain about, the inspector general has been
very active this past month in trying to raise awareness about
this office. As we are about to head into JUNE and budget
hearing season with the board of
supervisors. So, driving support for this office and its work and
its efforts is paramount at this
point, as I had mentioned, he was supposed to be on a public safety panel this afternoon, he flew to washington, dc earlier
this week, met with a lot of
leaders over there, including
staff members for congresswoman
lee, congresswoman pelosi. And he actually met with congressman
swalwell, they had the opportunity to discuss a lot of efforts for our civilian oversight on the federal level.
They talked about legislative efforts like the george floyd
act, as well as federal funding
opportunities for law enforcement and oversight
agencies. So we're going to follow up and hopefully apply for whatever grants become available to supplement the
funding for this effort, we want
to thank the sheriff's office for inviting the inspector
general and board PRESIDENT Su, to the cherry blossom parade,
both were able to MARCH in the parade and interface with the community, and both were
announced in the parade. So,
again, continuing to promote the , promote the office and raise awareness about the office, the
inspector general is actively engaged with the dream keepers
initiative staff to, leverage
all of the community organizations that they work
with, and lastly, as you've all seen, we've launched a
newsletter, that will hopefully
increase, our, presence within
the communities. We would
certainly invite this board to
submit to us any, folks or emails for folks in the community that have any interest. We'd like to increase that subscription list, we'd
also certainly had acknowledged
and thank board member mango for the idea of creating a
newsletter. And we have
discussed also creating a community corner on the
newsletter so that members of the community, through board
member mango, will submit
opinions and perspectives that
we will then, use this particular platform to amplify
those voices. So that, in a
nutshell, is the summary that inspector wiley asked me to
deliver to this board. Thank
you. Thank you, any questions from any of the board members? I want to also acknowledge and
thank, member mango for creating a vehicle for community voices
and suggesting a newsletter. And I think member brooker, because
he is so deeply involved in the
communities, can also refer people to member mango for write
ups. So thank you very much, any
public comments on this for members of the public who would
like to make public comment on line? Item two inspector general report, please approach the
podium when it is free. Being
none, let's move to the next agenda item. Calling line item
three. Department of police accountability presentation.
Informational item. Chief attorney marshall keane will answer questions from the dpa presentation from the APRIL meeting and will present on q one sheriff's office investigations by the department
of police accountability. Well,
that's me again. At, the board, according to board, board PRESIDENT Sue's schedule, we will be presenting quarterly
reports based on the work that epa is doing to support the
office of the inspector general,
I have a presentation to present
the first the. Oops oh,
actually, before that, item three a was if there were any questions from the last
presentation from APRIL. So we just kind of wanted to wrap up.
I know it was a little bit rushed towards the end. Oh yeah. Happy to answer any questions from that previous presentation
as well. We can launch into the quarterly report. Thank you.
Thank you, so in this brief
presentation we'll go over
quarter one case statistics,
which covers JANUARY 1st to MARCH 31st of 2024. And that is the case work that the department of police accountability has been doing to
bridge the transition of the investigative work to the office of the inspector general. We
have two investigators on loan and one backup investigator,
dedicated to sheriff, investigations of sheriff
misconduct complaints, secondly,
we want to highlight some of the work that the department of
police accountability has been doing to support the office of the inspector general. What we accomplished in quarter one, in
that effort. And thirdly, we'll
provide this board with, some ideas in terms of what we're
going to, do in the future to continue our support until the
office of the inspector general becomes fully self supportive
and, self-sustaining. So the
number of cases, again, for the purposes of context and for the benefit of the public who MAY
not have, read through the
particular areas that dpa
currently investigates for the,
sheriff's office, we only investigate five primary areas
of serious complaints or serious allegations of misconduct and
inappropriate conduct by the
sheriff's sworn staff. So a very small, limited scope of the
complaints that come to the dpa,
and that includes any sort of use of force that causes injury,
any use of a weapon or a control
device, pattern and practices of
harassment or retaliation, any
sort of, impairment of or
compromising the health and safety and welfare of the
inmates and any deaths in
custody. So, those primary areas are what constitute these
particular statistics? The rest of the complaints are handled by the sheriff's office internal affairs unit, which I think
earlier this year, was a much
the sheriff's office presented a much larger number of less
serious complaints that they
process. The three year comparison of the cases opened in quarter one for 2024 has gone
up a little bit in 2022, 2023,
and has leveled back out in
2024, this is really, controlled
by the number of complaints that we receive and the referrals that we receive from other departments, mainly the
sheriff's office. In a three year comparison of the cases closed, we actually closed a
significantly larger number of cases this quarter compared to
the same quarters in 2022 and
2023. I think that is attributable to a number of
factors. Including the fact that
we had a number of older cases that were previously told for a
variety of reasons, oftentimes a criminal investigation or civil
litigation related to those
investigations where we pause it
to take it, to let another investigation take the lead. And
when those investigations or those actions close, we move
forward and resolve those
matters. So in addition to that,
I think our staff is getting more and more accustomed to
these types of investigations compared to the investigations
that they had typically performed for the police
department for many years and
are able to effectively and more
efficiently close investigations quicker. I think we are averaging about 183 days now,
for closing a case and, over the past four years, we have not missed a single, 3304 deadline.
So that is, you know, something
that we continue to strive to do to, ensure that we have comprehensive investigations that are completed as quickly
and as efficiently as possible.
The cases pending snapshots, are really just a snapshot in time.
And they'll fluctuate from week
to week or even from day to day based on the number of cases
that come in and are closed on that particular week or that particular day. So not necessarily more informative,
but from the same snapshot in
time from quarter 1 in 20 22 to
20 23 to 2024, we have a larger
number of cases pending. In
terms of the case findings from, quarter one, this is just a
graphical representation of the
high level allegations, by type,
allegation type, whether it's,
misconduct, unacceptable job performance, whether it's
referred back to the sheriff's office or another agency because
we don't have jurisdiction, or
inattention to duty. In this
particular quarter, out of 39
allegations, we sustained three
improper conduct findings. And
they relate to all, three different types of misconduct,
unacceptable job performance and inattention to duty. This next
slide provides more granular
detail in terms of what those allegations are. These are the
allegations subtypes. And as
you'll see, the largest group of , complaints that we get. And
we've seen that consistently
over the years is the complaint about unnecessary or excessive
force, in terms of the improper
conduct findings, we have a we
have a finding for improper or
excessive force as well as for. Failing to write an incident
report and, failing to properly
supervise, the inmates, what,
one other, statistics that we've noticed over time within the dpa
statistics, as well as with the
dpa's investigations of the
sheriff's, cases, is that, we
have been bringing more and more
cases to close with an actual finding rather than a finding of
not sustained or insufficient
evidence. And I think that our observations are that we
attribute that largely to how
video evidence is becoming more and more available. We had a
conversation with the sheriff's command staff at cj three, and we learned that, body worn
cameras have been all all the body worn cameras that the sheriff's office have been
deployed to staff, but that funding is needed for additional
body worn camera to outfit the
entire staff. And in conversations with the inspector
general, we can't emphasize how important it is to have those
body worn camera, footages because they offer a level of
clarity to our investigations
that we would not otherwise have , and we're able to definitively
resolve cases, either for or
against the deputy as well as,
those cases or that evidence
develops into criminal
prosecutions where deputies are assaulted because there is now
solid objective,
incontrovertible, often, tangible evidence that the
prosecution can rely on. So having that clarity, really
benefits everyone. And so we
have discussed that sometime this year before the end of the
year, the inspector general will
be putting out a report as to its recommendations, this is
going to be obviously one of the
priorities. So I think, the
sheriff's staff has indicated,
that they are on board with, using body worn camera across
the board. It's just a matter of
funding at this time. Nothing
particularly informative about
the breakdown of the improper conduct, findings. They're
evenly divided between three
categories. The complainant demographics. We have, as I had
shown in the first slide, a
small number of complaints for
quarter one, 20, 24, there
pretty evenly split by gender.
Predominantly african american complainants and, fairly evenly
split by age, again, as I had
mentioned before, our demographic information is based
on what the complainant reports.
And oftentimes the complainant isn't necessarily the person who
is in custody. That was the was
the subject of the investigation, but instead a
family member. So for whatever
it's worth, that is that is the complainant information. We, we
are thinking about potentially
changing that, to have the complainant demographic, based
on the complainant describing
who is, really the subject of the complaint rather than the
complainants. Himself or herself , the complainants or the
complaints were also received evenly between phone and,
referral 5050. So those are the
statistics for quarter one, I
can open up for any questions
and then proceed to the next two
sections. Any questions from our
board members? I have a few, I
just want to for clarity, you
said, your team only sees six
cases per quarter or per year.
No, that was six cases that, new cases that were opened in
quarter one. Not not six cases for the entire year. I think we
had have, or processed somewhere between 30 and 40 cases a year.
And then. Like when that case
goes to your team, maybe this was in our training, but I forget. Yeah so right now,
because the department of police accountability is operating
under a letter of agreement and
granted jurisdiction for only a certain number of category of
complaints or certain categories of complaints by the sheriff's office. When we receive a
complaint that falls within our
jurisdiction, we will open up an investigation and then notify
the sheriff's office when the
sheriff's office receives, a complaint that falls within our jurisdiction. They'll make that
referral to us for cases that
are not within our jurisdiction, that don't fall within those
categories, we'll refer that to the sheriff's office, and that will go to the sheriff's
internal affairs unit. And then the 30 or 40 cases that I'm
sorry, and then 30 or 40 cases that you have per year. How
much? How what is a what do you think the percentage is that
actually gets, I don't know what
the word is, like, goes through
to trial or, so the sustained
findings. Okay. Yeah so they
vary from year to year, I don't recall exactly what the numbers
were from last year, but as you can see from quarter one, there were three allegations with
sustained findings. So you know, they're going to vary from year to year as, as a percentage of the number of investigations
that we perform, as well as just whatever, wherever the evidence
takes us, but in the two
previous annual reports, we reported out on how many
sustained findings there were. And then maybe my last question is your recommendation, is this part of the ig's recommendation
or the dpa's? This will be part of the ig's recommendation. So
it'll be, a report that the
inspector general issues got it. And then I know you made a comment about, like, the body worn cams, because I, I'm probably going to dig a little
bit into it, but isn't I mean,
aren't the staff able to, like, turn off the cameras? And second
question is like, with the cameras itself, is it is it assigned to a particular sheriff or can they share between it? I guess I'm not really understanding, like the low
number of body worn cameras.
Yes. So I think the sheriff's
office indicated that there are a few hundred body worn cameras,
short of actually outfitting the
entire department. Yes, they can turn it on and off, but there's a buffering period before they turn it on that captures a
certain amount of time of video so that when they turn it on,
that records and is preserved.
There are also, departmental policies and procedures, just
like with the san francisco
police department on when the body worn cameras should be turned on. And, turned off,
oftentimes turned on when, there is or anticipated to be an
incident turned off when there
are privacy concerns. But that's
that's all part of the body worn camera or actually video, video evidence, policies within the
sheriff's office, whether for
each individual deputy gets one assigned or if they share, that
is not something that I know the
answer to. Thank you. Any other
questions, seeing none, I just
also want to say that, remind the public that our population
in incarcerated population has
increased by about 50. So as members recall, we had a very
robust meeting with the community for input in FEBRUARY.
So I wanted to acknowledge and thank chief ju for meeting with some of those community members and addressing some of their
concerns. I think that that has actually had a really important
impact on the fewer complaints
that we've actually received, also, inspector general wiley
has been out, meeting with the
community and addressing their complaints. So I always believe
that prevention is worth, you know, an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure. So that's why I feel it's really important to make sure we're hearing from the community that they understand that we are listening
to them. Yeah, I can also let
the board know, with that, with
the jail visitations, the sheriff's office has a jail
visiting committee, which
they've now invited the inspector general and our staff
to attend. So we'll be regularly attending the jail visiting
committee meetings so that we
understand, directly from the community that's most affected. What's going on affecting their
visitation abilities, do we have
any public comment on this item for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line? Item three department of police
accountability presentation. Please approach the podium when
it is free. I have two more
slides actually. Oh, sorry. Oh I'm sorry. Short term memory
here. Yes so I'll run through
these pretty quickly, much of
these, items you have heard from our previous presentations, this
is just a wrap up of what we've delivered in our support for the office of the inspector general, and that is in the first quarter, a quarter one. We have worked with the inspector
general to launch the new case management system, launched an electronic, complainant interface and a complainant
portal for complainants to track
their complaints. Our finance and administrative team,
assisted the, inspector general on the inspector general's
budget submission requirements.
And we've assisted the inspector general on launching the
newsletter, also, while,
performing all the investigative work, we've closed, nearly three
times more cases this year than
in the previous year. And, one
final highlight from quarter one
is that dpa received another night and award the second in a
row, and I'm just, teasing that
as a lead into your next
presentation, we have, our
auditing dpa's auditing lead here today, steve flaherty, who
has received numerous awards for
his work, including now three night awards, which is a
national award for excellence in
government auditing, PRESIDENT Sue thought because the term
audit is used very commonly,
within the public, as a, idea
for reviewing almost anything, that it would be informative for
this board and the public, to
get a overview in terms of what is involved in the government
audit all their strict standards
and requirements so that, everybody understands what's going to be necessary in terms
of resources and funding. If we
foresee the desire to have an audit team within the office of
the inspector general. Thank
you. Any additional questions from my, one more slide. Oh,
sorry. Future. Okay. So, just very quickly, what what we,
future looking what we intend to deliver for the office of the inspector general and what we're currently transitioning within
dpa now is building a cloud based file system that will, as previously described, give
everybody access to case files
on a secure cloud, to, make sure
that our files are more secure,
that they are preserved, for
future review. And more
accessible by our staff. To hopefully perform the work
wherever they are, we are currently in discussions with the sheriff's office and we'll work with the sheriff's it team,
hopefully to put our electronic
complaint portals on the jail tablets. And at some point, I know the inspector general has been trying to find funds,
whether it's through city funding or grant funding, to
hopefully install some kiosks at
some strategic locations to
have, more accessibility for the complaints, we're in discussions
with the sheriff's office about,
transitioning to an electronic use of force, tracking as, as
opposed to, paper, use of force
logs, we are also in discussions
and, working out, discipline guidelines with the sheriff's
office to hopefully, establish
some standardized and transparent, guidelines in terms
of what discipline should be imposed for or range of discipline should be imposed for a variety of different
misconduct findings or improper
conduct findings. And lastly, we
will be moving away from periodic reports, as you've seen
published on the dpa website and
hopefully before the end of the year, launching public data
dashboards that will replace the reports rather than having static reports with the numbers
we intend to put all the numbers into dashboards that can be filtered by the user in order to
identify whatever stat almost in real time, that the user would
like to see, and that, in a
nutshell, is our presentation for quarter one. Thank you.
Marshal real quick, just on the, well, first and foremost, thank you for this. Just on the future projects, like, are they
prioritized like, do we want to
see, you know, cloud based file system in the next three months
versus the sfso discipline guidelines? I was just just
wondering that and just kind of like timeline. Yeah. We haven't we haven't, prioritized them, in the sense that all of them have kind of different timelines for
us to be able to accomplish them , we are currently working on building the cloud based file
system within dpa. Once we have
a proof of concept for that,
then we'll start working with
that within the, oig case management system. But, I expect
that should be done hopefully by the end of the year, the electronic complaints in the
jail tablets will probably be
easier than, installing kiosks. So, that's a matter of
negotiating with the sheriff's office and working with the sheriff's. It team. The same goes with the use of force tracking, the sfso discipline
guideline. We already have a working draft of that, we're
working with, sheriff legal. And
once we have a draft that's
ready for higher level review,
it will go to the inspector general and the sheriff to
negotiate. There will also be
probably a requirement that we, confer with the deputy sheriff's
association as well as, the
supervisors and managers association within the sheriff's
office as it affects discipline.
So, in terms of timeline for that, it took the dpa probably
over a year to get the discipline matrix for the sfpd
online, which I know you're very
familiar with, and then lastly, the data dashboards, we're
hoping probably within the next six months, we'll get that all launched. We're already beta
testing it now. I appreciate that. That was really just asking just to make sure, see if there's anything that we could also do as board members to make sure that we're keeping an eye on it as we know the timeline. And if there's things that we need to push on in terms of resources around technology, I appreciate that. Thank you. Sorry, a quick question, how is this part of the budget ask, or does it cost anything? I'm just
curious. So in terms of, the
cloud based file system, we are
leveraging an existing license that the city already has, with
microsoft, using a microsoft
sharepoint cloud. And, the, the building of it really depends on
making that interface. Well, with the salesforce case
management system. So that there's a seamless integration.
So building that application programing interface is what's
needed. And that's really not a
large cost. And largely our
internal staff is working on building that. The electronic
complaints probably will not
have, any additional expense for putting on the jail tablets. But
the kiosk probably will, electronic use of force
tracking, that's something that, will probably be an expense that
the sheriff's office bears, and
if it's an additional budget item, it will probably be on
their budget item. The
discipline guidelines will, or shouldn't have any additional
costs. And, data sf is already a platform. We're just, figuring
out how all of our data will fit into that platform. Good. Thank
you. Thank you. I just want to also point out that funding is imperative for the sheriff's office. As you know, we had a
presentation by their it chief, and so much of their work is
still on paper, so that that's a
very difficult task to integrate
the different systems, also, we don't have funding for our office of inspector general right now, and it's really not
sustainable to be sharing investigators with dpa. And
they've not missed any statutory deadlines. As chief attorney marshal kane has pointed out. And we don't want them to MISS Any deadlines, so funding all
around is really imperative. And working with the sheriff's office, because right now it
takes staff to call data and
additional reports, so as much
as we can all advocate for adequate funding, that would be
really important. But it's good
to note that, you know, the number of complaints has
actually remained steady, if not dropped, based on increased
population. So I think that's a good sign. Yeah. And I think
that's a great point to raise
that, between the 100, 150 plus,
complaints that the internal
affairs unit investigates as
well as, you know, the 30 to 40 cases, dpa's investigating and
an additionally, the other
complaints for contractors and unsworn staff that aren't
included in that number, it has
it is requiring that all of the three agencies work together to
ensure that the wheels keep
moving, that the internal affairs unit keeps performing
its investigations. Dpa keeps performing its investigations
until the office of the inspector general has the investigative staff to take over all those responsibilities. If
we were to drop 200 plus cases on the office of the inspector
general now without the support
of these other agencies to help for a smooth and efficient
transition, we would immediately run up on deadlines that the
inspector general's office would
not be able to meet. So I think that's a point very well taken.
Thank you. I think, just want to thank you so much, marshall, for ushering in and transitioning
the complaint dashboard for us.
But I also fear that we MAY be
too efficient and too economical
for our own good. So you know, as as we budget in government
and use it or lose it or, you
know, expand your budget. And so we've been very lean. And that's
why, we just need to at least have 1 or 2 investigators. I
mean, we're only asking for half
of what we need. Really? Yeah yeah, half only for this particular fiscal year. Yeah. As
we try to phase in. Yeah. Process. Thank you. Thank you
very much, do we now have any
public comment on this for members of the public would like to make public comment on line item three department of police accountability presentation. Please approach the podium when
it is free. There appears to be
no public comment. Next item on
the agenda please calling line item for government auditing.
Informational item steve flaherty, director of audit, san
francisco police department of police accountability, will
share his credentials and
present on the audit process.
thank you so much. Yes we use the term audit very loosely, but I come from a numbers background
and the actuarial field. So there is a lot of important
credentials and investigations
that are necessary. So as we think about calling for future audits, we need to remember the costs that are necessary to have
the official audits. Yeah and congratulations, by the way for
your years of winning awards for the department of police
accountability.
All right. Good afternoon,
PRESIDENT. Sue, board members, members of the public. My name is steve flaherty. I'm the director of audits for the department of police accountability. Today, I'm going to present an overview of the department of police accountability audit function. Today's presentation will cover the work we perform, how we perform it, and provide an overview of the performance
audit process. It's just an overview of dpa's audit function. In NOVEMBER 2016, san francisco voters passed proposition g. This charter amendment changed the name of the department from the office of citizen complaints to the department of police
accountability, more than that, and most relevant to today's presentation, it required that the department of police
accountability conduct regular audits of the san francisco police department's officer
misconduct and use of force. Dpa conducts its performance audits in accordance with government auditing standards. These standards are also known as yellow book and are issued by the united states government accountability office. These standards provide a framework that auditors can use when
reviewing programs. These standards help ensure that auditors perform audit work with competence, integrity, objectivity, and independence. Using a proactive and risk based
approach. Naco recognizes auditing as a key practice for the effectiveness of civilian oversight. Audits can help
promote broad organizational change by addressing by
addressing systemic issues, analyzing patterns and trends, and addressing deficiencies in
training policies and procedures . Just an overview of performance
auditing performance audits test whether organizations use
utilize their resources to
achieve their goals. Yellow book standards outline five concepts describing how public officials
are to provide functions and services. These are.
Effectiveness, efficiency,
economy, ethics, and equity. Performance. Audits MAY focus on
one or more of these principles.
An audit finding is structured around five key elements, each answering a question for the
reader. The first of these elements is the condition meaning what is the current state? What are we observing?
The second is criteria. What is
the expected state? How should things look? How things should
function? The third is cause how
or why did this condition arise? The fourth is effect. What is
the impact and why should this condition matter to the reader? lastly there's the recommendation and recommendations addressed two
things. How do we resolve the condition and how do we address
the cause? It's on the slide. We have an overview of the performance audit process when
selecting an audit topic, we try to align our work with the interests and priorities of our stakeholders like the police commission. After we select a topic, we conduct research to better understand the subject
matter and to develop a methodology that guides the collection and analysis of the
information. As we conduct the audit. Yellow book requires that we develop a sufficient and appropriate quantity of evidence to support our findings and conclusions. Dpa's audits result
in a written report which communicate our findings and
recommendations for transparency. These reports are
posted on dpa's website and are generally presented to the public at a police commission meeting. Once a report is issued, it is the san francisco police department's responsibility to implement the
audits, recommendations. So this
slide provides an overview of some work that our function is
done. On the left is a one page
overview from an audit that we performed on the san francisco police department's use of force. Notable to this audit, we found that officers report uses of force reasonably accurately and in accordance with the police department's policy with
a few errors. However, we found that the department was not
analyzing its data to monitor department wide compliance with the policy and form force reduction efforts, or to gain insight into the role that bias
plays in using force. The example on the right is from an audit on sfpd investigations involving first amendment
activities. Although this is not an audit we're required to do by
charter, it is an audit that san francisco police department's policy requires that dpa do on
an annual basis. In this audit, we found that the policies, guidance on when it applies is limited and not specific. We also found that the police department did not destroy records and media related to first amendment events, as
required by department policy. So the next slide features our
most recent work. This audit
evaluated the san francisco police department's handling of officer misconduct. The audit had a particular focus on how the police department handled
allegations of bias. This audit identified key areas for
improvement, such as improving data tracking to ensure compliance with statutory deadlines for misconduct investigations, strengthening
approaches to investigating allegations of officer bias, and
improving public reporting practices to meet various
reporting requirements. The audit made 31 recommendations to strengthen the police department's accountability
processes. We currently have one audit in progress california assembly bill 953 requires that
law enforcement agencies report data on all vehicle and
pedestrian stops to the california department of
justice. Dpa's audit is on the san francisco police department's processes to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data it collects. In order to comply with this requirement. This concludes my presentation, and I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have. Any questions for my fellow board
members? I have one. You speak
about police training and I
wanted to know who created
police training. Who who created
police training? I'm not sure I who created the curriculum for
police training. For training
the police, that necessarily isn't something we've ever looked into while conducting audit. I think typically what we
do when we conduct an audit is we evaluate whatever the subject matter is. If there's any training relevant to officers fulfilling their duties. And we might evaluate whether that training is effective. I believe
it's last name is wolff, but it
was created back in the it was
created in a response to the 60s and the 70s. And they had a lot
of cop shops, academic, facilities that popped up to
train police officers, and anybody in law enforcement so
that they can get promotions and etc, etc. So this police
training or this training for law enforcement came in as a
response to an era of liberation
by various groups and that
police training or that law enforcement training has been
known to be colored with racism
and oppression and for means of
control. So if you were auditing
police behavior based off of training that was developed back
then, what benefit do we have
today when we are trying to move
into a phase of accountability
that are based on on principles that are not in the police
training, I can only speak to the work that we've done. For example, in our most recent audit on the police department's handling of misconduct, we focused on training requirements
for personnel assigned to the internal affairs division within
sfpd. So they have a curriculum that sets out the courses that they were required to take. And what we did is we went and evaluated whether the officers assigned to that unit had completed those courses, and we found some gaps in the training. So we evaluated some of the causes for that, including the policy language, you know,
setting out who's supposed to be tracking this information by when the training was supposed to be completed. That's kind of what we would get at during the
audit process. And I hear you and I and again, congratulations for everything that you've been doing. And that has worked out
beneficial for the community. My
question is, and hopefully not
necessarily to you, to resolve today in this matter, but just
to bring their awareness that if our law enforcement are trained,
in a certain way and they stick
in that training to supervise the community, but they are
wronging, or they are committing
wrongs upon the community, but it's in accordance with their
training. How will we ever
resolve matters that come down
to, simple things like, protests
against people who are undesired . Labels are treated with bear
spray or handcuffs that are on too tight and taken in for custody for long periods of
time, as opposed to protesters
who are going to the capitol to say, we don't like the election
results, and they just seem to come in, come out, and then we'll investigate and see what
happened. So that's what I'm
trying to get at. Like if, if, if we're if we're if we're
looking at police training and
really criticizing it for when
it came out and the purpose of
when it came out, then we can go
at the root of the issue. If we
train, if we change the training, and it's more in line
with what we believe today, should be effective training for law enforcement upon the
community, then we can look at somebody's behavior today and
say, you're out of line. And what we what we what we want today, I can just speak to the benefits that audit MAY provide to that objective. And one of
the things we do when we conduct an audit is we look for leading practices throughout the country. So that might be
guidance issued from the united states department of justice in their community oriented policing services. We might look to practices that have been effective in other jurisdictions . And what we would do is we would reconcile what we're seeing in the police department's policies and
training and practices against those other jurisdictions to make sure that the police department's policies, procedures, practices align to
what's considered leading best
practice in training policies
and practices. All right, so I was going to say, member palmer,
it's you know, it's an evolving process. So under the obama
administration, there was the 21st century community policing
and as member brooke is very familiar, there were over 200,
reforms that were recommended for our sfpd. And there was an
announcement that they recently completed everything. So it's
also not just about sort of completing the reforms through policy, but also making sure that it's implemented and
followed. And I think that that's where also the auditing
goes forward to make sure that
these policies, are, are well implemented. Yeah. And if there
needs to be changes. So, I think
it's constantly evolving. So,
and I think our discussion is a little bit beyond the scope. It
was really to give a little bit of flavor about what auditing is
required, so when we ask for an
audit, it's not something that's a layperson's kind of audit that
it actually requires a lot of
thought and budget. So, yeah.
Yeah, I do believe that audit is a tool that can be very
effective in rooting out, issues
that plague law enforcement and how they respond to the community. I do believe and I
believe it should be used even
wider than it is. And more often
because we have law enforcement institutions and agencies that
most people don't aren't even aware of. There are thousands of
law enforcement agencies that most people in grade school
couldn't even name. Three other
than sheriff, police, and what you know, after those two, who do you think of when we talk about law enforcement? So I
yeah, and you know, just speaking on on obama as you as you mentioned, I remember when
he had the, the beer summit, when a professor, a black
professor, couldn't even get into his own house because an officer went and said, and harassed him about going into
his own house. And so that was a big deal. And that's what I'm referring to, instead of having a beer summit, we probably should have had an audit, but I
rest. That was doctor henry
louis gates. Exactly, member
nguyen. Just to clarify the
procedures, when you select the audit, considering that there's
many aspects of law enforcement, use of force, emergency vehicle
operations, community relations, can you just summarize how you
choose which aspect to audit
with your team? Yeah. So in dpa's case, our mandate is set
by city charter starting with that. So use of force handling and misconduct pretty broad topics. What we do is we do some
research, to get deeper into
those topics and specific subcomponents of them. We might
see, you know, we do research across the country to see what risk areas are popping up in other jurisdictions, try to determine if those are also applicable to san francisco, we pay close attention to what's going on at the police commission meeting, to get a
sense of what's of importance to the commissioners, as well as what concerns the public are bringing to their attention at those meetings as well. And so, based on our research and other information we gather, we try to narrow down the topic and narrow
down the focus of our audits. All right. Thank you. Member
mango, I don't have any
questions. Thank you. Thank you for this. And we will keep you
in mind as we think about audits
that we want and consult you again. Okay. Thank you, do we
have public comment on this item
for members of the public would like to make public comment on line item for government auditing. Please approach the
podium when it is free. There
appears to be no public comment, seeing no public comment. Let's
move to the. Next agenda item. Calling line item five. Sheriff's department oversight board 2024 q1 report discussion
and possible action item
discussion and possible action on the 2024 q1 report. Due to the sheriff and the san francisco board of supervisors
pursuant to san francisco
charter 4.1 37b5 regarding sdof
evaluations and outreach and oig
reports submitted to zdob.
So, members, you received this in advance of the meeting, but
I'll give you a moment to review
you, it's pretty standard from, the prior reports of what we've
done in the past quarter, also
integrating the reports from our
inspector general, terry wiley. And because his office is not
staffed, we still don't have a
lot of, information to report
other than what we've conducted
at our meetings
. The motion to approve this
report. So moved. Do I have a second one question before we.
Yes the one at the bottom in all yellow. That whole thing is being removed. I'm sorry. The yellow means that it's being
changed or removed. Oh, that's the next agenda item on the
rules of order. But I'm looking at the, quarterly report to the
sheriff and the board of
supervisors. Okay give you a moment to take a look. I read
that already. Oh. You did okay.
Are we ready to take a vote? Oh,
sorry. Any public comments on this item for members of the
public would like to make public comment on line. Item five. Sheriff's department oversight board 2024 q1 report. Please approach the podium when it is
free. There appears to be no
public comment. Thank you, when
we take the vote now calling the roll on the motion to approve
the q1 report, member mango I
mango is I. Member bruckner I
bruckner is I member nguyen I
winn is I member palmer I palmer
is I PRESIDENT Su I su is I. The
motion passes. The q1 report is
approved. Thank you, the next
agenda item, please calling line
item six amendment to sdb, sd, ob, rules of order 1.14 discussion and possible action item discussion and possible
action to amend rules of order 1.14 regarding the process for board members. Requests for
information and requests for agenda items for meetings. Thank
you, members, we've continued this item for a couple of
meetings, so I thought it was really important that we actually get to this item, I also wanted to thank member
nguyen for suggesting that we
have a forum on, requesting
information or agenda items, and
I'll let him speak to that. Good afternoon everyone, today I'd
like to discuss an important enhancement to our current procedures concerning the handling and tracking of information requests within our
board, this initiative, while
straightforward, it's, it's
crucial for increasing transparency and accountability
in our operations, the need for
a new forum to preemptively
address potential, strains on our resources and mitigate concerns regarding
appropriateness and relevance of
information requests. I propose the implementation of a
standardized form. This
proactive measure is designed to
streamline processes and prevent potential issues before they
arise. Features of the new form,
requests or identification. Every request must be
accompanied by the
identification of the requester, ensuring that only authorized personnel are seeking
information on purpose of the
request. The form will require a clear statement of purpose detailing why the information is needed and how it will be used.
Approval process requests will undergo a review process to
ensure that they are justified and aligned with the board priorities. As no one member
acts alone, but all the board
members act together as a team,
tracking and accountability. The form will be entered into a database, allowing for easy tracking of who requested the information and for what purpose. Additionally, this system ensures that all warranted requests are processed
in a timely manner, similar to
how foia freedom of information act requests must be tracked to ensure compliance with legal
obligations. The benefits of the
form prevent misuse by requiring detailed information about the
requester and the purpose, we can prevent the misuse of
sensitive data, as as you know,
anybody can request anything,
and we're trying to prevent that , they can request your favorite
color. So that's an example of something that would get denied, efficiency. Streamlining the request process will save time
and resources, allowing staff to
focus on their primary duties, enhance oversight with better
tracking. Our board can quickly spot patterns that MAY indicate
issues or areas for improvement,
implementing this form represents a step forward in our commitment to responsible governance and operational efficiency by standardizing how
we handle information requests,
we not only safeguard our data, but also ensure that every request is necessary and appropriate. I believe this change will benefit all members
of our board, and I look forward to your support and adopting this new form, there's an
example form here, and it's not it's not to restrict people from
requesting information, but, like I said, anybody could ask
any trivial requests. And, you know, those are the ones that we
would like to deny. Open to any
questions that you have. Do we
have any questions or comments? I think it's probably just more on a legal side. So probably for janet or are there requests that
we can deny as a board? Right. I mean, if somebody asks and it's a brown act and they're asking for something, do we have the
right to deny that what's been
requested? So as I understand it, this this form and this rule
applies to requests from board members, not from the members of the public, is that correct? Yes. It's mainly for board
members and if it's submitted, let's say it's for, say, sheriff's, operations or something. Some things MAY be
propriety. Marie. Sure. And so
but as a board, if we want to ask for it, we can submit it. And there MAY be instances where
they MAY redact information or we MAY have to have a closed session. So this way it allows
for, you know, uniformity in requesting the information and that this is a board priority
and our board request. Okay. No thanks for that clarity, I
wanted to ask as, I know I was
emailing with, jenna a while back about this because I was
trying to understand, but the charter 4.102 is that, like the
overarching charter that applies
to any board, right, it already specifies the powers and duties
of the board as a whole, as opposed to individuals. And I
wanted to read it because I think it's I'll read it out loud
and then kind of explain why I
do think it might be duplicate
live in, the rules of order for
this board, but what does it
say? So commissioners lack the authority as individuals to
exercise powers of the board or commission, although the body
MAY designate an individual commissioner to perform assigned
duties such as monitoring the progress of a departmental
program or and reporting on the
program to the body. So I mean, I think in that sense, I just
don't know. I just don't
understand why we would make a
duplicative policy to further, I
mean, that already is reiterated
in the charter, 4.10 to 4, I
guess I don't know if I'll let janice speak, but in general, there's an overarching policy,
but the boards can make more individualistic policies. So
let's say we yeah. So we would
have like, say our federal constitution and then we have state law unless there are particular conflicts. But each board or commission can make
something that's tailored for that particular board or
commission. Okay, okay. So then the second part of it is, I don't know, I mean, I spoke about this in the last meeting, but I don't particularly think that we should be making a
policy around one person. And, second, I mean, I agree with
like, there needs to be a formality to it and we shouldn't be requesting maybe time sensitive information or more
sensitive information. And then the 21 days, calendar days, I do think is a little excessive before board meeting. And I
think the last time we talked, we were thinking about, I think
a shorter time frame, but that
would be my feedback. Okay.
Anyone else? Yeah. I concur with
the 21 days. I think that's, I just thought of something last
week, so that would have been out, but it's not like it
couldn't wait to another agenda item. But I think 21 days is
fairly long. I was reviewing the
end portion of this and I see like it looks like a double up and I just was asking for further explanation where in the
beginning they ask for the PRESIDENT's signature. And then at the end it asks for his signature again. And I was wondering, what's the difference between those two signatures?
Oh, it was a one was request for information. Another is a
request for an agenda item. Okay so this is so just to clarify,
this is not for any one individual. It applies to
everybody. So I believe in
having policies that are irrespective of who happens to
be PRESIDENT, vice PRESIDENT Or whatever member. So I'm trying
to make it uniform, and that it's evergreen, meaning that,
going forward, that it makes a
board stronger and more uniform. I mean, I mean, I'm I'm okay
with it. I just think it's it just feels like additional work,
though, I think in my personal
opinion, I think once we laid out the priorities and the fact
that on our agendas, there's an opportunity to share which should be on future agenda items, we should be able to pull
from that. Because I'm also just trying to be cognizant and thinking of like, so who do
these requests go to? They go to whoever the PRESIDENT Is at that time. Yeah but it would go through dan. Right, to get to the PRESIDENT. I'm just thinking of additional work. So I just
have to say I just have to say
so I think most of the members
are kind of insulated, and I know members are having being
like a ceo essentially of his
nonprofit, as members, you don't
see a lot of the stuff that goes
behind the scenes. So I do get a
lot of requests and information. I sort through things. I'm in
almost constant communication with dan and sometimes I, and
then I will consult with jana on
certain things. So this actually makes it a little bit easier. Okay. And it also makes sure makes sure that I'm not missing a particular email or a request. And so this makes it more uniform. So that we can prioritize things. And we make sure that it's a priority. And this way it doesn't seem like
I'm denying a request unduly. We
actually have it all on paper so that if there's ever a public records request or anything, it's all on paper here. And so
that, anybody can see whether or
not there's a balance, of, you
know, approving the request and,
and as we send it, a lot of it is, you know, requesting things at the sheriff's office. So,
this allows us to also keep
track of whether or not we are being denied particular information and if the board would want to discuss that with
the sheriff's office. So so I
feel like we have a record. So I
know also, being a government attorney, I deal with a lot of
forms in my agency. Yeah. So it
actually makes it easier down the road. I do like the form.
Yeah I mean, I'm fine with it. I
think the only thing for me is
if it's not even a caveat, but just I would be okay moving this
forward. If six months from now,
we can get it back on the agenda
to take a look at how it's been
going. Yeah, I mean, I think in general, I've, I've received served, you know, enough requests where it hasn't been problematic. I'm just looking at
in the future and especially
with our tight budget, and, and i think what's helpful, I don't know if other presidents are going to do that. I mean, I set up an entire year's worth of priorities and everything, and we pretty much approved it as a board. So there shouldn't be something so outside. And of
course, you know, we've also made provisions for if there's an emergency situation that we
want to hear from. Sure. Every job on the form julie looks good. Yeah. Thanks. So now I have to make it interactive, I think, I just quickly drafted it up, but I tested it. I'm like, oh, it's not interactive, so we'll have to tweak that. And then the footer will change based on the approval date. So let's say I'm just thinking
about the process. So let's say I have an idea I fill out the
form, I submit to you in 21 days you will address it. No. In general. Well, actually in
general you can just actually email me. But if it's something that's requested outside. So let's say we're making a request for information from the
inspector general or from some outside agency or the sheriff.
That's really where this form is very crucial. So the 21 days we discussed it and we can be flexible about that. But the thing is, if we wanted something
on the next meeting, even in general, when I request something from the sheriff's
office and I'm very mindful of
chief jue, asking us to have a
three week, time ahead, because sometimes he has to call particular staff and check
schedules to see if someone can make a report at our meeting so that was mainly the 21 days. But if it's something else, you know, generally I can try to
accommodate, but it's if, if
you're asking for like a speaker from the community, then it's really juggling schedule. So that's why I just put the 21
days, I see okay.
So you're welcome to suggest a different timeline if you want. It's. You know, you know, I get so nervous whenever it comes to, like, policy because I'm like,
this is going to be set in stone, and. Oh, no, no, I mean, look, we're having this discussion now and we can change it, you know, at a future meeting, if it doesn't seem to
work and reevaluate. I said, I'm
happy to make a motion just with the, just to make sure six months from now, though, it's on the agenda. And, dan, can you
can you make a note of that, that we review this? I think it
would be great to, to just get
the feedback. Yeah. Do we need
and we MAY not even have we haven't gotten MAY not even have data to. Yeah for sure. Yeah
okay. But remember like dan right now is wearing three different hats. So it's kind of
nice sometimes if he just receives the form and can keep
it I never know who he is. He's got so many hats on, so easy to
MISS. A so, so easy to MISS The
email too. Yeah. And just gets lost in the email. Absolutely. That's why I so appreciate dan because sometimes he'll call me up and say, did you see that
email? And like oh I missed it.
So yeah. Perfect. Nope. I think that motion is on the table. All
right. So can I have a motion so
moved. And can I just ask for. So are you voting on both rules? i just want that to be clear in the. Yeah the entire thing and
the form. Is that possible to do everything. I just want to make sure that was clear. Yeah both
rules. Yeah 21 days okay. In the
form. In the form. Yeah yeah, do
I have a second on this motion? I have a second. And then any
public comments on this item for members of the public would like to make public comment on line item six. Amendment to sd0 be rules of order 1.14. Please approach the podium when it is
free. There appears to be no
public comment. Okay I think are
we ready for a vote? Calling the
roll on the motion to accept the amendment to the zdob rules of
order 1.14 with the review in
six months. Member mango I alkali mango is I member bruckner I bruckner is I member
win I win is I member palmer I
palmer is I PRESIDENT Su I su is
I. The motion passes. The motion
is approved. Thank you. Next
agenda item, please. Colleen. Line item seven. Future agenda items. Discussion and possible
action item. So any pressing
future agenda items? I just wanted to make an announcement
that, director paul henderson will be having his. What is it?
California coalition of,
oversight alliance. So I will be
attending the opening.
Discussion, it'll be on monday,
MAY 13th in the morning. So I
think, deanna, correct me if I'm wrong, I could probably only have two other members with me if we attend this, yeah. I mean, in general. That's correct. I
mean, I might need a little bit
more information to be able to advise on that, but. Okay, maybe
I'll forward it to you. But in
the meantime, I'll just, you know, have members have it on your radar so you can think
about that date to see if you're available. And we can figure out
if it's just two other members who can join me, but it's not something that we formed. So it
would be attending. Really an
informational panel. Okay. And
it's a it's a conference of some kind that relates to the
business of this body. Yes. Yeah. Then it's a two day. It's a two day conference, but it's
all oversight bodies. And yeah, I think it should be, I think you should have no more than three. But let me just note
here. This is not what you're this is not the an announcement
time on your agenda, right? You're this is this is about
future agenda. Okay? So it's really it's kind of an announcement and. No, I know I
just want to make sure we stick with the yes, you know, stay under the expert or the description on the agenda. Thank you. I'll just I'll just throw
that out there and so we'll I'll
pass it through jana. And then you can think about it on your
calendars. Okay so and then actually I was going to just
look at our timeline and task force. So this month was really supposed to be for a town hall. And I was expecting doctor cheryl evans davis from our human rights commission. But she is right now entertaining, yeah. I think she was reading my
brainwave, but she is having
panels with law enforcement, so,
we MAY we'll we'll get a report. Back from her, and we can have
further discussion. And then the next month we're going to look
back on budget again, and then we're going to look back down
into the fall. So we will be looking at hopefully the use of
force policy and as you recall that the sheriff's office recently, fairly recently had a revision of their policies and
lexapol. So I will check with
chief jue and, general counsel now, ronnie singh, to see if they would like to make a
presentation on that so that
that's it for future agenda
items. So any public comments?

Good afternoon everyone. Afternoon. Afternoon. So in my
report, some of it MAY overlap with the last meeting because I think we've had some members who didn't have the benefit of hearing the last presentation. So in giving you a summary of
where the ig's office is to
date, beginning, of course, on
JANUARY 8th, 2024, I personally went through some of the core training classes with the
academy class. With the
sheriff's department, and also so, well, went through some of
those classes, particularly, the
classes that involved some use
of force, I thought the
instruction was very well done from my observations. And I came
away impressed with what I saw,
we also took a tour of, one of the jail, the downtown jail,
that was very educational in terms of just seeing all of the challenges that, the deputy
sheriffs are having to deal with
on a daily basis. And we also
went through onboarding with the department of police
accountability and I want to say
right from, right up front that from the day I arrived, the
support that I personally have
received and that the office of the inspector general has received from the department of police accountability has been
tremendous, at all levels of
their staff and the support, I
also want to thank the staff that is currently working
directly with the office of the inspector general, starting with
dan lujan, who is just a as we
all know, he's tremendous, and
anytime I need anything, I can
send dan an email and it gets done, but it gets it gets done
correctly every single time. And then, of course, marshal kind,
who is kind of my right hand
man, I got to tell you, you
know, I've been a lawyer for 34
years now. He is one of the most impressive lawyers that I've dealt with in my 34 years, just
a tremendous asset. So moving on , now that I've given everyone
their accolades, we did two
budget presentations. One on
JANUARY 24th and one on FEBRUARY
14th, public presentation of our
budget, we exciting news is we
launched the oig website, and
it's a website that, of course, is under development, but we are
at least out there in on the net
giving people access to the oig office, it has links to
resources and information,
including filing a complaint and we also have a complaint portal
on our current website. But we
also established, a mission statement, a value statement and
vision statements, for the
website, we launched. And this
is very exciting. Because at the
point we launched our new case management system, we had only
been in operation for 90 days. And so it is a tremendous
accomplishment for us to roll
out a new, oig case management
system, and I'd say the major it's a major system that optimizes the department's ability to manage and track the
work, analyze and report on
data, because I think the to me, to be an effective agency, you have to be a data driven agency. It is it is the data that is
going to tell us what is really
happening. And so I think that
the, the, the system that has been rolled out is, is just, it's going to be of tremendous
value to the citizens of the
city and county of san francisco . And more importantly, it has a
complaint portal. And one of the
things that I felt it was important in coming on as the
inspector general is, I think,
in order to have the kind of accountability that we want to
have in the community, you have to have a system that gives
people access. And one of the things that this portal does is it gives, the community access.
If they have any complaints.
And, and to the point where they just have to have internet access in order to make a complaint. And I don't know, in our current society, if you get
better access than that, so
we're very, very happy to see that. And more importantly, it only costs approximately $60,000. And, you know, when you really look at these case management systems, I've seen case management systems that
have cost millions of dollars
and have taken years to develop and get up and running. And so I
think for us to accomplish this
with, $60,000 has been in a, a
tremendous accomplishment. It we
also launched, as I said, the
oig online complaint system. And
we also have with a joint landing page so that if you go
to the landing page, it has,
these symbols of the department of police accountability and the
symbols of the oig so that you
can go if you want to make a complaint against the anybody in the sheriff's department, you
can go to the oig, symbols,
click on it and it takes you directly to our website, which
is very easy to operate, we also well, first, I want to thank
supervisor walton, on MARCH
21st, supervisor walton invited
us to give a, orientation of the
ig's office and where we've been up to this point to the office
of audit and to the audit and oversight committee, the board of supervisors, government audit
and oversight committee, we were
able to present, very similar to
the information I'm presenting now to that committee of the
board of supervisors. And, I
also want to thank PRESIDENT Su,
who was at that meeting and,
after I made the presentation,
MISS Su went to the, podium and
gave very supportive, comments for the ig's office. And,
PRESIDENT Su, we appreciate
that, those comments. So after
providing what we provided the
gao with a overview of our work, and I came away from that meeting feeling that all four members of the board of
supervisors, after hearing that,
presentation, I feel like they
were very, very supportive of,
seeing supporting funding of the
oig office because at the end of the day, that is that continues
to be our number one priority,
because I think in order for the inspector general's office to be
successful, we have to be properly funded. And we think that the proposals that we presented to the mayor's budget committee are very, very
reasonable. And as I as I've
said, on previous occasions, the
strategy is to phase in the ig's office and understanding that
we're in, unusual circumstances with the current city and county
budget in that, everyone is
looking at deficits and san francisco is no exception. So we understood that, which is why we adopted the strategy of a phased
in, ig's office. And so, as I
say, I think the proposals that we've made are, are very, very
reasonable. And I think that there's a lot of support out there. Of from different
entities that agree with us. We
also launched our oig newsletter
and will be launching our second newsletter, I believe, next
week. We're going to launch the second newsletter, we've heard
from some of the people that have viewed the newsletter and gotten very, very positive responses, and it's not a
newsletter that's really extensive in terms of volume,
but I think the quality and the substance of what we have to say, I think has been very well
received. We have set up a new
office within the offices of the department of police accountability. And what we're
very thrilled about is we have
workstations set up and, I mean, we have an office that's that's
ready to go, and all we need is
the funding to hire people and on board, staff. So that we can
get up and rolling. And I'll
just end by, I think public
appearances by the inspector
general and our office are very
important in terms of, making the public aware that we exist,
for one. But also, the value
that we bring to the city and county of san francisco. And
we've since the beginning of MARCH 8th, we celebrated the
black. I was the keynote
speaker, down in san jose, which
I think there's an acknowledgment of the position that's been created and I was
asked to be a keynote, give the keynote speech for the black history month program in
FEBRUARY. By the city of san
jose and the silicon valley
naacp, I've also, I was I've
been a panelist on well, I was
honored to be a panelist, and
asked to speak as legends of the of the black bar. So they
brought in, top african american attorneys, with some level of
accomplishment and, we had a
panel discussion on, what have been some of the keys to our
success and, and really, it was a it was an opportunity to talk to younger lawyers that are upcoming and share our
experiences with them and hope
that we could be of some value as they try to navigate their careers. So I think, programs like that are very important, we
also participated in the lunar
new year parade, we want to thank the sheriff's department
for allowing the ig's office to
walk the parade route with the sheriff's department. It was a
lot of fun. And, it was, you
know, I walked for many years. I watched the new york, MAY day
parade and never had really been
to a parade. And I was like,
stunned, I it was more people than I had seen at any event
other than a sporting event. So
it was it was a great time and it was a good opportunity to interact with the citizens of the city and county of san francisco. So we want to thank the sheriff's department for that opportunity. We've also participated in the sheriff's department women's because this
this past month was women's history month, and the sheriff's
department put on a fabulous
women's history program and brought in women of leadership
from around the country. And I
was able to talk well, I was able to sit in on some of the
sessions and just came away very impressed with the panelists, the quality of the panelists.
And, and just listening to some of the challenges that women
have had to overcome and, and continue to fight those
struggles and so I thought the program was very, very well
done. We also attended the
myself and marshal kane and PRESIDENT Sue attended the asian american bar association gala, and it was it was another
opportunity to, to, have a lot
of contact with the asian community and make them aware of
the, of our office and, and just it was a lot of fun because
there was a lot of good people there. We were also seated at the table with us attorney izzy ramsey. And so it was just it was a great event. And I think that we have to continue to do those kinds of events. And I'm
going to end by by, we also think it's important to meet
with the leadership of the
sheriff's rank and file. And we
I had a recent meeting with kim
lamba, the PRESIDENT Of the sf
deputies association. I thought we had a very, very positive meeting, in terms of our discussions and kind of what our
role is as the ig and how we can
work together to really make the san francisco sheriff's
department one of the best in the country. And so I think that we were all on the same page.
And then finally, I participated
with dreamkeepers, we've allowed
some members of dreamkeepers to utilize some of our office space
, and I just happen to be walking down the hall one day,
and I saw this young man. I hadn't seen him, so I introduced
myself to him and it turned out that he was one of the leaders of the dreamkeepers program, and so I suggested, well, I'm the new ig. I'd love to participate,
in your next meeting. So he set
it up. And so I was able to, speak to the members of the
dreamkeepers, at their community
meeting, that next wednesday and
had a great discussion with them, many of them were unaware
of the ig's office, and, we had like I said, we had a great discussion about the services that we bring and making them
aware of us. And I think that
any the more and more we continue to do that, I think the
more visible the ig's office will will become. And I think it's important for the communities of the bayview,
hunters point, in the mission district. I think it's important for those communities to know that we exist and that the services that we that are available to them from the ig's
office. So with that, that's my
latest report. Thank you. We
have any questions or comments?
I do. Vice PRESIDENT Karen, hi, how are you? Thank you so much for your presentation. I had a couple comments and I just a follow up question, so I did
want to say I had an opportunity to review the case management
software when it was in beta form. And I have to say, it's incredibly impressive, you know, and I think that it's really exciting that we're going to be able to have that now. It's about the budget and getting a
data analyst to be able to
maximize the use. Yes. Of all of the work that got put into that
case management. And so I'm really excited to see all the information and the patterns will be able to identify and,
you know, be able to develop forward thinking solutions.
Right. You know, so it really
excited about that. I, I understand that the I really
think the website looks amazing and I'm so happy that it is
internet accessible. Have we I
think this was an issue we had discussed like, you know, a pie
in the sky. Has there been any
thought moving forward at this stage, or, you know, in the
future about having self-help kiosks where people can have
access that don't have access, whether that's in the public
library or in the self-help sections of the superior courts
here, yeah. Well, the, the, the main discussion that we've
discussed is having a kiosk in
the visiting area of the county jail, because, you know, those
are generally the folks that,
you know, are more likely to have a complaint. And so we think that that's a, a location
that, that we've had discussions
and, and we'll have further discussions with sheriff
miyamoto, about putting a kiosk in that area because, you know, there are times where individuals who MAY be in
custody and MAY be disinclined
to make a complaint. And, and if
they have a complaint, they might be more willing to step
forward with any complaints they
MAY have by if there's a kiosk
in the visiting room, and after they make their complaint, they
can go home instead of into a jail cell. So I think I think there's some thought, because for us, from our perspective, it's really given the public
access and increasing the access , and so that that has been the
thought and, and again, we
didn't really think about a library because we, we just think that, you know, for the
purposes of the kiosk, for our
purposes, it's really for if anybody has issues with the
sheriff's department. And so
that's probably a, you know, well, a consideration, a
consideration. But I mean, actually when you think about
it, they the a library might be less intimidating than, than even the visiting room of, of the, of the jail. So it's something to think about. Okay,
so I also went to the 30 by 30,
women's leadership. Yes, event
and the panel that I went to was absolutely amazing. It was so
powerful and so strong. I have
to tell folks, I actually spoke
at the first one, last year,
which was a great honor. And
those kinds of events, I have to
say, it was so. Well put together and it was just so
empowering and such a joyous
event that you know, as somebody that has gone to so many conferences and done leadership trainings and do all those
things, it's wonderful to go
into that space and feel, you
know, like just supported and
educated, uplifted, joyful,
inspired, to come out of those spaces. So I have to thank the sheriff and everyone and
assistant chief carter, who just
did a fantastic job. Yeah, I it's wonderful to hear that you were there also. I know there
was a kind of a it was a large
crowd. Yeah. And I went after I was able to get some work done. So I'm very, very happy to hear that you also participated. Last question. Only question really
is. Well, I guess not. You've been here now a couple of
months, right? Yes other than budget. Right. Because we know
budget is crucial. What are some of the challenges that you have
seen and what are some potential solutions that you're looking at
at this stage? Well, so I'm not really one to complain. I'm just
like, okay, this is what we
have. And so let's just get done what we need to get done. But I
am going to complain that i don't even have an administrative assistant, and I'm not going to back off on
that, because I think that as an
agency, I really shouldn't have
to keep my own calendar and, and
we really need the assistance, to, to do the kind of work that that we're, we need to do. Because recently, I just
received a, a list of, of
community based organizations
from supervisor walton's office, and it's about 40 different
organizations and so I either
have to put the work on dan or myself or marshall to send out
the greeting letters and to all
these organizations and make the
initial contacts. And so I, now, aside from that, it's the only
complaint I'll have today,
outside of that, I think that the reason I'm so impressed with
both dan luang and marshall kine
is they're like machines. Yes. And we're able to get a lot of
work done because I have, very
impressive people around me. And
so I don't really have a lot of
complaints about not getting the work done, because I have such a tremendous people around me,
but, you know, that puts a lot
on them, that, so I think it's important for us to get funding so that we can onboard, staff so
that I'm not putting everything on dan and marshall. And it's
also, to me, my perspective is, you know, you have subject
matter experts that are here. We're not maximizing the expertise of the current staff.
If they've had to just only do
their time is being consumed by administrative matters, which we
could hire someone that's an expert on that. Right. And there
are things that, you know, we in
order for us to really help the
sheriff's department become, a
great sheriff's department. And I'm not saying that they're not a great department. I'm saying that every department can improve, but we need to have the
time to really analyze what's
going on. We need to have be
able to collect data, have a
data analyst to analyze the data , and I think that when you have
those things in place, then you
can really start, making the
kinds of suggestions and, and
also, one of one of our goals that and we're going to have some further discussions. But
one of my goals, after this week
is to have at least two town
halls, at at least two town
halls per month. And because I think it's important for us to now start getting out into the
community because I was, and it and the reason I think it's important is because, appearing
in front of the dream keepers group and to see so many people
who had no idea that we even
existed. And so I think it's time now to get out into the
community in form of town halls,
which is why I asked supervisor walton's office if we could have
a list of the cbos to get
started with, putting together some town halls and really
having a discussion with the
community because I think, it's important to have a tracking system. It's important to keep data, but you also have to listen to the voice of the community, and really respond to what their needs are. And the only way to really do that moment. So I just wanted to lay out for the public, not everyone knows what the 30 by 30 is. So
it means having 30% of our law enforcement by 2030, which is
not a long, ways away, but
having been on the commission on the status of women for 12 years, we had been working on that, all along. So I'm glad to
see it improving, especially
with junior cadets both men and
women. And, women cannot do it alone. We need the buy in of people who are making the policies and still that's
predominantly men. So you know, as far as the gao goes, the government, audit and oversight.
Excellent presentation by you,
inspector general wiley, the
issue is, if you are to look at that agenda and what was on
their consent calendar for the settlements, that's lots of
dollars. So at every opportunity that when I've been running into the mayor, I would remind her we need a budget, and that
preventing litigation, even 1 or
2 cases will pay for just the very bare bones budget we're asking for, which is really 50%
of what we actually need, and, you know, it's bare bones. I've
been doing a lot of work. So on
the side and so I don't I try not to burden dan and you and marshall and dan together really powerful. And you know that we
talk to each other after hours. So I don't know what's going to happen when, assembly member matt haney's disconnect,
legislation might go forward,
but, after hours, we're we're
all on call and I'm kind of a
vampire. So that sort of helps.
But I'm very cognizant of you having to travel to the city, to
the office. So I try not to call you, you know. Oh, no, I don't
mind. In fact, I'm I'm at a conference right now, so I had to drive from sacramento to be here, and I got to drive back to sacramento, tonight to be. And
then and then if you look at the outline that I put together for
the rest of the calendar, that focuses a lot on community
outreach, if you will notice, I've also included the human rights commission doctor, cheryl evans davis is really amazing. She oversees the dreamkeepers
program, so I think that the office space is very serendipitous because there's a
lot of, kind of cross-pollination and a lot of
people who are with the government. And then I think I
left an inspector general by a message that one of his
childhood friends, the sister of, happened to say hi. And now
it's, oh, you know terry wiley,
don't you? And so and her brother was formerly on the
police commission, so I think with a lot of community advocating for a budget and
being the voice and helping us communicate and really want to
thank, member mango for really
talking about communication, her expertise, being out there in
the community, having polished newsletters to, get the message
out. So thank you. Yes. So do we
have further comments, questions , member bruckner? Yes, if I can, through the chair. So it
sounds like a consistent theme.
Budget and human capital. Yes so I want to make sure that we continue to put that out there. And I actually only had one comment, and it was more of kind of a housekeeping, as someone who was formerly on the police
commission, and I was at the oci commission meeting, when I look at most boards and bodies and commissions, I would want to
invite the ig to be on the dais with us. Yes. Versus actually presenting, I think, in this format, I think has been very common. And very general kind of across the board. But it was something that I was thinking about last meeting, and felt like it was something as we talk about solidarity and going out
in community as the ig is out there, we support the ig and the sheriff's department. So I think
it would be cool. A corner right there. It's all his. It's all his. So that was it. Do it. Thank you, member wechter. Yes.
Well, welcome. Thank you, congratulations on the
accomplishments and particularly
on the website now. And one of the links is review dpa sheriff
department reports. And when you
click on it, it takes you to reports regarding complaints
against police officers. So is
that a mistake or is that going
to change because it's I think
it's important that we make clear in the minds of the public, there's a difference between the police department and the sheriff's department. And they're going to look at this and go look at all this huge number of complaints. But they're not against the sheriff's department. Yeah. Well that's one of the problems that
we have with the fact that we don't have a budget and we are
not yet able to, separate completely from the dpa. Now,
I'm not exactly sure what page
you're talking about, and, and
I'm sure I've seen it, but, you know, but I think that one of
the problems is that, it's
important that despite us not currently having a budget, that
the work is still being done.
And in this particular case, we have two investigators from the
dpa that are actually doing the work of the oig. And so that's
why that's why there MAY be some
intersection, with their reports
and our reports. But, you know,
that's something that we, will
rectify in the near future. But at the I think more importantly,
the work is being done. And also, I want to ask something that you and I discussed, the article that was in the pleasanton newspaper in which
you said you would decide in NOVEMBER whether you were going to be in this position or take the judgeship. And some people in the oversight community have asked me about that. Have you corrected that publicly, or made any statements saying that you are not going to accept the judgeship? Well, we do always know that the press does not get
things right. Yes. Okay. And so
I think that's where we should
start. And what I have said from day one is my commitment is to the city and county of san
francisco, and that's my statement today, and that'll be
my statement tomorrow. And that's why we're working hard to
put the agency together. So does that mean I'm sorry? Does that mean you will not accept the
judgeship? Well, I'm going to be very upfront with you. Let us get a budget. Okay? I think
that's a fair assessment. Okay,
regarding the budget. So you're asking for six 8124 line
investigators and two 8126
senior investigators. Yes. And does it look like you will get
that? No, no. And what what are
the what's the opposition to that? So I think initially that
the staffing that we presented
is the staffing that would make
us a fully operational, office of the inspector general. But we
understand that in our current budget, this current budget cycle, there are huge deficits.
And so strategically, we think it's more important to phase in the ig's office. Instead of asking for everything all at
once. And so we don't anticipate
receiving funding to, onboard
that many inspectors. But we can
get the work done. And phase in
the work, with 3 to 4
investigators. So that's what our budget contemplates. So let
me also interject. So in discussions with the mayor's
office, her anticipation was
sharing personnel from the department of police
accountability and I really shared with her that that's
really not a wise decision, because the department of police accountability has not missed
any statutory deadlines. If we,
look at different agencies, oversight agencies, they've missed statutory deadlines. So we don't want to start unraveling the department of
police accountability. And furthermore, we are trying to be
a little bit more separate. But, you know, marshall is wearing three different hats. Dan's wearing three different hats.
Yes, I step in a lot more than I need to and spend many hours looking doing calendar, looking at community, legislation,
policy, and sitting on a past commission where there was actually staff, there were staff that looked at particular policy and, and legislation. I'm drafting, you know, and doing
editing all along with the
assistance of dan and that is not what I necessarily signed up
for. But I can do it. The problem is, if we make it look too easy, we MAY not get a
budget. I mean, I think with the
help of marshal dan and, inspector general wiley, we've done more work in a few months than people would take a year to do. I mean, fresh starting something from scratch. Yes. So
I think the mayor is softening up a little bit every time I run
into her. I impress upon her the importance of having a budget and just even having an administrative assistant would
really make a difference. Right. And that's why I want to,
increase my public, I want to be out there much more with the
public and garner the support of the public. So in one, one group that I one important group that I left out, that we met with was
the san francisco latino task force. And I had a great meeting
with them. And, you know, they had a lot of concerns that they expressed. And but I think that
the more we do, the more interaction we have with
community groups and just the public in general, I think it
can generate some momentum to,
for our, our, office to be
supported. Yeah, I am concerned that you have adequate investigative staffing because I
know that a new agency can
become overwhelmed with an increased number of complaints
and that can be a morale problem
for the investigators. There can cause them to leave, you very
quickly fall behind, and you're not going to meet those statutory deadlines. So that's why I think there has to be a significant emphasis on, from
the very outset, getting a clear understanding that this is the minimum investigative staff
you're going to need to perform
effectively and, and, a source
of support you can have for that are people from naco, from the oversight community, people
who've been doing this work for decades in different agencies as, in different models who can
talk about the need for minimum
staffing and adequate resources
and funding, is one of the 13,
key factors in the for the success of an oversight entity on the naco website, and I think
you can get letters of support
from those practitioners in fact, there's a research article
that's going to be coming out sometime this year that studies
budgets and staffing for oversight agencies. That could
be a very useful, objective,
empirical source of, of evidence. I'd love to see that
for this. And if you contact I can't it hasn't been released
yet. But if you contact cameron mcelhaney, the executive
director of naco, who knows more than anyone else about what's going on with oversight agencies around the country and about the resources and staffing and
funding they need. She can, I think, give you a lot of useful information and put you in touch with people who potentially can
write the letters of support, perhaps call. Well, I guess they can't call into the meetings,
but write in to the board of
supervisors emphasizing why you need this, these this
investigative staff. You know, I agree that could be a very helpful strategy. I just want to
add, yeah, I just I want to make sure that we're moving along because we have some reports and I want to recognize a member of mango. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I
just wanted to, restate what
inspector wiley had said. He's a
person of one. And I think until he has this appropriate staff needed to help him do his work,
we got to maybe. Maybe we as a
board can help bring that support, you know. So yeah, I
think it's more important for, you know, local support. We do
have community, and then one thing that we, we haven't
addressed, and that's what something on on hold right now is the charter. So we had the staffing based on the number of
sworn deputies. But as we know,
the population has increased by 50. So I'm not saying that we're
going to have a barrage of complaints, but anytime you have an increase in population, we
can have an expectation of more complaints. Whether they're justified or not is, you know, to be seen. But that's another issue, right. And I will tell
the board that we are also
trying to look at some of the data because another concern that we have is the increase in
the number of inmates at the san
bruno jails and the lack of
increased staffing with the
sheriff's department. So, ken lambda just sent me a sleep and wellness study that they did of
about 200 deputies. And so, you know, we have some concerns about, their having proper
staffing, and how the lack of
proper staffing can impact the quality of the work that they're
doing at the jail, and which
ultimately can impact the services that inmates are
receiving. So it it's things like that that I think is part
of our role as the ig to raise,
that we also think that there's
there should probably be some,
some increased staffing to meet the demands of the increase in
inmates and, and there's a whole
new pod that are that, I think
the level of services that that pod is receiving, probably
should be improved, but it's very difficult to do when you don't have the staffing. Thank you. And that's why we have today's presentation. Owens.
Yes. So, any other further
comments or questions, I just want to say thank you for all the hard work and keep up the good work. Thank you. Member
palmer. It's good to see you on
the job. All right. Glad to see
you, too. Thank you, so with
that, I will proceed to the next
or have public comments on this agenda item for members of the public would like to make public
comment on line. Item two. Inspector general report. Please
approach the podium when it is
free. MR. Phil, new system.
Nice. Great as long as we know
that, no matter what, everybody's going to have to go
back to school. Whoever, whatever the budget you need for
this new agency. Where does this
budget come from? Because it's going to make a big difference on the data. You collect. The
data can be, let's say, reliable. If you don't know
exactly where the budget come
from, you understand. So it's always the same question as
always making sure that any
conflict of interest is made
clear for anything. It's serious
business because you make what
you want with your data. So how
do you know there it's accurate? Go back to the source who
finance you. It's basic. Don't
beat around the bush. You know it's a lot of talk blah blah
blah. Know what's your goal.
Yeah thank you. Good afternoon. Since we were talking or the oig was talking about systems, it's a good time. That handout that you received already is a data system collection. It's called
sherlock. Good afternoon. Oig and sheriff's oversight board.
Some of you know me. For the others who don't. My name is chris klein, and some of you know that I have over 25 years of investigating high tech crimes. This week, I have been at multiple public hearings to include the board of supervisors, health commission, and the disability and aging commission. Someone I won't identify by name, but is an african american and female, used a system called sherlock and other systems to alter the public comments. Closed caption in a bad attempt to discredit
me. That is a crime to alter public records. On wednesday night, the same person was on a
call labeled as anonymous to influence a decision more favorable to the mayor's office at the sunshine ordinance task force hearing. Unfortunately,
this person thought it was necessary to place this system on members of this board and senior officials within the
sheriff's office. With the system, they can alter data
falsely accuse a person of a crime, or attempt to use data to discredit a person, attempt to sabotage or sabotage their job, or alter decisions such as
public hearings in court and their favor. I just handed out
an email that is being circulated in city hall, read it
and act on it. I'm confident that this board and our sheriff are the right persons at the right time to change, to force,
change. And I'm not going to lie to you, this happened before in 1978. Same thing. People were using systems. So if you're going to use the data collection system, make sure you have credential credentials and
oversight. It's really important because people get a hold of the systems. They can use it in a negative way. Thank you, thank
you, thank you. All right. So
we're ready for oh I'm sorry.
There's another okay. Welcome.
Good afternoon. Excuse the
outfit. I was moving, so, just following up. I'm a service
provider in the county jails, and just wanted to give a quick
update. Same kind of deal. Still struggling with lockdowns, it's obviously affecting programs and the hours and the services we're
able to give guys. And I know
it's an effort that we're all coming together to try to meet, I just wanted to give that and I'm excited for the ig's, you know, arrival and I saw the case management system as well. So
looking forward to it. Thank you, thank you. Sorry. Which organization are you with? So I'm from, I'm employed by five
keys. I'm a interim co-chair for
latino task force's reentry committee and, roadmap to peace as well. I'm really happy to
have you here. Thank you so much. Glad to see you guys. And I did see sonny schwartz in an event. So we are all collectively wanting to reinstate a lot of the programs.
Yeah thank you, so on to the
next agenda item, dan calling
line item three, san francisco sheriff's office sfo
presentation, informational item. Board member and deputy
michael nguyen will present on his recent completion of field
training officer certification
after member winn's presentation captors captain sanford, chief
ramirez and chief jue will present on recruitment academy
process and ongoing training, working conditions and deputy
safety resources for the physical and mental well-being
of sworn law enforcement and the
junior deputy program member. Nguyen. Thank you and congratulations, member nguyen on your accomplishment. Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen of the sheriff's department
oversight board. Thank you for having me on the agenda today.
I'd like to share my journey through the field training officer program and what it
means to me, my background and
becoming a deputy, my path to
becoming a deputy started with a passion for public service. I
wanted to make a difference in my community, uphold the law and
ensure safety for all. After rigorous testing, interviews and
background checks, I was accepted into the contra costa county office of the sheriff law
enforcement training center. The
training was intense physical fitness, legal studies, firearm
proficiencies, and more. After
graduating from the six month
academy, it was a proud moment.
After the academy, I started work at the san francisco
sheriff's office. I worked in the jails, and then I patrolled the public buildings or the
clinics. It was challenging, but little did I know, the real
challenge waited for me during the field training officer
program. Fto the fto training
was a grueling journey. The fto training is where theory meets
reality. It's the bridge between
the classroom and the streets.
My ftos deputy choke, deputy galarza, deputy wacker and deputy ponce were seasoned
veterans. They taught me the ropes, but they didn't sugarcoat
anything. They would say, this job isn't for everyone, so show
me you could do the job. You have one hour to finish this
burglary report and hesitation killed the warrior, so don't
hesitate. Just act. We hit the
streets together, patrolled,
conducted traffic stops, handled
domestic disputes and more. My fto emphasized situational
awareness, communication and
decision making. The adrenaline
rush going. Code three for a man running in the streets with a knife was unforgettable. My hands shook as I approached the
man but my fto was calm.
Presence relaxed. Me we
discussed tactics, ethics and community relations. I learned
that being a deputy isn't about
just enforcing the laws. It's about public trust and
understanding the community. The late night patrols were eye
opening. We dealt with everything from noise complaints to life threatening situations. Each call was a learning
opportunity. We my fto
certification was a milestone. After months of training,
evaluations and assessments, I finally received my fto
certification. It's more than
being certified. It represents a commitment to excellence,
integrity, continuous improvement, and the ability to act according to the post
standards. It's a badge of honor worn by those entrusted to patrol the streets of san
francisco. It's a responsibility
I take seriously to the trainees
out there. Embrace the process.
Learn from your ftos, ask
questions, and remember mistakes are a part of the growth. In
conclusion, the fto training isn't just about tactics and procedures, it's about shaping character, resilience, and
dedication. Thank you for
allowing me to share my journey, and I look forward to answering
any questions you MAY have, any questions or comments from
members. Thank you so much for all the hard work that you've
put in. It's great to have your perspective here on the board
and to really kind of highlight
the experience that deputies have being out there and, you
know, jeopardizing their own safety for the benefit of community. I think that you are an excellent model for other
deputies and very proud to be
able to serve on this board with
you. So thank you. Anybody else?
I just I also want to encourage, as we're getting into the realm
of, of community, and there's
some programs in the fall and,
field or faith in blue that
assistant chief carter also puts together. You will have an
opportunity to learn day to day what deputies do, but also the
simulator. And I know vice PRESIDENT Carreon has done
simulations. So that is very eye
opening. So for all those who think that they can see a video and second guess an
instantaneous, decision that,
our police officers and our deputy sheriffs have to make, you know, you might want to think again. And actually go
through the simulation, it's
very eye opening, mike poon did
the training, and mike's, he's he's done a lot of academics as
well. I think he's also has a
degree from harvard, and he says
making it through the academy, it's fewer than 5. So that's
that's lower than getting into
an ivy league college. So you are the elite of the elite. So want to thank you for the service. But it takes just
stamina, grit, decision making,
and so I hope that all of these programs and, and the presentations that I've put together throughout this year gives people a broader
perspective of what goes on in law enforcement. As I publicly stated, oversight doesn't mean
just taking complaints. And, you know, talking to the sheriff
about complaints. It looks at the well-being of our deputies, our frontline people, to make sure that we can support them.
Well, because as we know around the country. But but we're
focused here is the shortage of
staffing. So remember, the next time you're enjoying dinner with family that many of our deputies
are recruited for 16 hour work
days, you know, sometimes three days a week, so you can't plan a
life around that. So and then some of our deputies live far away, and it's not safe for them to drive after so many hours, and they end up sleeping at the
jail. So I want people to really think about that and appreciate
that. Thank you, member. Yes.
So. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. No, I
was I was just going to say, I know when I was on the police commission, I got the opportunity to go through the simulator and let's just say I'm supposed to be doing what I'm doing now. Yeah, yeah, there was, it was quite interesting. I did a lot of de-escalation, which in certain situations I probably shouldn't have, but just one again, just want to echo the. Thanks, but, deputy nguyen, what's one thing you would tell young michael nguyen,
coming to the force to be a deputy that, you know, now that maybe you didn't know back then that you would want to share with yourself, the most important thing I would say is,
don't give up on yourself. And don't don't lose faith in
yourself, because right when you
think you can't get over that
hill, you just give it a little bit more energy and you're there. You're on the other side.
So don't give up. You know, if
you got a goal in mind, work towards it whether you fail or not. Just keep going towards it and you'll eventually get there.
I appreciate that, member wegner. Yes, so can you. I know
you've been a deputy for, I
think 6 or 7 years now. So where does the training you went through, the certification fall in the typical career of a
deputy? Is this something that everyone's going through or just
those who are going to be doing patrol duties, the fto
certification is for people going outside of the jail. So in the field fod field operation
division, people that are
assigned to, for example, civil,
sheriff's patrol unit, units outside of the jail, warrant
services, units like that would have to go through the field training program, to know how to
handle calls, because you could get flagged down for a variety
of law enforcement, incidents, and you would have to know how to handle it, so the, these,
this certification is specifically for field training,
out in the field deputies. So
I'm familiar with the field training program for police departments. Can you describe
this, the length, what it
involved formal instruction in the field work different shifts,
etc. Yeah absolutely, so it's
very similar, almost identical
to the, police. Police department's field training program, there's a variety of
shifts, day watch swings and, well, actually typically just,
for, for me, I speak on myself.
It was day watch and swings and, we would work depending on the
fto. We work in certain district, mission district. We
could go out to the richmond district, tenderloin, soma, and
we would look for crime and we
would enforce the law. We also take calls off the board. So people call in to 911. For
example, they would call in for a variety of issues and we would take calls off the dispatch
board and we would go handle it. And how long was the program? Was it all field or was there any classroom instruction, there
was a pre-academy. So it was,
scenario based. And also in the classroom before you actually went out there to prepare you for the streets and, yeah. So
the, the whole entire program,
it's approximately three months,
but it can get extended if you
are, lacking in a certain area.
So the extension would be 16
days. And does this mean you're your assignment now will be in field operations bureau rather than in the jails? Yeah, I've been out in the sheriff's patrol
unit, for a while in the public,
public buildings and doing the,
hospital and the fto program was getting improved and getting
better and better, recently we
had a coordinator, mike lee, and timothy conway, which are doing
a phenomenal, phenomenal job at,
directing the field training program and making sure it's tip
top, so right now I'm in the, spu and I'm still in the spu, I think I go back into the jails
in around JUNE, but we'll see. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome.
Thank you. I think before we take public comment, I'd like
the rest of the presentation. So with that, I'm going to bring up
chief jue to give us a layout of
what's coming next. Afternoon.
Members of the board welcome back, MR. Palmer, so we're going
to do a presentation related to the academy and the training that the deputies have in addition to the wellness program we have and what we're doing in the jails. So, first present person that's going to come up is captain jamal sanford. He'll be presenting on the training and everything related to the academy in relation to the field
training program. Welcome,
captain sanford. Thank you. Good afternoon. Members of the board, it's my first time being here,
so, I appreciate you guys and,
you know, support and all the work that you guys are doing, to
assist the sheriff's office and the community at large.
Presentation is up. Excellent. I can go to the next page. All right. So I'm only going to present on, what was asked. It was just the recruitment academy process and ongoing training, which will also include some of
the information that member nguyen presented, for
recruitment, we have two staff members, and, one of them is the most recent addition because we,
saw that his expertise in his previous career would enhance
what we have for the deputy sheriff, because a lot of our positions that we have, for our deputy staff, we go, we come into this trying to, you know, to be deputy, our sworn staff member, and we take on, other duties that, we don't have
training for necessarily. We do screen and we do interviews for
those people, but, it's enhanced
when somebody else that has like 30 or 40 years experience, as such as MR. Frank skleros does
have. And to enhance what, our other member, deputy justin
murray, has. So we have one recruitment deputy that is deputy justin murray. He brings his expertise, expertise to
recruitment of being an actual deputy sheriff. So that way when he's talking to people, he can explain what the job is and all the ins and outs, deputy, I'm sorry, recruiter, frank skleros.
Squarcio. Was the actual I believe he was the athletic director at sonoma state at one
point. He was a coach and he was a recruiter for many colleges.
So he brought his recruitment expertise to. And he also came
in, got the information he needed to be up to speed. So that way he can clearly talk to people about, the wonders of being a san francisco, sheriff's
office employee. And I do say office employee because he does. We don't just recruit for deputy
sheriffs, next slide, events. We
do several events. Next slide, some examples of plants. We do
approximately, and this is on average, including the time during the pandemic where there was a minor, a minor slowdown in events, obviously, for the quarantine. But as soon as we came out, we went back to our our average of about 135, events
a year, we do law enforcement academies, because there are a lot of people out there do that are not affiliated with an
agency that we go and we talk to them and see, one of the reasons why they're not affiliated to if they're interested in coming to our department and being affiliated with a law enforcement agency, can we go to community colleges? We go to four year colleges and universities. We go to job fairs. Particularly we just recently the city had a series
of city job fairs that we made sure that we were attended. Thank you. And a really huge I don't know if I can say, shout out during this meeting because of public comment, but I am going to say shout out, to our drs diversity recruitment team because they really been helping us out a lot with being able to enhance the recruitment that we had already, we go to a parades multicultural events and we do,
combined, where if you saw the slide before again with our two
staff member, it was one it was definitely deputy murray, we recently, separated because de
pendre was the one recruitment deputy and the community
engagement deputy at the same
time, we recently separated that. So where he can focus solely on recruitment and we have another person, director kelvin wu, who is now the director of our community
engagement, next. So here are some examples of some of the events we went through in the
last couple of months, as you can see, there are colleges and there are the citywide job fair, the one particular at the top.
We are, now moving forward with even though it's been about a year, we've been dealing with
some of our armed forces.
People, some of the armed forces
where, we realized between p
three and our army p three and,
army pays program where we, are have access to bases where we
can recruit, military veterans that will be discharging soon.
And so the same thing with the army pays program, where they're within a year of being discharging from the military and are interested in taking a
job in law enforcement that we have access to speak to them. So that way, while they're still
completing their service, we they can go through the hiring process and by the time they discharge, they will be placed.
Next slide. Same thing this is the recruitment. Here are some
of our partners. Again army pays, our diversity recruitment
team p3 office of economic and
workforce development, we work with them closely on enhancing
again our outreach to people. So
that way we can get good quality
people in the sheriff's office, this is just another list,
hiring modernization team. They are also another shout out to
them who is super helpful with
navigating certain things like, enhancing our presence on the
air website, helping us navigate
smart recruiter, and helping us
organize our efforts. So that
way we're, example I give is that we are focusing on the
places that we get more bang for our buck, and not and eliminated
places that are not places where
we're getting, the amount of applicants that we want. So if I
go to, city college and I get 20 people that apply, then I'm
going to keep going to city
college. But if I go to csm and I get five people or one person,
then I have to tone down how many times I go to csm, next
slide, marketing. I don't want
to press the budget issue a lot,
but marketing, we have no budget
for, and so we come up with little ideas and things that are
helpful, we do lean a lot on our, on our partners or things that we already have in place,
the bus ad that you see on there was a really struggle to get,
and to get the cost down enough to where within our budget that
we had, you know, we, we were we
were able to get bus ads on, all
these photos were taken by us. It was not done by a marketing
firm, we leaned on the talents of the people that were already working the department to get good quality photos. And we have, a lot of these photos that are, changed frequently on our
website, social media and ad, so on and so forth. You can go to
the next slide. So here are some of the things we do, staff, it continues to be the number one
resource for our recruiting. Word of mouth is always has
been. And continues to be how we
get a lot of people to come in to the sheriff's office, email blasts. We email a lot of people. We do a lot of communication, video conferencing. There is a particular program that we tried
out, to make sure that we make connection with people. They say in recruiting that seven touches
is a good number. And that means that, you know, I'm talking to
you. At least I've talked to you at least seven times. So somehow, some way, whether it's through email, text or through visual, places, we recently
played with a company called visage where you can make a
schedule to talk to directly to one of our recruiters, and they can answer your questions. Most of them are frequently asked questions, but it is good for a person to talk specifically about their current situation.
So that way that you can,
navigate with that person how it would be effective for them to come into the sheriff's office, smart recruiter, obviously, we
are navigating around that, because we're new to using the recruitment part of smart
recruiter rather than the hiring
part of smart recruiter. And other networking platforms
there. There's, a couple of people that we've had,
presentations from, there's handshake and things like that, where again, it is another way to communicate with people that
are interested in coming to the sheriff's department to answer
all the questions, particularly about their situation. Next slide, we are currently on social media. We're on most platforms dms, facebook, instagram, twitter, linkedin, so on and so forth. We have had, again strategically placed,
billboards, when we when we
could with if we had little pockets of money to be able to do those things. And we also work with the whoever's providing that service to keep the cost down extremely low because we don't have. So some
of these ads only stay up a month. And that's all we have really. The funding for,
banners, if you've, strategically place at 425
seventh street, just so happen to be, strategically, very
fortunately placed where it is because coming into the city and
going out of the city, right, going towards the bay bridge, the back of the jail is there. And in those windows we were able to put up, a recruitment,
banner that says join our team or your future begins here with
contact information. So coming in and going out of san francisco, you will see, hey, you have an opportunity to join
our team, radio ads. We've had a
couple, during, the playoffs with when the warriors made
their run and the niners made their run, we were attached to
those where basically there was
a 32nd, notification that we
were hiring, fliers and cards,
which we, we had for decades, which is, again, what our budget
has allowed for as long as I've been in the department 24 years, and we've always done that, it's basically just information cards that we pass out during a recruitment events, and then our
website. Thanks. Thank you. Now,
one of the questions was the academy process and how we get
there. So we're skipping past you applying and taking the
test. If you're once you're in the academy, here's the process.
Once you've been hired and the
sheriff says, yes, you're suitable for this department,
you have been selected, then the first thing we do, you swear. And I always tell my story
because I was hired as a deputy sheriff in AUGUST of 2001, and I
started the academy, in AUGUST
of 2001. And my first month of service. We all know what happened on SEPTEMBER 11th,
2001, and we were notified that we should be prepared in case there is an emergency in san francisco that we would be deployed at that time, people don't know that, in the san francisco sheriff's office, it is like the movies that you see that the sheriff does deputize you and that if he needs
assistance more than what he has , he can deputize you and you
would have to act by the law. So we swear people in before they go to the academy. So that way they can be active whenever they're needed in case of emergency arises. Obviously we
would not put that out in the field because they don't have any training. They would start in places where they would do stuff like administrative work or something like that. But if
it if it came to where it was super catastrophic, then we would be able to deploy them, so
you get sworn in. We are one of the few agencies, I believe we might be the only agency that does a two week pre academy, during a pre academy week, we give you the tools that we know that you will experience on a larger scale in the academy. So that way you're not going from
no disrespect to grocery clerks,
some of our best deputies have been grocery clerk because they have good customer service
skills, but, you go from being
that clerk to right to, hey, you got to learn about law. And there's a we need a transition period. So two weeks of a
transition period where we show you what to expect in the academy. So that way you're not going in there blind, it's been highly successful. I went to one of the first pre academies. It
was only a week then. It is now currently two weeks, so that's pre academy. During the academy
it differs to the academy. The state mandates 17 to 20 weeks.
It actually mandates our. I'm
just guessing that it tells you about what the weeks are. I think the hours are something
like 664 hours, and the academy is actually turned out to be 17 weeks, which actually, the information on the next slide. So I don't even know why I'm guessing. Next slide please. All right. There we go. 17 to 20 weeks. Current academies that we've been using consistently is south bay regional consortium.
They have four academies. One at in san mateo, two in san jose
and one in seaside. And santa
rosa is another academy. We use, and we recently started using
alameda county out of the need
to, get people that we just hired into an academy quickly
because we want them to come out in time to bring down some of
this overtime. So those are the three main ones we use, next
slide, that was pre academy. The
academy, once you graduate the
academy then we, you get your star because you can't we can't
give you a star before you come up before you show me your posters, your post certificate, then you get your star, and then
we send you, to a training that
comes after the academy. Some of the post academy training is,
for back in the standards of training that they have for correctional officers, you have
to go through a core course, a supplemental core course, which is supplemental is this is training that's supplementing the academy training, and that
is approximately five weeks in our department, even though it only requires 56 hours. So we give a lot more training, during that time, and, for our internal
training, we have, which is similar to the field training
program, we also have our jail training program, which is also seven weeks. Every deputy sheriff goes through those two
first, to the member nguyen's,
training. That is something that
specialized, depending on how you get there, we have what they call satellite assignments, which are, five year assignments
that you can elect to go into. You, apply for, you're selected,
you stay there for a period of about five years, the hospital unit that he's in current is a five year terme and is one of the satellite units. There are
some field non satellite units. Basically you get also still get selected to go into those units and you that you do need field training in. But everybody gets the core class and the jail
training. Next slide. Ongoing
training. We are mandated by law to take a certain amount of training because we all know
that sometimes you depending on your assignment, you don't do certain things. So they do want
us to make sure that we have a couple of things, which is perishable skill training, professional development training, so on and so forth. So we have two governing bodies that we have to please. One is california post, the other one is the board of state and community corrections. And post
requires that 18 hours of,
certain types of training, tactical firearms, drivers training, arresting control,
strategic communication, use of force that we have that training 18 hours of that various
training depends on on which one
you want to that that you choose
18 hours every 24 months. So every two years and in back is
yearly, on a fiscal year basis,
you have to have 24 hours of advanced officer training is
what we call it advanced officer training, where you also can
either do a combination of these trainings that we're that we
listed here at and other training that, they actually
approve. They don't have a set
training that you have to give. They just want to see that whatever training you're giving
to people that work in a custodial setting, that they look at their they look at it and they approve it and they certify it. If it is certified
by them, then that's the training that you can provide. And they will say, we will give you credit for those 24 hours. If you give these trainings that you told us you were going to give, slide. Thank you, then we
also have our city and county of
san francisco training that we also give, which is the mandated
training. We all have to do as,
city employees. And that is our discrimination and harassment
training, the cyber security training that we all get those emails about saying, please take
it. So we can make sure that
we're all safe and, professional development training. It is in
the msas, which is the managers and supervisors association for the sheriff's office. It is in their contract that we give them a certain amount of hours of professional development
training. And, then by our employees, not just necessarily
deputy sheriff, but any of our employees that put in a training request. We look at the training and how it is relevant to the sheriff's office or to that
person's job scope, and then we approve that training. We send them the training. So if you find some professional development training that you like, then we'll send you to it. There are also some training set that we encourage, like the sherman block leadership institute, for anybody who wants
to be a supervisor or manager, then we encourage them to apply to those. Those are specifically selected sheriff signs off and
we send you away. Next slide.
And there was a question about
the junior deputy program. So, junior deputy program, I might
get a little emotional about this because it's near and dear
to my heart. This is my purpose as dealing with youth, so, remember, brichter will, attest
to I am a product of youth,
youth, community development, I used by one of my first paper
jobs. I say paper because my father owned a construction company and I worked in construction. So I was 11 years old when I turned 14. I had to
get a real job that came with actual paycheck. And I started at ycd, and I worked, latchkey
at the, joseph lee gym, when I was about 14, I read books to
kids, so, someone, to go to the next slide is a nonprofit 500 and 1c3 that the sheriff's
office has a letter agreement
with. So for support, in that they, give a summer academy. We
do mentoring, we do sports
camps, the air squadron currently is working with them on flight stuff with, unmanned
aerial vehicles or drones, planes themselves, so on and so forth. They take them a lot of field trips. It's a great program, and then they also join us at community events, some of you who were at the women's leadership conference at, seeing
three of our junior deputies, that were there, I'm
particularly proud to of caitlin. Caitlin has a really
strong story, she was very, very
nervous for months about giving that presentation. And I'm glad
that, I'm so proud of her. Thank you. That's for saying it. I'm
so proud of her, so all the age
groups, we are trying to be strategic about the age groups, the junior program try to be about the age group. So we make
sure that they are actually getting the information that they need so they can be leaders wherever they are amongst their peers, it does stuff like leadership training, mentoring, conflict resolution, because we would like them to be able to be peer support at their, whatever schools or in their family, they get first aid training, so on and so forth. And they do get like the baby babysitters training and training because we also bring it up to the fact that it doesn't matter what age you are, if you have a younger sibling and something happens to
them, you should be able to help that person until emergency services come. So, it's a really good program that we support. We want to continue to support that program, because we have a lot
of good leaders in some of these young men and women, and we want to make sure we bring that out there. They have the right information to do it, other than
that, I believe I will turn it unless you have questions for me, I will turn it over to, chief. Chief ramirez so he can continue to the presentation.
Thank you. Thank you. I just had a quick question, in the p
what was the tangle out percentage from the academy
versus now? I understand that the classes are smaller now, but more people are getting through
the entire academy. That that
varies. Before I can say this,
before, because we're talking about recent years, I can't go
back as far as when we used to be. We used to feel academies with 40, 30 or 40 people, in my tenure as the administrative captain, we've sent about
approximately 20 per academy until the pandemic. And then it
started to dwindle down to like 4 or 5, we're currently
increasing that back up. That number is going back up after the pandemic. It's about last academy we sent was about 14
people, the next academy, the next two academy sent eight. So it's slowly but surely climbing
again, we have a like 90, 95,
graduation rate. Normally we only lose maybe one per academy,
sometimes none at all, we did have one time where we had an anomaly. I can't even say the word. I don't even know. I'm trying to say the word, a rare occasion where we had, more than 4 or 5 fell one academy, but
either way it goes, the opportunity for that person to go back through, depending on
the timeliness of it, we try to put them back through because it might be one minor mistake that they made that they learned from. And then we try to get
them back in. Great. I hope I answered the question. Yep, that's good to hear. Okay. Yeah. Any other questions or comments?
Member wechter, you mentioned the you have no marketing budget. How does that compare with san francisco police department, let's say surrounding counties. San mateo sheriff's department, are you getting short shrift compared to comparable agencies? It's absolutely a word. Did I say
that right? Yes, on on several
scales. Right, the amount of people we have doing certain
things is not comparable. For instance, you saw, when we when
I say that that deputy marin was the recruitment deputy and community engagement deputy,
when everybody else has 16 to 20 people doing that type of thing,
same thing with the amount of
money, I can't I don't know what
the actual figure is for what our budget is. I do know that our recruitment budget covers,
it doesn't cover what you think it covers. When I say recruitment budget doesn't, that doesn't mean marketing or any of
that thing. It means salaries. Right? So that means the people
that my background investigators , their salaries is in that
budget. What we pay DR. To give our test that's in that budget.
So it's not the marketing part where I can actually pay a marketing company, you know,
however much money it takes to run a full year round ad or multiple ads and multiple
different mediums, there's it's
zero compared to people who have , you know, 1 to $2 million for,
for that. What are the question
regarding the perishable skills,
the ongoing, does that include any training on constitutional
policing since sheriff's
deputies are now doing patrol duties where they will be making stops, searches, arrests and the
law changes all the time, is there any updated training, on
that? And if so, how much,
anytime there is a, an update in the law that affects the things
that we do, there is training on that. And it's not just training saying, hey, this law changed. Here's a memo. It is training that we have to incorporate it specifically. We know that laws have changed specifically in recent years and use of force, that has been reiterated with specifically talking about the,
the law itself for a certain amount of hours and then incorporating how that affects our use of force policy and how how how that changes it.
Specifically. Yes. Thank you for
a great, thorough presentation
on, so you have recently hired pretty recently a director of
development, right. Development
or or isn't a director of outreach. Oh. Community
engagement. I'm sorry. Right.
Okay, great. So does that person are they also responsible for marketing or do they do something completely different? So how does that work? If we're talking about the director of communications, that person is
in charge of what internally is
communicated to our staff and what is externally committed to
communicate it to the public,
that is essential of, the person who is pretty much management of
our, our public relations officer and our, our public
information officer. Yeah. So part of that would be like the
website, which is a part of our,
some of our recruitment advertising, but it's also the website for the entire sheriff's department where we are currently working on. If we did
have the budget is a separate
recruitment website, so that way
we know and we can definitely 100% get the analytics on where
people are, seeing us and how
they're applying to our department. So that way we know we can focus specifically on those areas if we had our own recruitment site, because that would be dedicated completely to recruitment, where people had a
space to go to ask their questions and specifically say,
hey, I saw you at the women's leadership conference, can I get
more information? And that's the key to everything. I think being out there, being visible, I know
member brueckner. He's he's out at different events for chinatown youth center. So it
was chief jue, I was there and, kelvin wu, it's always great to
see the same faces because when it comes to recruitment, there's
a comfort level in seeing the same faces. And so for people who might be hesitant to go to
the recruitment tent after they see the same faces, it's like, well, they look pretty friendly. I think I'm going to go up and ask some questions. Yeah. So
that's very heartening. And so I just want to remind all the members, if you get to go out there, you'll probably find some familiar faces and introduce yourself to some of the deputies or the captains or chiefs who don't know you and kind of work together and kind of get the feedback from the community. And
my mantra has been for a long time, you know, good leaders know about their community, but potentially great leaders are
immersed in their communities. So thank you very much. Any
further, member palmer, nice to
see you again, I talked once
with, the chief about, like,
having some type of community, engagement around, like, a
softball game between, organizations, nonprofit
organizations that do work in the community. That way you can, capitalize off of the people
that you're serving there, and
then people who MAY even have an
adverse, perceptive of the
sheriffs. And we play some softball or some basketball. And
then you are recruiting young
minds to, to know, how honorable
it is to serve in law enforcement, especially as a sheriff, being that the name sheriff comes from sharif, which
means honorable. So you know, implementing that into the
neighborhood, sooner rather than
later makes the recruiting even easier. And I think it's
important that people who live in the community serve the
community as sheriffs. Not to say anybody who lives outside of san francisco ain't all that great, but we would love to have people who live in the neighborhood, who knows the
neighborhood, serve the neighborhood. So what do you
think about, you know, and I can help you with that if, you know, let's let's let's let's do it. Let's do it, I mean, the angle that we have been taking recently is the sports camps that we have given. We gave a free camp, last year, year
before at, at si, it was a free
camp for youth. We had a bunch of people, young men from, from
peace parks, from the patrol hill rec center come out to that
camp and take advantage of that camp. It was free. I actually gave it. I am a basketball coach, so. And it was wonderful.
We do participate in, you know,
law enforcement night at the warriors where they do battle of
the badges. We do have some times we do play basketball in
the community, but yes, definitely 100. Let's let's do
it, we welcome that type of stuff because those ideas and those type of events, it is hard sometimes to connect with,
community leaders to arrange these types of things.
Unfortunately, my busy schedule, because I do know a lot of
people, doesn't doesn't allow me
time to go out and put those two
things together. For instance, ryan and ross is the PRESIDENT
Of the san francisco brown bombers. My son played there. I coached there, and, we were I do
frequently visit their practices and talk to people, I grew up in bayview-hunters point in potrero hill. So I do have those connections where I'm able to
talk to the community in those two, in that specific, those two specific neighborhoods. But I'm just one person, and we do have a lot of other people. But it's
timing to be able to get out there. I, I literally in the six and a half years I've been in this position have, only been out of my office for those important things that I have to go out and do, the flexibility
by having director wu in the
position he is, he has a little
more flexibility to be able to get out and make more of those connections. And that's just a recent position. But but absolutely. My father used to coach the san francisco centers. If anybody remembers who that
was, bill marquis. And that's the vision that we're having, is to be able to do somebody in that kind of position, to be able to do stuff like that and make those connections with the community, but yes, I'm gonna take you up on that. All right. That's good. I, I actually had one last question. I wanted to
congratulate city administrator carmen chu and DR. Director
carol eisen. How will the career center help or dovetail with
what you do? The new career center right here on the first floor of city hall. We will take full advantage of it. 100% diversity recruitment team with
portia bunton, and her crew. We man it. They are a blessing.
That's to our to our department to our recruitment efforts, because again learning right is that is what we needed. That's
their job is just to, to recruit the more knowledge we can get from people who do that specifically, the better. They
helped us out with presentations is how we should be able to reach out to people they've been reaching out to people for us. They've offered us when there's their day to be in the career center, to be down there with them. So yes, 100% taking advantage of it. And I just have to say, I really happy the poster is still there. I
frequent stonestown mall, and now right on the side entrance,
you'll see the big poster. And so that's deputy justin murray
there, but also it used to be in
the food court that it was just alameda county. And I would always call chief gee. I'm like, chief chiu, what is alameda county doing? Trying to rate our
people. And so I'm, I'm so glad to see our poster. And it's still there. Yeah. I don't know
if we want to post in alameda
county, but that is a goal. So really quick I just wanted to
say thank you, captain sanford, for all that you do and all that you've done in community. And mine's actually really specific.
So I actually serve on the board , with the director of DR. And a
couple of other directors here in the city and county of san
francisco just looking at workforce development. So it's very near and dear to me and just thinking about, okay, while we're getting folks into the academy, we had 14 and we had two sets of eight. I'm also thinking of the influx of individuals that are going to be retiring and probably have been
retiring at the rates that folks have, and just really my direct question, because, you know, I love the junior deputy program, is just what what's our relationship or what's the relationship with the department. And sfusd and what does that look like? Just because I know pd has sros, so they have people and access to the schools, I'm just thinking about when I was a young and many, many moons ago and law enforcement would come into the school and have conversations about being, you know, sheriff's deputies and being police officers, just thinking about
the basics while we're talking about marketing and dollars that
are needed for that. But I think , as member palmer pointed out,
being out in community and being able to talk to people who are here who are going to be here
and should be serving our city and county, I think is very low hanging fruit. So just I think directly what's kind of the
department's relationship, picking off, piggybacking off of some of the things that I've learned from officer johnson over at sfpd who runs operation
genesis in his in his spare time, is connecting with because
we are partners with him in the youth career academy where they
take high school kids and we do a summer program with them, piggybacking off of what he's done for the last couple of years, we have done the same thing. We've reached out to the school district and we've just
walked up, and I'm a big, stickler for not telling people what what we have is asking them what they want or what they need
first. So that way I can see how we can work together to accomplish that goal, school
safety is a big issue in san
francisco, as as I'm, as I'm out
there speaking to principals, and other administrative people
in the school district, so we're saying, hey, we, you know, just coming out talking and so forth. I particularly myself and some of our other community engagement, team members have
been to the, I forget. Oh, my
GOD, I'm MR. Ruiz, who runs the
summer criminal justice program
for the school district, we've done three presentations with
him. He just emailed me, and I
got to email him back, to do it
again, we also again, we host
the same three days we do for the youth career academy. We will host that for anyone. We've done it with leadership public schools in richmond because the person who runs that program
used to be a five keys, teacher.
So we will provide those 2 or 3
days of instruction that, that, PRESIDENT Sue also went through,
for any anybody we've done,
obstacle courses for elementary school kids over at the lower school and over at lorton. We do
that anywhere also, and at saint john school, we'll do it at wherever. So we are getting out there, the limited amount of
spaces that we have been, oh, stop the bleed. Also that we've done with dfe, but the limited amount of time we have out there
again is due to time timing to
get people out there and staffing what we're trying to do for our deputy sheriffs who are working those 16 hour shifts to give them a change of scenery, a change of scenery. So we offer that as a detailed time for them to be out in the community. So
that way they can get a breath of fresh air, one and two. So that way they're not doing the same thing every day. But we do have currently a community engagement team that has approximately six members in it, that are the main people that are. Tomorrow we will be at visit valley outdoors over at hertz playground, I will be on
the grill. So you, if anybody wants stop by, it'll be between 10 and 2, and we're going to have a good time. Yeah, and you
do a mean barbecue. Thank you
very much. Thanks thank you. Any
any other questions, we'll open
up to public comments. I believe . Oh. Presentation. Okay. Oh. So, chief or chief for mayor.
Sorry good to see you, that's a
hard one. He's barbecuing. That's a hard one to follow. Right. What am I going to do? Right. Inspector general,
members of, dpa. Good afternoon, madam PRESIDENT, the board. Good
afternoon. Good to see everyone again. I think last time I saw you, we did some training over
at one 2014 street, it was great . I really enjoyed that session and found out why we no longer
have homestead ravioli, so
following up with some of the things that captain sanford was
talking about, do you mind if I
try? Can you hear me? Is that or
do I have to use it? I have to,
all right. Yes, we'll try it. So we wanted to talk a little bit about, staff safety and wellness, and what I wanted to start with was a personal,
story. When I started the department about 27 years ago, on my first day, I had just finished core a couple of weeks,
started in jail, I was assigned to the swing watch that night at
about, it's about 8:00. I got a call from a supervisor saying. Ramirez, you're staying over, 16
hour shift, first day. And usually what we do is we do what's called count, go around, start counting, everyone, make sure everybody's accounted for, and they're where they belong. Well, unfortunately, that night,
I was in what we call c pod
medical facility right over at 45 seventh street. And, my count
didn't clear everybody that I
had to account for wasn't there. So we looked a little further. And what it was, was somebody
was committing, trying to commit suicide. So my partner that night and I, worked together to,
keep that person safe after that
shift, I went home. It was about 2:00 in the morning after writing reports, a bunch of other things, tried to go to sleep. After rolling over a
couple of times, stared at the
ceiling for 4 or 5 hours and said, let me get myself into. First night on job. All right.
After a couple of weeks. So since then, what the department has done is really look at this issue of officer safety and
wellness and what the rigors of the job, what that does to officers, deputies, both male and female, all age groups.
Right. And what we've done over
the years have developed a couple of different things. One,
everything that the department does that's mandated, that's
required for safety issues when it comes to training equipment,
the facilities themselves, and then what the department, what staff do for themselves. So we have a very robust, very,
healthy peer support group. And
alongside the peer support
group, members of the unions have also engaged the department
in discussions about how we can make wellness better for the department, how we can work together between the labor
groups and the department to create better working conditions
for staff, and in my presentation, I'm going to talk to you about a couple of things. But what I'd like to show you,
really, just to start off, is our peer support group on day
one on the job. And this is something that I didn't have in
many others. Didn't on day one, peer support. Right. The department makes sure that peer
support gets out to new recruits
and does this presentation andmake sure that they know that these resources are available to
them, so that on the first night on the job, if they have a traumatic event or a situation where they have questions about what happened or how they're feeling, they have somebody
available to talk to other than a supervisor or somebody that
they MAY not want to share with, and that you have members of the department that are looking out for you and providing resources.
So I'm going to share with you a little bit of the presentation that they do for our staff, while they're onboarding into the department. Next slide
please. And a lot of it is they
want to know who the peer. They want to make it crystal clear about who the peer support group is, how to get in touch with them. If you need some help, if you need assistance, what the
availability is. And these folks
are supervisors, deputies that
use their own time to really help each other in times of
need. So they really make it available to let folks know who
they are, where they are, how they're accessible. Next slide
please. And they really go and
talk about what stress, what kind of, stressful factors
you're going to start encountering on the job and maybe not right away. Some folks after the academy do great. And then a traumatic experience happens along the road. And if
you have no one to talk to, they talk about all the different stress involved. And instead of taking time off or doing
something that might be reckless, they have somebody available, a peer that they can
talk to. Next slide please. Talking about stress right I
know stress. It's kind of funny.
Next and one of the things to
help folks stress in the academy. They talk about what to
expect while they're going through the academy. For some folks it MAY be a long time before they've had to go to a school environment with all the
rigors of, going to school. The
athletics, involved shooting. If
you've never shot a firearm before. So they try to prepare
you for the for the academy and what it's like meeting new people. If you're unfamiliar with the program, if you're
afraid of getting hurt, losing your job, being away from home for a lot of folks is the first time they've been away from home
for a long period of time. And for some folks that have heavy responsibilities at home to be away for six months dealing with an academy, it's traumatic.
Stressful. Next slide please.
And we talk about how you handle stress. And we really talk to deputies about what are there alternatives out there. What's what are the options out there. Next slide please. And we'll go through these quickly. We talk about you know the stress with family exercise going talking to friends making sure you're
recreating in between. Next slide please. So these are all
the things we talk to the deputies about. How do you handle your stress. You know. And we caution them about some
of the unhealthy ways especially during the academy turning to alcohol, drinking, going out,
partying on. You. Got through the week. Great. You're still with us. Let's go party this weekend. And we tell them be careful with that. Right? There's cautionary tales there.
A lot of things could go wrong. and we talked to them about healthy alternatives to deal with that stress during the academy. Next slide please. Right. And for the folks that
say, well I don't do anything, I do nothing. Well, we encourage them to say, hey, let's get together and let's go play a
little softball or let's go do a sporting event, or let's get together and get to know each other. Maybe we need to study
for a test coming up. Right. But sometimes we don't want you to take on all those stress, all that stress on yourself. Right because after a while it builds up. Okay next. And then after
the academy. Right. We talk about things going through the jail training program, going through rafto. Congratulations deputy win. Good job. Thank you.
Chief all right, that's a whole
different type of stress, right? As I go along in my career, how
are people going to look at me if I fail this part of the
program? Right. If I'm not able to accomplish that? So we talk about involuntary overtime and all the extra time that you're going to be at work bouncing
around from different shifts. If you've never worked a midnight shift, the impact that has on your life. Right, and that it
MAY not be forever, you MAY do that for a year, and then you MAY move on to another assignment. So always what's down the road next, please? Talk
about shift work and overtime. Right. We find that research
shows that shift work can be hazardous to your health. Right?
Day in and day out. 16 hours, three times a week. That's
difficult. Right one of the things that we've done our down rooms, we've talked about that that was one of the things that the union brought to our attention, folks live in sacramento and they're commuting after a 16 hour. It's ridiculous. Right. So at county jail one and at county jail three at both campus, there's down rooms where deputies can
stay there and sleep and get at least two extra hours of sleep a night when they've been held over for 16 hours, instead of trying to fight traffic for 2 or
3 hours, that 2 or 3 extra hours
of sleep on campus seriously makes a huge difference. Okay,
next slide. All right. These are
all the things that we tell the deputies as they're coming in. And we've done this presentations to different groups. We talk about fatigue
next. Weight gain and diabetes.
The impacts that gaining weight
can have on your health. Next and a heart attack. Right,
cardiac conditions next. And we tell the story. We talked to them about your backpack. Right the load you're carrying and how
at first, when you start in your career, that load MAY that be too big. But after, a few years in the department and, families
of kids, children and other responsibilities, well, that backpack soon looks like this.
Next slide. Right. And you're carrying the weight on your shoulders. And then, GOD forbid, you promote. Right. And then
that backpack gets twice as big. And now you're dealing with evaluations and day to day decisions. Right decisions that has impacts on your staff and their health and their safety.
next slide please. Right. We talk about staying connected,
spiritually with your community, with yourself, family and friends. And we want people to just be well-rounded and not just about the job. Right.
That's why community engagement for us is another way that we're helping, staff deal with wellness. Get out into the
community, talk to folks. Some folks love to work in the jails, and they just want to stay
there. And they get very, they get somewhat tunnel vision,
right? They get very comfortable sometimes working in the facilities and they forget, you know, the customer service aspect of it. And the greater the greater picture, right, of what the sheriff's office is.
Next slide. One more please, we
keep going. Okay. And really it
is what's peer support. And I
want to leave you with a process where person discusses personal issues with someone that is trained in peer support. And
it's that training that I really think sets our peer support,
apart from others. It's not just a group of folks that have. I've been through it all. I've seen it all. Kid. Come here. Let me tell you a story. But the folks
that lead this group do a lot to go to training. They do a lot of, peer support training. So they do have a post training
under their belt, they work a
lot with, eap, so the eap, the,
what's it called? Employee assistance program. Thank you so
much. So they work with the employee assistance program often and make sure to make referrals and encourage people
to use the eap. In their medical benefits. There's a lot of other, there's all kinds of benefits there that people should take advantage of. So the peer support groups always looking at wellness options to provide for our staff. Next
slide, a lot of the things that
we talk to them about, peer support especially, is that it's rank free, that nobody's going to look at you any different for going for peer support as a
matter of fact, as a supervisor, one of the first things that I do when I know deputies been involved in a situation is let
me get peer support for you. Let's have somebody talk to you
about situation, when we have deaths in the department, people that have retired and we haven't
seen them in a couple of way, we remember that a few years ago.
There are best friend on the tear, right. That has an impact.
So we make sure to get peer support involved and talk to folks when they're going through that situation. Loss of a of a former member or a current
member, even. Next slide please.
Yep, peer support is super diverse, right? We have a little bit of everything, sometimes I've even gotten a call from peer support and saying, I know you're not peer support, but can you come talk to us? Come. Come with us to talk to somebody? Absolutely not a problem. Right,
we know you have a very good relationship with so and so would you mind coming with us and you'll see that most supervisors are are quick to say
yes. Next slide, it's also
required under the government code. Right. And I think sometimes what happens is you
get a very watered down version of what a peer support just because it's a mandate or it's required. And that departments don't pay enough attention to
their peer supports. We're lucky here. I know the police department has a very robust
peer support group, as do we, I think even if it wasn't required, the department would
be there, supporting our peer
support group. Next slide please
, we use an app on our phones. So all the phones that we issue, our department staff have an application that has a wellness
component in it, and you go through there and there's all kinds of different little exercises and little tips, about
wellness and what's to be healthy, right, both physically
and mentally. So next slide. There it is. There's the
employee assistance program. We talk about eap early with staff I didn't know we had eap until I was a lieutenant. Right. Years
and years later after being on night shifts and stuff like that, really there's benefits. I didn't know that. So we want our
folks to know right away the minute they're in the department, there are benefits available to you. There's folks that you outside of the department, if you don't want to
talk to somebody here, find you somebody outside of the department that you can go, contact information is there available. It's voluntary, it's confidential. And there used to
be this big stigma. Well if I call the employee assistance
line, are they going to report back to the department? And we make it crystal clear that that's not going to come unless it's a mandate report situation. Right a very specific where somebody is going to cause harm to themselves or others. Right but regularly we make the
referral folks do take advantage of it, along with some of the
other benefits, from your health
programs, next slide. So it's
free next. You go through these fairly quickly. There you go.
It's confidential. It's 24 seven
365. It's always available to you. It's culturally competent.
It's, folks that have experience dealing with law enforcement
officers, so they know the language. They know what we're
up against, and it's. That's it.
Next slide. The other thing is that it's for everybody. It's for not just for sworn staff, but it's also included for our cadets, our non non-sworn staff also that are going through
things, and we make sure that they're available. The other thing that our peer support group does really well is that they provide a cert team, a critical incident response team. If there's been a death in custody, if somebody's been hurt
really bad, we have a group that comes out and they help start
talking to folks and see how they're feeling and see where their mind's at, they come out to shootings when a deputy severely injured when gunner taken away, child deaths,
attacks on staff or unfortunately, when there's a
suicide by either a member or
family member. Next slide. We
also have and this has become a little bit bigger. We've always had a chaplaincy program, but it's expanded a little bit. And assistant sheriff carter has actually been very instrumental
in having more chaplains join in the department, it's been good
to see them out with us a little bit more. And we've been talking about different programing that we can have with our chaplains and really take advantage of
that resource. Next we do. They
put on things like the family
academy and next slide, family academy is great. It's one of the ways that we can invite our
family members to come and see
what we deal with on a day in and day out, we have a session coming up later on this month. I would invite all of you to come
and attend, and go through the family academy so you could see a bunch of the different demonstrations, the walk environments, and what it is that we do, it's kind of a different perspective when peer support puts something on like this. So I hope I hope you all
could make it. Next slide. Right. Peer support goes around
giving around free books. Right. They love to give resource
material. I love a cop. It's a very important book for anyone involved in any way with a cop. I'll definitely keep this book on my bookshelf forever. So they're out there giving you resource material that's available not just for you, for you, but for family members also. Next slide please. A couple other books, the
emotional survival for law enforcement, I think I think we all have a copy of this on the shelf somewhere. Right, it's a quick read. It's very
interesting, next. So the other
thing is I and the reason why i
took so much time with the peer support is just because, we've come such a long way from.
Here's your keys. You start work. That's who you answer to. Good luck on the job. Right? To
having, good training. Like direct supervision. Training that that I put you through when we did that previous training,
to peer support training. Where people know, what the job is
going to do to you, going into it. So you're well informed and
what you can do about it. And what the resources are available to you. The other thing is the department has a safety analyst.
We have a safety officer, when I was at the projects and planning
division, the safety officer was under my chain of command. And
one of the things that we did was develop this department's injury and illness prevention
program, next slide, please. So the safety analyst officer
really looks at conditions in the jail environment, looks at
hazards, anything that MAY be a cal osha violation, that type of
thing. And really. Provide a
recommendations on how to mitigate some of those factors. For example, on the old seventh floor, we used to have an issue with flooding. Flooding was something that happened all the time. So what did we do? We went
out and we bought a bunch of,
of, spill kits and basically what it is, it's a bucket that has a bunch of blankets that super absorb liquids. So if
deputies were responding to a to
a situation, one of the first things we would do is grab one of those buckets and start throwing blankets on the floor to soak up the excess water, we have those at all the facilities now, and that came about from a
couple of incidents that we had that involved, flooding on the tears. Right? Flooding in different situations. I actually cringed when you mentioned that because I remember being a
prosecutor at, the hall of justice when the flooding happened. And there was human waste. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That came down and fell all over us. Right. So it's not just water you're dealing, right. It's the hazardous material involved.
It's right. Yeah. It wasn't just
a one time deal. No, no, that's, you know, having to destroy
uniforms and all this stuff and, you know, it's traumatic, right? Yeah. Some of that stuff. Yeah. And your cases don't stop. So,
so that's what the safety analyst officer does. I have, I brought with me just because I wanted to share a couple of
items from that. I don't know if
I can. Is it okay to hand you
some material. Could you please. Here. Now, this material will be
posted on the website. It is. So what I'm showing you actually is a, one of our policies. It's our injury and illness prevention program. It used to be a standalone program. So, as you know, standalone programs, what happens to them? They get forgotten, they get overlooked. So instead, what we did with the
new lexipol policy platform, what we did was we took it and we created a policy in lexipol. So now it's readily available.
It's there all the time. It's very easy to find. And for those required mandated reporting, cal
osha incident notes or any other
incident, that requires, by law, some type of action, you can
easily refer to the 1031 injury
and illness prevention program. A couple of things that I wanted to, point out. So under really
the purpose of this policy is to
establish an ongoing, effective plan to reduce the incidence of injury and illness for members for the san francisco sheriff's office, injury and illness that results in lost time. That requires medical treatment and beyond first aid, right? So day
to day, we have a lot of
injuries that don't require you to stay in the hospital, be admitted, that type of thing. But in the event that you are admitted or there's significant
injury, we go to the injury and illness prevention program and
see what happened. What's going on there, and how do we keep this from happening again. And there are certain things that are required, for example, if
you look under 1031 three, you see that we have to post or distribute safety information and just one of the other
programs that we have that the sheriff has created is what we call a sync. It's the sheriff's,
information network center. And basically what we do from admin
is we send out safety bulletins about everything and anything.
Would you mind? Let me get up and move. So if there's anything that we see that's going to be
critical or MAY cause injury or something, that is an officer safety bulletin for a safety
issue, we send these out from
admin every day that are reviewed during muster, during
what we call briefings, during assemblies, so that people are
aware of potential hazards that
are out there, we also have what we have, safety and health committee. Captain kbb now is
the new, chairperson of that committee. And they go through
and look at injuries and, and illness, issues that can be
avoided. And and provide recommendations on how those
items can be improved. And so
this policy, which lives in our department lexipol and I believe you guys have access, I think if you don't let me know and we'll make sure that you have any policies that you need. It also
talks about inspections. One of the things that we do in the jail every week are weekly inspections. During that time, we go around, if we see if there's anything that's hazardous, members of our engineering department are
available to address those issues right there in that. So
we're constantly going through our facilities and making sure that we're addressing anything
that is going to cause harm. And
let's see next slide please. And
what you're looking at here is, one of the gyms that we're building over at four, two, five seventh street for staff as part
of our wellness program, working with the unions, they've made
some recommendations of what they'd like to see at one of the gyms. County jail two doesn't have a gym right now. They will in a few months, so we're ordering equipment, same
equipment that we're ordering, to update the equipment out at san bruno. So they'll have some new spaces that are identified
specifically for, staff downtime and so that they can get some exercise while on duty 16 hours a day. No exercise. Well, here's an opportunity for them to, you know, take the duty gear off in a safe environment, get a little
exercise in before they go back.
Okay. Next slide. And then I
just wanted to share with you the other thing, that was asked
was about assaults on staff, the sheriff's criminal
investigations unit currently
falls under my command, and we have a core group of investigators that deal with all our criminal investigations,
anything that the fod guys would bring to our attention or anything that happens in the
jails and. We take any assault
on a staff as a crime that would happen either in custody or
anywhere else. A crime is a crime is a crime. And we assign these cases to our investigator
to, file prosecutions and follows prosecutions as far as
they can, last year, fiscal year
2223, we had 73 incidents of,
assaults on staff. 44 of those
cases were referred over to the
siu team. There was eight assaults from our field operations division. This was something that happened out in the street somewhere. 36 assaults occurred in the custody
division. Of those cases, 39
were booked, for our prosecution
by ciu and of those 39, 27 were
filed by the da's office. So far
this year, we've had, 50, 55
assaults on staff, 49, which have been referred over to the criminal investigations unit 15
assaults from fod, 34 from the
custody division. Of those, 37
were booked and 28 have been filed by the da's office. And it's standard booking, standard rebooking process. As any other
case. Okay. Any questions, I
just wanted to raise something. You know, we were talking about communications in the jail, so
giving those incarcerated, tablets and that sort. But that
also can become a weapon, knowing that all of our devices
have glass and metal. So I think
I wanted people just to be a little bit more aware that
anything can be turned into a
weapon. Absolutely, absolutely, and then one other question
about the family support. I think it's so important that you are actually mentioning the families because it is a sacrifice for families of our
sworn officers, the late hours, but also just the time to decompress and everything else.
So do the families regularly get together or do they have a
similar thing like eap that they
can call so family members can call eap? They absolutely can. That's why we also invite families to our family academy,
and we design that family academy specific for families to
come in and experience what their loved one is experiencing.
And the other thing is, any time we have a promotional ceremony
of any type, the first thing we do is make sure that family is invited right? It's not just for the officer, it's also for the families and the sheriff makes
it a point to always thank the families first, right? Because it's with their support that
we're able to have deputies go
away for six months, study, concentrate, make it through the academy and come back and do the job right. And I think what's alarming, too, is statistics around the country. Now that
there are retirement suicides are on the rise. And I think,
it's hard for someone to know unless someone's been in your
shoes. So I think in retirement,
the possible isolation or the lack of camaraderie and also
that people don't necessarily live in the communities that they serve. They live far away. So there's like further
isolation. Correct. And studies have shown that children of law
enforcement officers highest dropout rates, highest substance
abuse rates, it's just a fact, right? We do have studies that
show that. So I think the more you bring families in, it helps bring those numbers down. Right? It used to be, anecdotal. Right.
The old, line was that cops live
five years after they serve, after they retire. Right. It used to be something that people used to say. They have a five year lifespan. I think with a lot of wellness programs, that's changed. Right. And now and that was looking primarily at law enforcement patrol officers.
Right. And now because of the umbrella of law enforcement
being so wide, those stats have changed a little bit too, right? When you include corrections and other type of law enforcement. So we want, you know, much longer lifespans after retirement. And some are coming back under sort of the ambassador programs too, right. The ambassador program, we also have a lot of folks in our department that are coming back. Prop f has a lot of, support
staff. So yeah, just again, staffing budgets, right, being what they are. So it's funny for
us, when we see those folks retire, it's difficult because all that institutional knowledge that leaves. Right. And it
creates such a vacuum for us, but as the prop f's come back,
we have those folks that can take the younger guys and gals and tell them, hey, when I was here, we used to do things this way. Luckily for us, some of that new technology coming out, helps some of the redundancy. We
do a lot of things that are, you
know, data, data input. Right. And we use these systems that are so antiquated. But as we see new technologies coming out, it really helps the minimize the redundancy and put officers in
areas where they're better needed. You know, instead of doing admin work, technology is sort of a two edged sword, because I think there used to be
a lot more human interaction. So that's sort of a means of support and joy for people that they don't necessarily do anymore. Yeah yeah, absolutely.
So any questions comments for chief ramirez. Yeah, I have a
question, I have a comment, I noticed from the first time I
was I visited the jail and the
last time that there is a
better, spirit in the jail with
the deputies and those who are residents. I know there are
certain populations where I saw
them communicate and de-escalation and very
respectful talk where before it was, this is my house, and you're going to do what I say.
And if you don't, then you know, I'm going to force it. Situation where at this time and in the
jails, there's more relaxation.
And I see that, the younger ones are maybe not even necessarily the younger ones, but a certain group are even more engaged
with, respectful conversations
and humanizing language. So they're not is only safer for
the deputies because now they're not creating a conflict
situation or, or someone you never know what their mental
health issue is. Then they might want to be revengeful. So it's
safety not only physically, but it's emotional safety for
everybody involved. And so I
just wanted to point that out. I contribute that to when you talk
about new technology, it's not just devices, but it's also,
mental technology, skill sets that are being applied as well. That's great. No, I appreciate you saying that. Thank you.
Yeah. So appreciate you saying that. And what I wanted to add
to that was, there is, you know,
for the group of people who've always been in our department
who've always had that, that,
that mentality, that's why that's, you know, changed because changing of the guard and it can't I can't even say it's generation because people older are still doing that thing. They've always been there
is now they're more present. We
recently did, a training for those people who, MAY or MAY not
have that same mentality was, we was put on by the group called
why you why'd you stop me, and it is a very, very really robust
program that they do where they dig deep into beliefs and, and
things like that. And it gives both sides of perspective, like,
hey, this is this is my perspective from you talking to me. And when you stop me. And what is your perspective when you are stopping me? So that way
we can meet in the middle. It's like when I'm pulling somebody
over on a felony. Stop what my mentality is, what my fears are and my all these different things of like, hey, all of the
things that could go wrong because that's how we're trained and that's why we thought, is that okay? I have to anticipate that if I pulled this person over for whatever I'm pulling
them over for, that they MAY harm me, and how do I mitigate
that? And how do I talk to that person? And when I get there, I have to. My conversation has to be from the lowest. Even though my anxiety is at the highest,
and then, you know, and then the person on the other end MAY be feeling the same way. And I don't know it. I just know I'm just doing my job. So that's a open conversation about that type of stuff. So I just I'm
just a really good program that we recently did. We're hoping
that we can implement it more as an ongoing training for our staff. So that way, again, those people who do not have that mentality of, hey, conversation and just every day, being the best human being you are and treating people like, like human beings, that will also mitigate the conflict. And we're hoping that we can get people who don't have the mentality, to have that mentality. Yeah. You know, I was going to say, you know, my conversations with jeff adachi
was is to do psa at traffic stops because traffic stops, domestic violence calls are some
of the most dangerous, for law enforcement. So I wanted things
that were in language what to do
if you're stopped by a police officer? Keep your hands
visible. Stay calm. Don't you know some people are really enthusiastic about reaching for id or registration? But that's scary because, you know, the
officer doesn't know if you're reaching for a gun or a weapon. So I'm hoping that down the line
we can do in language psa's. The other thing that we find is,
believe it or not, body worn cameras, more of our officers
have body worn cameras, and they've just learned now that, hey, I'm on camera all the time. Everybody's watching what I'm doing. So, you know, I don't I don't have to put on this front of. I'm the tough guy all the
time or tough guy or whatever it MAY be. I just am, you know, and
you're going to capture me on camera and you're going to hear what I said, right? So I don't have to, you know, make up a story or it is what it is. Right? And it's all there. So I think that's really had a big impact, too, on how people react to each other and respond to each other, so I'm sorry, vice PRESIDENT. Karen, you had something to say? I just had a comment. Thank you so much
again. It's great to know that you're really addressing secondary trauma and just the reality of it, that things as well as family members are surviving. I did want to make the comment that I would like you to change the nature of anxiety and distress in your report. I think it's problematic, and I'm happy to
talk about that, at a different point, but I think it's
important to publicly say that
because, you know, I think women's bodies and, and, women's
bodies and shaming women's
bodies happens so often, that I think that if we're doing this as a presentation, then we
should be aware of that. So we'll change it. All right. Absolutely. No problem. Thank
you. Birx. Yeah. And. Maybe the color as well too. That was a little difficult to read. The black on green as well. So thank you for that though. Member.
Carry on. I just had one question, chief, because you kind of brought it up and alluded to it is just can you kind of talk about the monitoring of hours for deputies because, you know, one of the things that you did share was, you know, when deputies have to
do a 16 hour shift, can you just share with the public, you know, after they do 16, is it mandatory? Eight off? How many can you do in a row? Right. Because as we're thinking about again, as member palmer shared,
as you mentioned, the customer service, like, how do we make sure that we're looking at the hours, making sure that folks aren't zeroing in to be like,
hey, nobody wants to work in the jail, so I'm going to work in the jail for 56 hours straight, just what does that look like within within the department.
So, a deputy can work 16 hours a
day, so no more, right? At 16
hour, we have to cut them loose. No. Regardless of if they're involved in an incident where they have to write a report or something like that. When you hit the 16 hour mark, you're
going home. That's it. Or you're going to stay in one of the down rooms or something like that.
Right? But you're off duty after
16. And it used to be that you could be what we call drafted
every day of the week, when I first started the job and we were having staff shortages, I remember being drafted four out of five days every week, right?
And that went on for 2 or 3 months, now we've made, through some agreement with the unions where you can no longer be drafted. And let me correct. Let me check, what are we doing? Twice a paper, currently. Right now, we made an adjustment to
twice, pay period, a pay period
or a week. I think it's a week. It's a week, a week. So now you mandatory overtime will be twice a week. So you're you could be
compelled to work two 16 hour shifts in one week or four in a
pay period. Two weeks. Now, that
doesn't keep staff from working voluntary overtime. So some
staff will work double shifts
every day of the week. And twice on their days off. We have seen that that's an extreme case, but
we don't cap voluntary overtime unless we see that there is an
issue, right. Behavior or something going on. And then
after discussing with that person and see what's going on or coming to some agreement, we
MAY cap, overtime, but mandatory compelled overtime. It's two
shifts a week, total 16 hours
per day, or for in a pay period.
And the reason why that you have
to do the math. And it gets kind
of weird because we have so many different tours of duty. We have eight hour shifts, ten hour shifts, 12 hour shifts. So we're constantly looking at how many hours did you work the folks that work 12 hour shifts. We could only compel them to work an additional four right? For a 16. So sometimes when you do that, it's hard to make up the remainder of the shifts with
other folks. So but on the flip side, is there a required number
of hours of downtime, even if
it's voluntary, there's not a or a downtime requirement. But usually we say there has to be an eight hour break in between duty. That doesn't always
happen. Right? But the person
MAY be released after 16 hours, but they might decide, hey, I'm going to stay at the facility
for an hour or so, go work out or go do something else, and then I'm going to go home right while they're at the facility.
Does that count? There's always been certain gray areas, right, but usually right now that's our understanding, our agreement with the labor groups, no more
than twice. It was three at one
point, went down to just two.
That was a good question. Yeah I mean, I mean, that's sort of data that we would be looking at in the future. How many hours worked and possible discipline
of deputies behavior, interactions. So that's why we
ask about it. So yeah, I actually believe that that's part of the case manager data that, there's now data points
for that. And if, if I MAY,
speaking from experience, first
I'll say this a lot of overtime
is financially fiscally I would
say irresponsible. Just on the taxpayer because overtime costs
more than regular time. So if a
person is working overtime every
day of the week and on his days off, I understand he's trying to
get his bread. But what does that do for the taxpayer that has to fit the bill? Second is
I've seen where our officers,
who are not quite as liked, are working overtime in somebody else's part and they'd be like, oh, now the whole the whole culture and the shift of the
mood changes. And so looking at, you know, 602, which is like a
write up on the officer and being able to use that data to
say, well, maybe you do need some time off, or maybe you need some extra training because this the people in this pod right here really don't like when you when you come on shift and you disrupt the culture of that,
that pod, so, you know, to her point, to the PRESIDENT's point,
you know, maybe there should be
some, required downtime just for you can get your mental health
together and relax a little bit and then and come back with a
better mindset. I have two questions. Does the sheriff's
department have an early intervention or early warning
system? We well, so I know some
departments will use like ia pro and they have a whole early intervention program software
that tracks that. We don't have a formal tracking system that
has an early intervention. But what I would say is that every
supervisor on the line, having
been there myself, I understand, we're always keeping tabs on our staff. What's going on with them? What's their situation,
why somebody has selig on certain days, every every week,
so I think really what happens is those, you know, those front
line supervisors become our, our
early intervention group, and they make referrals to eap or
send it up to admin and talk to
the personnel unit about issues that people are having, and a
lot of that is just mentoring,
right, supervisors that mentor the younger ones and say, hey, what's going on with you? Or what's happening? Or I've noticed this or your uniform,
you look like a soup sandwich. What's going on with you? Right, and sometimes it's those very simple conversations that we use
, to get people, to walk straight again. Right. It's
something as simple as that. But formally, is there software that
tracks that? And no, we don't,
there MAY be, what we call a counseling sometimes if somebody
did something that needs a corrective action, that
counseling process MAY be used to document some behavior or
something out of policy that can
be corrected without discipline. Has there been any discussion
about instituting an early warning or early intervention
system? Oh, yeah. I've been part of those conversations right in
planning, but they cost money, and they're usually the first thing that doesn't get funded.
Right. What is the cost for that ? The chief is correct right
now. It is a human thing where supervisors are trained to monitor that type of stuff, we
are currently we currently do have a contract for a software
that would do that because we're trying to move from a manual, handwritten performance appraisal, to an automated
software that we currently have
a contract with. It is $56,000, we would like to support, to continue that funding. So that way we can actually get it implemented in that particular software does have an early
warning intervention. Component
of it. It also does also have a program that watches out for supervisors when they evaluate people, what, you know, when there's a huge gap between one supervisor evaluating a person
versus another so that way we also can keep track that the mentoring is on point. So yes we
do. We have one and we're trying
to implement it is has come to a couple of hurdles. It took very long time and very hard work to actually get the money to get
the software, we would like to continue that. Okay. Well, I hope you're able to do that,
second question is, given the stress that the mandatory
overtime. Two, 16 hour shifts a week seems like a tremendous amount and incredibly stressful to me. What effect is the assignment of deputies to patrol duties which deputy nguyen described, what effect does that
having on the ability to fill
the shifts and perhaps avoid the mandatory 16 hour shifts at the
jails. So a lot of that it's
happening everywhere. It's not just happening in the jails.
It's in our field operations. It's throughout the departments, in our administration. It's everywhere, because we work,
business hours monday through friday, right, with weekends off, we're not getting drafted,
as much as others. There was a time, especially during covid, where we were doing some compel drafting across the board. Everybody was doing mandatory overtime. But right now, now, we certain places have staffing
minimums that have a requirement to be filled. And obviously those are going to get, compelled overtime first. Right?
Then other units that don't have mandatory minimums, if they can
go without, they will. But the patrol duties that deputy nguyen
described, I think are comparatively new, aren't they?
Not necessarily. We've been patrolling at the hospital for
decades now, so, on the swing watch, if you need a deputy. The day watch deputy is staying behind. I'm referring more to the patrols in downtown and the tenderloin south of market. Some
of those operations have been staffed, they have a different
staffing model than our traditional staffing model. It's a little bit different. So usually right now, if we don't
have sufficient staff for a swing shift on that patrol unit,
we'd probably go without or we'd make an adjustment in other
patrol areas to cover those those areas. So not very
different than what the police department does, right? If they have a task force or something assigned to an area and they can't cover it, well, district picks it up, right. They do a very similar thing. Thank you. Can I one last question, chief. And you might not know this information, but it's just got my mind. My mind is like now scrambling, especially as I start thinking about overtime.
And we talk about the lack of funding. But given the amount of jails in the population that we have in san francisco, what is kind of what is adequate staff
of a sheriff's department, like
how many deputies are we short in terms of, you know, city, our size, the amount of jails that we have, folks that are housed there like, you know, how the police department says we're supposed to have x amount of police officers because of the amount of people we have in san
francisco. And I don't know if you know that off the top of your head, but I'm just well, we have for specifically for the jails. We have what's called our minimum jail, staffing. We have a matrix of what we recommend is the proper amount. We can
provide that to you. We can get you a copy of that. Okay. But even then. Right. That's a minimum, of course. Right. Yeah. That's a threshold that means on duty training isn't being done
right. That means that when an incident report has to be done,
somebody's going to stay over, not necessarily 16 hours, but at least 3 or 4 hours to complete an incident report. Right. Where if you had additional staff beyond the minimum, you can do
some training on, on on watch.
You can get reports done and send people home on time. Right, if we have to send somebody to the hospital, that means that you've now fallen below minimum because somebody at the hospital. Right. We're usually
if you had an additional staffing, you know, an optimal staffing level, then you could still be, at minimum, send
someone to the hospital. Well, I was just saying we had past reporting from chief jue, and so we don't want to compromise any kind of safety, so if you want to keep it quarterly and average, that's fine with us.
And you can send the data to dan. Yeah, or through chief jue.
Either way, it'll get to dan.
All right. For alpha mango, do you have any comments or questions? All right, to say
thank you. Thank you. All right. You know, you almost have enough
for a softball team. I know, but we'll take that challenge, and it should stop raining, so I'm ready to get out there. We're having training camp pretty
soon. Yeah. Thank you. So do we have. Oh, chief jude, do you
have. Oh no. You're good. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for
organizing time zone right here. I know, I know, I've looked at
the time, but I'm like, okay, thank you so much for organizing such a comprehensive presentation, so now we're going
to take any public comment. Board members, the public would like to make public comment on line item three san francisco sheriff's presentation. Please approach the podium when it is
free. Thank you guys for that
presentation. I'll be very brief. I think we also want to keep in mind to, you know, the culture of the sheriff's department and all policing is
just as important as everything else that we're talking about, right. In order to implement these things that we're coming out with, whether it be on the
cell phone or, yeah, I heard all the wellness initiatives taking
place. So I think that's really,
really crucial, across. Yeah, all departments. So thank you guys. Thank you. Okay. Next item
on the agenda dan calling line
item for department of police
accountability dpa presentation. Marshal kane, chief attorney,
will present on the importance of separate criminal and administrative investigations
and the safeguards to ensure that one investigation does not
compromise the other. Thank you.
And I think this is important. So this is our ongoing education
without having to spend, budget
but appreciate, marshall kane for being here and giving us
some constitutional education.
Good afternoon. Board members. I seem to always find myself standing between you and the
weekend, welcome back to board
member palmer, congratulations. Board member win on the, field
training certification. Thank
you, PRESIDENT, sue, vice
PRESIDENT Karen, this presentation, to put it in
context, is responsive to the
recent news articles that that this board had identified,
relating to the terminations
that are reversed many years
later, that has justifiably and understandably caused a lot of
concerns with this board and with the public. While I can't
speak directly about the cases,
given all of the statutory
statutory protections of confidentiality under penal code
section 830 2.7, as well as the
operating agreement that we have with the sheriff in performing
this work, I can provide an
informational presentation about what are the common issues that
have arisen, that have created
tremendous, problem with both administrative and criminal
investigations and the success
of those types of prosecutions,
given all of the issues that often make it very difficult to perform these investigations, we certainly don't want procedural
defects to, to, cause these
investigations to run afoul of seeking the accountability, that these procedures are intended to
achieve, in this presentation,
I'm going to go over generally,
three areas with you, in terms of the legal framework between administrative investigations
and criminal investigations, kind of the minefield it presents for investigators and
prosecutors, so we'll cover how
indiscriminately commingling evidence between the two investigations can create some catastrophic problems in the
criminal investigation. Secondly how the overreliance on a
criminal outcome, can have on
the administrative adjudication. And that's often an imprudent
shortcut. And what measures that can be implemented to safeguard against these problems from reoccurring in the future. And
that's ultimately, I think, hopefully something that
addresses the concerns that I've heard from a number of the board
members. How do we prevent the
issues that have occurred in the past from reoccurring in the
future? So for foundation, let's
start off with, what is
generally well understood in the public, and that is criminal
investigations. What are criminal investigations? It's an
investigation to determine whether evidence about conduct
supports criminal charges. It's the uncovering of that evidence
develops of that evidence, and then putting it into the context
of a criminal prosecution. The
standard for that is the highest standard or the standard of proof for that, the highest standard in the legal system
beyond a reasonable doubt. Under
the us constitution, fifth amendment, no person shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
and in honor of MARCH women's
history month, I amended the constitution, added herself as
well. I don't think the drafters
were, as gender inclusive as
they should have been, that is the fifth amendment right
against self-incrimination, against self-incrimination. And
everybody knows what that right
is. And based on that right in the landmark case of miranda versus arizona in 1966, the
court created some judicially
prophylactic protections where individuals under certain
circumstances have to be advised of these rights before they're
interrogated. Namely, there are
two, two features that have to be present in order to trigger
miranda rights. And that is the person is in custody. And
secondly, the person must be subject to an interrogation, an interrogation, meaning that the
person is subject to, questions designed to elicit incriminating statements. Now most of these
features are not present in a criminal investigation and
administrative investigation of police officers for particular
events. And that is why the
california public safety officers procedural bill of
rights act, included the
admonition in the california statute government code, section
3303, subsection h, where where an officer is subject to potential criminal charges, they must also be advised of their constitutional rights. We commonly utilize the rights that
are prescribed in miranda to
satisfy that requirement. Lesson
less well understood is the world of administrative investigations and what our
administrative investigations is. It's to determine whether
evidence about conduct supports violations of policies,
procedures or rules and laws.
This type of investigation uncovers procedural violations
and policy violations that do
not rise to the level of criminal conduct, the standard
for proving this type of violation is a preponderance of the evidence commonly understood
in law as more likely than not, or a feather on the scales of
justice. Public employees are, subject to being compelled to
cooperate, in the case of lybarger versus the city of los angeles, public employees,
including all peace officers,
are required to participate in
an inquiry and are responsive bill for providing cooperative
responses to questioning by, the authority conducting the
investigation. So in essence,
what lybarger and government code section 3303, subsection e,
creates. Is no right to remain
silent for a public employee. So what this creates is two conflicting principles. When there's a criminal investigation , there is always going to be an
administrative investigation. If the officer is suspected of committing a crime, he most certainly would have committed
an administrative violation. The reverse doesn't necessarily stand true. Many administrative
investigations, occur without a criminal investigation because obviously you can violate a
procedure, policy or law without filing a criminal law that subjects you to, criminal
prosecution. Given the rarity of criminal prosecutions in the world of police accountability and the vastness of
administrative violations, it is certainly, administrative
violations that shape and define , the world of accountability and discipline. However, where there's the possibility of criminal prosecutions, that is the ultimate level of
accountability. Some additional
principles as it relates to compelling a public officer or a peace officer to provide a statement, under lybarger and
under 3303, subsection e, is
that, if the officer refuses to,
cooperate or provide a statement , that officer is subject to punitive action or discipline,
and that's admonition, and that has an intended admonition that the interview and whatever is
provided in the interview cannot be used against the officer in a criminal case under spielberger
versus santa clara, in 2009, the
court had found that by admonishing an officer, when
they're subjected to a compelled statement, that their statement
cannot be used against them in a
criminal case, in effect, that is providing the officer with use immunity. And by creating use immunity, meaning that
nothing that the officer says in the administrative investigation can be used in a criminal case,
that triggers, that triggers a
series of protections, under
garrity versus new jersey, where
this really creates a series of problems for the criminal
prosecution. Is that under,
under a use immunity, it extends
far beyond just the statements being used against the officer,
but also anything that is derived from that statement, any
information, any evidence that
is, even tangentially related to
that statement, becomes
inadmissible in a criminal case. And once that occurs, once the
administrative investigation, compels a statement, the officer
provides a statement, evidence
is developed, and, the officer is subject to a criminal
prosecution. They can claim, the
protections of use immunity, which shifts the burden to the
government, to the prosecution,
to prove that all of the
evidence that it proposes to use in the criminal case was derived from legitimately independent
sources, and that is, in essence, kind of the problems
that potentially taints, a criminal prosecution when there is a parallel administrative
investigation. So how do you harmonize these two rules for a successful both a criminal
prosecution and, and an administrative investigation
that leads to administrative, administrative discipline? Well,
the evidence needs to be
scrupulously maintained,
documented and quarantined from
the two parallel tracks, if that's not done, the prosecution in the criminal case ends up in what we call kastigar hearings,
and for those familiar with that process that is putting the prosecution behind the eight ball, it's almost like putting toothpaste back into the tube
afterwards. And while it's very
rare, it almost, is almost fatal
to most prosecutions, in the
high profile case of the killing
of freddie gray in baltimore in 2015, there were about a half a dozen police officers that were charged in that prosecution. And
because the prosecution in that case used some compelled
statements from one of the officers against the other
officers, when at last officer was subject to prosecution and all of that information had
already been publicly revealed, it becomes almost impossible to
separate out all of that evidence from the compelled
statement. And while it never got to a kastigar hearing that last officer, after a series of
unsuccessful prosecution on the other officers, that officer's
case's case was dismissed on the
day that they had scheduled to start and conduct the kastigar
hearing. So it is certainly it
is certainly an area that
prosecutors seek to protect
against and avoid. So how do we
ensure the, successful
prosecution, on the criminal side, as well as administrative
investigation and leading to, administrative sustained violation, if it's warranted by
the evidence? Here's a graphical
representation of how the two investigations should run
parallel and be structured, to provide the essential
information, but also safeguarding against some of the perils that I had previously described, you'll have an incident that leads to both
potential criminal charges and,
an administrative investigation.
Criminal investigation must be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt. The administrative, an administrative investigation by a preponderance of the evidence.
So lower standard of proof.
Information can flow. Freely from the criminal investigation to the administrative investigation. In fact, it's almost essential that the
administrative investigation has all of the evidence uncovered in a criminal investigation, because the criminal investigation is seeking to
prove the case by a higher level of standard. And if you have a criminal violation, you will have an administrative violation. However the information should not be
flowing both ways. There's a
very important firewall feature that is necessary to prevent the
information from the administrative investigation,
particularly after the compelled interview, from flowing into the
criminal investigation, because
just the very act of information getting commingled into the
criminal investigation following , a live argued statement or a
compelled statement, means that the entire pool is tainted from
there. It's almost creates the
presumption, shifting the burden to the prosecution to show then
how every piece of evidence has
a legitimate source. Also, as I
had mentioned, it is certainly
it is certainly commonly used where a criminal conviction is
almost, per se an administrative investigation, administrative,
violation, and will sustain a, administrative violation.
However, I would caution against complete reliance on that
criminal investigation or the criminal conviction for the
purposes of sustaining a
violation, because if there is some sort of defect with that criminal conviction that is discovered later on and that conviction is reversed on
appeal, then your entire basis for the administrative violation
falls away. So, let's go over some of the safeguards to
protect against. All of the
problems that I've described.
First, I would highly recommend starting the administrative
interviews after the criminal
investigation is completed, just so that there is no possibility
that that, that there is
potential allegations that there
is some evidence derived from that compelled administrative
investigation. Now that potentially is somewhat of a
controversial statement, because because it is not always prudent or practical to completely delay
those interviews us until the criminal investigation is
completed, for the simple reason that many times a criminal investigation and a criminal prosecution can drag on for
years, and, and I think many in the oversight community will
agree that that is way too long
to, to initiate administrative
proceedings, for administrative
violation, which, which. Then
deprives, the aggrieved party of
some sort of justice for whatever they're complaining about. And it also, creates this
long separation between, the act, the offending act and any
sort of accountability, which,
is never preferable. I'd also point out that there is no requirement that the
administrative investigation start after the criminal investigation starts, but that's
just a protective mechanism in
place. And government code
section 33 04d2e provides for that to happen. Provides for the administration, administrative investigation to be delayed
until the criminal investigation is completed by tolling the
statute of limitations for the completion of the administrative
investigation in. It's important to create separate units or divisions conducting the administrative investigation
versus the, criminal
investigation. And up until 2014, as it relates to the
sheriff's office, both of those
units or both of those functions, the administrative
function and the criminal investigation function were
housed in the same investigative
services unit. However given a number of issues that had arisen from that, the investigative
services unit in the san francisco sheriff's office split
into the internal affairs unit and the criminal investigation
unit, which is best practices
for any department to have two separate divisions that operate,
within in their own lanes of administrative and, criminal investigation, having
interagency firewalls. Particularly when the administrative investigation and a criminal investigation are conducted within the same department, is absolutely
essential. And I'm happy to have
also identified, policies within the san francisco sheriff's
office policy set, policy 607
and policy. 1010, particularly. 1010.5.2 and 607.7, that
provides that the administrative investigation and evidence from the administration of administrative investigation
does not and is. Prohibited from flowing freely into the criminal investigation. The ideal structure is to have a separate
agency which we are building right now with the office of the inspector general to perform the
administrative investigation. So that there is virtually no risk
of that, that evidence getting
co-mingled. So long as we have the protective safeguards in place. And lastly,
recommendation seven, the last, recommendation is to fully
develop each investigation option such that even if the criminal investigation leads to
a criminal conviction, don't rely on that criminal conviction alone for the administrative violation. Develop the
administrative files action in and of itself, that administrative violation is broader than the criminal case. For the simple reason that you could violate a number of
different policies, beyond what
is captured by the criminal conviction such that if years
down the line, the case gets
reviewed, the conviction gets reversed, there is still an independent basis that that will
withstand scrutiny, on a on an
arbitration appeal, later. Thank
you. Chief client. We MAY have to invite you back at the next to the next meeting for questions and discussion and
public comment. Thank you. Due
to time, that was so necessary. If only we had great professors like you during law school, it
would have been less painful. But I was waiting to hear about fruits of the poisonous tree, I think at this point we will hold
off on any kind of questions and make sure we have public comment. Although, janet, do we
need a motion to continue the other items? No. You can just make an announcement. Okay. We
will continue, item five and we MAY have time for items. I don't know, maybe we'll continue. Item
six as well, so now we'll take general public comment. Thank you so much, marshall. Thank
you. Well, you need to do public comment on this item. Oh, yes. Public comment on this item. For
members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item for department of police accountability presentation, please approach
the podium when it is free. It appears we have no public
comment, line numbers five and six will be continued to the next meeting. Calling line item seven. General public comment.
At this time, the public is welcome to address the board for up to two minutes on items that
did not. Appear on this afternoon's agenda, but are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. During public comment, neither
personnel nor any board members are required to respond to questions by the public, but MAY provide a brief response if we. If you would like to make public comment, approach the podium when it is free. As a reminder, you have up to two minutes to
give the public comment. There appears to be no public comment calling line item eight adjournment action item. All
those in favor? No no. So can I say before we adjourn? Yes. Just want to give great appreciation
to margaret baumgartner. I wish
you could do a vulcan mind grip
on me so I can learn all of your
expertise, you will be sorely missed. But I know ronnie singh's been a great understudy, and ronnie singh will be taking over for you starting next month, I don't know if you want
to come up and tell us and make us jealous of what you're going to do in your retirement. Yeah, this is last meeting. Thank you. Actually taking over us of next
week is my last week, so I as of APRIL 13th, which will be my literal 32 year anniversary date. Working for the city. I
will be retired. So I don't have anything that specific that I'm
doing in retirement except a
bunch of travel and, things like that. And my husband retired three years ago, and his
statement is, the best thing about retirement is simply I don't have to go to work every day. So that's kind of what I'm
looking forward to the most, is I get up in the morning, I don't actually have to go to work
every day, so I will MISS A lot
of it. I will MISS A lot of you. Working on boards is always with boards, has always been,
entertaining. I'm curious to see
how the ig's office ends up melding with the sheriff's office. I'm very hopeful, given the staff, that this will be a
positive of move forward for,
the department and for the city
as a whole. So thank you all for your service on this board. And,
good luck in the future with my replacement. And hopefully there'll be somebody else that
will help ronnie out as well, in the fairly near future, I hope I
have my fingers crossed. So thank you, thank you. Have fun.
Happy trails. Okay. With anything else, jana, that we
should address? We're good. That's it. All right. Calling
line item eight. Adjournment action item. All those in favor?
Aye, aye. Any nays? Meeting is
adjourned at 4:53 P.M. Thank

report from the office of the
inspector general. Um good afternoon. Members of the
sheriff's oversight board. Uh,
it's a pleasure to be here today . Uh, you know, I was looking at
the calendar and it looks like I've actually been on the job.
Exactly eight weeks, so, um, I thought it was. This would be a great opportunity to update you as to what we've accomplished over the last eight weeks. Uh,
on the job. Well when I first
arrived on JANUARY 8th, uh, of course, I needed to go through an orientation with both the city, but also the department of
police accountability. And I
want to thank paul henderson and the department of police
accountability and marshal kane,
because they had a very nice, uh, orientation laid out for me,
uh, sometime seems unrealistic to get so much done in a day,
but we got most of it done. Um
and in part, a big part of it was just explaining to me the
orienting me with the department of police accountability to see the facilities, uh, uh, the
resources, the divisions and the responsibilities and, and the systems that they employ, uh,
that went on for the first week.
And in, in the second week, uh,
began running. Uh bilyeu leave. yeah, it was in the second week
we began, um, uh, becoming more
familiar with with, uh, the
operations as they are
basically, uh, taking care of a
lot of the responsibilities of the, of the inspector general's
office in terms of handling, uh, the cases that come out of the sheriff's department while we
get up and running. Now another interesting thing that happened
in those first couple of weeks was I attended, uh, the core training with the current
academy class of the sheriff's department. So once they finished the sheriff's academy, they go through a six week core
training. And so I was able to participate, date with the
latest academy class in some of their core classes. Uh, unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in all of them, but
some of the ones that I did participate in was like the
class on the use of force. Uh,
the class on the use of the, uh,
well, it was all all the defense
mechanisms that they utilize in
their training and I was very, very impressed with the training . I thought the instructors were
really, really good. Um and so I
came away, uh, feeling very, uh,
comfortable with what I saw, uh,
in the, in the, in the core training I.G. Williams. Were you
able to do the, um, the
simulation on, uh, you know, unfortunately, that day I was
double booked and I wasn't able to attend the that training,
but, uh, and that was one of the things I was really looking forward to. Hopefully you can. I've done it. Um, as a prosecutor on these issues before. And it was it was really interesting. Yeah. No. And I mean, uh, I'm really thankful that the sheriff's department
has been very, uh, open and
helpful. Uh, so that pretty much anything we want to see, anything we want to do that, um, and so I anticipate that at some point when things kind of slow up, I'll have an opportunity to
get back out there. Yes. And then I was going to say in OCTOBER, our members will have an opportunity. If you haven't
gone to the community, um, uh,
events at the jail. And then
they, they do allow, um, working
on the simulation and a tour through operations and it also
includes the junior cadets from the high school, which was really nice to see the youth out there. Yeah, that would be great. That would be great. Oh,
I also saw their taser training,
which was I got to be honest, I learned so much about the taser
in that training. Uh, and so now
, now when I see any kind of a taser incident on video, I, I'm
looking at it through completely different eyes now because now I understand how it operates. And,
um, and kind of the whole theory behind the operation of the
taser so that was that was really good. Uh, I also completed the mandatory training of the city and county of san
francisco, which which is it
actually shocked me of how much
stuff they, they you go through, uh, in order to onboard with the
city and county of san francisco
. Um, and I was actually very, very impressed with how much of the training I had to go through. Just to onboard with the city and county. Uh, I completed a number of mandatory trainings, uh, implicit bias,
ethics and sunshine laws,
whistleblower program, and just
the series of trainings that they require. Uh, I also attended the san francisco new
employee orientation, which was a 9 to 12, uh, training that was, uh, actually very, very
good. Um so I was very impressed
with that. Um then probably one of the most important things that we've been doing over the last, uh, several weeks is meeting with a lot of our stakeholders. Uh, so I've met with supervisors shamann walton,
who, of course, uh, was the sponsor of the legislation creating the office of inspector
general. I've met with sheriff
miyamoto. We had a great meeting. Um, and really talked in depth about a lot of things
that we want to do from the with
the ig's office and with some of
their expectations are and where
we kind of meet. Uh, and so I was very impressed with sheriff
miyamoto. Uh, we also met with the sheriff's legal team. I
spent about a half, uh, a morning with their legal team talking about a lot of the issues that that they're seeing
come up and, and things that, uh
, uh, you know, we anticipate, uh, looking out for. But also very, very impressed with their
legal team. Uh, I've met with the public defender's policy team, so I know that, uh, angela is here today to do a presentation. I met with her and the public defender's team, and,
you know, we just we just had a general discussions and we
anticipate having a lot more meetings and, uh, and I
anticipate that we'll be meeting
on a regular basis, uh, to I've
met with paul henderson, uh, the
executive director of the department of police, accountable. He was kind enough to take me on a tour of the
board of supervisors. Uh, and I
probably personally met about half of the members of the board of supervisors, but I met all of
their staffs, uh, their staff members. Uh, I've met with the
mayors budget team. I've met
with the mayors, chief of staffs
. Um, I've met with the san francisco jail. Just this
coalition. Uh which is the
coalition. Interesting that was
the group that, um, was the they were the group that got the
sheriff's department to. And the
city and county of san francisco
to do away with, uh, commissary
fees, uh, phone fees. They, they
got funding or they found funding for the tablets that the inmates now use. So I think that they've had a real positive
impact on, on being incarcerated
on, on the, on the life of those that are incarcerated and making life much easier for, uh, for their families. So I was very
impressed with what they've done so far. And we also agreed to
meet on a on a rolling basis,
you know, as things come up, uh,
I, I've joined the bar association of, of bar
association of san francisco's,
uh, task force, which is a task force of literally everybody involved within the criminal
justice system. And we meet, uh,
I think once every four weeks on friday, and we just discuss issues of the day. And one of
the issues that that's like currently being discussed, um,
although I wasn't able to attend the last meeting, the meeting before that, what was being
discussed was the, uh, uh, the
policy cases involving the use
of, uh, what do you call the not the flying robots, but the
drones. Drones. Drones uh, drone
policy. And it was a very
interesting discussion. And so I , uh, I came away actually very impressed with that group, but there were a lot of smart people in the group, and there were members from the department of police accountability also on
that task force. And so, um, uh, we also met with allie riker,
who is the director of the
sheriff's department programing, because one of the things we wanted to find out was we wanted a list of all of the sheriff's
programs so that we have a working knowledge on what are
all of the programs that they offer to the inmates and their families, and so we had a great meeting with allie riker. I was very impressed with her. And,
um, and just her knowledge of,
of, uh, the programs that they're providing, but also
where, where things can be
improved and, and that's always,
uh, uh, a positive. Then we
dealt with the budget and, uh,
we've worked with the dpa's
finance team, and I really want to give special thanks to
cherise yao and nicole armstrong because they've worked very
closely with our team. Uh, in
terms of preparing our budget, uh, for this budget cycle, uh,
we've met with the mayor's
budget office. Um, we've also well, we've met with the mayor's budget office. Multiple times,
and, uh, I think everyone
understands is, um, that it's
important that, uh, you know, we
are receive some, uh, budget funding in order to meet our obligations of the office of
inspector general. Uh, we made two public presentations, runs
of our budget, uh, one on
JANUARY 24th in city hall in
room 416. And we made a second budget. Uh, present version on
FEBRUARY 14th, 2024, in room
408. Uh, we finalized and
submitted our budget proposal on
FEBRUARY 21st, 2024, and, and,
uh, I would say this about our
budget is that we, uh, prepared
and presented a budget that I think realistically assesses the
fact that, uh, the city and
county of san francisco is in an
unprecedented budget deficit, or
they have an unprecedented budget deficit. So we understand
that. And I think that the
proposal that we presented was
very realistic in terms of
considering that we're in the
type of budget era that we're in
. Um, you know, we only asked
for the basic things we need to get the agency off the ground. So I don't think that there were any over asks in our budget
proposal. We also, uh, um,
proposed agreements with both
the sheriff's department and dpa
to ensure that that they
continue. Well, in the case of
dpa, that they continue the investigations and that nothing
is compromised in terms of the
sheriff's investigation. Ations.
Um, while all the oig obtains funding to hire on board and train staff, uh, because we
understand that one of our challenges is that even when we
receive the funding, you know,
we still have to, uh, hire folks
on board them and train them,
uh, according to our procedure and protocols. And so that's
going to take some time. And our agreement that we're seeking to enter into with the sheriff's department and dpa takes all of
that into, into consideration.
Uh, we also launched a website,
um, we developed and launched that website. And I actually
want to thank, uh, dan, uh,
leon, uh, for his assistance
with that website. Um uh, dan
was the man on the website. Uh,
it has links to services and
information. Um, and we will be updating the website. You know,
when as appropriate. And as we
develop as an agency. And I've
also, uh, focused on, you know, I think it's very important to
raise the public's awareness of the office of the inspector
general, but not only inside san francisco, not only with the
stakeholders, but I think in the
greater bay area. And so I participated in a number of
speaking engagements on FEBRUARY
second, uh, I was asked to be
the keynote speaker in the silicon city of san jose. Uh,
and, and the silicon valley chap
of the naacp asked me to be their keynote speaker at their black history month program.
And, uh, it was a great
opportunity to raise the profile of the office of the inspector
general. And I had a great,
great time participating in that
program. Uh last night or excuse me, before last night. Saturday.
Uh we marched in the, uh, uh,
the san francisco lunar new year
parade. Uh, and that was I was just telling, uh, uh, folks in
the audience that it's the biggest parade I've ever personally attended. I mean,
i've seen the new york MAY, uh, thanksgiving day parade. I've
seen the rose bowl parade, but a parade that I've actually
participated in, I mean, it was
just huge. So, I mean, it really, really enjoyed the
parade. Um, I thought the city did a great job of putting that
parade on. Um, so it was a great
time last, last night, I was a
panelist on a kind of nationwide . Uh, well, it went out
nationwide wide, but the focus was on the state of california,
and it was called a conversation with living legends of the largest black bar associations.
And it was an honor to be included in that, that group, because it was a group of real luminaries. His and it was hosted by the law firm of duane
morris and, uh, you know, we had
some great discussions that were very appropriate, given that we
are at the end of black history
month and, um, and I think that also I think it's programs like that that raise the profile of
the office of inspector general.
Um, so I think as you can see,
we've been very busy, uh, over the last eight weeks. And we
really and this is just the
beginning. So we anticipate, uh,
staying on the same pace and
trying to accomplish as much as
we can in terms of, you know,
our main goal is to get the
agency up and running so that we
are, uh, solely responsible for
the oversight of the sheriff's
department. Thank you. And I if I recall, you, you also were
invited as a special guest to the fda's black history
celebration. I was yes, I was,
and I, I really, uh, enjoyed
that. Um, and you know, there were a lot of people that I knew over there and, yeah, I had a
great time and but I think that that that's also a good
opportunity to, um, get to know folks in the other agencies and, and, and develop good
relationships with them. And so
I appreciated the invite and, and, uh, I think brooke jenkins did a fantastic job with that
program. So thanks for reminding
me about that. And there are any questions I was going to say. Now, you're a member of the asian american bar association of the greater bay area. So I am
ending the gala. You were highly requested by the organization and the PRESIDENT To be there, and now you're a member. I'm a
member, and I bought a ticket.
Um, I also wanted to recognize member mango for making sure that our website becomes more
user friendly, client friendly
in terms of the services and
just again, thank her for doing a beautiful highlight and
overview of our annual report.
And she was too modest to want
to take any kind of credit. And so I had to put it in the PRESIDENT's letter as I was introducing the report. But also
down the road, if you could keep
her informed so that she can
actually kind of do her little
model and graphics to make it easier for people to. Yeah. MISS
Mango also sent us a link to the los angeles, uh, oversight
board's website. Uh, that I
think I've had a great time just
looking at it and seeing where where we can pick up some good tips on putting our website
together, and also show, uh, the manner in which they outreach to
the public, I think are very,
very, uh, was very helpful. And do we have any more questions or
comments? Um, member nguyen, do you have any. Um, no. Uh, thank you for the presentation. It was
very informative and, um, uh, you look look forward to having you on board and working together. All right. Thank you. And I will say this, that, you
know, um, I place a high
importance on as big things come
up, keeping you informed in real
time and not, you know, reporting it. Just when we get here to the meeting, because there are going to be some things that come up that you all
need to be aware of. And so we
want to create that mechanism to get, you know, get word to you in real time when there's something we think you should be
aware of. Okay. Thank you. And member brichter has joined us. Member brichter, do you have any questions or comments? Uh, no questions. Uh, apologies for being late. Um, sounds like
you've been busy. Yes, yes. Which is really, really good. So welcome I think, um. What?
Absolutely love. And I know it's probably something that if we haven't discussed, we will discuss just getting out there and having some community meetings as well too, so that
you can facetime, uh, with the different districts and the communities here in san francisco. So they also see, uh,
the ig. Um, but yeah, outside of that, look forward to you
continuing to come back and us having these discussions, but also enjoyed, uh, you sharing, looking for ways in which we can also communicate in real time so that we're not having to be reactive versus being proactive
with how we can assist. Yes, absolutely. As well too, if we see something that we need to
get out in front of, we want to immediately let you know, like, look, we need to get out in front of this. And so, so yeah, no, I definitely we, uh, want to
operate in that manner. It
sounds good. And then, you know, our timeline, our priorities and benchmarks. That's a dynamic
document. So, yes, as you see a need, we can adjust our priorities as an oversight board. Absolutely thank you very
much. All right. Thank you. So
dan, the next item. Oh I'm sorry . Uh, public comment for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item
two. Inspector general report, please approach the podium when it is free. It appears there's
no public comment. Calling line
item three. San francisco public defender's office presentation
information item angela chan, assistant chief attorney from the san francisco public defender's office, will present an overview of the san francisco public defender's office. The clients they serve, and their experiences with jail conditions
and legal visits in the jails. MISS Chan, thank you. And I think it's really appropriate
that this month is happy, um, women's history month. So our next two presenters, uh, very strong women leaders in our community, um, and angela is no stranger for her work in the community, coming from the asian law caucus and having been on the police commission and now with the public defender's office, thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. I
really appreciate it. Um, and
congrats on this board for existing and the work that you do. And also welcome to inspector general wiley. It was a pleasure to meet with you recently when you came to our office and met with several
members of our staff. Um I put a some copies here of this powerpoint in case you prefer
hard copies. And can I ask in terms of forwarding the slides? Should I just ask you to go
next? Okay great. Um, so I'll start again. Just saying. Hello I'm angela chan. I'm an assistant chief attorney at the public defenders office. I oversee our confront and
advocate wing. We confront state sponsored violence and advocate for community empowerment. I'll
explain a little later. More what that means to curious title. Uh, my friends sometimes tease me about. And previously,
I was at the asian law caucus. I was there for about 16 years managing the criminal justice reform program there, and also
was on the police commission for four years. About a decade ago. And we used to meet in this room . Soa very familiar room
for me. Um, so I'm just going to jump in next slide. Thank you. Um, I'll be presenting on our
office. What we do some of the
programs that we're really proud
of. The clients that we serve as
well as going into some of the issues that, uh, we work with the sheriff's department on and some highlight some of the challenges that we're trying to problem solve with the sheriff's
office. Um, as you'll see here in this slide, our office is
almost 100 years old. Um, and really, we have a constitutional
mandate to represent, provide legal representation to clients who cannot afford a private attorney. Uh, private attorneys
are very expensive. And so the vast majority of people can't afford that. And so we do
represent over 70% of the people who are accused of crimes in this city. And the constitutional right that we're protecting is the right to due
process and a fair trial. Um, I also bring with me greetings from our public defender, manu raju. He's the only public defender that's elected in the whole state. Uh, only reason he couldn't be here is he's in trial. Um, but he was glad that I was able to join and appreciated the invitation to our office. Um, noting here,
too, that we have 120 attorneys,
120 staff. So 240 staff total, and we represent about 20,000
people annually. We I'll talk a little bit later about the caseloads that our attorneys
carry. Next slide please. So we always try to start every presentation, especially in the
community with our theory of change. And our mission. What drives us mano often talks about
this as the why we do the work,
not just what we do. Um, so our core mission is to fiercely defend our clients. We want to
make sure that they have an opportunity for a fair trial.
They're presumed innocent and
that we turn over every stone to make sure that we investigate
their case. And present the most fair and accurate case possible for them. And we take the lessons that we learned from this client representation
lesson to develop our local and
state policy priorities, and
also our community empowerment
programs, which I'll talk about a little a little bit later. And
to give you an example of kind
of how we do this that's very applicable to this board. Um, we
actually, uh, help to plant the
seed for this board because back in 2015, uh, then public
defender jeff adachi, um, found through our clients and their family members that there was an issue with and really concerning issue of sheriff deputies
forcing people in custody to
engage in gladiator fights for bedding and entertainment
purposes. Um, obviously gross
misconduct. And that got a lot of attention in the community in the press. And it led to the passage of the ballot measure that established this oversight
board. And also an inspector
general position. So it gives you a little sense of how we operate and the change that we
try to make. Next slide please.
This is a chart. The
organizational chart. And you'll
see to the left here in yellow this is the bread and butter of our work. Our felony and misdemeanor units that defend people are accused of crime. At
850 bryant the hall of justice, which is right next to c.J one
and k two. Um so two of our jails um we also have our youth defender unit that represents
young people. Some of you, I think, work on juvenile issues and are familiar with this area. And we have an office in twin peaks diamond heights, where we represent young people. And really the focus there is about rehabilitation and also reunification with children and their families, because we
believe that's the safest and most supportive environment for
them in most situations. Um, we also have our confront advocate unit that I oversee under this
unit is seven, um, different
groups and teams. Our integrity
unit deals with law enforcement misconduct. We keep a database that's open to the public called the cop monitor database. We try
to identify and make transparent , um, concerns about misconduct. Um, we have our small but mighty community actions team that
educates the public, especially
when we have an acquittal in a case to clear our client's names. We also have a local and state policy director and our
moving a package of policies at the state level where our
criminal laws are made in order to try to advance criminal justice reform. And we have our clean slate programs, which are out in the community holding monthly clinics in different neighborhoods throughout the
city to try to help people with
removing barriers to jobs,
housing and employment, which happens when someone has a
criminal record and then our magic programs, we'll talk about a little bit later. Our freedom project deals with post-conviction relief and helps
to implement recent resentencing laws are called second look laws
that have been passed by the legislature that allow people with long sentences in state prison to get a chance to appear
in front of the board of parole hearing and show their record of
rehabilitation to get a chance
at release. Um, and then we, in this third column here, we have
our, our operations unit, which is very important in terms of
all the data that we have to gather, the record keeping, the research that we do, the legal research in order to support our
policy work and our client
representation and lastly, our
chief of staff, um, handles, uh, ensuring that we have we are our commitment to diversity and
equity in our office. We are very proud of our diverse staff at all levels, including at the
management level and we are in
budget season. So we're very much in the process of advocating for our proposed
budget. Next slide please. Uh, a
little snapshot of the clients
that we serve. As you'll see here, about 10% of our clients are immigrants or limited
english proficient community
members. Um, most of our clients
suffer from mental illness or have are grappling with a
substance use disorder issue
issue. Um, the vast majority of our clients also are unhoused,
and all of them are low income.
Um, and noting that on the right here in this pie chart and this
is something I think, um, is
particularly egregious in san
francisco, but cuts across most counties in california, the overrepresentation of
communities of color, um, and so
about 75% of our clients are
people of color and half of our clients are black, even though the black population makes up about 6% of san francisco. So
there's a lot of work to do in san francisco in terms of racial justice and criminal justice
reform. Um, next slide please. um, we're proud that as a public defender office, our trial rates are probably some of the highest in the country, meaning that
we're not afraid to go to trial. And we are proud of the skills
of our trial attorneys. Um, and
we have a great success rate to
show for that. About 40% of the
cases that we take to trial, we
are able to get an acquittal,
um, or a hung jury. So avoiding
a conviction, um, and noting
that about 97% of the people who are detained in our jails are
actually pretrial while awaiting the resolution of their case. So just kind of giving that context . Also, I thought it was 80. I was looking at the most recent numbers. I didn't realize it's
97. So a high, high number of people detained in the jail,
pretrial, um, we also have a high success rate in terms of dismissals. So seeking a
dismissal of a case under california penal code 99 five,
because the procedural errors, lack of probable cause and other legal issues that affect the integrity of the case. And
lastly, it's not where we're not just proud of our trial rates and our success rates. We're also proud that we provide holistic representation to our
clients. Um, it's not just about process. Sing them through the criminal system. It's about
making sure that we get connect and to the services that they need, whether it be mental
health, substance use, housing, etc. And so that's something
really, uh, is why we have not just attorneys, but social
workers that are critical to the
work that we do. Next slide
please. Um to give you a sense of some of our cases and our clients, uh, match a face to what I'm describing here. Um,
here are some of the headlines, some recent headlines over the last two years or so of
acquittals and other successful outcomes that we've been able to get for our clients. This
includes this picture of MR. Everett here, who's standing in the middle in between two of our
amazing trial attorneys. He's,
um, he's 54 years old. He was
shot five times by sfpd when he
was in mental health crisis. He was charged with resisting arrest, threatening an officer and carrying a knife. Um, and
luckily, we were able to get the case dismissed before having to
go to trial and noting the
headlines here, the theme are are people who are unhoused being involved in the criminal
system and how that is actually
be, um, a kind of important fact to pair with that is that unhoused people are more likely to be victims of crime than they are to perpetrate crime, but they are much more likely to be criminalized and to be
incarcerated. Next slide please. This will highlight some of our community programs, including our magic programs that I spoke about earlier. So we not only defend our clients in the courtroom, we also try to make sure that we look at community empowerment. We want to prevent folks from getting into the system in the first place, and we want to really put ourselves out of a job is kind of our our goal here at the public
defender's office. And so about 20 years ago, we started our
magic programs that are programs based in the bay view and the
western addition, slash fillmore
area to strong black communities
in order to, uh, provide services such as our summer literacy program, our fall
backpack giveaway program. We just had our black and white ball, which is a really fun event for children to dress up and celebrate with their families. Um, and we also hold regular convener meetings with
community partners, where it's a space for people to share information and build community. You all are absolutely welcome
to join those. Magic convener meetings, which are posted on the magic website on their
social media. Next slide please.
Um, I'd skip through. I'll just kind of quickly say that we also
have a program called the legal education advocacy program, or leap, where we advocate for young people in terms of their
educational programs in sfusd
schools. Um, and when I was at the asian law caucus, I actually
was also involved in the effort to make sure that young people have the appropriate educational
plan so they're less likely to get into trouble in school. Um,
and on this side, I want to highlight our end the cycle program. This is relatively new. We do have a limited number of social workers, so that the social workers, we do have, we've had them focus on more serious felony cases to really
try to get to the root of, of the needs in those cases. We in
the last two years or so, started to end the cycle program to connect our to get a few more
social workers. We have three to work with people who are arrested for misdemeanors when they first enter the system. Because when someone enters the system, that's a chance to
intervene in and to prevent a cycle of being re-incarcerated over and over again. Sometimes that's even generational. We want to disrupt that cycle. Um, and it's really our social workers connecting people with
the services that they need. I mentioned our clean slate program already, and then our college pathway project. We started this last year, and these are formal partnerships with sf state and city college
to connect our clients with those who are in the jail and those who are released with higher education opportunities.
It could start with just a few classes, or it could be full time enrollment. And it's been
wonderful to work with sf state and city college on that project . Next slide please. So I mention our workloads earlier.
Um, there's been a couple factors that have led to a pretty dramatic increase in our workloads. Um, our felony
attorneys can carry around 70
cases for one attorney. Our misdemeanor attorneys can carry around 130 cases. That's an
immense amount of cases. And that's even coming from a nonprofit where there was already a high case load. This is even higher than that. So it
is quite a bit of work. Um, and, and laying out some of the causes here, I'm sure you have probably additional causes you might want to throw in, but includes what I'll talk about later. The trial delays. Um,
there has been an increase in filings by the district attorney's office. There has been a dramatic decrease in referrals to diversion programs
and a complete shutdown of the adult restorative justice program and a significant
reduction in the youth
restorative justice program. So
we are trying to work with the district attorney's office to bring that back. But we are concerned about that. Um, there's also been changes in laws that have resulted in also more work and more
opportunities, including the racial justice act. I'm not sure if you've heard of this, but it's a relatively new law. Um, and where there is evidence of
racial bias that has harmed or
impacted a case, that's an opportunity to challenge a
conviction on challenge a charge or challenge a sentence through
bringing a racial justice act motion. So that's additional work that our office has really
tried to specialize in, but we certainly could use more resources for that. And noting, too, that the jail population has increased from a low of around the 800 seconds to in 2020 during the height of the
pandemic, to about 1100 people
now. And so those numbers do
mean that we have higher
caseloads and more work in our office. Um, next slide and you
might have seen this in the
headlines. There has been a
backlog of cases, uh, where
people have asserted their speedy trial rights, uh, 60 days
to hold a trial. If you have a felony charge, 30 days if you have a misdemeanor charge and
trials not being held within
that mandate time frame mandated by state law and also
constitutional protections, and
as a result of this backlog, that started with covid, but really continue well beyond that
emergency. Um, we got to a
height of over 1100 cases that were backlogged where people's speedy trial rights were
violated. And at that height,
about 150 people in the jail
were there waiting their cases past their speedy trial deadline
. And some of the concerns that
we highlighted is that close to
city hall is our civic center courthouse, which is a second courthouse that we could use in addition to our hall of justice to hold trials. And
unfortunately, only about 1 or 2 courts rooms at that nearby
courthouse was open for trials for criminal trials. The rest were used for civil matters,
which are less time sensitive.
Um, and there was a concern it was there's been a finger pointing at the say between the sheriff's office and the courts as to how do we problem solve, what's the issue here? Um, and the courts had pointed their fingers to the sheriff's office, so they needed more share of staffing to hold the hearings at civic center. Our office said
you know, we don't care what the issue is. We just need these
trials to be held because we have clients who are waiting with their rights violated. So we were just pushing, pushing, pushing everyone involved. And that includes filing a lawsuit that's pending, that's against
the courts in order to try to reduce the backlogs and get them to come up with a comprehensive
plan to address it. We also held
back to back summer sit ins eight weeks back to back at the
hall of justice last summer to educate the public about this,
and also to put pressure on everyone around to get going on
addressing the backlog. The good
news is, from all that work, there's been a significant reduction in the backlog with felony cases. So that's been a
relief. And there's been trial after trial now happening at the hall of justice on the felony
end. But on the misdemeanor end, we continue to see a very significant backlog, um, both
for people who are out of custody and in custody. And so
that there continues to be a push on that. And 20, 24 were four years, you know, past the height of the pandemic. And we're still dealing with this issue. And it is pretty unique to san francisco. Um, of the 58 counties at san francisco that probably has the worst backlog,
um, alongside santa clara county . But other counties have been able to address their backlog, and some didn't even really have much of a backlog. Um, next
slide please. Um, noting are the
funding for our office here. We
have about $51 million in our budget. Um, the district
attorney, by contrast has $81
million. Our budget's about six times less than the sheriff's department, 13 times less than the police department. Um, and
we do represent about 20,000
people a year, over 70% of the people who are in our criminal
system in san francisco. Next
slide, please. Um, the war on
drugs. And so over the last few
years, there has, in my opinion,
been a revived war on drugs in san francisco, where there's
been a focus on law enforcement approaches versus public health
approaches. And as a part of this revived war on drugs, the sheriff's department has deployed 130 deputies, not all at the same time, but they've applied. They've designated 130 deputies to be deployed to the
tenderloin to engage in drug
arrests. And this is a small neighborhood that's already has been saturated by law enforcement, including sfpd,
california highway patrol,
california national guard and
federal drug enforcement agency. So there's a lot going on in there. And something I often comment on from a policy perspective is it would be wonderful to see the tenderloin saturated with nurses, doctors,
social workers also, so that
people who need help can get it.
Um, back in OCTOBER 2022, we
held a press briefing with daca
peters with treatment providers
to really lay out evidence based public health strategies that are more effective at addressing substance use disorder than
arrests and incarceration. I
included on this slide a qr code
so you can view the youtube
record lauded presentation in case you're interested and get to know some of the experts that we brought to have this
discussion. Um, we're concerned, and I think the numbers bear it
out that a decent chunk of the
increase of people in our jails
is because of this revived war
on drugs, and in particular,
where we've seen that with ck
one, which is the intake part of the jail that we have people there who are going through
there for public intoxication,
for substance use disorder, and they're being flash incarcerated
. So therefore, a few hours a
day and then release out and we
have reports from our clients where they are going through a
really excruciating withdrawal
and not receiving the medical support and attention that they need. So it really just feels
like for our clients, um, not not a helpful situation, not something that will get them off of substances, but really something that's just putting them through a really painful,
um, time. Um, and what we would, would really like to ensure is that people instead get access
to low barrier, um, uh, easy to
receive and accept services rather than this flash incarceration that's been going
on now for, uh, a year to two
years. Next slide please. This is where I'll spend a little bit of time just giving our observations regarding the jail
condition. And, uh, you know, our partnership with the sheriff's office to try to address and problem solve some of these issues. Um, so, first,
legal visits, these are when our
staff, our attorneys, social workers, paralegals, investigators go and meet with our clients. These legal visits
in the jail are critical. And
they're also not optional. They're required. It's required that we get access to our clients through the constitution , through statutory protections, because it's a it's a part of
that right to a fair trial and
to due process. Yes. If we can't meet with our clients, we can't prepare them for their next hearing and prepare with them for trial, which means that people are less likely to get released, and that contributes
to increasing numbers in our jails. So it's a top priority for our office for those reasons
, we engage in legal visits in
three main ways zoom visits in person and also via phone. And
we meet biweekly with prisoner legal services to problem solve issues with legal visits and also try to alert them in real time when we encounter them. Um, they've been incredibly helpful.
I think nick presented to you pretty recently, and I just want to say that nick and his colleagues, melinda and asia,
have been awesome. Really ready
to do work, uh, working well outside work hours to try to
problem solve issues. Um, in terms of zoom legal visits, some things that we've seen, that's a reoccurring issue that we've been trying to problem solve and have been also asking for support from the sheriff's. It
department is, um, uh, bad sound quality. Sometimes the sound
quality is on one end, sometimes it's on the other, sometimes it's on both. And when the quality is so bad that you can't hear one another, you can't
conduct a proper legal visit. So those visits have to end. Um, and some times get rescheduled. That delays hearings. We've also
had issues in this past week. There's been um, it's happened three times already or three
days out of two weeks where
we've had a row of visits
canceled, zoom visits canceled,
and with no notice about why. And we're still following up and
trying to figure out why those visits have been canceled. And that's been very disruptive. Um,
we have also had issues and it hasn't happened in the last
month or so, but definitely, uh, last year and the year before
this has happened, where some deputies would place the tablet that was used for a zoom call
outside the individual cell. So there's no attorney client
privilege, can't conduct the
call when that happens. And so that really ends up the zoom call being canceled and having to be rescheduled. We've been
problem shooting some of that, but more work needs to be done to make sure it's consistent across the board that people are
brought to the relevant visiting rooms to have a proper,
confidential visit. Uh,
in-person legal visits. Um, this is critical. Also to our work,
and nothing can replace being in person and making that effort to
see your client and as you know,
our third jail three is down in
san bruno a bit of a drive. So when our staff make the trek there, if they aren't able to get in a legal visit, it really throws off their whole day. It
can take a few hours to do this, and we've had some issues with
not being able to get in a legal visit because of lockdowns and
short staffing. Um, noting that
neither are appropriate reasons to not allow a legal visit because legal visits are constitutional and statutory. Right. So we've been trying to wade through that by asking for
the watch commander, asking for the supervisor on staff.
Sometimes we can problem solve
it. Other times it's kind of a
waste of, you know, a few hours and delaying of hearings because we aren't able to. So that's
work in progress. Recently, we
also had a deputy at cj three in san bruno walk into a legal visit and told our staff to cut short a visit because of short
staffing. Um, also not something that's legally allowed. And so we are concerned about that and have flagged that for the
sheriff's office. Um, we've seen also a pattern of the use of count time, which happens
several times a day in each of
the jails, where a count creep,
uh, the count time seems to be going earlier and ending later.
And that being used to in some
situations not allow a legal visit. And so we've been also asking for a watch commander
trying to, uh, go higher up when
we encounter a count creep issue where we're denied a visit outside of the appropriate count
hours. Um, so those are just a smattering of our our legal visit issues. Happy to answer questions about that. Um,
another issue that we've been encountering, and there was a recent news story about this, um, actually coming from the district attorney's office. Um is the sheriff's office's duty to transport clients to and from
court. Over the past several years, in the time I've been in
our office, we've seen numerous
times where, uh, a deputy
reported that a client refused to attend court, and that's why they weren't brought to court. And in those some of those situations, our clients have
said, no, I didn't refuse. I wanted to go to court and we were concerned that some of those situations, it's not really a refusal. It's misunderstanding,
miscommunication. And sometimes our client, uh, flunking the attitude test and then being
denied a transportation, a court that, of course, delays court delays, criminal proceedings and
can contribute to, um,
increasing numbers in our jails. And so we've been working with the sheriff's office to try to identify are there certain
deputies where this is more likely to happen? Can we retrain? Can we problem solve here. And so that's also a work
in progress. Um, client contact with family members. So it is
very important to us that our we don't just represent our clients. We want to make sure that we meet the needs of their families and communities impacted. Um, and so, so sometimes family members have
reported to us concerns about, um, not being able to get a client visit. And during the pandemic, family visits were
shut down. It was very slow for them to come back. Up until recently, there were only about two visits. Opportunities for visits per each jail a month. I understand that that's been increasing, which we really
appreciate. Um, however, we want
to keep pushing and say we want more access for our families to
visit. Um, you know, for those who are parents to be away from your child for any amount of
time is excruciating and heartbreaking. So to the extent we can really encourage and
support that access our office
would really encourage that. Um also programing, I think I'm sure this is something you've recently talked about. Um, programing was shut down during
covid. We are four years out
from that and program is slowly
coming back, but not fast enough. Especially program in different languages to make sure
we provide programing for all of our communities who are in our
jails. Um, and another thing to highlight that has been in the
news, um, and has been, uh, discussed is concern about lack
of sunlight and outdoor time. Uh, I did a tour of the jail
last spring, and thanks to the sheriff office for hosting us and, uh, a public defender, manu raju, for those very helpful
visits. I did notice, though, that there was a lack of sunlight, lack of access to fresh air, and our office is concerned about the impact in
terms of mental health and long terme illnesses that people
experience from lack of those
very basic things that could lead to heart disease, depression, um, high blood
pressure. And we've had clients
that, due to the travel delays, have also been detained even
longer in those conditions. And, and their families have
expressed concern about that, um, about family members coming home with those types of conditions. We understand that
in OCTOBER 2023, um, the judge in this lawsuit that was filed
by an outside party, um, ordered the sheriff's department to provide at least 15 minutes of sunlight every day to people who've been detained or jails
for one year or more. Um, I understand there's some issues
and discussion about compliance, and the judge is doing a tour soon of the jail. We do hope
that that these issues of just basic access to sunlight and
fresh air will be addressed for
our clients. Yes. And just a last note here. In terms of laying out some of the challenges that we're seeing. Um a concern about in-custody deaths, um, we have had at least
two clients die in custody in the last two years. Um, allegedly by suicide. I believe in both those cases. And we are
concerned that these clients had mental health needs that were not being addressed in the jail and do ask for a thorough
investigation of those deaths. Um, both behalf on behalf of our
office and also the family members who've reached out to us and have expressed you know,
deep concern. Um, and that kind of goes through some of the some
of the issues I wanted to lay out. Um, this is my contact information. You all are welcome to contact me. I try to be as
accessible as possible. Well, I think I know at least a half a half of yo this commission and really appreciate all of your service to san francisco.
Thank you. Angela do we have any questions or comments? I'll
start with member mango. Yes thank you so much for your presentation and for walking us through the context. And I can
see how how, um, kind of like
the values come to life through the work that you guys do. So,
um, just to maybe some two questions on the slides that you presented. I think that in the
court slide, you mentioned 90% pretrial trial clients are
waiting. Um do you know what the
breakout is? Is it like. And I'm , you know, not a legal person? I don't really understand the language, but like, is it like misdemeanor offenses or is it
like felony offenses is for that
is a great question. I have the most recent stats courtesy of the sheriff's office and it does not break it down. Um, so if anyone in the sheriff's office would like to comment, you're welcome to I don't have that number. I just know that the vast majority of people who are
awaiting pretrial, um, uh, that that's the high percentage. And if I were to hazard a guess, I
would guess that a lot of those individuals are are facing felony charges in that
situation. Okay. And then also,
thanks for explaining the whole the bottleneck situation with
the trial delays. I can see that
from from the graph that you had it like spiked, especially during the pandemic. So I think it's also very interesting what
you noted that other um,
counties aren't experience seeing the same issues aside from santa clara. Do you know what that is like? Are they are
they like what the reason is for
the santa clara? Yeah. Other um, so outside of san francisco and santa clara, other counties
continue to hold trials during the height of the pandemic in
2020. And 2021. They found, for example, san mateo county opened
their convention center and held trials. And so they were able to actually not accumulate a
backlog. Because of that, san
francisco did not take those
actions, was not proactive, was
not was not planning. And as a result, we're in a situation where four years later, we used we still have a very significant misdemeanor backlog and are just
making some progress on the felony backlog. So we are concerned. I understand that santa clara had a similar
missteps in how they handled it,
but I would hazard a guess at this point, san francisco might have worse numbers in terms of
our backlog. Okay well, it's good because you have the
inspector general here, you have the board, and you also have the sheriff's department. Um to listen on this, okay. On the last slide, the jail conditions are these listed on priority
order. Oh, that's a great question. Um, I definitely don't
think they're in priority. I because, of course, in-custody deaths is something that we take extremely seriously. And when we have to speak with those family
members who have a lot of questions about why their family member died in custody, it is extremely difficult. So this is
not in any particular order here. I did want to highlight legal visits because we I have the most information about that, um, since I've been dealing with that and I'm really granular level. Um, so that's why I
started there. Um all right. Well, thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you for those questions. Member. Dwayne. Uh, I don't I don't have any questions. Thank you for your presentation. Thank you. Yeah.
Thank you. So much for that. Uh, assistant chief chan, that was very, very thorough. Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear that. And, you know, I got an opportunity and just want to give a big shout
out to public defender mano raju , uh, who spends a lot of time in community. I think the last
time I saw him, he was in district ten and we were going through the district ten safety plan and I got to see some of
these numbers on a on a much smaller level than what you just presented today. Um, but I think, you know, really what I wanted to highlight was just, again, just being able to look
at the numbers. And both of us have been on the police commission and just allowing folks to really connect the dots. When we look at racial injustice and how it, you know,
starts off with the police department and how it continues to go, uh, even with the sheriff's department. So I think I just wanted to make sure that we really highlighted that. And again, I think we're also hearing some consistent themes, uh, that we just heard last
month at our meeting when our members from the reentry, uh, community came out and talked
about lack of services being
able to get time with their loved ones who are in jail. So
as we continue to hear these themes, I hope we continue to, you know, have that dialog. Now
that we have the ig here where,
um, we can begin to move the needle forward with information that's consistently coming, not just from community, but also from other agencies. So, uh,
look forward to you. You all continuing to come and provide us with information and things that we can do in order to push some of these things forward. Thank you for that. Really helpful comment, commissioner. um, I see the work that this
sheriff oversight board is, is
charged with doing, and this our new inspector general as racial justice work because of the
great gross racial disparities that we have in the city at
every level, at access to services, at education, at
employment, that and also with
arrest rates, incarceration
rates, release rates, pretrial
um, convictions and sentences. It's every step of the way.
There is racial disparity. And,
um, it is shocking when you go into our jails and you see that it's significantly majority
minority both in juvenile hall
where I used to spend a lot of time working and in our adult
facilities, it tells you there's something seriously wrong. And
we have a lot of work to do in
this city. Vice PRESIDENT Great,
thank you so much. Assistant chief. And it's really great to
have someone with your experience and involvement directly in community. I think
that it's wonderful that, you
know, you picked somebody like
you to be in this position. Um
so I had a couple questions. Um
what is do you have a formal procedure or protocol for public
defenders to address concerns
with the sheriff or do you have 120 attorneys? And they do they go through a manager or a
process? Yes. Um, because one of the things we want to do is we
want to get your clients the immediate help if they need.
Right. So if there is an error or there is a mistake, we want
to be able to know that there's
a process by which it's being
communicated, communicated and
addressed promptly. Right and consistently between all your
public defenders. 120 is a lot of different opinions and different approaches and styles
calls. Um, so do you have a policy and procedure for what, uh, public defenders need to do to assist them in getting resources or addressing any concerns with the sheriff?
That's a great question. And I
am, uh, I am a very organized systems kind of person. So I
always ask the same questions like, let's make sure we
streamline this. Let's make sure we're also thorough in capturing
our concerns. Um, and as timely
as possible. So with me joining the office about two years ago,
um, it's myself and another
assistant chief. He actually oversees our operations. Um, and
the two of us meet, uh, every
two weeks with the sheriff's office. We've been meeting with prisoner legal services last
year or so. Prior to that, we met with chief deputy, uh, fisher paulson. And we also do have a line to chief deputy lizette adams. Um, to convey any
concerns that come up. Uh, our
attorneys, all of our staff know
to raise those concerns with us immediately when they have them,
so that we can organize and
prioritize our concerns and make sure we relay it some situations, we do run it all the way up to sheriff miyamoto and
say, this is something that's really urgent, we need your help. And he has been responsive in returning our calls and trying to address issues. So would it be accurate to say that if a public defender is
independently moving outside of
that kind of manage material
support structure that you have, then they're not really following the rules to be able
to get the assistance from the sheriffs. Yes we, we send
regular updates to our staff, um, debriefing them on our conversations with problem solving the sheriff's office. So they are aware. Here's what we're trying to do. Here's much more work in progress. And so
our our staff should be well aware. There are some situations where they might have more facts and details than we do. And so we'll say go ahead and email the
sheriff's office. But cc us so that we're aware of what's happening and we can track everything. So we try our best to have an organized ship. Great. And I think that's really important because, you know, um,
as many of the issues that I think you've raised, um, really
highlight the understaffing and the issues with not having sufficient deputies, you know,
in terms of not having deputies
being able to. Oh, thank you so much. Being able to be in the
civic courthouse when I was a misdemeanor. Um prosecutor, I
had several, um, uh, trials in
the courthouse. Um, and you know, as well as there's been issues also from transportation
of not having enough staff and you're also indicating to us about in-person visits and not
having enough staff. Um, so I think that that that's something I, I hope that the community and everyone here on this board really, you know, hears of just how it's impacting your clients
to not have sufficient deputies to be able to perform their
essential functions. You also
mentioned about, I think, um, commissioner afamasaga asked a question regarding the data of
what was the felonies and
misdemeanors for the 90. Um, you
indicated that you had the data
from the sheriff's office, but do you not keep your own data? Um interim. We do keep some of our own data. But in terms of the data of real time, what's
happening in our jails, that information comes to the sheriff's office. And so and it's through a partnership called the safety and justice challenge from the macarthur
foundation that, that we do have
the various criminal justice stakeholders at the table meeting regularly to try to share information because different um agencies in the
system have different data, right? Have different
information. Um, and so we try
our best to collaborate and share what information we are allowed to share. Okay. Great because I think that if you know, we have community members that want that kind of data, that might be something that you address through this already system that you've already established to obtain data.
Right? Because community members obviously want to find out what's the difference between people being in jail who are in misdemeanors and felonies, and
especially for serious violent felonies? Um, we've seen a lot of different articles, and especially now in an election
year, this issue is coming up in so many different ways about who are the people that are in jail versus who are the people that
are being let out of jail. And there are reasons for that. Um,
so. Let's see. What are the
things that you think this board should be immediate? What would you say are the priorities? And
I understand that you know, I'm putting you on the spot right? You haven't had a chance to talk
to your, uh, boss, but what
would you say as a practice owner at someone that has come
in to kind of overview relook at the system? What are the things
that you think that the pd's
office can do to have the best conversation with the sheriff and vice versa? And what
conversations do you want us to focus on first? Like, what are
your priorities? I hear you with the death, um, custody deaths,
right? Um I hear the speedy
trial issues that go into the in person, the preparation, the
transportation, the visits and
whatnot. So it would be helpful
to you because our goal is to
make sure that the sheriff is
able to do the work that they need to do, and that you are able to do the work that you need to do in providing your essential services that you do
for community. Absolutely. Um
and I don't know, I need I would need to look back at your, your
charter and your, your powers to see if this is within it. Um,
but one thing you had mentioned, short staffing. I think that's an issue across many departments. Our office certainly, as you can tell from our presentation, feel very,
very short staffed. Um, and I think when you are short staffed
and you're in this budget situation in this city where people are being asked, agencies are being asked to cut their
budget, um, and not expand, um, is to look at where are we
spending our limited staffing right now? Where are we putting people right now? And our office would posit that, um, we should prioritize staffing for when there are constitutional or
statutory mandated duties. And
that includes facilitating legal
visits and transportation to court. And that's why I've highlighted those, um, for our office. And that's what we would strongly encourage. The
sheriff's office to do. Um, you know, you're getting pulled in a million different directions
every day. Uh, and, and also
being asked to take on new work.
And I, I would say get your core
duties done first before you go
beyond that, it. I just wanted
to add this because, um, I think it's important to note here because what I'm hearing is not
under agreed and understand that
understaffing, sheriff, understaffing is a problem for everyone. I totally hear that.
But what I'm gathering from her
presentation is even from like
zoom meetings, which I don't get. I mean, unless someone can
walk me through how that is, is extra work for the sheriff's department, I need to understand
, like why that would be an issue to set up those zoom meetings and things that would
kind of help bring, um, move
things along. We we've had the same question. We've been trying
to figure that out because, um, it has been really helpful to have be able to have multiple ways of visiting our clients, including zoom visits. It's very useful. We want to keep that going. But we have been trying to sort out why it's pretty challenging. It's not that
smooth. So I actually have one
more question. Um, and then I it's more of a comment because I
have to say, I think, you know, and from my professional and past experience, I believe the san francisco courts were
already backlogged before covid.
So we were already dealing with
a really, um, dire situation in the courtrooms, both civilly but
especially in criminal courts.
And I distinctly remember giving
offers of diversion and all of those different programs and then being like, no, we're going
to trial. And I was just like,
but your client. Um, so I think
it's, I think really important, especially when it comes to misdemeanors, is also for
deputies to really, you know, public defenders to accept clients that are offers that are
fair and reasonable also. And I
think, you know, that that is
something that, you know, I felt
like there was moments when I
went to work and I was like, oh, justice was not served today. You know, and as someone who
cares passionately about justice
because I, I genuinely believe I
am of the mindset and this is my own personal belief that victims without justice are future
defendants. I have reviewed
numerous mitigation packages of defendants, and the stories that you hear are heart wrenching,
and especially in juvenile, right. When you do that work and
you're like, no child should ever have to have experienced this, right? Um, so I'm hoping
that in our position as the
board commission, we can be a support to you in making sure that you're getting the communication that you need and
the prompt responses that you
need in addressing these issues
so we can cut through a lot of sometimes the divide between
both offices and the law
enforcement to really get like, if your client needs medical
attention, let's get let's zero
in on that and be as responsive. And that's one of my goals is to ensure that the sheriff's office
is as responsive as possible. As soon as possible. And if there
is issues with response, being responsive or with the approach
is that that's the things we want to know, because our charter does require us to look
at the policies and procedures. Right. And the sheriff has just had an overhaul of their entire
policies and procedures, which I am hoping are are going to be improvements. Right. And we're going to see hopefully those improvements. So you are the ones on the ground dealing with those policies and procedures.
So we do want to make sure that there's an open line of communication. So that we can address that. Um, and, and your
comments definitely do not fall on deaf ears. And we're very happy that you're here at the
table presenting it to us. So thank you so much for your time. I appreciate that very much. And I'm glad to come back. I'm glad to bring other members of our staff to provide regular updates and also have an open line of communication and regular meetings with inspector general
wiley. We're happy to do that. And we are, you know, this board
is came out of some of our work.
So we really want to support you all in being as effective as possible. So we appreciate your service. My $0.02 in here and I
am time sensitive. And we are going to work on charter amendments today as we speak.
Um, so I also and you, you've known me for a long time. So I am very much about community in a multi-pronged approach. Worked with patty lee on human
trafficking issues. Um, so, so one of the very effective
approaches we've had is a multi-pronged approach with all the stakeholders at the table. So on the commission, on the
status of women, we had the family justice council, uh,
family violence council. So that
actually stemmed domestic
violence homicides to zero, uh, for a period of almost four years. So that meant we had public defender represented da
victim services, um, adult
probation and the courts all
present at the table. We met, you know, once a week. I mean,
I'm sorry, once a month. And so I think sometimes the small things addressing things, um, in
a very methodical way, actually stems bigger problems. And so
when people think, and I don't love meetings, so I like to be really efficient. And so, um, people who know me template s I love templates. So if there is a
particular issue, um, that can be addressed, a particular person. So people don't have to fish. I mean, it's so difficult for the public. I work as a public sector attorney, and so I'm very conscientious. When someone reaches me in person, I
know how many channels they had to go through where they didn't get an answer, they get didn't get their problem resolved. So I'm hoping that we can streamline and make sure. I mean, it's great that we have, um, terry wiley as our inspector general because he is very hands on, um, getting the problem solved. And so I'm hoping that, you know, when you can bring
issues to us and we are, you know, we're very fortunate that
our, our sheriff welcomes
oversight and welcomes issues brought to his attention and I always tell people, you know,
the public, we rely on you, too, because we can't be eyes and ears all over. So we expect people to bring problems to us so that we can resolve them. I wanted to go sort of specifically into the pretrial
detention. Um, so the great our numbers are actually really, I think, from the tenderloin area
with that multi task force. Um, and that also puts a strain on
our deputies because we haven't grown our staff. But the
incarceration rate is 50% that
the, the population is 50%
higher. So that puts an extra strain. Um the maximum hours
that a debit can work is 16 hours. So imagine that you can't plan your life because deputy,
when you're in your locker room and someone says, sorry, we got to call you back to duty so you
can't even plan a life. There's no quality of life. Even for our deputies. And when other jurisdictions can maybe offer more money, the housing costs are lower. We are actually
continuing to lose staff and not only to retirement, but, you know, really younger deputies
who want to have families and a
more stable life. So you know, we're we do the balance. And
when I look at the entire justice system, I'm looking at the families, the individuals affected by the criminal justice
system, but also the quality of
life for those working with our
sheriff's office. So I hope that
everybody kind of brings in that perspective because it's all a
whole continuum and a balance. So I also wanted to ask you about the impact of the elimination, essentially of the bail system in san francisco. If that's had an impact, too, in
the increased incarcerated population. That's a great
question. Um, I don't think that that's been the most significant driver. It's been a big change. Um, for our office and our clients. But I feel like that that's not the main thing that comes up. We're talking about why there's been an increase in
jail numbers. It's really this,
um, increase in law enforcement
in the tenderloin. It's been the reduction in diversion. And going back to your comments,
commissioner, I am a, uh, very
committed to restorative justice . And that's been some of my work in this office is trying to revive that program because it
has been shut down and so finding basically more ways to
allow people to leave the jail in a safe way with services is
been a big priority. That will help reduce jail numbers and reduce the workload on the
sheriff's staff and on our
office. And that's why that's
part of why I elevated the issue of legal visits and transportation to court, because when those things don't happen,
um, you can't your court case is on pause. And that can prolong someone's detention. So I'm looking at both sides. So
victims want their cases to go
forward to. Exactly. And so I've
heard from victims to is, you know, oh, you know, my case was continued because is the
defendant refused to get on the
bus for transportation. So and while there's a right to speedy
trial, I don't know if short of a judge's order, I don't think we can compel someone in custody
to get on that bus and get into the courtroom. That's a great point. What are the solutions? Or do you think that we. That's
what I want to untangle because what we want our clients to go to court, we have every incentive to encourage them to
go to court and in many of these situations, our clients have
said, I wanted to go to court
that day, but the sheriff did not transport me. And so we have lifted up those cases, just investigate and see what happened here, because it's
about preventing from happening again. Can we identify can we
problem solve and also kind of target. Is there a reoccurring pattern in with certain
individuals. So we're in the midst of figuring that out. And my understanding is there is a log that's kept when there's a refusal and we're asking to go
back through that log and do do a spot check, see what's happening here. I think it would
be possible and actually didn't
want to talk. That's right. We want to untangle that. We want to understand what happened there, on whose end it was. But
our office, we're clear. We want our clients to go to court and so we're trying to figure out
the log jam and like, uh, sort
of mandate, um, you know, due to
the short staffing, um, you know , it's kind of hard sometimes to
arrange that legal visit, do the safety and security concerns
correct? That's right. And so that is why it is about
priorities. You know, you you
have a certain number of staff. It's never enough. And so where do you, um, where do you have your staff focus on. What do you prioritize? Have them
prioritize. And so for us, you know, what we're asking is to prioritize those legal visits
because it does help reducing the number of people in our jails. So it allows them to build a process. Their criminal
case. Also, I think, um, another priority could be staffing. Like focus on staffing. The sheriff's department and getting resources and support for the sheriff's
office to get more staffing to, you know, arrange those legal visits. Well, we have our hands full with our 50 million budget.
That's one six of the sheriff's office. So and our massive
caseload. So at the same for us to be transparent, that's our priority. We need to address
that. Um and but we hear you about and we are well aware
we've heard from the sheriff's office about short staffing. Right. So I had a few other
things to just raise. Um, in
terms of the drug withdrawal.
So, um, I don't know if you tuned into last month at all, but when we had our community partners here and we had cedric
akbar, um, we do have people who
have been through the criminal justice system who have had
substance abuse issues and are now, um, counselors. I think, you know, these lived
experiences make them much more credible in terms of how to turn
people's lives around. So, um, I
hear from some of people like, like cedric, who say, you know,
the people who are supposedly running the organizations are
not following what would be successful. And so how do you
how would we approach listening to people who have actually successful lived through the experiences, who are now
counselors to have people who are higher up actually listen and try to get people successfully into reentry? I
mean, that is our whole reason for being here to make sure
people have the resources while
they're incarcerated to become successful in reentry. And then the supportive services upon reentry. So there's a lower recidivism rate. Absolutely.
Great question. Um, and I have that war on drugs press briefing
that I linked to here, in case
it's helpful to kind of dive deeper. And we do have a number of experts who have spent decades in this area, um, speaking at that press briefing to explain the approaches. But what I learned from that press briefing is that it's not a either or in terms of the types
of programs. Um, there are, I
believe, um, cedric might be one of these individuals. I'm not sure, um, that are advocating for abstinence based programs
which have their place and abstinence based program and for some people, that works really well. And that's actually what they need for other people, it
might be something on the kind of a different part of the continuum or the range where it's harm reduction, it's reducing substance use, doing it
in a safer way. Um, with ways of addressing overdoses. Um, it
might be in that they might be at that in that part of their life. Um, and so we in our office, we advocate for the full
range. We want services to be culturally competent, language
accessible. And whether it be
abstinence or something along the continuum of harm reduction,
we support all of that. We just want to make sure people get the services they need when they're ready to receive it. And we also
find that when it's a voluntary, um, situation, people are more
likely to participate and to participate. Long terme. So we
want to also get people in a place where they can voluntarily receive the services to. And I think sheriff miyamoto has been very much sort of the carrot
person in terms of, you know, extra visits from family. What
pre-covid? Um, and this in particular, I know on the, uh, for the domestic violence, um,
those who are incarcerated for domestic violence, having to go
through the annual or that year long treatment and classes. So I
believe in offering the services and having some enticement to make sure people are successful.
So going back, though, um, one
one thing very near and dear to my heart, and because it's in my neighborhood, is the youth guidance center and I wish that and I'm going to just say it out to our leaders before you do
something. I'd like people to have a vision rather than be reactionary or, you know, have some kind of populist soundbite
in the news. I'd like to see the youth guidance center as a
center for kids. I mean, we talk about shutting it down. Well, what are the alternatives? Um, you know, it's a prime piece of land, twin peaks. I'd like it to be a safe space for kids to go
after school, to study, to have a safe, to have a nutritious meal, some kids never see another meal once they leave school or, you know, they or
they're unhoused. So that is my
goal. And I know there are a lot of people in the neighborhood, um, lifelong san franciscans, multi-generational. They want to volunteer, and it's centrally
located. I mean, it's a prime
spot and, you know, um, you know , you know, the bus lines that go there. So it's very accessible to everyone. Um, can
we get some kind of momentum to look at that? Because when I heard that it was going to close, it was shocking to me
because some some of the youth that are housed there, they lose
their support system. It's not healthy to put someone,
especially, um, a young person
whose first taste of this justice system is left there and they don't have their support system. You move them out of
county. Um, for those who who don't have cars or transportation to visit their loved one, that just makes
pushes them farther, deeper into the criminal justice system. I
cosign everything you just said. Our office, patty lee, who's amazing and heads our defense
wing of our work. Um uh, was our
managing attorney for our youth defender unit for 30 years and has been with the office for 46 years. Um, she's been deeply
involved in the effort to not just close juvenile hall, but build exactly what you're describing, a place that's community centered, that's
provide services to young people . And for those who have to be detained temporarily for whatever reason, a more home like environment. And so we are
working on that. There was quite a bit of press and community attention on it a few years ago.
The attention has gone away and so we would love to work with you to bring more attention to this issue and revive it, because it requires a lot of people to make this dramatic transformation. I have a quick
follow up question. Um, so my
experience as a prosecutor was, you know, a couple of years ago, not that long, but it was a different, you know, I started at a different time. Um, different completely different prosecutors as well, with
different policies. Um, so one of the questions I have for you
is what is the training that you have for your misdemeanor public defenders for trials that
doesn't require them to pick up
many trials? So for example, my
experience many times was that I
need to I was told my managers, I'm not getting enough trials. I need to take this out to trial. This has to go to trial. Um rather than really focusing from
my perspective on what MAY be the defendant's needs were of maybe they don't want to get a trial. I've had that experience, regrettably, in court, where I've had defendants say, I want to take the plea, and their public defender grabbed them and say, no, wait, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And it's been a mess
. And I'm hoping that the defendants with misdemeanors
lives are not just used as training grounds for public defenders or for prosecutors.
You know, because it's not about
just training. Um the da's and
the and the public defenders.
It's about reaching justice. You
know, and that to me, justice is , you know, thinking about both sides. You know, the defendant
has their rights and so do the victims have their rights. So I'm hoping to say this to
express my own past frustration. And I think frustration from
other individuals of, of, you
know, having defense rights be the training ground for, you
know, work because I, I don't think that's ethical personally.
And that's just based on my experience and that's not every
experience. I can say I've had very positive experience. I feel like justice has been served in
situations, but there is a
culture of training, you know,
um, attorneys. But it impacting
the defendants and the victims
lives. And I think that hopefully that's not something that is continuing, because that's something I saw readily. Yeah. Thank you for asking about that. And you can see from the mission that I shared at the beginning of the presentation, it is about client centered,
holistic representation and
trying to get people out of the
system, period. So that they can
be with their families and live a good life with many opportunities. And so that's the
goal, not trials, a trial, if
it's appropriate in the case, because there's evidence that supports the need for a trial.
Um, so that certainly we are
proud of our trial skills. Um,
but we that's we, we kind of see that in perspective live in
terms of trainings. This office does a lot of trainings of we have trainings almost every wednesday on every topic under the sun, um, including many
topics not about trials. So it's been it's been great to see and I've helped to organize some of those trainings. Also for example, I didn't highlight our immigration unit. We have an amazing immigration unit, um,
that helps people in terms of fighting their deportation. And they will often give trainings
about immigration considerations that impact a criminal case. That's actually a requirement
that people think about what the immigration consequences might
be of a plea or a certain outcome in a case. So we plenty
plenty of trainings and it's ongoing at all times. Great to hear. Well, thank you so much, angela. I'm just conscientious about the time and we will
invite you back. But I expect that you're going to have more dialog and meeting with us and our inspector general. Thank you very much for having me here.
Thank you. Thank you. Uh, do we
have any public comments for members of the public who would
like to make public comment on line item three? San francisco public defender's office presentation. Please approach
the podium when it is free. Appears to be no public comment.
Okay, next agenda item, please.
calling on item four. San francisco sheriff's office presentation informational item. Lisette adams, chief deputy, will present on sfsu's custody
division. Well good afternoon.
Good afternoon. Lisette adams, chief deputy of san francisco sheriff's office custody
division. Thank you for having
me. We have a presentation. I'm happy to start with that. I'm
happy to start with questions entirely up to you which way you'd like to go. Well we'll go with the presentation. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Let's stop
the presentation. Um, I am here
to present on the custody vision of the san francisco sheriff's
department. Next slide, please.
I just want to start out with
the core principles and core values of the sheriff's department that sheriff miyamoto has instilled upon us and past sheriffs before him. And that service, professionalism and
pride. We make sure to keep
reminding ourselves of that
every day as as public defenders office has shown, it's a challenging job as the conversations that we've had,
it's challenging on both sides, on all sides. So we make sure to keep reminding ourselves
throughout the challenges that that's what it's about service,
professionalism and pride in the service and professionalism that
we provide. Next slide please.
So in the custody division we've
have a lot of things going a lot
of things at once. Just keeping
the balls up in the air is what really the main focus of my day is every day. So I'd just like to talk a little bit about the division projects that we have going or have completed in the
last year. The first one was the
tablets, um, as was discussed previously, community members, community groups, work with the sheriff's office to get free tablets to the incarcerated
population on on those tablets, they are able to access all of material on their the tablet
automatically translates it into the language of choice of the
individuals. We also use it for educational programs and
processes, and for some
entertainment video visitation. We did this in response to
covid. When covid hit, we start shutting down the jails as was
required by the city and county of san francisco and the health officer. And in response to that, to keep people connected to their community and connected to their family. We brought up video visitation. So that people, even though they couldn't have their loved ones, come in and see them, we'll be able to still see them through the video visitations, not
ideal, but as those of us who survived covid, we know that's how we kept in contact with a lot of people. What the sheriff's department did, though , in addition, is we've kept
that video visitation going even after covid. And as we brought up in-person visiting. So we
have both going at the same time. That also applies to our legal visits, our legal visits entirely before covid was in
person, when covid hit, while we
did have some in person, um,
legal visits, a lot of it, both at the request of the health
officer, the public defender, and the deputized staff and the incarcerated population, we went to video visitation for legal visits. Also, we continue to do
that. Um, since it was one of the issues that was raised. I'd like to just talk about one of the challenges of video
visitation in terms of both the community and legal. Our jails
were not built for it. Our jails
are surrounded by concrete and steel, and all of the things
that have to be in place to keep
the facility safe and strong,
and that's not the best conduit
for wi-fi. So when you say, why are we having, um, the
challenges in terms of audio,
audio and video, it's the physical structure that we have
that we work with. Um, we have
been working to try to put an additional wi-fi, additional lines through that requires money and that requires time. But the sheriff is committed to do it. And we have been doing it as we've gone along to try to
keep improving the quality of the services that we provide through the video visits. But it
is challenging just based on for
anyone who's been to the hall of
justice. All of our jails were pretty much built like that. You
know how solid those walls are, how they're built, and our jails was built that way too. So we continue to try to work on that.
We've increased program hours. No, we are nowhere near program
hours where we were prior to
covid. Um, not a lot of people want to come to the jails. That's always been the case. We
lost a lot of our providers when
we shut down during covid, and getting them back to readjust
their life and readjust, but the
ability to come into the jail
has been challenging ali riker has been phenomenal in trying to make sure that we get as many people back in providing
services as possible, but it is
a challenge. It is one we are working to overcome and we will work to overcome. I'm not sure if we can ever have enough program hours, but we are
working on it. Facility upgrades and hardening of the jails. We
tend to build our jails and walk away. It's not something that
people, um, like to think about
spending money in, but it is a
building that takes, um, wear
and tear, wear and tear. It does
so over time. If we don't keep the facilities up, they start
deteriorating. It makes it dangerous for the incarcerated population. It makes it dangerous for the staff, and it
makes it harder to keep the things going. Like we talked
about the wi-fi. It's not just hardening, but it's improving. The facility. And we're
rehabbing our facilities while
we're in there. So just take a
moment of thinking about doing
construction work on your house while you're living there.
That's what we go through every day because we still have to keep the buildings up. We still have to keep them going. The more we do without doing that,
when we actually have to do the work, it's a lot harder and it's a lot more money and a lot more
intensive. Um, so as we get
money in, we're going over
deferred maintenance and, and
reconstruction and it's tough. But a challenge that the sheriff is committed to do, um, improve
staff spaces. We all talk about
wellness. We talk about we realized under covid just how
much wear and tear, not only on the incarcerated but on our
staff. 16 hour days, at least
two times a week is what our staff are doing, and most of
them are doing 3 or 4 days because they don't like walking away, knowing they're leaving their staff member, um, staff
member for, um, significantly under and the facility unsafe.
So our people are not only doing the mandatory and it is
mandatory at this point. Six,
two, 16 hour days. They're doing more to keep the facilities up and running and to safeguard the incarcerated population and
their partners as staff
development sheriff miyamoto is
a true believer in training,
training responds or helps with some of the issues that were
raised here about how do we make
sure that our staff are adept at seeing what's happening? Um,
recognizing changes in
behavioral health and
psychiatric issues that comes from staff development and, and keep our staff going and keep them up to date on the best
practices as new technology and finding out best things that are happening in the community. So that goes to the staff
development, reduction of asset population. That's
administrative separation. We
put people or people are placed in administrative separation for the safety and security of the
facility, largely. And sometimes
for their own safety. We are doing everything we can in our
power to reduce that population,
to reduce that isolation. We have gone through, and working with a number of community partners, both within san
francisco and also national. We're working with chicago
beyond, and one of the focuses
is reduce the isolation of being in jail and administrative separation is a greater
isolation than just normally
being in jail, because you're not in the general population with everybody else. So we're
working working on reducing that population, and we're doing that
through programs, through jail,
behavioral health. And just
honestly, deputies talking one on one and saying, how can I help? How can I keep you out of
here? How can I keep you in general population and going
forward, increasing automation?
Uh, we are trying to those who have worked in san francisco
know as close as we are to silicon valley, we are still
incredibly behind in using the technology. The more technology
we use, the hopefully the more
we can use our staff members to
do what we like to do, which is the one on one, and dealing with people directly instead of dealing with the numbers and keeping track of things that
hopefully automation can do
better for them, for us, for me, phone calls and no, no
surcharge, commissary, that was already talked about in the public defender's conversations. So I'll just leave it there as
those are projects that the division also worked on.
Challenges. We've heard it here
staffing, staffing and staffing. We can talk all day about staffing, but it's also the resources beyond staffing. We
talked about, um, the tablets
wear and tear. We put out
tablets and we're pretty much replacing our tablets at least
once a month or every two months. Um, incarcerated population, not all of them
appreciate some of the message that comes through the tablets and have to take it out on somewhere, and those tablets are one of them. So we have to keep
replacing some of the technology that we have there. Uh, we talked about rebuilding the jail while we're still existing in
it. Um improving occupied spaces , same thing. Project management , uh, big thing as we have projects keeping track of
projects, we in my division alone, we've got about 15, 20 projects going and so you times that by every division. And the sheriff's having his own
projects and individual units and facilities having their
projects, just keeping track of those projects and keeping them on track is very time consuming,
consuming culture shifts. Um, we
had one under covid. We having
one as we come out of covid. We have them as we keep up with the
expectations of society, we um,
let's be honest when before covid, there was a shift to no
jails, um, let's start shutting
down. Let's move people out. There's another shift going on in the community. We, the sheriff's department, has to
respond and to what's happening,
whether it's the courts that go
through no bail for, um, not
making people go to court, more
arrest while the sheriff's
department is part of the system , a lot of things that are happening around us are not things that the sheriff's department is instituting it,
but we are we're it falls back on. So we're going through that
shift and dealing with that. As
the community changes, change in
custodial population. There was a time when I first started
there were misdemeanors in jail.
We had a population where 40 to
50% were misdemeanors in for
drug use. And, you know, they would dry out, they would get
out of custody. What we largely
have in jail are people who are
in jail for violence and serious
charges. Um, the population of that was incarcerated when I
came in is not a population that
we have now. So we have to
change not only our practices, but our training and our developing our staff to respond to the kind of population that we currently have. Competing priorities, as everyone knows
it. Um there, there. And we continue to meet those challenges. Court mandated activities outside air project
um also covered by the public defender's office and mandatory
lights out. Um, we are
responding to, uh, things that we've done for years, practices
and as we go through and times change, expectations change. Our jails are not new jails. Our
jails were built 20, 30, 40 years ago. In some cases. And so those jails are not always built for the expectations that
society has. Uh, sheriff's
office does not disagree with those expectations. Largely but
we do have to do them within the existing facilities that we have. And the resources that we
have. So we continue to, uh, trying to adjust to meet those
challenges. Next slide please.
Um, this is just a chart of the
people that are the command staff within the division I. As the chief deputy, I have a
couple of administration people
that work with me. We have three
captains, um, our classified
unit, central warrants unit, and
our hospital ward 77 zero. Next
slide. We'll talk a little bit about what each one of them does. And a couple of slides
ahead. As we said um, staffing
has come up. Staffing has been
an issue. If you look at these
slides you can see our hires are not meeting our separations. The last time that happened when our hires met, our our separations
was fiscal year 1819. So since
then we have generally had more separations than we've had hires
in the last six months. That
tide has turned. We've gotten a
few more people than we have
people leaving the unfortunate
part is, is that we tend to hire
in spurts. When I came in back in 92, 93, the sheriff's
department went, um, pretty much
doubled, had their size in,
alas, in about 4 or 5 years from that period. And that was largely due to consent decrees from the court. Well, that generation in my generation are
retiring. Um, so we're losing
over the last 5 to 6 years, that 3 or 400 that came together,
that's the 3 or 400 leaving together. Um, right before covid, we had a spurt in hiring.
And you can project in about 15,
20 years. That group is going to
leave in mass. Also so, um, so
when we do not do continuous hiring, when we have to resort
to bulk hiring to make up for past years, whether it be because of budgets or hiring or
that other agencies are
providing longevity or retention
or hiring bonuses that currently
are department is unable to provide because of budgeting.
When we do that, we hire in mass. We lose them in mass, and that hurts the continuity of the department and the services that
we can provide. Next slide
please. County jail one is our intake facility. Is located at
425 seventh street. Um, the facility commander is captain
bill kelleher. It's a type one facility. And basically what it basically what a type one facility means. It is largely
due for people who are initially arrested or who are being transferred or are released to
another facility under a type one facility. Be you cannot be
at a type one facility longer
than 24 hours based on title 15
mandates. Uh, basically, it's
not meant to be a place that you sleep. We don't have beds there. We don't have all of the things that we have in our housing facility. It is just there for the initial arrestees or
transfers. As you can see, we're while we're authorized, 83
people, currently there are 54 sworn there. Uh, next slide
please. This slide just talks a
little bit about the average incarcerated population. But what it does do if you look over to the right and writing it talks about some of the things
that are done at that facility and the services provided. When you first come into our county
jail, as soon as you are escorted through the door, right
in front of you is a chair, and that's the chair for triage. That's your first, first encounter with our jail health
services. They take an initial
assessment of you to make a determination whether or not you
can safely come into this jail, even if it's for an hour or two
hours. They take a basic mental, a basic physical and mental
health assessment of you before you go on with the booking
process. In addition to jail health services, you will see
jail health services a minimum
of twice you do your initial assessment. There if you're going to stay, you are then seen
by jail health services. Again, um, you went from triage. Now
you're at the assessment. At the
assessment, they take a much larger in-depth conversation with you and history of your medical process and the things that you have going and the good thing is being in san francisco, unlike other counties who
contract out to for profits, um,
who MAY or MAY not provide the best of service, we have the department of public health that work with us. So they're every information that they're getting
from the custody. Um, they're also able to double check it.
And if that person has been part of going to either zuckerberg, san francisco general hospital
or any of the df's clinics, that medical record is there and available to them. So they can
tie it all together. So so and that goes also when they're released, it's not just when you
come in. We also provide you any
medication that you need. I think for the next 48 or 72
hours to get you to the point where you can go see your own health care provider, um, get you over to the clinics. We have referrals to other clinics
outside. Died while you're in
custody. The dph will provide the ivan to come by. So you can
have your eyes screened. Get glasses if needed. They also
have doctors from ucsf and san francisco general hospital come and provide clinics for just about every well-being that
there is. And every medical
specialty. If we do not provide it at the jail, then we transport you to san francisco general hospital, provide care and we'll talk a little bit about that when we talk about the jail ward. If you seem to be having some kind of mental issues, either because of your incarcerated or a history of it, we also have jail behavioral health services at county jail.
One, they will also speak to you. See, you. They'll check your history, see if there's any
record of that, but also assess where you are right then and there. They're was some
discussion about detox. Um, are people going through detox? Our
detox is right across from our medical station so that the
nurses can see and keep an eye on the person in detox. And both
by our policies and title 15, anybody that has placed in detox
is seen by a minimum of twice an hour by the custody staff and
twice an hour by the medical
staff. So anybody who is going through detox is seen at least
four, four times an hour to make sure their well-being and that they're provided the care that's necessary. And that includes
being provided detox medications that are prescription medications for detox. I do not
believe they provide that immediately. Okay um, I don't
think that that level of detox
kicks in immediately. Requiring that medication. But what we
have done is we've made them made arrangements with the
department of public health or jail health services to make sure that anybody going through
detox does not stay as much as
possible. You know, again, not a
system that's perfect. We I fully acknowledge that. But as
much as possible once that those those people are identified, we try to push them through the
process as soon as possible and get them upstairs to county jail
two, where we have a nurse that goes around every hour checking on people who are in detox. They definitely provide the
medication in there. We'll have them there for 48 to 72 hours, and that's definitely where the
medication starts getting
provided. Most of the people who initially come in and are at
county jail one are still under
the influence, so that's not the time to start providing medication for them. But we do
make sure that they go into to
an area where we keep all of our
detox blood pressure, temperature and vitals are checked once they get upstairs
and on detox, I believe it's every 2 to 3 hours. Um, so we make sure that the detox is are provided. The care that's necessary. We have the or project and pretrial to determine if they should be released. Also going through the buffing the buffing process
where they check and see if the judge will release them on their own cognizance, and response to
the no no bail. Um, but for the custodial staff, perhaps the most important thing they do outside of the jail health
services classification and our classification are run by our sworn staff. Our classification
sits down. They run the individual's history. They have
conversations with them. Has have you been in jail before or have you been in this jail
before or, um, have you suffered any trauma in your life? Have
you had any abuse issues? Do you
have a drug issue? Do you need a
special food? Do we cover the same things that medical covers but not, you know, in terms of
is there a medication that you need that you haven't told anybody about? Um are you at
danger for anybody else? Do you
need to contact anybody and take
a history of them to make sure that we house people appropriately and safely? Um, the safety of the custody is are
most important, but housing someone incorrectly could make it unsafe. Not only for them, but for the staff that are
required to take care of them. Uh, the person gets booked into custody. We talked about the
sobering cells. We have special cells down at county jail, one that are mandated by title 15, that we put people in who are
under the influence and under unable to care for themselves. We talked about jail, health
screening and we also take dna
collection to go to the justice portion. There are certain
charges that require or mandated
to have dna collection done that
is done to see if there's any cold cases or anything going forward in terms of that person
in. Fingerprinting uh, picture
taking. And we talked about the jail medical interview and
assessment next slide please. In custodial in the custody division, we also have the central records and warrants in
terms of people in custody, these are the immediate liaisons
with the courts. Uh, they run the warrants. It is run by
lieutenant mark conti. Um, so housed in 850. Bryant for now,
until we determine what's going
on with that building. Uh, next
slide, please. So in terms of
incarceration, they maintain all of the incarcerated persons
booking and records information
on commitments, release
calculations. They received the
court minutes and translate the court minutes into best practices. And what needs to be
done. Uh, they process the bail,
they process all release as. But in addition, in our central records and warrant unit. And
what is taking up right now, I
think dividing probably I'd say
about 20 or 30% of our focus.
And this is fairly new in this terms of units is the public
records request. We get a lot of public release records request. Uh, people are very interested in what's going on.
Documentation that's a unit that
we're again standing up on our
feet and trying to get it up and running and trying to get the
resources there. It is. As you can imagine, critically
important to for transparency sake, to be able to provide the information that people request
and also mandated by law. Next
slide please. County jail two is also housed at 425 seventh street. That building has two jails, one on the first floor, which is, uh, county jail, one
at and the second, third, fourth
and fifth floor is county jail,
two. County jail two is a type two facility. Uh, basically type two facility means in terms of
title 15, we have both of arranged, prearranged and sentence. Everybody can go to
this facility. Other than our type one facility. All of our jail facilities are like that. Type two, which is a mix. Next
slide please. At county jail
two, uh, our how will we help people that we housed there? First and foremost, that is the
only location that we hire our female that we house our female population. So all females
arrested in san francisco and incarcerated are housed at county jail number two, a pod.
We have have, uh, transgender
and we have some of our s and y,
which generally are our dropouts
from gangs and people that can't
go to general population but do
not arise to the level of needing to be an administrative
separation person in c pod, we
have on the lower level, we have
our medical wing, where people who have medical needs are
housed and the upper level is
our psychiatric. We have our psychiatric sheltered living
unit for our female incarcerated
population and on the other
side, we have of our, uh,
observation, which basically is
the psychiatric unit, one step
below, having to go to ps or seven zero. These are people with severe psychiatric issues or psychiatric staff are there
about ten hours out of the day,
10 to 12 hours at and they are there to provide services to
them, check on them and make
sure they continue. To de pod is where our kitchen workers are and we have some general population custodies there. E
pod is a little bit of
everything, uh, all male, but we
have administrative separation. We have administrative
separation on the upper level, on the lower level, we have general population open and
frank pod is our intake and our
administrative separation. So when they first come up from
county jail, one, generally
they'll go to frank pod for our
intake for 72 hours. That way they can be assessed further by classification an observed to make sure they have no other
issues. And also medical staff
is within that pod. So if they
have any medical issues they're they're able to respond. And then from there, after about 48
or 72 hours, we moved them on to other locations. After both medical and custodial staff has
had an an opportunity to observe them and make sure that we have
them in the right place and they're getting the things need
that they need. Uh, we have a
kitchen in there that was recently remodeled and opened. We used to we were using the 850
bryant kitchen, and when we shut
down county jail for we were a couple about a year or two. We used the 850 bryant kitchen. And
then for about a year again
remodeling as we're living in we totally gutted the kitchen in
county jail two and rebuilt it.
And during that time we were funneling the food in from
county jail three by van. So we now have that kitchen up and
running. Um, totally remodeled
and again remodeled while the jail was open. Uh, they actually
cut a wall, cut a hole in the wall on the third floor inside,
and sort of had a elevator built
on the outside to funnel the equipment. And the people up to
the kitchen. Um, so again,
renovating while you're living
in a place is not ideal. County jail two we also have parent
child visits. Uh, we have, and I apologize for not having a
picture of it because it's, uh, excellent picture. I hope you have seen it before. But but we
have a child visiting room that
is a standalone phone room. Um
painted with bumblebees and
honey combs and child friendly
equipment and child sized
furniture. And there they have contact visits with their family
members and the family members bring them to the jail. They're escorted upstairs by our
nonprofits and volunteers, and they're able to engage directly
with their family members, their
children for about an hour once
a week. And then we have
in-person visiting, um,
historically, we had visiting
saturday, sunday and holidays, visiting were all during the
daytime time, pretty much from 8:00 in the morning till 2:00 in the afternoon. And that was saturday, sunday and holidays after covid hit. And when we
brought visiting back up, I decided to address what I believed was an issue that should have been addressed a
long time ago and that not everybody has weekends off, not
everybody's daytime hours are
available. I know to the extent
that I finally have weekends off in this capacity, I've had it
since I've been a captain, but for years I worked. I worked
weekends, and now on weekends
I'm probably sitting at a little league or peewee soccer or
football thing. Um, so having to
choose between engaging with your kids and their activities
and going to see a loved one in jail and only having just this
time period seemed unfair. So when we brought back up
visiting, uh, we decided to not only bring back up visiting, but
expand it to the weekday hours.
But again, limited resources. We have one visiting room at county
jail, two um, to use throughout
the population. So what we did
was tuesdays and thursdays, we
alternate between different pods
to allow visiting to take place. It's not contact, it is through
a screen, but that way it's now in the late afternoon, early
evening so people can go after
work. They can bring their kids
to visiting after school and it gives them another opportunity
based on their lifestyle, to be
able to change on wednesdays. We
save that for our, our, our, our inmate population who work for
us. So we have workers who work in the kitchen or help clean the
facility. Um, as an additional
perk for that, we said we're
going to set a visiting for you. And while generally visiting is
30 minutes a day, 30 minutes per
visit for, um, inmate workers,
we put it up to 45 minutes. Next
slide please. Zuckerberg uh,
sfgate. 77 zero. Uh, run by
sergeant john malaspina. Next
slide please. So 77 zero on the
seven l side. We uh, house our critically psychiatric, our critical psychiatric
incarcerated persons. Um, these are people who, at that time
cannot make it in the jails.
they're sent to seven l to get
assistance from the psych staff. Their medication. If it's warranted and appropriate, and to get them stabilized to be
able to manage in jail and in a
jail setting. They're also responsible for managing the security or assisting with the
deputized staff who go out there. One of the things we do,
a lot of is, um, particularly down at county jail two, because that's our initial intake, is spend time at the hospital with people who come in. Unfortunately the incarcerated
population are not always the healthiest, particularly when
they first come into jail. Um, as was pointed out, they're
going through detox and the
drugs that are out there now,
uh, we're before detox was easily managed in the jail.
We're having more and more where people are coming in. And just
based on the drugs they're going through, they go out to the hospital for a detox related issue. And sometimes they're out there for five, six days. And
that's five, six days of a
deputized staff having to be
there 24 over seven. Um, provide security for them and for the hospital because they are still in custody. What's over the thoughts are whether they not should or should not be once
they are incarcerated. Our job
is to provide the security so we're there 24 over seven. And I
can tell you last week, arc
county jail two had one person, uh, two people at peace with which is the psychiatric
emergency, which is a mix of everybody brings someone to
psychiatric emergency, just as it says it's people who end psychiat sick emergency
psychiatric distress. We had two
people down there. We had two
off wards at our high point. We had two people in ps, three
people on an off ward, which
means they were put on a ward at
the hospital, and we had two mhz, which is basically someone sitting in the emergency room.
So out of one jail we had five people or five custodies outage
out to the hospital and one of those custodies was an mre for which for us means is a two
deputy escort. So that took six
deputies out of the jail and
that ran for a good 2 or 3 days
before we got any relief that
six deputies for three shifts, 24 hours a day for three days,
that hurt. So when we talk about
the short staffing, even though
you can look at our numbers and say, yeah, they're short, it's also response to the things that
are required to do, and we are required to do at a moment's
notice. Um, county jail two they
went out during the night. Team
I believe we had in 119, which
goes from 1900 to, I'm sorry, 7
P.M. To 7 A.M. They had three
hospital runs that night. Team
came in three deputies below,
minimum three hospital runs that took them six below minimum. And they had to make do with the staff. They had then and there and make the adjustments. So in
terms of legal visits, and while this was a night team, the same thing can happen on a day team in terms of legal visits, zoom visits, whatever the visits are,
we don't cancel. And I have written stated that to my staff.
We see legal visits can not be canceled. We're absolutely right. They have a
constitutional right to it. That doesn't mean that we can do it right away and that's what I get from our staff, is I'll get the complaint. They'll talk to pls,
I will go down and talk to the captain, talk to the staff member, find out what happened and they'll give us this is what happened this day. We had three hospital runs. There was a
fight. Um we were having a worker doing some painting in this room over there required us record, required a deputy escort
and. And they had to wait for 45
minutes, and then they left. So, chief adams, I'm looking at the clock. Could we wrap up in two minutes? I you know, absolutely. Back at a future date when there's other issues. Um that you can present with us? Absolutely. Can we go to the slide that talks about the
annex, please? That slide right
there in response to surge in a
population and absolutely. Ah, I , I took over this position in
FEBRUARY of 2023. The jail population has increased 45%
since I've been there. Um, so in one year we've gone up about 45% in our jail population. And in response to that, we've had to reopen in, um, a couple of dorms
of the annex. Next slide please.
We talked about classified
session. So let's slip skip over the next two slides, please. And let's just go to the jail
population. This is just a tracking that we've done on where the jail population has
gone, where it started back in 2023 of JANUARY 3rd. And just where it's gone today. Uh, the numbers on the slide can tell you this month our average
population or. Excuse me, not this month since this month has just started, but our average
population of JANUARY was is
1152 5% change in one month. And
had a 44% change from last year.
And where it comes from is our
bookings, our bookings have gone
up 16. Um but in in relation our releases have also gone on. Um,
some people are staying more, but we are getting a lot more people coming to our custody.
Next slide please. And this just
provides a breakdown of our jail
population in. And considering
the time I'll, I'll close there. Next thing is just more
classification information. Um so I'll open it up for questions
if anyone has any for me. Thank you. Um, I don't know if you want to hold questions, or we could submit them through chief
ju, and then, um, have chief
adams answer them. Just in the interest of time to get to our charter. Yeah, that's fine with
me. I did want to just bring up. I had previously asked for data.
Um, and I'm not sure if you were. This was conveyed to you, but specifically, one of my questions was regarding the tablets. This is what are the
expectation of privacy that the
defendants have on those tablets ? Because there's going to be
metadata and access to that. I know that there's the recorded
line that there's the preface of saying, hey, you're being recorded, right? And it's everything you say can be used, you know, um, so I think that would be helpful to, to learn
what that was. Um, at a, at a different point. Great. Quick
answer is none. No. Okay. Yeah we'll get more information of
what's provided. But um, right
now there's none. Okay. Um, I just had one quick question as well too. I mean, outside of the biggest elephant in the room, when we talk about the staffing
and resources and the money for it just what would be some
suggestions that you can think
of that would help with
staffing, just in terms of you talked a little bit about, you know, having groups that are coming in like what are some strategies or some things that we might be able to do or that folks aren't thinking about and should be thinking about because it's the same thing with the police department. Right? Just quick, you know, one, 1 or 2 things. Um definitely our recruitment. We need money on
our recruitment. Um maybe stop going in the same pool of
everyone else. Um california's pulling people in every direction. We might have to go
outside of the state. A lot of departments go to other areas
where, let's be honest, the money that we provide in cal fornia seems large compared to what they get. I talked to the
captain in charge of that, uh,
last week, and I told him, I
said, you know, back east, there are 20 and done for most, most departments in back east they do 20 years and they're retired automatically required. They're still fairly young at 20 year
40, 45. And if you go to the big cities, they're not going to be in culture shock by coming here.
Uh, the other thing I would add,
um, signing bonuses is, uh, it's
we have zero in terms of a signing bonus and we're competing with people with 25,
$40,000 signing bonuses. And the
final thing I would say is retention, pay retention pay and retention pay, because as important as this gets, new
people, one of the things that we're having a problem in the department right now is keeping
people here and getting that knowledge to pass. Um, from time
to time, I'll jokingly remind the sheriff when he reminds me
I'm at will and you know, it's done in a joking manner. I also
remind him I'm also, at 30 years
and should be gone at, and I'm
trying to find a reason to. I'm trying to find a reason to stay.
And while I love the department,
I want to support the department and want to support the deputies. I am maxed out and I'm
staying for the love of the department. But my family is also saying, why are you there
for? Um, so if there is a
retention pay, I could actually give them an answer. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Yeah, and succession planning is so important to without that institutional knowledge, we don't have good succession planning. Yes. Thank you. Thank
you so much. Um, do we have
public comment on this item for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item for san francisco sheriff's department presentation, please approach
the podium when it is free. There appears to be no public
comment, so I'm going to have, um, marshall kind indulge me.
And I kind of gave him the heads up that we MAY have to move him to the next meeting. So we get to the charter. I also think it's important that, um, member webster also be able to hear your presentation, because it's so important. Um, and that would be the firewalls on the administrative investigations, criminal investigations. And then the fifth amendment protections. So thank you,
marshall, we have your so I would ask the members to
actually just review that before the next, um, meeting. And so you'll know the kind of presentation that marshall will give. So next, um, because we
are on a pretty urgent timeline in terms of this, that's why I wanted to get to the charter amendments. Um, and then I'm
going to have, um, our deputy city attorney, jana clark, kind
of preface, uh, what happens? I think she sent out an email kind
of detailing the procedure, and
we have several documents I purposely didn't do any more
because, um, I didn't want it to have it like an interim meeting. So all these documents are here for our discussion purposes. I
will keep a running list, and then these will be
recommendations to our potential
legislative sponsor, who hasn't
100% agreed yet. But we're like
95% there. So I just want to give you that as a layout. Sure.
Um so this would be calling line
item six. Sorry amendment to san francisco charter 4.137 language
discussion possible action item. Discuss and review proposed
drafts of amendment language to
sf charter 4.137. Um, thank you. So the process, I think that's
what you're asking about is um,
so for any charter amendment to
be introduced, it needs a sponsor. And that can be someone on the board of supervisors or the mayor's office. And what happens is, once there's a
sponsor that, um, that sponsor then works with the city attorney's office and most likely someone on my team, most
likely me, frankly, um, to, uh, help draft whatever amendments
the sponsor wants. And and, um, and at that point, then it's introduced at the board and then the board votes. And I think
that they're due in I think that the due date would be mid summer
, around mid-MAY. Um and so what
this board can do is, is make recommendations ones and then,
um, present them to a sponsor.
But but um, but it would be ultimately up to the sponsor. What any amendment would look like. Um and so what I did was
some of the drafts that were circulated, which I'm pretty
sure were posted, um, on the in connection with the agenda items. Um, but so I went through
and, um, looked at some of the suggestions and it looked at some of the, the suggested or proposed amendments and made some suggestions. Owns it.
That's not a substitute for the process that will happen later. If there is a sponsor, our office will go through the, you know, word and period. By I mean
in, you know, great. Um like we have to approve it as to form. And so in order to do that, we would look at it carefully and working with the sponsor. So, so my review wasn't approval as to form, but just to give suggestions on sort of the substantive substantive issues
that I, that I identified, which I've, you know, shared with the board. So any any other questions on the process? I'm happy to answer them. Now. I think we can dive right in and what I'm going to do really
quick, actually. Jan, one quick question. And it's probably rhetorical question. I'm hoping
the sponsor can also be the person that originally wrote the legislation. Right. That's
correct. PRESIDENT Icu, as we
talk about 95% in terms of potentially having someone to
sponsor, have we had discussion and conversation with the person who originally wrote the legislation? I haven't yet. I've
had it with somebody who is on
budget and will have more
longevity. So um, I will have the further conversation. I just
wanted to put it out there
first. Um, so, so really what I
first put out is just a cleanup is, is you know, as to what we're calling ourselves. And,
um, so I will reach out, but I first wanted to reach out to see if there was even an interest.
Um, right now. So, as you can imagine, the focus was really
just on budget, so I didn't want to disturb it. So we've had conversations I haven't formally
asked or um, but I wanted to find someone who was sort of
switzerland to get everyone together, and that was the main
purpose. Yeah yeah. Thank you.
Good question. So if I might, I was just going to go through section by section and if there
are no particular objections, we
will just make it as a list of a recommendation. And then for those things that we might be
more stuck on, we might just, um , kind of have all of the particular recommendations that
we think should be considered by the legislative sponsor or
sponsor, and then the city
attorney. And that way we can
try to get through, um, by 5:00.
Um, so I have a question. Um,
you mentioned a list of recommendations. So so, but what I'm seeing here are red lines of different documents that have
been provided. So are what we
are doing now. Are you creating? Are you creating a new document
that's going to be a red line or literally providing a list of our recommendations? I will do
both, depending on what's recommended by the city attorney, but what was helpful
when shopping for a legislative
sponsor was to say you know, these are the main things we first need to clean things up. And what has been on our agenda
forever and a day is kind of, um, focusing and limiting what law enforcement agency looks like because that has impact on
the hiring of our staffing for
our office of inspector general.
And so those were the two main things I didn't want to say. Do you want to be a legislative sponsor without anything? So part of it was the document that you see that I had created was
mainly more of a cleanup to have consistent language, um, and consistent reference to
acronyms. And so part of my, I guess, idiosyncratic thing is I don't have articles before an
acronym. If it refers to an entity, but for an individual, I do so. And so you made mainly
drafting. Yeah. Suggestions. So
that was just the basics, but that they could reject the entire thing. I just I didn't want to just go in there without
them having an idea of what was
going to be there. Um, and then the city attorney works with the
legislative sponsor or sponsors.
Um, I cannot be a part of it unless the legislative sponsor or sponsors want me to be a part of it. So there are conversations, um, although when
I approached this, this office, um, they said, you know, we
would welcome your help. So
that's where we also, um, you know, are part of the process.
And if we need to, you know, we could have a special meeting in between as the process goes on
to, to further deliberate
question. So the, um, that you
had a I know michael had his recommendations, you had your recommendations and jason, would it be like a hodgepodge of all those recommendations and then, um, carry on. And then also from the inspector general, we had some suggestions. So I have those in my brain. And that's
why, um, but I couldn't discuss it with any of you because we have to have a public meeting and so that's where I'm going to
bring you through and where we get to certain points where there are different, um, um, suggestions. I will point that
out and then we can comment on
on that. Does that sound right?
Sound clear to you? Yeah. So the just my one suggestion would be if, if it's going to be if they are going to be recommendations of the board, then the board, you know, you should vote on
each recommendation. Or if you have a collection of them you can it doesn't have to be each individual line, but just be
real clear. What recommends you're thinking. If we just have a general consensus, do you think we still have to take a vote? Yeah okay okay. We'll do that. Okay. So the first item is what do we even call ourselves?
Um, so it's no longer the
department, right. So it's not really the sheriff's department
oversight board. Um, I. Thought
about and I think I, um, threw this out there. The board of sheriff oversight only to distinguish ourselves from being
an independent board, because even the sheriff's department oversight board sounds like we
might be under the sheriff's office or sheriff's department.
So I also thought about paralleling the police
department of accountability. But then if we had the board of sheriff's accountability, then
that's the same acronym as the, uh, boy scouts of america. And
then I wanted to avoid sob, which would have been the sheriff's oversight board. So
um, so by default, I ended up
with the, um, with bso. That sounds good. Board of sheriff
oversight. And so that kind of just culminates. I mean, even though the sheriff is generally
singular here, I'm just using it kind of like police. So. Okay, we're good with bso. So do we
need to vote? Shall we take a
vote on that. It what I mean, it's up to you how you proceed. But yeah, you can vote on each one at a time or you can vote as
a clump of them together. I just want to make sure it's clear what you're voting on. Okay. That makes sense. Um, why don't
we just go one at a time, just
to make it clear so we don't go back, and then we have to reiterate everything. And let me
just share for the record, for me personally, I'm I'm against this. And the reason I am is just kind of the process in
terms of what I'm hearing and just kind of how I'm feeling. Okay. Uh, especially around the fact that there's a lot of work
that's been done that's been great work by all of you here. That if we don't get a sponsor, we get a sponsor, and it doesn't take that all the work was
really for not so I just think for me, from a process standpoint, I would have loved to feel more comfortable saying, we have someone that wants to sponsor this. There have been conversations that have been had and this is what we're going to propose versus I kind of feel like it's a little cart before
the horse for me. Okay um, so we still have to have the conversation as a board. So do
we for sure. I mean, so just to actually just lay these things
out. Yeah. Okay so to put that out. Yeah. So do you. So do we
want to go item by item and just say is there a motion to call ourselves the board of sheriff oversight? I personally don't want to go through item by item. I think that's a waste of time. I think we should just make the list. Make a list right. Um, okay. And then go from there. Okay. So okay, we'll talk it through. And then if there's any particular flags, we'll feel
strongly. Okay um, okay. So then we went back and so looked at the board seats and I know from
member nguyen there was a flag that one of the seats be from a labor organization. But to emphasize it's a labor
organization represents law
enforcement center. Uh, email to update just to keep the original
language. So to disregard my proposal change. Oh, okay. I didn't get that last one. Okay.
Sorry. Oh, okay. Okay. I tried to just. Yeah. Yeah. So sorry. I don't even look at emails right before the meeting, so. Okay. But that's better. Anyway yeah. Okay. It's better. It's happening here because I thought
that might have been probably. Okay. Um so then we next go to training, and we know that it was actually difficult to actually get training and onboarding in particular time.
So um, there was a little change
on that for 180 days and 20 hours was, I think, um, the
training is cost money and it's
staff and time consuming. Um,
who good rain here. Um, so, so,
um, I purposely actually tried to integrate training. I mean, with the presentations we have here. So if people don't feel
strongly or feel strongly, just throw out whatever you want in terms of training. Looks great.
Sorry question. We're looking at the FEBRUARY 20th. Yeah. And
then the other documents from member wechter as well as member nguyen. Well, I thought, do you
have that member quinn said, no.
Oh no. We're looking at training though. And member wechter had his suggestions on training, which is not identical to so
that is um, and I think in the
future we just need to label. But this is with the, um, the
from the firefox with the red.
Yeah. I think since we're all looking at three different documents, there is a proposed amendments, which is PRESIDENT Sue's. We have the red line,
which is commissioner nguyen,
and then we have. No, that's what that's what vectors red
line. Yeah okay. And then the other one that's um, some cross but with blue would be from
member nguyen I see. Okay. Great
perfect. You know, one other thing you could do is you could
agree as a board. I'm just throwing out suggestions. Um
because it's 430 that you submit
all of your, you know, each red line and identified as whoever suggestion suggested them. And then the sponsor could, could consider all of them. And that's
another possibility. I mean, I think we're, I, we don't have a lot. So I think that we can get through this. And so I just
wanted to throw it out and just philosophically, I like to be a little bit more general than, um, specific. But sometimes the more you put in, the more
limiting you end up being so.
And sometimes the small changes you can take out a word and it
could, um, make, make all the change without having to add
extra language. So instead of so just to understand the meat of
this proposal, it's like taking instead of 90, we're doubling the hours of training for 100. No no we're extending the days
because it wasn't practical to actually have someone onboarded
and then get training within the
90 days. Um, and then we realistically just put the 20
hours, I think it was originally
there was a proposal to have 80
hours, and it would be phased in during an entire year. No. And
so I think with I don't know how you felt, but the 20 hours was a good foundation for us. Yeah, yeah. It was a great training. Um, and I didn't specify who was going to do the training. When someone says experts in the
field that could be subjective.
So I left that kind of clean. Um
so then moving on, um, it's just
a little bit of cleanup on the, um, the terminology, but also now we're looking at our powers
and duties. Uh, member wechter wanted to have x unfettered
access to information and
records and, um, that concerns
me a little bit because, um, I view our board as quasi judicial
and just as, uh, the
presentation that that, um, marshall kane was going to give, we don't want to have information that MAY
accidentally, um, reveal
confidential information. And I think the investigations are
best left with the office of inspector general. And if we do want additional information, we should actually go through the
inspector general. That makes
sense. Sorry, I'm like, what
page are we on? Yeah, I think it MAY be helpful if we, um, reference the page. Yeah. So at least the section. Okay. So yeah
. So we're under um, be the best
powers and duties. Yes so yes.
So if you, if you follow that
section. Um, okay. Got it, got
it. So what I see is a lot more just cleanup. It's just, uh,
drafting cleanup. Yes, yes. Um,
and then in following that, we
go on in and then we have the
office of inspector general. So that's just cleanup. And I apologize. I'm trying to catch
more where I had a typo of boss
instead of bso, so next we go to
the oig. Powers and duties. And
so this in particular is where vice PRESIDENT Karen waite
weighed in. But it's also about
reviewing things that are in
custody. And so we know that the job of the deputies has been expanded with tenderloin. So
we're out in patrol. So um, I thought about just in a more broad sense, rather than saying we're going to look at, um, injuries or deaths based on
shootings or where we are, um, I'm thinking about the
terminology sfso related death
or injury. And that way it's a little bit more broad. I didn't
want to say sfso. So um,
involved because we could have a situation like we've had in the
past where it's a facility or a building that the sheriff's
office, um, uh, keeps as under
their protections, such as general hospital. And if there's , say, a particular fight or somebody's missing and there's
an injury or a death, it is sfso
related. But it's not sfso
involved. So I thought that that
might be broad enough to encompass everything where we didn't have to specifically spell out whether it's in
custody, out of custody. Um, yeah. I think my comment, though
is, um, officer involved shootings don't always involve
deaths and injuries. Right. So I don't think it should just be tied to deaths and injuries. That's why I said officer. Or it
would be deputy deputy. Shoot. Yeah. Shoot. Okay. Deputy involved shootings excessive. So
we should have a separate thing just to mention shooting and I don't know. And marshall, maybe you could help me or, um, member
bruckner in general or all the or. Janet. Are all the shootings
just pro forma investigated by
the oversight body? So like, that's the police commission. they I think they look at every shooting. So yes. So the inspector general would look at
every shooting. So do we need to even spell it out. Well right
now what it doesn't provide the it doesn't provide authority for that. Yeah. Yeah. So I think I think we should spell out the
shooting. Um okay. And that would be under, um, two or.
Yeah. Um, sub division e two.
Yeah. And then and then are people okay with the other
otherwise like taking out the in custody and talking about sfso
related death or injury. Yes
okay. Okay and then moving on.
That's a that's more clean up. Um. Oh no. One really important
thing is so the authority for
the oig to look at, um,
complaints between sfso
employees or between sfso employees and sfso contractors.
So that's a labor issue that, um , our deputy city attorney
brought up. So maybe we need to reword that or look at
particular jurisdiction on that.
Was that was under e one. Yeah.
My, uh, recommendation is that you don't include complaints between, you know, employees
basically that employees cheese and other employees and
employees and contractors. So that falls under DR. And the
city attorney's office. It it
falls under drs jurisdiction
now. Okay um, so it's on under e
the way the language read, receive, review and investigate
complaints against sfpd
employees and sfpd contractors.
And then it's comma and then
what was proposed is between sfo employees or between sfo
employees and contractors. It's that language that okay, so we take out that entire clause
between, um, okay. Now is there an instance where a internal
affairs actually looks at some of the things, or is it
automatically referred to DR. Um
, I'm not really sure. I think I
think they do, but, um, you
know, complaints between employees. Chief jude does internal affairs look at those. Sorry to put you on the spot.
Sorry, sorry. Um, so we're going to take out the clause of
complaints between sfso
employees or between sfso employees and contract sfso
contractors. Um, because that's
usually handled by DR. But my
question is it's likely to go through internal affairs or at
least that you would know about
it. Right? We would know about
it. Um, so are you talking about the shootings. Is that what you're. No, no, we're just talking about just complaints between employees and then complaints between employees and contractors. We had added that
as expanding the jurisdiction
for the oig powers and duties. Um, but we were recommended that
maybe we take that out. So
sorry, because it goes through DR. And we don't want
conflicting, um, resolutions. I also think it's a human resource
issue. Um, I don't believe that that we have legal here to
legal. Yes alrighty. Sorry that.
Yeah so that I can speak to that specifically. It's on a case by case basis. If it has a ciu element and there's a criminal investigation, then it will be handled by them. If it's an eeo complaint, it will be handled by
ia. DR. And our internal office.
And if it is an administrative issue it could not rise to the level of ia. It's a case by case basis. So there can't be any general rule. So we will take that out. So it's safer to be silent on that. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry to put you on the
spot. Um yeah. I'm not on the labor team, which is. Yeah yeah.
So. So, um. Yeah. So just to be clear, janet has a lot of layers. So even when things go to her with their government team, they also refer to the
other teams like labor. And so, yeah. Okay. So, um, other than that, that's clean up. Um, we've
added, uh, what member wechter
had raised to have, um, audit reports. Uh, we're not specifying who actually conducts the audits, but there are professional certified auditors, so I don't want to say that we're going to get statistical reports and audit reports and it's somebody just throwing it together. I mean, I hope that we
have the properly credentialed people to make sure that the reports actually are meaningful.
Who gets audited in this with
this line? Um, it's so the inspector, the office of inspector general would be auditing the sheriff's
operations and numbers. And then so, um, it's putting it in there. Where where they're
looking for an audit and then kind of risk management. So so,
uh, one thing we talk about is
if we do things, it's hard to show what we prevented, but if
we prevent even a single lawsuit , we've paid for our department,
you know, so that's the main thing. And we saw an employment lawsuit that was recently rendered, um, a few months ago,
and that was like $1 million for
the plaintiffs. So I would like to make a oh, go ahead. Sorry question. Um, does this open up the door because I don't know
what the office of inspector general staff requirements are.
Does this does this line like, require us to, like, make sure we have staffing appropriate for that? Yeah. Everything I mean there's a there's a catchall at the end that it's subject to
budget and resources. So there's
a catchall at the end of this charter anyway. Yeah. Okay I also think the language should be a little bit more clear and
say submit an audit report of
the sheriff's activities or, you know, to the sheriff and boss. So that's clear. So, so or should we say operations. Yeah,
exactly. Operations. So we'll
just do or so operations. This
one I want to think a little bit
longer on just because I, I'm
trying to understand, um, if, if
it just opens up a can of worms to staff for it and then require
like, uh, I mean, I do understand the importance of it because, you know, I want to
make sure that we're not doing anything unlawful and then adds
to, like, legal. Um, but so
which section are you talking
about? It's the language in that I added item number seven under e oig powers and duties. So it's the added item seven. I just mean which draft are you on? I'm
sorry. Oh, sorry. It's the draft
, uh, with my initials on it. So
FEBRUARY 20th. Yeah. Dated and actually, this is really FEBRUARY 6th. I on the 20th. I
just tried to catch all the
corrections for bso instead of boss, but it didn't even in
this. So and you know, I think
that for me, I don't mind even tabling this because the first
report is from 2026. So we don't
need to make that dis decision about the audit report right now. The only reason I can see some concerns of like, what's the purpose of the audit report,
what is the audit report going to be consist of? How is it going to be used? Because I'm not trying to give the ig to have to do more work. We could actually request it outside of the charter. We can just say we
need. And I just, you know, member wechter was pushing it
and I actually have it on the timeline anyway, what we're going to discuss later in the fall. Yes. So we don't need to we could eliminate it if you want and not even make it a recommendation. I agree, I would agree with that for this purpose. Okay. But there's no
just in terms of, uh, member margo's question, there's no legal reason why you couldn't require that. I mean, just. Yeah, just to follow it. Just I
just you can also do it the way you've described, which is probably better, but I just wanted to write it. It just kind of confounds things. If we're placing this before the voters,
if they see too many changes, they might even vote everything down. I mean, there's a lot of moving balls, so I think in general, sometimes just getting a cleanup is easier because we've got a lot of cleanups on
the ballot. Um so those were
the, the main things I let's see
g just was cleanup to fix. Um, the reference to the sheriff's
office and also with requesting, um, the records, I was just kind of concerned. So I just put in
hipaa and other privacy. Yeah. Which is a lot, you know, just so you know, on that section g,
it says at the beginning, unless prohibited by state or federal law, that that includes that
pulls in, uh, hipaa and the
california privacy act. All
right. So I don't know, I just, um, only because I didn't it
didn't like, flash out at me. I
was just a little nervous. So I added it. But I could just take out that. Yeah it's not necessary. Okay. We'll take out the hipaa. Okay. So you're withdrawing your own comment okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just but I just want to make sure um,
because was this also included
member webster wanting to have our board or individual members
access to records like that. And so I just wanted to flag all the privacy stuff. But we can take
out the take out the hipaa. Okay so we're an h now. Uh, yes. So
we're just about done really.
And we MAY have marshall present after all. I have a question. Yes. One for every 100 sworn sf
employees. Oh, that was another big. Yep. Sorry. Thank you for bringing that up. Wait, what was your question? I didn't hear I
don't I need to I just want to understand what it is like. Why do we need to spell it out? For every 100 sworn employees as a employees or for every 200
incarcerated individuals, based on a three year average, which
is greater? Which ever is greater? What's the need for
that? So under the original language we remember we had one
one, um, investigator for every
100 sworn officers. But now we have an incarcerated population
that has grown by 50. So you
could argue that there could be more complaints because there's an increase in the population.
So I didn't want to limit it to
just one investigator per 100.
Um. Per per 100, um,
incarcerated is the intent to increase the budget as necessary if like, yeah, yeah. So increase the number of investigators. So let's say the population grew by 50. So we ended up with a certain percentage of, um, complaints. And whether they're
difficult complaints or whatever . Just when you get a larger
population, you would expect more complaints. So with the budget. So I want to have some flexibility in terms of the inspector general being able to hire, whether it be by contract
or staff, to have investigators.
Okay so the only other thing, I mean, the second part of that line, the san francisco sheriff's office or san francisco police department, as a sworn law enforcement officer, I do have an issue with this
because it's it just only
specifies sf. Um, officer or law enforcement, but that opens the
gate for other agencies, nearby
agencies, does it not? Yeah. So
I, I didn't broaden it. I think,
um, I was just looking at something really, really narrow,
like if a voter were to vote,
it's just really. Well, why not
just why not take out san francisco and just say, sheriff's office or police
department as a sworn law? Yeah,
we could just do that too. Okay and then that labor organization
was always there. Then can I, um, just going back to that
comment. So that means, though,
if our ig has a, you know, knows
of retired and alameda
investigators, right, then they wouldn't be able to apply here because they were previously worked for the police or they previously worked for the
sheriff. Right? Yeah. Okay yeah. I thought we were all in favor
of, um, like or we had the same consensus of allowing law enforcement to apply for these positions because they have a background in investigating and
they're. Good. Yeah, that's what I thought we had previously discussed. So this language to me seems a little different than what we had talked about. So we had narrowed it down to what were we thinking. Like what what a voter think automatically about law enforcement agency. Because we had remember we had just throw the law enforcement
agency was so broad that it eliminated people who worked for the federal office of inspector
general, um district attorney's offices, even investigators who worked in the district attorney's. So we were we were
just like throwing out good
candidates. So this is an
attempt to narrow it. And I, you know, however you want to narrow it, not narrow it, but define it
or define it, but it also it also narrows the people that we potential candidates. Because when you just say law enforcement agency, you would
have eliminated so many people. So you're narrowing the definition down, so to speak. I was speaking in reverse. And
yeah, like I know mining it for a reason. Yes. In the charter.
So this is saying, um, to not allow we want to allow. Right.
No no we're not. So, so, um,
we're, we're eliminating people. Well I mean, okay, so law
enforcement agency, we can agree was very, very broad. So now the
people that we would say can not
apply, you're focusing on agencies, right? Yeah. Just
sheriff and sfpd and the typical
layman would understand it as like law enforcement. Right,
right. Deputies and the police officers. And then the question is, do we just say, san francisco? Because there is a
direct conflict, right. Um, but
I mean, even even if you hired someone from another jurisdiction, there could be a conflict that they knew someone. That's where legal comes in and says, you can't handle this case
or whatever. So, um, you know, we're not addressing every single little thing. We're just trying to make sure that we're not boxing ourselves in again
where we can't hire the best
candidates. So scenario. So if there's a candidate that was 30 years in law enforcement, he retired from daly city pd, for example, and then he applied for one of these positions. He wouldn't be allowed. Correct.
Um, if we if we took out the san
francisco reference, then that that person would probably be excluded. If we if we took out
san francisco, because then it would be any kind of, um, sheriff's office. Or if you beat
cisco, then he is allowed to be.
Yeah. To be interviewed at least
. Yeah. Right. To be considered. That's good. Right there. So I, I see so there's a san francisco
, the san francisco then adding
san francisco is a way to have a checks and balances that there's not an actual conflict of
interest that somebody worked in san francisco, that knows anyone. Right. But then I think the concern that other board members have previously raised
is that no one that should be in
law enforcement should have previous law enforcement
experience. You know, it's hard
to become an investigator that
knows how to do this work
without working in a police or
sheriff so that that is just the reason I just look at michelle phillips, who's come here, and I mean, she's been there two years, done amazing things. She
was a deputy sheriff. She was a probation officer. She comes from baltimore. So I personally,
I never want to exclude somebody
just based on their title or whatever. I mean, we all bring different experiences and that's what makes our board strong. So so, um, you know, I don't presume that the vice PRESIDENT
Is like, so pro law enforcement because she's, you know, been a
prosecutor before. Um, she has
her prosecuted officers. Yes to say, right, right. There's a difference. But I mean, there's
a balanced viewpoint. And so she's also not you know, she's also not anti, um, law enforcement because of the roles that she's played as a prosecutor. So I just want to make sure that we were not excluding candace with really
solid experience. I also think
in terms of credibility, um, for
policy changes. Um, we also are
a very union town and, you know,
member nguyen represents, um,
um, labor organizations. And so
we have to really be mindful of things that we recommend that
there actually workable and
acceptable. So that's where I kind of just made it a little
bit more narrow so that we could look at other people. But I mean, even then legal would get involved if somebody came from a jurisdiction. I mean, even if someone came from the east coast, they MAY know somebody. We have you know, we have long time captains who originally came from the east coast. So
there could still be a conflict. And that is up for legal to say, you know, you can't investigate
this case because you know, this person. I mean, that's very
basic for attorneys to just create firewalls and that kind
of thing. Yeah, yeah. I think my only thing is like, you know,
this was voted in by the public
like majority votes and the spirit in which this was written
was that no law enforcement
officer as a typical layman would understand, would be
leading this, uh, board or doing the investigation. So this is just like, no, no, but remember, the original language was law enforcement agency, not officer.
So here we're defining it. So why not leave it broad and how it was written then? Because law enforcement agency would exclude
people from the district attorney's office, a federal
office of inspector general, any inspector general, I couldn't,
you know, so got it. So which which is why we're here to define it. I'm okay with this
definition. If we take out the
san francisco part. Okay so I have like a mixed feeling about
that because I think the san
francisco part is meant to be like a okay, we don't want somebody who's going to, you
know, like a code blue, right? Like they're just going to go
and side with law enforcement because they know that person. They're affiliated with. My concern is getting qualified
investigators to be able to do
this work, because how else do
you become an investigator to do
crime? I mean, it's where do you get your training? Where do you
work on that? So it's I agree with the small pool that we have to work with. I agree, I totally in agreement with that, but we just hired the inspector general, right. That came from a
dea background. And I'm, you
know, I'm it's we had to pick
from the pool that we had, the
limited pool that we had. I still think very strongly that
we should just keep to the sheriff's office and the law
enforcement office. Officer
language, or the sheriff and the police, you mean. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, I see, um, and so we are
kind of expanding the pool by
narrowing what we mean by law enforcement agency. I mean, that's, um, I will I will say
that, you know, where I work. We
had predominantly sworn officers
as our investigators and about 15 years or so, we started
moving towards civilian investigators. But and we have a good combination. Yeah. I mean, I'm in agreement. Listen, I mean, going through so we're told we have four minutes.
Although that clock says six
minutes, you have four minutes on my phone, which I think is I trust our commission secretary.
Um, so I will note so, so take out san francisco and leave it
as, um, not previously employed
by a, a sheriff's office or as a
sworn officer, as a sworn
sheriff's office or a, uh,
police or a police department as a sworn law enforcement officer. So we'll take out san francisco
references. I mean, I, I think
it's important that we do have sanford. I see now the point of the adding the san francisco of
allowing us to be able to have a larger pool of investigators that MAY not be affiliated with san francisco, that have been
trained, um, because we don't want it to be like the like, old
boys network of, you know what I mean? Like that. That's kind of what we're trying to ensure is that that doesn't happen. I am concerned about getting
investigators with, like, the experience that we need to actually do a proper
investigation, because if you get investigators that don't know what they're doing. Yeah, it's a wrap. Totally. You know,
I get that. I guess what I'm concerned about is the public perception and the reason in which this board was created is
that there is a mistrust with.
So. So I thought that seeing san francisco right up front, it
actually would allay their fears that you're having that fox
guard the henhouse. So I mean, it could go I mean, what we
could do is just say that we are conflicted on whether or not to
have san francisco in there and then just leave it for the
legislative sponsor. Can I ask the question? Actually, this actually brings me to a good point. Um, so let's say we propose this. We give it to the sponsor, or are they allowed to make changes like even changes? Yeah, they can change it. They can throw everything out. They can exclude us. They can whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So and then and then even when all the
work is done, the voters can say we don't like any of it. And they're going to vote it down.
So we could do all this work. But what I'm trying to do is make it lay out the groundwork for future generations of our board. So and the inspector general's office, so we can do a better job. That's all. I think. You know, I think a compromise
to this situation, given that we
are just a recommending body, is that we say there is a
difference of opinions, you
know, one, uh, no, that's what I just said. We're going to lay it out and just say we're conflicting. We have a difference of opinion, or we're conflicted on how we. How about
you? You let me finish. Um, what I was going to say was that, similarly, we put the state of y
right? For example, yours is the
original intent. Right? The
what? You think the original intent was to exclude all persons. Right. But another side is that san francisco is a sufficient check and balances to
ensure the fox henhouse thing.
So I think we might want to specify, though, what that
right. I mean, I think with all the list of recommendations, I'm also going to put a rationale and that MAY be part of when you
read the stuff in the ballot. It also would lend itself to legislative history when people, you know, ten years from now,
like, why in the hell did they put that in language in there? we will have the documentation. I mean, you know, legislation is
always evolving anyway, could I just suggest you just take a
pause and offer the general public comment item because you
have to do that. Yes. Okay so
are you are you okay with that?
Just that we're ending it here and then we're going to. Okay.
Um, so let's move on to we would need to take a motion though, right? Yeah. No, you have to vote. Definitely but I just meant, like, just because I'm worried that if you get cut off. Okay, let's just take some general public comment first, and then we'll do a recalling line item nine, general public
comment. At this time, the public is welcome to address the board for up to two minutes on items that did not appear on this afternoon's agenda, but are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. During public comment, neither sheriff personnel nor any board members are required to respond to questions by the public, but
MAY provide a brief response. If you would like to make a public comment, please approach the
podium when it is free. There appears to be no public comment.
Okay so let's, um, take do I
have a motion? Let's take a vote
on, uh, what we just discussed and having it as a list of
recommendations and the various
drafts that we have as, as recommendations in the hands of
our city attorney to present to
the legislative or I guess the city attorney's not presenting,
but to provide to the
legislative sponsor. It would be that your, you know, you would compile it and your secretary
would would send it to whoever the sponsor is. Or you could designate a some a member of the board to do that. If you wanted
to do. I would suggest that we
just do a quick summary of what are the list of the recommendations that we're going
to put on. So it's very clear. Right. And I can do the summary myself if you don't want to. Oh no. No, I mean I took a list of the summary but the legislative
sponsor potential one does have
just the cleanups, the main
cleanups. Right but for in order for us to just make sure that
we're all voting on the same page, why don't we just quickly say all right, there are going to be technical cleanups, which are the recommendations, right? We are agreeing to all the sections a to do this, this, this, this, which is only for
things substantively. Yes right. So that's that's so that's what I had down in my notes. So, so um, so when I summarize that, I
don't know, I think I will send
it to dan jana, I don't, um, is
it okay if I send it to dan and
then everyone looks at it and then I guess we're voting now, but I just want the final document to reflect. If you're going to vote, it should be clear what you're voting on. Yes. Okay. I wrote it down. So we're going to vote. We have so
what we went through on the technical cleanups, the line items that we had and that will be the list of recommendations that will go through, dan, to
the legislative sponsor. Those changes are to be, uh, changed
the name to be. So 20 hours at
180 days on section a, five, uh,
on section e two to add deputy
involved shootings, remove the
suggestion on e one and remove
the section on e seven. Remove
the section on g hipaa and h um
to take out san francisco or leave for the legislative sponsor to decide. Uh, we're missing something. So we're
missing, um, we're missing the
where's the thing? Um, the portions that are in custody
were are going to have sfso
related, uh, death and injury.
So because there's a reference
right now just to in custody,
and I believe the recommendation is not just to take out san
francisco, it's just that we have a yeah, a difference of
opinion. Right. It's to just put it out there and there's two different rationales for it.
Yeah and the rationale and they are as you described, I just want to make sure it's clear what you're voting for. Right.
Yes okay. Well I'll move to um
approve those recommendations.
And I would also, uh, as part of
that motion request that the
PRESIDENT Be designated as the person to incorporate these, um,
provided to dan and to jana, our
city attorney. Yeah and I'll just hold him until if and when
you have a sponsor for is, I guess will be the process next
week. And then I will, um, at
member, um, brooke suggestion, I
will also circle with back with them. All right. Is there a
second supervisor walton.
Second. For members of the public who would like to make
public comment on line item six amendment to the san francisco 4.137 language, please approach the podium when it is free. There appears to be no public
comment calling the role on the motion to accept the amendment
to sf charter for 4.137.
Language member huamango. Um,
I'm going to say no, and I'm
going to give my rationale for
it. It's because of the
potential for the charter to be
amended when it goes into the
supervisors hands. And I'm just
like, worried that something will get passed through, go to the public that I wasn't comfortable with. Like if this is the original, if all these changes that we're agreeing upon
stays all the way up until it gets to the public, I'm fine with that. But if it's not, then I'm going to have to say no. Well, I think the public will still have the final say, like
on the changes. They still have to vote for it to get through. So but the majority of the public wants it and that's what they want, right? I can't hear you. Member. When I'm sorry. So
just. Oh, sorry. It's not speaking in the mic. Um, but
yeah, I was, I was saying, um,
with the changes, it still has
to go to the public at the end
of the day to get, get voted in.
So the public will have to make the final decision. So so we could submit our suggestions,
but it's, uh, you know, what the
public wants is what the public
wants. And they could vote on it or not. So and the sponsor. Yeah. And the sponsor. Yeah. We can't control we all. We can
only recommend. Yeah all right.
Member bruckner. No bruckner is
no vice PRESIDENT Carrion. Yes
carrion is. Yes. Member nguyen.
Yes. When is. Yes. PRESIDENT Su?
Yes. Su is. Yes. There's no quorum. If three is that. Yeah
so it doesn't pass. So we need a supermajority on the charter recommendation. You always need four for any action. You want to take. It's not the majority of
people sitting here. It's the majority of the members. So I guess, um, down the road, do we
want to take this up next month
at all? Do we even want to do this at all? I mean, yes, I was recommend that we really kind of
figure out our legislative, um,
sponsor. I think that. It
behooves us to show the respect to the originating, um, sponsor.
Right if I wrote a book. Yeah. And you had an opportunity to speak to that book writer. Yeah. Just to get as we're talking about original intent and other things, right? Yes I think it's just in the spirit of collaboration. I agree, I think, and then we can revisit this
because we will have time to and I would feel more comfortable if
whoever the sponsor is continues to keep that same language that we all just spoke about. Right, right. But I just I just wanted
to I think as I was reading what you were saying, though, the
voters could just also reject it
. And then we're left with our old language where we, you know, the inspector general is going to have a harder time recruiting and staffing. That's that's the main thing. It is it is true. But we also have already
previously done a motion to
define law enforcement agencies
for the purpose of the ig. Exactly. For just police and
sheriff. Right. So if that
happens, you know, I, I do think we have time. Right. And also you can always. Yeah. And you
can always invite it has to be
by mid-MAY. So I mean if we if we would like we could have an extra meeting. The legislative sponsor has to get everything packaged by mid-MAY. Yes. So that means they have to get it through their committee and their board of supervisors meeting. So it's not like a lot,
a lot of time. And so I wanted to do you think it would I'm
sorry. Go ahead. I just wanted to I just wanted to float out there and make it easy. And that's why I just had particular documents. Because one. Yeah. So so when it's not, things are not packaged easily, then they're like, I don't really want to do it because it's more work. And then we're we're stuck in budget
time. So I was only doing this mainly also to buttress the need
to actually staff our office and having done all the work that
everyone one associated is very
serious. We're all committed and that's why we're also fighting for the budget. So this lends to everything. So I will go and
talk to, uh, go back to the
legislative sponsors, plural and
, and get a firm commitment and hopefully I'll have that by the end of the week. Um, it would be also interesting to hear from their perspective what their
thoughts are on this particular,
um, issue of the law enforcement agency. Yeah when those conversations, sometimes people
don't understand the unintended consequences, like they had the positive thing. But in practical motion, you realize that we need to amend this because it
actually was hamstrung us from
actually doing our work. I think that people are more amenable, but I also understand the budget, too, and I didn't want to disrupt the budget process.
So it's a lot going on right now. Yeah. Um, and thank you for doing all of this work also. And whoever the sponsors is can watch your meeting because I
recorded it and read all of the
drafts because they're attachments. So you might invite them to do that. Yeah. I had
asked them to either if they wanted to appear or watch it in real time. So yeah. Okay. Having
no quorum of votes, the motion does not pass. And is not adopted. Calling line item ten adjournment action item. All
those in favor? Aye. Any nays?

2024-02-14,"I am the new san francisco inspector general heading the
offiof the inspector
general, and as it was stated
I'm here to present our
proposed 24-25 budget and I
will start with telling you a little about the office of inspector general.
Basically, san francisco voters
passed proposition d in 2020
establishing the san francisco
first sheriff department
oversight board, and that board proceeded to create the office
of the inspector general and
the whole purpose of the
inspector general's office is provide independent oversight of the sheriff office.
We have been assigned the
government code or department code, sda to sheriff department
of accountability. The oig, roles and responsibilities are defined
and san francisco charter section 4.137.
then our oversight board
appointed myself, terry wily as inspector general and on
DECEMBER 20s we had a very
beautiful administration of the
oath by the legendary former
mayor willie brown and the department of accountability which was created for oversight
of the san francisco police department continues to provide
support of the oig operation
and assisting us with our independent investigations basically until we are fully
staffed and up and running.
Now, our role and responsibilities.
We conduct the investigations of complaints filed against san francisco sheriff office
employees and that includes the
deputy sheriffs and their
civilian employees and any third party contractors that
they contract with.
We also handle the
investigations of any individual who dies while in
the custody of the sheriff department. Additionally, once we conduct
our investigations we also recommend disciplinary action
to the sheriff. In terms of policies, what we
are really looking to do is
assist the sheriff department.
We are also assisting with the development and recommending
use of force policies for the sheriff department.
We also look at the writing-reporting and auditing
so we track and report on investigations, recommendations
and outcomes and we monitor the sheriff office operations to
insure compliance with the laws and policies.
and we also conduct hearings.
Most of those hearings roget
right now are conducted by the oversight board but we have
there authority to issue subpoena, administer oath, and take testimony.
Now, our budget priorities.
Well, our budget priorities are to recruit, hire, onboard and train staff because we are a new agency and so this is going
to be one of our primary purposes getting the agency up and running.
We also are tasked with
developing policies and procedures, requesting
positions to meet our charter mandate.
And what do we need? We need investigators to
investigate our sheriff office cases. We also need a senior
investigator to investigate review investigations and
manage the sheriff department cases. Basically the senior investigator will supervise the
investigators that are conducting the individual investigations.
We have a assistant chief attorney who's really
responsible for helping process public records requests to review and support
investigations before they come to my desk, draft agreements and just assist with the overall running of the office
of the inspector general.
And of course we have a executive secretary that in
addition to many roles also processes payroll and
purchasing and provide administrative support.
what is the proposed budget for the 24-25 budget? We are here today to present
that at this public meeting. When looking at the budget we
first wanted to look at the mayor's budget instructions and
so what is the primary focus of the mayor's budget for this
year and one is to improve public safety and the street
conditions of san francisco.
To promote city wide economic vitality and that goes hand in hand with public safety and street conditions. Reduce homelessness and
transform mental health services. Mental health service delivery
and just increasing the overall accountability, equity and
spending of the budget. Now, this last section is very
important because we are in a very difficult funding year, and so all departments of san
francisco are being asked to reduce their general fund
support by 10% and through the
years-through the fiscal years,
2024-2026, with also a possible additional 5% contingency you
MAY be asked to reduce your budget so we could be looking
at most departments a 15%
budget reduction.
With that in mind and being a
new agency, we understood is we will probably given the
difficult budget cycle that we
are in, we are going to have to
do a phased growth of the
office of inspector general, so instead of asking for everything that we need to be
an agency up and running, we understand we will have to
phase the growth of our agency.
Right now we are-we looked at
what is the basic amount of
funding we need to get up and running?
We propose 2 mill $22.163.632. We feel that request allows to
bring in the number of employees to get up and running independently as a agency.
Because we are being asked to
take a 10% cut, that cut is
reflected in the $353.080 will amount to the cut we are taking out of our budget, which would
leave at the proposed $2.163.632.
Now, for the number of employees, our basic proposed
budget we have 13 employees,
and with the 10% cut, we would lose one of those employees so
it would leave us at 12
employees under the current
request for funding.
And so what does that 10% look like?
I told we would lose one
employee that would be a investigator and also our non personal service amount to
about $40 thousand leaving
total of $221 thousand that
reflect in the 10% reduction. We also have work orders
because we are not able to fully-we are not fully funded at this point because we are a new agency,b then we have to
rely on the department of
public accountability to support our agency-excuse me, department of police
accountability to support our agency with technology that
will come in the form of about $62 thousand.
We also would need accounting
service from the san francisco
controller's office, $53
thousand and investigative and administrative support, $480 thousand, and because we don't
have our own in-house hr department, the county is providing us the hr rep and
that will amount to $147 thousand.
Now, what is the-our proposed
budget is where we are requesting the funding, but we
understand we had to pull back in 24-25. We are proposing that we are
not asking for any increases in materials and supplies.
We are not asking for any
increases in non-personnel services. And not asking for any increases in salaries and benefits.
We are really trying to work
within the scope of
understanding that we are in a
difficult budget time, but at
the same time, asking for the minimum of what we need to get
our agency up and running and
as a result we'll be relying
heavily on the department of police accountability to support us and that will be in
the form of $747 thousand.
That will allow us to operate
as the office of the inspector general.
What are the impact of the reductions?
Because we are not able to be a fully operational agency at
this point given the budget constrictions, what is the
impact of those reductions? Well, the original budget did
not include funds for central personnel and infrastructure to
meet the charter mandates, so these reductions will extend our reliance on borrowed
support from the department of police accountability, it will
delay our ability to become fully operations and impair our ability to meet our core
requirements laid out by the charter, 4.137. And it will also prevent our
office from adding services for the community.
And with that, if there are any questions, I'm very open to answering questions or ts
anyone MAY have.
And if there are no questions and comment, I appreciate everybody who tuned into watch
the presentation, and I believe
that's it."

Informational item cedric akbar
will be making a presentation on services prior to reentry.
Educational opportunities, apprenticeships and job training
and support services on reentry.
Well, good afternoon and, uh,
thank you for inviting me here.
And I have to be, uh, I was a little confused because at first someone told me to come and tell
my story. And then when I looked
at the agenda, it was, uh, different from what, uh, was
explained to me. But I can do
both. Um have a long history with the san francisco sheriff's
department going all the way back to michael markham and
sunny swartz and, uh, one thing
I can say is that that, um, they allowed us. Well, at the time was the northern california service league, but we were
working under it. Some founding members of the organization. I'm from positive direction. So it
was change to allow us to open up a road to recovery. And at that time, it was in the annex
and it was only from 9:00 to 12
noon. And it has come a long way since then. Um, positive direction equals change. We've
been around since 1993, and we
were a group of african-american
men at the time that came out of prison. And and from substance
abuse programs. James didn't
know how to live a life. And we
pulled ourselves together in to form our own support group to be able to manage our life outside
into the world. And teaching each other, uh, walking through the process of being parents,
being responsible and just being
accountable to our community. And from that, we wanted to give back to our community. And we
started, um, by going to the, um , the youth centers in san
francisco and alameda county. And from that we started doing a group called the gathering every
friday night that's been going
on since 1993. And it was open to the public. And then we used
to call it one thing that we help people assist people in
what ever it is. The need was in our communities. We wanted to
just stress on substance use,
but coming out office was in
bayview, hunters point. So when
MISS, uh, MISS Lee might come in and say, I got to pay my pg and
e bill and she has the money,
but she has the wherewithal to get there, we can go online and sure how to do it. We became after care for kids this is how we started domestic violence classes when people wanted to go to a domestic violence class in
their community and started women's domestic violence
classes because for some reason, an african-american community, a
lot of black women would get
charged with domestic violence
as being the offenders. And what we found in even in those situations is that families still stayed together, which
went against the norm, and we
had to find a way to be able to make sure that the children were safe. In the meantime. Um, so
today we have an array of
services available. Um during the pandemic, or just about the
end of it, we were able to open
three programs here in the city. Um, the first one was trp
academy, which is a 65 bed rest
treatment and this one is total
abstinence based program, which
was a hard fight in the city of san francisco due to harm
reduction. But I just we always
felt that it was needs a balance
and that 65 males and we also
opened up the billie holiday
center, which we always felt was a need. Billie holiday center is
a, um, it's let me see. They wanted to call it a navigation
center, but my thing was having
it more of being helpful in the situation of bringing people directly off the street and be
able to come get a bed, get some
rest, eat, take a shower, get
some clean clothes, and then after that, be able to decide
what you want to do. And what we call it was a stabilization
center and that way they can go
get on their meds that they need medication, go to the medical
doctor and get all the help they need. It's a 30 bed facility and it stays full at all times and people can come. At first it started off as a referral
process, but for me personally,
I like for people to be able to just walk up to the door and knock on the door and be able to
access when needed. Uh, the other one we opened was the
mentor project, which is a 75
bed facility, which was mental
health and substance abuse. And we do that in collaboration with
citywide forensics and part of
that is dfu. Also as part of the funding in that particular process. But most of our programs is through adult probation. And with that
particular program. Um it's a
transitional housing where a
person can stay up to two years and to be able to get themselves their life together. All of our programs are structured,
structured, very structured, um, we don't allow youth in the
program. If you use you go to billie holiday or MAY go to another level of care in our
system. And just at this, well,
DECEMBER, we just opened up a, a
women's trp that's on ten harlem
and it's a 40 bed facility for
all women. That's they don't
have to be just as involved. You
just come and it's for women and children. So those services are
available for people. Um, we have been working also with the sheriff's department, with the
nova program since 2006, and the
nova program has been a program that's almost kind of like a
best kept secret today, but assisting individuals that are
coming out of custody. We meet them in custody to be able to
talk with them and come up with
a plan of how they would choose to live. It's a voluntary
program. You're not forced to be
in it. You can come in or leave at any point that you choose to, and it offers transitional
housing in which we have about 4 or 5 transitional houses, three
in bayview and two in fillmore,
that people have access to. And depends on what community or
person can go to. And it's not
in most not drug infested areas.
Um and even with those, we have
curfews. We, we have structure and people have to attend
classes and also save their money and get their lives
together. So, um, but the most important thing I just wanted to
say is to this panel today is that I know budget cuts are
coming up in the city, but I
really ask that you continue you
to support at least the nova
program because it has so saved so many lives and it's great
because what we do is meet
people upon release, as soon as they get out, we're there to
meet them and to be able to take them to whatever destiny it is.
If they choose not to have housing, you still can get the case management services, and
it's also funds attached to it.
They need boots to be able to go to work. This is the first program and this is what I love about it. The money is not going
to the agency per se. It pays the employees, but it goes to the clients. And that's where
which is so important. And we
really do not want to lose that,
especially in this time. Um, so
that's my presentation to any
questions. So cedric, before we have your other colleagues and some questions for you, just wanted you to touch a little bit about your personal story. Um,
what what you believe. Yes. So wasn't listening to okay. Asked you about your what what I what
made you what made you successful and because you do meet people prior to reentry,
what kind of services is um, do you see that's more necessary while someone is still incarcerated and transitioning
into reentry? And then, uh, additional services that they
might need post reentry. Okay.
So um, I use heroin for 20 some
years and never had a clue about
how I was going to stop. And it
wasn't until I was like, facing
ten years and I said, in a cell by myself. And I was crying, but
no tears came out of my eyes. It was just crying. And all I knew
was that every time I use
heroin, I go to jail. Those two went hand in hand, so I just knew I had to stop heroin and I
didn't know how I was going to
do it. And uh, it was strange. I
had cases in every county in the
bay area, and my last stop was
in marin county, and, uh, I kept
asking for a program. Um, I don't really I really didn't want a program. I just didn't
want to go through ten years and
, uh, so I went before the judge . The judge said he was all right with me going to a program. They asked the district attorney, district attorney
said, I love for MR. Ackbar to go to a program, but he can do
it after he give us the ten
years. And my little heart sunk.
And from that point on, I just took it upon myself to learn everything I could. Because at this particular time it was no
training. It was no, uh,
rehabilitation or anything like
that in prisons. And just going
to prison is one of those things
that turn on my life, uh, around. And then I went to a program, and when I found I
still didn't know how I was going to stay sober. But when I
found the brothers in positive directions, it finally clicked
on me that I needed to be held
accountable. Because if I leave
myself to my own wishes, I will
do what I want to do and once I
found that out and I found out that I had to constantly check
in with other people, that's
when the light came on for me.
And what we've I find today, the
need is. For for me, more
stabilization centers. We
definitely need that because we
do the mental health, we do the
substance use, but we do not do
the things that for medical help
for people and what we do is overrun our hospitals. And every
time the police and the fire department go pick up somebody and bring them somewhere, even if they can bring them somewhere, they turn around and
leave in another hour. So so
instead of having what they call
them injection sites and I call them shooting galleries or but
instead of having those, we need
more stabilization centers to be
able to balance these things out
. We also need more programs
that are culturally specific.
Um, and like whether it be
asian, latina, latino, um, they all need to have basically have their own program. A person can
have a choice on which one they
go to, but forcing people, people recover in different ways and they recover in their community in different ways. On some parts it's the same early
on, but as you grow in it, you want to have the feeling of where you come from, because a
lot of times you have to go back to that community. The other
thing is something we need
immediately is the way the
contracts are set up. You want
to have, uh, bilingual speaking
people, but you don't pay them
for their bilingual and that's
also a problem because there's non-profits. All we get is a certain line item, and everybody gets the same. But if you're
asking a person to translate and do a language for people, they
should be paid accordingly. And that's one that nobody ever
talks about. But it needs to
happen. And and um, because, uh, it's just like our programs, we
have like 30, 40% latino and,
and about 20% asian and a lot of
times for us, I mean, we communicate, but we still need other people to be able to communicate and translate that
information. Also so, um, this is a paradigm shift, but it's
going to have to be with each one of us. Is move so much from all this harm reduction and have
a balance because in this city
and it's not to, you know, they they give needles, they give foil, they give all these things
and which cost a lot of money and we still getting the same results in the streets. And what's funny about the city is
that they give away free needles that the city pays for. And taxpayers pay for, but in our
programs, we can't have plastic,
bottled water. So I be like, okay, I'm confused, right now.
And, um, so I got a litany of things I can go down the list
on, but I just believe and it
just needs to be a balance of when we go out into the streets
and talk to individuals. I'm a
true believer in what I try to teach you, and it MAY not go all
the way down to the front line people, but building relationships with people you, I mean, you can't necessarily
teach that, but a person has to be able to have that. You get
more from a person when you have a relationship with them, they MAY not do it right then and there, but treating people like
human beings instead of like
right now, people on the street are really is like a political
thing. The people on top continue to make the money while the people on the streets still
suffer. And and uh, so that that's what needs to change. But I'm going to stop there because I'm sure I didn't bring anybody else with me. But I see a lot of my colleagues up in here, so I
know they can add some things to when they get a chance to speak. And if they want to use my time,
you can feel free. I want to say
something because we know each other. We've been fighting for a long time. I've never been to
jail. Say your name. My name is
maggie rivera, and I. I'm from
the bay area to the bronx, so I've been on both coasts, so it's pretty much the same problems we suffer in both
places. Um, cedric had a lot to
say because it's true. Um I am
an intensive reentry case
manager. I also speak spanish.
It's really hard in custody. Um,
for our spanish speaking women.
Because there's a lot of the services are coming in english.
So how am I going to know about
any services if I can't get past that first step on where they're
at? Um, it's just a lot going on right now in san francisco, and
I've been doing this for 30
years. I started in the bronx, um, when my aunt was struck by a
stray bullet and I went to court
every day. And it was a young
man that did it. And my anger turned into compassion, um, because I wanted to know what made this young man think that
he can do the work that he shouldn't have done. Because at the end of the day, when the, um, smoke cleared, it was my
aunt who was an amazing woman
coming home from work that was
struck, not the intended person.
Um, and that's what made me get
into learning about why how
everybody has a story. I'm not here to excuse behavior, nor
justify it, but there is some
behavior that can be explained. And that's what I do. And I do
it with the tape. Allen, I am repping myself. Maggie rivera
along with the agency that I work for, which is community works west. It is a restorative
justice, um, organized action that's been in partnership with the sheriff's department for
over 25 years. Um, we really
believe hard about the arts and
creating, um, events and
activities that take them
outside that world so they can
say what they want to say without being judged or penalized. If you make a little script about it, then it MAY not
be real, you know? So we work with the arts a lot. We just got
a building, um, 986 mission, um, two stories. We got project.
What it um, upstairs for the
children of incarcerated parents
. And downstairs. It's anybody's
welcomed. Um, we want to partner
with anybody that wants to make
the city better for everybody.
So that's my spiel, and I'll see you next month. Thank you,
joanna, for inviting you.
To give us the time. Hello,
everyone. Uh, my name is joanna
hernandez, and, um, I'm going to definitely speak during public
comment. As a parent of a current person who's currently in custody inside san francisco
county jail and the lack of services. But I'll use that. My
parent talk at the end of the agenda. As a service provider, I work with the latino task force. I'm the chair of the reentry
committee, and one of the things
that we are seeing is the lack of services inside our san francisco county jails. As we
heard cedric story and how
programing and getting him the right tools to be successful can help someone stay alive, free.
We have more lockdowns than we
do programing. We have more
visits with debbie, high staff
and behavior issues because they're not letting us in. There
is no community access unless
the sheriff, the chiefs, they can say, yes, we have programing . Here goes our agenda. Here goes. That's not what's happening. When you get to the gates at san bruno county jail,
aka rikers island, they don't let you in. There is no programing happening. There was
about 40 to 50 inmates that were
transferred from san bruno, san
francisco county jail, 2 to 5 to the annex. And it looks like a concentration camp back there. People are there with lack of services. People don't have, they don't have. They're working on their wi-fi right now.
There's always an excuse as to why people are not being served.
Enough is enough. I just met with the with our district
attorney on monday, and she's
saying, well, people need to be held accountable. We understand. And I'm someone who believes in accountability, but I also believe in her ability mission. and if we're going to stick
people inside our jails to have for public safety, then let's start working on her visitation and it is the sheriff's office responsibility to help give the
community access. We get funding
by dcyf, by id, we have outcomes
to fulfill, but if we don't have the access to walk in these jails to provide our service so that we can have people stay
alive and free, guess what? It's going to be a cycle. People are going to get out and they're
going to go back in. As someone who is the director of strategic partnership for pretrial, I see it all the time. We are trying to connect people, but we need access. The sheriff says one thing in his leadership is doing
something different. There's a disconnect and I hope I'm so happy that we have someone in charge that's going to come in
now with a different lens, and it's not going to be them inspecting themselves. So thank
you.
Everyone. My name is dakota rose
austin. Um, she her I'm a trans
parolee presently at this time I
was incarcerated, um, in the state of california for 26
years. When I was 19 years old, me and two best friends that were also trans. We killed a man
in a hotel room. Um, um, I did my time and finished my education while I was incarcerated. And when I got out or toward the end of my
incarceration, I recognized the indifference of the
rehabilitation process by specifically for the trans community. Um, and the state
facilities, as well as in local like san francisco here. County,
um, there's not enough trans representation as far as the
instructors for these rehabilitative recourse programs that are trans and coming in. So
that the parolees are or inmates that are in the trans community, we can relate to, um, that it
matters a whole lot. Um, and the resources as well. Yes. There
are are reentry programs that are coed. I was placed into a
coed program here in san francisco when I got out of prison. 2022 thanksgiving
morning. Um, the coed program accepted the funds and financing for all the other trans individuals that were considered
residents. Um, but we were treated more like inmates again.
And the treatment came from the
lack of understanding, empathy, understanding. And you know, again, the curriculum on working
with my demographic. You can't just say, I'll take someone because they're trans and they automatically look at the cloak
of the lgbtq community and
there's tears in this community,
and the trans community is all the way at the bottom. We're not
respected in the aspects of when we're placed into these reentry programs. I had to fight, kick
and scream to get showers for
the girls, shower curtains. Um,
specify side rooms. There might be trans individuals that are in
a wheelchair that are 88 ada. It
was an array of issues that are going on at all of these residences. Um, I'm also
familiar with one of his as well. The billie holiday, the man akbar. Um, and his program does good work. I have some girlfriends that have been through there, but again, these programs don't specify enough
for this community. And you can
go to the lgbt, q center and all these other resources and, uh,
organizations in the city. Um
they have no relationship with
you guys. They can make referrals and that's it. But they don't really have direct
relationship to where they can refer something as far as a
program, um, specified housing for the trans community. I think
there's only one for us. Correct
in the city, I think. Yeah and
this is the gay capital of the world, ladies and gentlemen,
there's a lot there's a big population of transgender and
gay in mates. And so we need better resources. And I think
that we should consider bringing some, some, some, some ideas to
the table in conjunction with some of the places that we already have around town. City.
Now, thank you. Good afternoon folks. Uh, my name is joshua
jacobo. I'm a service provider
in the county jail. Both three and two. Could you repeat your last name and spell it? Uh,
yeah. Jacobo jacobo. First name?
Joshua but I'm coming to you
today as a, um, concerned citizen of san francisco. Um, you know, the annex was
mentioned earlier with the latino population just really think of the optics of how bad that looks. A certain
demographic is just shoved into a back part of the jail.
Services are limited. Um, you
know, it's just really tragic. So I just want you guys to really, really just imagine how bad those optics are. And again, throughout the jail, um, you
know, the lockdowns, we might
have services for folks and we might be getting somewhere with folks. Right we might be, um, progressing in the rehabilitation lockdowns happen, you know, their mental health
declines as a part of that. Um, and a lot of progress. We're constantly doing two steps forward, one step back, you know, and it's very disheartening to see some of these young men who maybe start
to have a few, um, breakthrough
moments themselves. And that is
just constantly having to be, um
, how do I put what word am I looking for? You know, start basically starting over in the rehabilitation. It's very frustrating as a service provider and as a citizen. And if our priority here is safety,
right. How are we going to achieve that goal if we're
constantly limiting the services
that assure that. Right. So
yeah, and I think one thing, um, yeah, that's it for today. Thank
you. Thank you. Do we have
anybody else.
Yeah. I'm just going to. Good afternoon. My name is greta garcia and I'm with the reset justice collaborative for baker
here in san francisco. So. I
hear this man, MR. Akbar, sharing his experience and
advocating for programing. Is this the right place for me to voice my frustration with the
lack of rehabilitation services
and programing as a contracted
partner? In fact, there are
human rights violations inside the county jail. Instead of
hiring culturally responsive
individuals, they're hire
someone with abusive talk,
virtuous behavior. What will we
do for our people who have
voices but are being unheard?
Thank you. Do you have anybody
else before I open up to questions and comments from my
board members, we'll also have public comment after this item as well. So um, starting with
you, um, member go. Yeah, I just
wanted to thank the speakers for coming up and sharing their
experience. Um, oftentimes I
think we're you asked to share the most traumatic parts of our
lives. Um amongst strangers just
to prove our credibility. But um
. I just want to say thank you. Thank you. Uh, member nguyen.
Uh, yes. Uh, a question for
cedric. Um, first of all, thank you for the detail presentation of all the programs. Uh, uh,
very educational. Um regarding the, uh, you mentioned the stabilization, the stable stabilization center was very similar to the navigation center, but you had something
more unique than they did. No, no, no, no, I was saying they were trying to call it a
navigation center, but I said
stabilization centers is what's needed. Where you have medical
care, mental health services and
drug treatment services and a
safe place to be where you don't
have to have be referred word.
You don't have to, you know, go
through a, a assessment process
where df is always requiring people to have for people to be able to immediately access a bed at that moment. So basically,
the walk in without the referrals, the main. Exactly.
And you don't have to be just as involved. You don't have to, you
know. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Okay member. Yes, I want to echo
what member emanuel said in terms of thanking you for coming
forward and speaking so candidly
and explained the emotions that you feel very rawly I know how difficult that is. Uh, the
import of what you're saying are some of the things member palmer and I heard when we visited county jail three in SEPTEMBER.
Um, I do have some specific
questions. Um, for MISS
Hernandez. You had mentioned, um
, uh, no. No. Community access
can you give us some specifics about that, about what? What people have been told about, you
know, the where is this
happening? When is it happening?
Uh, just to give us a clear sense of what you're talking about, I would say there's just
no consistent process. Um one
day you are able to get access, meaning you're able to go
through the clearance process, which was virtually, but now is
in person. Um, there's just no consistency. I think that the programs department of the sheriff's office needs a lot of help. And, I mean, they have all
these 8420s that make over 100 plus thousand a year. I just don't understand what so much manpower. Why are we still in this situation? So there's just
inconsistency on how someone can
get clear to go in the jail to
provide, uh, programing or when
you get there to facilitate your
class, you're told so sorry,
we're not at our minimum. Uh the
program is canceled, so. So it's
just it's up and down. I just give you another example. The latino task force, um, volunteer
geared its services during latino heritage month, and we
walked into a pod that was
called, um, uh, it was a it was a it was a it was a rehabilitation pod. And they were providing substance abuse
classes of that pod. It was 46
men. Of the 46 men, 20 of them were latino out of the 20
latinos, 19 were from honduras and one was from puerto rico. Not none of them spoke english, but the puerto rican, but they
were housed in this pod to get
rehabilitation services. But
none of the staff spoke spanish, so there was no cultural
competency. So why not? We have all these programs that are funded by the department of
public public health, by dcyf,
by odd. Like we can go in there and provide this service, but staff want to be treated with respect. And I'm not saying all deputized staff are not, because I worked in that jail for eight
years and I got some some
friends who I love very dearly.
One just retired chief fisher. Deputy bryant for the record, are amazing deputized staff who treat people with humanity. But there are some ones that need some training on how to work
with people. So and you also know, said the sheriff, says one
thing and his leadership says something else. Can you give us examples? And when you say leadership, who who are you referring to? And one reason I'm asking this is that one of the inspector general's, um, most
significant authorities will be
to conduct audits is to take a systematic look at procedures in
the jail, look at data, compare
it, look at best practices. So that's why I'm asking that. And I also want to know what suggest you have or what areas we could ask the inspector general to audit and examine. Well I was going to say this during public comment, but I'll just put on,
um, noah's grandma hat on. So noah's grandmother, I'm my son,
visits that jail to visit my son, who has been incarcerated
for seven years. Right now in
san francisco county jail. We
lost 3 to 4 years because of the
pandemic, no trials, etc. So we're we're starting over again.
I'm here not to say that people don't need to be held accountable. People are being
are innocent till proven. My son
is innocent till proven guilty. And in that jail. But his
visitation with his his son
should be a priority. There is
the leadership of the department says one thing about parent child visits and the sheriff
says he wants to break generational incarceration and bringing children together. I
made a complaint in regards to what happened with my son a couple of weekends ago, because
my son's my grandson wanted to
use the bathroom and he told his dad, dad, I need to go to the bathroom. So my son got up and said, excuse me, 8420 department of rehabilitation coordinator.
My son needs to use the restroom
and he told the program staff from one family, they said, the
bathrooms right there, my son
walks to the bathroom and takes them because he told them where
the bathroom was, where my son was supposedly, per the sheriff's office, messed up was
he closed the door. They said that the deputy needed to be there with him, and that the
program staff needed to be in the bathroom. My grandson does not have a sf number. My grandson does not wear orange. He should not be treated like an inmate and have a deputy watch him use the bathroom. That is
unacceptable. It's unacceptable for volunteer staff from one
family to be in a bathroom with a six year old child. So when I sit there and made a complaint
or I wouldn't even call it a complaint, I wrote down and vented about what happened
because noah said that that the police yelled at his teacher because his daddy took him to the bathroom. So the one family
staff were yelled at in front of
the inmates in front of the
children because she let my son let my grandson use the bathroom. There was no consistency on how they run
things. The in-custody chief MAY
say one thing and MAY want her jail to run a certain way, which I have a lot of respect for her.
But the staff under her MAY do things a lot differently. So that's what I mean, that there's just people run that jail differently. Just the parent
child visits is they haven't updated their policy in years,
years, in years. But because joanna brought it to their attention now they're updating
the policy and guess what happens? My son gets in trouble and gets shipped from k-2 to
k-3. And now my grandson has to travel 50 miles to go to san bruno county jail to visit his father because we brought it to their attention. So you can't I
know now, today I took a risk. I told my family last night and I
told my son I was coming here, I
son, I said, son, be ready. They
might beat you up. They might take your mail, they might strip
you naked. They might hurt you
because I'm going to speak up
for you, milton. Be ready because I'm going to fight for
you. So today, today, I'm saying publicly that something might
happen to my son because I'm
here today. Some thing has to
give. I get follow the rules.
But I hope MR. Wiley, he got a big job ahead of him. And I hope that the department, I hope they give him the right budget for
the staffing he needs because he has a big job. The sheriff's office has always run like rikers island and runs on, like
a little island on its own.
Thank you. Shamann walton. Thank
you. Because we need it. This
I'm very disheartened and
concerned to hear that a mother
has to feel fearful for her son's treatment because she speaks in a public forum. No one
should have to fear speaking out and telling the truth. Um, so
I'm I'm very disturbed to hear
that, um, um, I don't know if you can speak, but MR. Garcia talked about human rights violations inside the jail. If she wants to talk about that. But I'd like to know what specific human rights violations people feel are taking place inside the jail. If you feel comfortable talking about that in this forum, um, I there's
just so many things I don't
know, I just for me, it's more
about, um, that little child's
experience walking in that jail. It's not even about my son right
now because he has to do the
time and he has to follow the rules. He has to do whatever he has to do. Do that. And if he
breaks the rules in there, then follow the process and title, whatever. 1315 whatever they call that thing and follow the rules. My thing is about noah. Why does noah have to be
punished? Why does noah have to
suffer now? He has to go from pittsburgh because we're displaced out of san francisco because we can't afford to live
here. A native san franciscan, born and raised in the mission, who has to live now in pittsburgh, california, and learn about pruning trees because I didn't have that growing up to now having to travel here to take my grandson to see his dad. Five fauci five plus miles because they removed him from cj two because I sent
an email. They're going to make up some story and say, oh, because we moved him, because he's not going to trial right now, of course. But we all know that they're upset because I
said something and I cc the
board of icc to everybody, but I
know this is a long fight, so I'm not going to even touch
that. But let's let's, let's create a better space for children. Let's break that cycle in incarceration. Because guess what? Noah's not only my responsibility as his grandmother, but he's your responsibility. And like the
elders in my community said, noah is your nephew and I need you guys to take care of noah
because he's our responsibility. I want noah to be the next
miyamoto. I want noah to be the
next london. So I ask you, I plead for you. Let's work together to break these cycles
of incarceration. So there's I we can go on and on. I just I'm going to just let the what we
all voted for with san franciscans voted for to have
this, you know, MR. Wiley, be in the position that he's in and
hopefully to see the change. And I'm and I do want to say for the record, that I respect MR. Miyamoto and the work that he's
done and is this is stuff that's happening way is deeper than than what sheriff miyamoto can
do. So thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. I appreciate you joining. I mean, this is bringing things to light that we need. And just for the record, you've probably seen my background. I'm fourth generation san franciscan. So,
um, paul miyamoto is a native san franciscan, as is member mango. We want to make our san francisco better and so unless people come and speak out, I also want to let everyone know
here that even if you can't come and personally testify or are in
any way fearful, um, please,
please email us at s d o b at sf
gov. Org we also want to keep a running list of particular resources so that it's on our
website. So that is my personal
commitment. Um, I've also worked really hard in trying to make things consistent. So coming up with forms, you know, member
wynne talked about having forms because if we're going to ask for information, um, the public
has the right to know how we're going to use that information, given that we're accountable when we're asking for things. And he made a suggestion about forms and getting information.
So that's in the works. Um and I'm very much about a process person. So I like consistency and forms. And hopefully you'll see that from me. And as
PRESIDENT You have my commitment . But um, so I want you to hold
me accountable. And my board accountable by, um, attending the meetings. And if you can't, please email us. So we follow up
on particular things, but we rely on the public. Um, I'm an
attorney for a public agency. We can't be eyes and ears
everywhere. So we rely upon the public to give us information. And thank you for your bravery.
And as you probably know, I was on the commission on the status of women for 12 years. So that
is why, especially for children,
we want to make sure that there's visitation with parents and even those who have been incarcerated because of domestic violence. We want a place where a child feels safe. Still, having the relationship with a
parent. So um, you know, keep informing us. Thank you. So,
member brewster, do you have
comments and questions or.
Joanna, I am noah still. I think we absolutely needed to have a meeting like this. Now that we have our ig in place, it was the biggest charge that we were
charged with as a body. And so
now it's time to continue to
roll up our sleeves and get to work. But I want to say, I heard
each and every one of you, I see each and every one of you, and I value every single one of you.
Cedric maggie, joanna, dakota,
josh, noah, greta, and you all
know me in terms of my work and community, my organization
touches baker ldf. We have
reentry services in bayview hunters point, so this is very
near and dear to my heart. So i want to make sure that I also offer to be the board member
alongside my colleagues, to really work with folks in community to make sure that we have those services that we know our brothers, our sisters, our
aunts and uncles need here in
san francisco. So you have my
word on that. Thank you. And I just want to remind everyone here that we do have what was originally called the equal access to services ordinance, and I actually worked on that
legislation back in 1999. Um,
9899. Um, and it is law. It's now the language access
ordinance. So every city agency
is required to provide interpretive services.
Translated services. So we need
to know if that's not happening.
And cultural competence doesn't
just mean language. As cedric
aptly pointed out, it also means community because different communities have different ways
of supporting someone in reentry
to make sure that they're they don't have to go back to jail because they have the support of community. They have supportive
services to lead productive
lives. So I just want to put that out there. Um, we all need to work together. It's not just
any one individual. Well um, and
I think, you know, janet, you aptly pointed out a lot of this, these, these institutional things happened over the years. So it's not one particular
person. So that's why we have to work together. The budget's going to be very difficult. So
as we're looking for the budget, I know our inspector general has
such a huge lift to do, especially with the budget and
resources. I think I made that
clear at his swearing in in DECEMBER. He made that very clear that we need to have resources to do what we want to
do. We've been very conservative about the budget, even just rolling out some of the priorities. So if you see in
today's meeting, I'm all about setting up the priorities and
having benchmarks, what we can
do. I'm very honest with people like, we got to the point where we hired an inspector general. I
said, we cannot worry about anything else until we have budget inspector general, and now we're focused on budget, but we're also focused on hearing from folks like you, from the
public defender's office and down the road. I'm also, you know, asking about jail health. So that's going to come down the line. Then towards the fall, we actually are finally able to get to policy. So as we're looking
at our charter mandates, looking
at the use of force and that
kind of thing. So it's a step at
a time. But hopefully this will give you some idea of, you know, having particular direction. I don't have meetings for the sake of meetings. I don't call on people. But there's a rhyme or reason to why I'm getting to
where I am. And if you have any
other ideas, I don't consider a criticism. I consider it, you
know, meeting the needs of the community. So please weigh in
early and often. So I thank you all for being here. And you know
where to reach us. And as member bruckner said, we're all about community. I mean, that's why
we're serving here. Um, and, um,
it takes a lot of bravery. And,
you know, my best wishes to all of your families and know that you can rely on this board for
additional support. Um, with that, I'm going to ask for
public comments. For members of the public would like to make public comment on line item for presentation from the reentry community. Please approach the
podium when it is free. So good afternoon. My name is sylvie pagan. I am an intensive case manager with community works
west. I'm also, um, uh, work
with the nova. The nova violence
alliance project. Um, I'm here because, yes, there's a lot of
concerns, uh, with the work that
we do in terms of support with
community, I was, um, a program
manager for the one family, um,
prior to or previously, um, to
the work that I've done, and I
can, um, I can attest, and I
can, uh, just say, you know
what, joanna was saying? That there is some challenges when
we're doing the work. So I do
want to also know that, um, I,
I've been asking for, for, um,
access to support the latino,
uh, reentry. Um. Inmates that
are in the jails. And I just
wanted to make, um, an
announcement that I, I, my
colleague and I, jose gomez, who
also is part of the nova project
and myself, will be starting,
um, uh, a latino, uh, program,
um, starting next week. But this
is just a seed in a large bucket
of many, many needs that we need
for community. So kind of what
cedric was, um, or express in
that we need to come together. We need community to provide
these types of services. Um, as starting this group, um, next
week, um, is great, but i definitely want to see more. I want to see, uh, more programs.
I want to see us thrive, serve as community members going into
the jail and just stopping that
recidivism that is taking place.
So I ask for consideration to
continue with the funding for these programs as it's much,
much needed. And we want to come and work with you all to see how we can continue and expand these
programs. But I just want to say
thank you. Thank you. Um, so I
just wanted to say one other thing that was on top of mind. So as I'm coming down to more closer to retirement than
actually launching a career, um,
it dawned on me early on when I was sitting on the commission on the status of women that we treat language access as an afterthought, even though we
have this law on the books, it is my dream to make sure that
every application for a federal grant, every application for a city, and county or a state
grant has have a line item on
language access. And I told people there should not be any
kind of second guessing at a bare minimum of what is on your ballot. So there should not be
any kind of guess. And then it would be an opt out that you don't have language access, because I think it's an absolute must. So I need, you know, the community weigh in. But those are the kinds of things that
after years and years of working with community, that sticks with
us. And so hoping that it's
going to be there. I think it's an advancement, you know, the sheriff's office, they do have
badges so that people know what
languages are available to them
and their law enforcement officers in the city and county also carry breast pocket cards to make sure that there's
language access when, um, we realize that a person is not
english proficient. So, um,
thank you all for being here. And do we have any more? I have
one more comment. I just want to say if anyone is retali against in the jail is mistreated
because of relative or a friend speaks out that is misconduct.
We should know about it. The department of police accountability should know about it. I've been an investigator for many years and oversight,
and that is strictly prohibited.
We need to protect anyone, one who wants to come forward and
make a complaint and voice a
concern and have them feel
assured that they will be
protected, that they will not be retaliated against. So I say
that to everyone here. Please tell your friends and relatives in the jail if they do experience mistreatment or
retaliation. You need to let us know. You need to let the department of police accountability know through a specific complaint, which I
believe can be done, uh, on
behalf of someone else, or
anonymously. These things need
to be brought into public view, and anyone who's responsible for violating the sheriff's
department policies needs to be. That needs to be brought to
light so it can be addressed.
There should there should be no excuse for not behaving in a
professional manner. Okay so I
think we're ready for the next agenda. I'm being a little conscientious about time because
we're going to take photos. Do you have more public comment? Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Apologize. Yes. Please come
forward. Yeah and actually,
before you get up to the podium, I just wanted to, um, let people know that I got a belated text message from, um, member. Carry on. And she's got a sick child
at home. So after the remainder of the public comment, I'll ask for an excused absence. Thank
you, thank you. Um my name is bianca sanchez. I am with the
bay area community resources. I'm a program manager for the
roadmap to peace initiative. Um and as a member and provider of the community, I have been seeing less access, um, for community partners to go inside
and to provide services for
incarcerated population. Um, and reentry services. And I want to know what is the plan to collaborate with the community
to be part of the reentry process and plans? I also want to know what is the plan to allow access for community partners to go in and provide services and programing as members of the community? We are culturally competent. We implement a healing centered
approach and have a trauma informed lenses making us more
equipped to provide services as
um and support inside the jails. Because of because of this, if you work in this with this population, you must know that there is a correlation between
trauma and involvement with the
justice system. Sorry, I'm
looking at my notes. So as trained professionals we can provide the effective
intervention treatment and rehabilitation services to break
the cycles of incarceration.
Thank you. Thank you. Hello. My
name is victoria reminick and I am a senior case manager for
roadmap to peace through bay area community resource. As a
case manager, I have not seen any referrals coming in from the
nuevos destinos program. Um, I find this incredibly disheartening as the nuevos destinos partnership provides
monolingual spanish speakers with the services they so desperately need, such as case
managers, esl, and trauma informed care. In an effort to reduce recidivism and help improve racial equity for the
latinx population. I just wanted to express how invaluable programs such as nuevos destinos are, and I ask for your consideration to continue funding for these programs.
Thank you. Oh, good afternoon,
my name is araceli garcia murcia
from baker. I'm a senior case manager with reset justice collaborative. The reentry I'm
working with, um, at risk youth
from 14 to 26 years old. Um, I advocate for them. Um in the
courtroom all across california.
But um, I wanted to come up here
and agree with maggie, who is working with latino risk services and not just regular, just for latinos, but also
general population like the undocumented monolingual that joanna was speaking of. And the
annex, how they come as an encampment and how they're treating them, the clients who
lack resources and mental health . When speaking of the human,
um, I'm also part of my sister's initiative keeper, where we did
a human rights summit introducing the human rights,
saying that basic, even basic
needs aren't met inside the jail
system. Um, as well as women who are prenatal. I have clients on
my caseload who are pregnant and
who get who recidivate, even if it's for a couple of months or a couple of weeks, their prenatal services aren't up to par where
they should be. Um, when you say in making san francisco better, how are we making san francisco better? By giving our homeless
people or adults needles and
everything like we're supposed
to do preventative work, not make it worse. Worse? Like my
clients have used the billie holiday services. So I have
rapport with MR. Akbar. And how
they've helped my clients. Just
get on the straight path. Um,
with this position often comes vicarious trauma within our own mental health. Like mental
health with ourselves. At least
once a month. Two, 1 to 2 of our youth are shot and killed.
Whether it's in the mission in
bayview west point or in, um,
even through fentanyl, and which
is another, uh, like the
fentanyl cases, like most of my monolinguals have been picking
up drug cases as well. But
they're like, um, it's sorry, the fentanyl cases just to make
ends meet, killing our community , countless by busts and felony
accounts for $400 to pay for
basic needs such as food or
anything to just ask to rent. Um
prior to working for baker, I did work for a pretrial, so I
did notice, like the 250 to 300 case load management monolingual
clients that were on my caseload that were just all fentanyl
cases. At what point did we start looking at it as human trafficking? Because they're coming here just to make ends meet, to prepare for the better
living. And it's not they don't obtain the mental health services that they need. They don't get the quality, support and lack of services that we
used to. We used to have jobs
and stipends and everything to
support anybody and everybody in the community, especially during
covid. Now, where did all that
go? Like it just started going
downhill. I just feel like we
try our best to do preventative work to make sure that our clients stay alive and free, and that they make poor decisions just to try to make ends meet in san francisco. And I'm able to say that because I am a san francisco native, I've been here for born and raised kaiser hospital. So I've been I'm lucky to actually still stay here. I'm
in the portola district, but
I've seen it all and of all of
our providers, that it's dear to our heart that it's sad that we do preventative work just for
that to be shot and killed in
six feet under. So so thank you.
Thank you. Hello. My name is jose hernandez. I'm the program director for central american resource center's second chance youth program and tattoo removal
clinic. We work with, uh, young
people, 14 up to 20 for, uh, prevention and reentry work, aftercare. Um, just it's
interesting that out of the
people who are being placed in what is effectively the most structurally dangerous holding cell in jails in the city county of san francisco, a majority are
are in similar nationality and
country of origin. My question
is, how is it that there's a large number of people similar in race and national origin or
place of birth that are being held in the annex, not
discriminatory practices where the majority in the annex are
latinx and the majority of those
are from specific race, ancestry , origin, or national or place
of birth. Secondly, it shows how much about this board, the
powers that be that is allowing people, community organizations,
city and county employees to work in what the city inspectors deemed as a seismic life hazard
in 2017, that is, an earthquake. That in an earthquake would
present a crisis situation and what is going on in the tenderloin can and will not be solved by mass incarcerate. When you throw 40 dealers in jail,
another 40 will pop up the
scapegoat changes through different generations so it changes demographics of who's
being blamed about the situation in the tenderloin and the drug
dealing in san francisco. And
it's absurd to think that it is the fault of these specific groups, but more a failed institution. Racial profiling practices and the fact that in order to get all of these amazing programs things as an
adult, to get fast track into firefighting programs that are
held in the county, to have
housing and stable food, you
need to go to jail first. Thank
you. Thank you. Do we have any
more public comment. Okay. Seeing none, dan, the next agenda item, please. Um could we
take a five minute bio break before we go to that item? Um,
sure. Thank you.
Venmo.
Meeting back to order. At 325.
Thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT. Do
we have a motion to excuse vice
PRESIDENT Carrion? Uh, so.
Moved. Do I have a second?
Second? All those in favor? Aye
any opposed? Motion carries next item on the agenda, please. Dan colleen. Line item five.
Quarterly and annual report. Discussion and possible action
item review and discuss. Spo
zdob evaluations and outreach
for q4 and the 2023 annual report. Due to the sheriff and
board of supervisors pursuant to
sf charter 4.137 okay colleagues
. So, um, I'm working with the
inspector general on just templates in terms of what we want data to look like, and then
the report. So the sheriff's office doesn't have to guess. Um, it's I think, um, chief ju did a nice comprehensive report
the last time, and if we want more detail, we should include it possibly in the template, and
see what can be released. And what passes muster with their
general counsel. So um, that's
going to be on the table. But right now we need to look at the quarterly report. And then the annual report. We've got a
deadline to submit it. Um, next month. But we actually, dan, correct me if I'm wrong to have a resolution that we've approved
something so that you can submit
it. Is that true? We need to submit it. Excuse me. We need to submit a resolution to the board of supervisors, and they'll put
it on the gao committee to, um, recommend. Okay. Thank you. So first we're going to look at the q4 report. And then there's an
annual report. I did a lot of the text and, and, um, member
mango did a beautiful summary.
So it's always in the works and
down the road we'll have a lot more when it comes to data from the ig. But this is, um, thank you for your efforts. And we
were all on zoom calls late at night after she finished travel. And strained her eyes to keep
them open while we had a meeting
at. And so I'd like, um, you to
review and then, as appropriate,
to have motions to approve or,
um, any kind of comments. Uh,
yes, I have a comment. As I
noted to you in email a couple of weeks ago, there's an
inaccuracy in the annual report under JANUARY 2023, where it
says vice PRESIDENT Zoshi carrion moved to have a committee on the classification considerations of an inspector
general with vp. Carrion and member julie de su as committee members. The motion was solely
to have a committee with um vp
carrion as the as the head, and I can read that from the
minutes. All right. So I'm going to say, since I sit next to her, it might not have gotten
captured. And so she said, any volunteers? And I said I will volunteer. And so she said, I, I'm on it. So um, I put it
together. But obviously from the next meeting too. And
unfortunately, vice PRESIDENT Carrion isn't here because she wants a comment on that. Um,
then at the FEBRUARY meeting, I was elected to be the liaison to
H.R. So I actually was there to
draft and work with the job announcement and work with the
hr. Well, I don't think the annual report should misstate
the motion as it's described in the minutes, which says vice
PRESIDENT Karen makes a motion to create a task force committee
to work with DR. For the process process of soliciting resumes
and to access and present a recommendation on whether we need support to create a job post and a return with an update
to the board of supervisors. So
what I am going to propose is
that it, um. Uh, it's going to say vice PRESIDENT Carrion moved to have a committee on the qualification considerations of
inspector general, period. And the motion passed unanimously with all members present. Um,
vice PRESIDENT Carrion and
member julie de su um were
committee members? Uh, no. I also was supposed to be a
committee member. So that was that wasn't captured in the minutes either. So I don't know what you how you want to handle this, but I don't want to belabor a particular point because we have a lot to do. Um,
but I want us to be accurate. And vice PRESIDENT Carrion did send me an email on JANUARY
ninth talking about scheduling a committee meeting with you and I
and her indicating that I was supposed to be a part of that committee. So I think the annual
report should be accurate. So
should adhere. Okay, so but member wechter at no point did
you participate in the committee . So I'm not even aware that you
were a committee member. And also in the FEBRUARY minutes, you made a motion to appoint
yourself to be the liaison to
hr, and you were. And that motion did not even get a second. There was a subsequent motion to make me the liaison and then I was voted in as
liaison. And you were PRESIDENT At the time. So I don't want to go back and rehash. We're trying to move forward and get things
done. So I'm just trying to do a
compromise with you and reword that particular motion. You were
not. It's clear that you were not a committee member and you were not made a committee
member. And um, you could have joined, but you didn't join. So
I don't know how to handle this. I don't really want to rehash
PRESIDENT Kerry and send me that email indicating that I don't remember. Yes. And the question is, did you participate? I was
not allowed to participate. Um, it was open. We couldn't have we
couldn't have a we were we were
we had a special meeting posted as well. So you didn't even attend. So I don't know how to
address this, I did attend, I was told I couldn't speak that
we can only observe. So I want the report to be factual and
accurate. That's all I'm saying.
I did volunteer to be on that committee. I very much wanted to be on that committee. I had a lot to bring to that committee and vice PRESIDENT Carrion
recognized that in the email she sent me in JANUARY. Not so I don't want history. Okay, I'm going to say you're reading more. I'm not speaking for member carrion and neither should you. You tend to want to speak for members who are present. But member carrion is
not even present today. So I was here. I did the work for an
entire year. I think I know who
contributed and at no point did
you actually weigh in in a productive manner. I just have to say so. And you were present
at the time. So I just want to go back and I didn't finish about reword. Adding this, she moved to have, um, a committee
period. And I'm going to say that I was on the committee because you're not you weren't on the committee. So I'm just I
just want to finish this so that dan can capture this because we
do need to approve this. Um report today. Well I'm sorry you're resorting to personal attacks again. It really is.
Does not help the member. Let's not go. Excuse me. Let's. No,
no, no. Right now we are conducting this meeting. Getting
this through. I don't want to go back again. You're taking everything as personal attacks and they are not personal attacks. I am you're you're alleging a particular factual
thing. I was there, I'm doing
the work. So I can attest personally for the factual
thing. I don't want you to speak on behalf of member carrion or any members here. I was there,
so let's let's reword this to the stated that I did not
contribute at all. I amassed all
the job descriptions from other
agencies of similar the inspector general and executive positions. I put together the spreadsheet of the salaries of comparable positions, which is the reason. Thank you member
wechter and that it's fine to
cull information, but the work actually had to be done to
actually draft a job description . So could I make a suggestion just sorry, sorry, I thought you were done. No. So. So let's
let's stop this for a moment and just move on and get this done. I don't want to go into the
particulars for minutia. Um, so. So I'm sorry. Um, well, I was
just going to suggest that maybe you just say special subcommittee form to advance ig recruitment period, and you
don't have to settle the issue
that you're disagreeing on right now. Just. Well, I mean, I that, I mean, I didn't yeah, I didn't fully finish. I want to stop it at that. But it's clear that vice PRESIDENT Carrion and I staffed that committee meeting. So I think it's appropriate. And
accurate to state that in
JANUARY it was just a suggestion. Just thank you. Thank you. But I thought that I would I thought that that would have taken care of it when I,
when I cut off that sentence and said, who actually served on the
committee. So I'd also like to propose that as a attachments to the end report, we include the minutes of all the meetings, which include public comment
we've seen here tonight that the comments from members of the public are valuable. I think
there are things the sheriff needs to hear, and the board of supervisors needs to hear. We can't expect the sheriff to watch the recordings of these meetings. So I am requesting that the minutes from all the
meetings in 2023 be attached as
an appendix to that. So that is noted. And in general, the minutes are not attached. We can make a reference for people to
actually go, um, onto the website. But even reading the
minutes alone is insufficient. I think if people really want to delve deeply, they're going to actually watch the video
archives. Well, I'll make a motion that that the annual report. Excuse me. We want to finish this particular wording.
So, so you can make a motion. But we're not even finished with the particular wording in
JANUARY. So, um, I'm going to so
we're going to stop here. It's going to say vp so she can move to have a committee on the qualification consideration of an inspector general. Period and
then the motion passed unanimously with all members
present. And then it says vp,
um, carry on, served on the on
the committee. And that committee would then be capitalized. I'm going to take
off the word members and that's
the last sentence under that
first paragraph. So do I have
anything from anyone else? Can
you reread, um, your proposal?
Yes. So um, the first sentence
is the same. So um, at its JANUARY 2023 regular meeting, zdob made great strides to advance its charge to hire an inspector general, ig vice
PRESIDENT. Vp shashikiran moved to have a committee on the qualification considerations of an inspector general. Period.
The motion passed unanimously, with all members present.
Period. Um late. Um and then and
then we will have vp carrion and
member julie de su served on the
committee. Capital c, and then
later that same month, the committee held a special meeting
to solicit public input. Dan,
did you get that? Yes. Okay. Thank you. I don't believe
that's accurate and I won't
support that. I'm sorry. What
does it say in the minutes? In
the minutes, it says. Vote on motion to create a committee
that will work with DR. To prepare a job description which will be presented and updated first to the board and then to
proceed to the next step, which would be posting it and making the list. And then it lists the eyes and the nays and says the
motion passes. And what do you
propose? Be changed or added. Simply that it say that there was a vote to create a committee
with member su as the, uh, how
was it phrased? Well, with was
exactly what is in here
.
That was FEBRUARY. So if we want to be so, so I think I captured it because in FEBRUARY there was a formal vote to make me the
liaison. So. I don't want to split hairs, but I'm pretty
familiar with everything because I went through all the minutes
and I did the work with DR. So I'm pretty familiar and
unfortunately. Member carrion, vice PRESIDENT Carrion isn't
here
.
So any motions put out there? I mean, I'm actually I'm in agreeance. I think we should make sure that we're consistent in terms of, you know, what it is that we're providing, especially from the annual
report. If it's reflective of our minutes. Yeah from a meeting
that we had. So I think I think the way that it's stated is reflective because in FEBRUARY we actually state that I was
vote as, as the liaison. So I don't want to put that in. In
JANUARY, I think. And if I'm hearing correctly, you want to
have in JANUARY that there was.
That it was a vote to make sure
that we had a committee correct.
Mhm. Yes we're talking about the
JANUARY 2023. Yeah so it's in
there.
So it's just JANUARY three that we're. Yes. Debating about. Okay. Yes. And then you're
saying um. Number that we're
going to cross out that last line. We're going to move this
over. So it's this and then we have this sentence and it's
period here. And then the um,
the motion passed and then this
and then this sentence. Vice PRESIDENT, carry on. Members served on the committee. And then later that same month, this committee held a special meeting to solicit public input. Got it.
Yeah my only suggestion. Was if there was disagreement on who was on the committee. Um and
different memories of what happened in the minutes didn't reflect who were members of the committee from that meeting in
JANUARY, that you just leave that out in order to move on. That that was my only suggestion. I know, but we did. But we did have a notice of special meeting. So that notice was obviously there with who the committee members were. And I
was just trying to move us forward. No, I get it. And I'm trying to move forward because I
want to get to the test. The priorities. Um, because that's a
burning issue with member. Go. To.
So dan, did I guess we should actually do the quarterly report because we didn't even do the quarterly report. We should actually we're approving them in
two separate motions, right. Is
there any discussion on the q4
report? That I would like to see
the minutes from the OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER meetings attached as an appendix to the
quarterly report. Is that by way
of motion, member wagner, I move
that we approve the fourth quarter report with the minutes
of the OCTOBER ober, NOVEMBER and DECEMBER meetings attached
as an appendix. Thank you. Is
there a second? There is no
second. Any other discussion on
I think that on these reports we
can actually have a note at the
end that minutes and, um, video
recordings are available. On our
website. And govtv. I'll make a
motion to approve the fourth
quarter. Um report. Thank you.
Is there a second, second? Thank
you. Did you want to add the addendum that, um, uh, PRESIDENT
Su stayed it and that the
minutes and video are available?
Sure. Thank you. Yeah I guess we
can add that to it. So it's a
motion to approve the fourth quarter. Uh, report as is, but also make reference to the minutes as well as the
recordings on our website. Thank
you. For members of the public who would like to make public comment on line. Item five, q4 report, please approach the
podium when it is free. There
appears to be no public comment
calling the roll on q4 report.
Member chaim engel. Huamango is I member bruckner I. Bruckner is
I member nguyen I win is I
member su I su is I member
wechter no vector is no. The
motion passes by majority vote.
The 2023 q4 report is adopted. Thank you. And dan, I just had a clarification because sometimes when I want to watch the recordings, I actually go directly to wskg-tv, but I'm not sure that our website has a
link. Should we? Is it there or should we link it up or just have a notation on our website?
Uh, there. Was a link at the end
of the minutes, but I'm not sure if it's a clickable okay link. So maybe we'll revisit that and
see if it just if it could be one click from us. Otherwise
we'll make a notation to go to sp govtv. Yes thank you. Okay.
So back to the annual report. So
I do want to I do want jason. Uh
uh, board member wechter to get
some credit for the work that he helped with the job posting, because I did I did remember he had pulled a lot of the recruitment postings from all the other oversight agencies, and I would like to see that
reflected here. And I'm happy to
look at the video if need be, to kind of go back and see where,
um, he mentioned in those
meetings. But yeah, that would
be my only comment, except that
we have to approve it today. Yes. Okay. Well, I mean, can we pass the majority? I don't know, like of it or it can't pass in unless we approve the whole
thing. We've got we've got to do
the entire thing today. I mean, that was already I mean, that
was already reflected in last year's report. I mean, the prior
year was when a lot of the remember, this is this is just this is 2023. Then we had the, the annual, the prior annual
report was 2022. So that's when um, a lot of the data was pulled
. So that's already that's reflected in in the 2022 year
report. Um, about the
recruitment process. Um, I sent
it to, uh, to member carrion and to DR. Directly. I sent them all those job descriptions. And
again that's also reflected in member carrion's vice PRESIDENT
Carrion's email to me. Um which
had a list of all the documents
I had sent. Uh for the committee that I sent her on JANUARY
eighth. So that was in 2023. And you can see there's a long list
of job descriptions from various communities for their, um, job announcements for inspector general and for executive
director. And I also wrote a draft of the job description
that was submitted to DR. Um, and they incorporated elements. I get that, but I actually worked on it. And you submitted
it after. So let's let's just
put, um. Let's just put
PRESIDENT Jason wechter, um, I
don't know. Um surveyed
additional information from
different jurisdictions. I don't know, job descriptions and salaries from different jurisdictions. How's that? I
think it was more than surveyed. I spent a significant amount of
time going to websites of all those communities, downloading
the job description, organizing
them. I also spent a good deal of time, uh, extracting the pay
scale for those positions and put them in in the spreadsheet that we presented to DR. As a
rationale for them to go above
the usual salary scale for the
inspector general position, which is why we were able to
offer him the job at the highest
salary, which was above what DR. Had originally designated as the
salary range for that position.
So what what sentence would
satisfy you to include for you,
for your work? Um. Gathered
numerous job descriptions as
from so what's the difference between surveyed and gathered? I
mean that they had that's how we
got the information. So um,
obtained I didn't survey survey
implies looking at something I actually did the research,
downloaded them, put them in a
format that they could be where
they could be sent to. DR. I get
that, I get that member vector,
but it was actually, uh, I
actually had to do the work with
DR. To actually cull through everything and extract everything. So it's nice that you, you're just assuming that
neither vice PRESIDENT Carrion nor I actually pulled out information and did our own
research to submit to DR. So so
and um, and as liaison I had
like practically weekly if not more than that, um, meetings
with DR. And also the emails. So
um, and I'm not talking about all the hours I've, I've spent pulling together benchmarks and
task lists. I mean, we would not
have been lit if you want to be really accurate, we would probably not have been in this
position had I actually not done a timeline and benchmark of where we needed to be, because I felt like we were just gathering information, we were just having people speaking without
direction. So, um, I don't want to belabor this, and I really want to get to our priorities and list. So so, um, why don't you state your entire sentence of what would make you happy so
we could move on that iris
searched, downloaded, organized
and presented to the board and
to DR. Numerous job descriptions for comparable positions,
gathered information on comparable salaries for
oversight. Director positions in
the bay area to justify an
elevated salary range for the
inspector general. Okay so okay,
so historically, you've liked to have these really long sentences. Can we just keep it
really, really short because I
didn't put the whole kitchen sink of what I've actually. So can we just say that you
presented and job descriptions
and comparable salaries to make
informed recommendations to the board and DR. Can we keep it short like that? I would say that I did significant research
and presented the findings on job descriptions and salary
scale, uh, to the board though,
because so jason, what the question is, why do you want to
put significant because then that assumes that other work is insignificant. So how about just
that you you present covid
research on comparable positions
and salary from from other
jurisdiction. So can we just leave it at that. Mhm. Okay. Well I just it was a significant amount of time that I invested
and. Yeah. So we are in sochi.
Yeah. So and we're not talking about the time and not to mention like you know member
karen has gone above and beyond
in just in this month alone. So
in her work. So can we just keep
it short like that. So we can
say, um, PRESIDENT Jason wechter
presented and. Research and presented uh, or presented. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Presented. Yeah presented. Research and
present. Did. Well. You couldn't have presented if you didn't do the research. So, uh, less is
more. And so PRESIDENT Jason
wechter present did. Comparable
job description describe
options, plural and salaries as.
From other jurisdictions. And
I'm not going to limit it to bay area because it included other parts of california as well. So
okay okay okay. For the sake of
us moving forward, that's fine.
So with that, do I have a motion
to, um, with that amendment to approve the 2023 annual report?
S I'll move to approve it with
the minutes from each meeting as it as an appendix, as an
attachment. I think the sheriff and the board of supervisors
should be able to access that information more readily. I
think things were said at some
of our public meetings that they need to hear, just as they were said. So. So member wechter. So just as I said, for the quarter, the q4 report, that we have a
sentence in there. I'd like to add that to the annual report,
but, uh, I'm not going to have minutes attached. I think that's
laziness. If, if, if you didn't take the time to actually craft a report that people know where
to do the research, but I want to have that reminder there. And actually watch the video. I don't think, uh, attaching
minutes and then if we have to have a paper report adds to anything except for killing
trees. So I wouldn't support
that. That's my motion. If this
board chooses to vote against it and not attach the minutes, then
they can do that. Okay. Do we
have a second on the motion by member wechter to attach the
minutes. Thank you. Is there a
motion to, um, accept the annual report with the stated, uh,
amendment? So moved. Second.
Okay. So we'll just be we'll clarify again the stated amendment and I'll read it. Um,
that, that that, um, dan. Yeah.
Dan, can you reread that sentence that I gave you? I
didn't get it all down. I can I
can read it. Is it PRESIDENT Jason wechter presented comparable job description, salaries and salaries from from
other jurisdictions. Yeah. And did you also want to note that the minutes and videos are available? Yes. Yeah at the end,
the same as q4. Um, so that would come at the end of the
report. Right. Okay I remember,
uh, bruckner made the motion is there a second, second? Thank you. For members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item five, annual report. Please approach
the podium when it is free. Uh, well, you're welcome to make a public comment about seeing that
, if you'd like. Yes, please.
Just, uh. Yes. Okay. I understand that you have your own things to solve together,
but we. Please, uh, time is
running out here with a line of credit for happiness. Is running out. So don't waste everybody's
time. You are wasting your time
and ours. Everybody's time. I mean, it's funny, at some point,
it's so. Okay cbn thank you. All
right. Calling the roll on the
2023 annual report. Um remember
mango I feel like mango is I
member bruckner I bruckner is I
member when a win is I PRESIDENT
Sue I sue is I member vector a vector is I. The motion passes the 2023 annual report with the additions and amendments are
adopted. Thank you. Getting
through our hurdles. So next. Item please dan calling my item six zdob 2024 priorities tasks
and. Benchmarks discussion item and possible action item discussion on 2024 priorities,
tasks and benchmarks. The zdob
will strive for in a calendar
year 2024. Okay, so colleagues,
um, we briefly touched upon this
at our last meeting, and member,
uh, bruckner asked me to sort of break things out into our
priority, um, categories. And so I know that's most of you
submitted some particular lists, but even if you didn't submit a
list on the data, call from dan,
what I did was I looked at the particular list when it said future agenda items. And dan, at certain points in time would,
um, provide a comprehensive list
. So I would synthesize that.
And so this is kind of what I
came up with. Um, it is a little bit dynamic, as you noted, the public defender's office wasn't
able to make it that day. So we can adjust the calendar and then towards the end of the year, I
have some things open where we
might need to take, um, do catch up. But I was very mindful of now that we have an inspector general, um, come the fall, we can start looking at particular policy issues. As you notice that I've also added particular things like you know, jail
visits, additional training, but
that all come, you know, the training and everything else. It all comes with budget. Budget is still top of priority. And that's why I didn't want to, you
know, waste time. I want to remind everyone again, valentine's day, if you love your sweetheart, if you love your board, if you love what
you're doing, got to make it to the valentine's day budget
meeting to, um, to support the, um, inspector general as he
makes the report and then down
the road, as we need to talk to
the supervisors, talk to the mayor. That's what we need to
do. So would like. You to just kind of go through it again and get some comments on it. But, um, it's not something that we
necessarily see have to take
action on. But I'd like you know, sort of an adoption because at least it gives us
some kind of framework.
Um I just want to say thank you, julie. I'm sure this was a lot
of work, and I like that. This is dynamic that we can change as
we go. Um, so, I mean, I think
I'm okay with it. The only thing I wanted to note is for the
public defender's office. Can
probably present from in our next meeting, but can we get the team that works directly with
the, um, in custody. Clients
that that deal with, like the jail conditions and the legal visits? Because I believe there's like a particular team that. Yeah. Um, so, so the public defender recommended angela chan. Okay. Perfect um, she said she's available in
MARCH. So after this meeting, I
can try to. You. Know, ink it,
ink it on her calendar. So she
makes it so much. Yeah no, I
just want to echo, um, my colleague shared. Thank you so
much. Did you get this sheet?
So, director sue, this is the
even smaller one. Yeah yeah, you requested that. So I want to make sure that you saw what your request did. I appreciate it. No I mean, it actually is even more
clear now when it has that
bolded topic. Oh, no. I had bolded it in the prior one, but
I'm hoping that this made it more clear that we look at community engagement services for incarcerated families affected by the criminal justice system. Really? Inspector general, office of inspector budget is three sheriff's office operations, sheriff's office policies. So that's really. Yep. Nope. That's our bailiwick. Yep. So I wanted to say thank you for
that. And then the only thing and correct me if I'm wrong. Last updated JANUARY 16th, 2024 2024. Yeah, um, I think you know
what? She's okay. No, no, no, both both ones should be 2024.
So thank you. Oh, no, just I
think I think I might have sent a, I think I might have caught that and sent it to dan, but there were so many documents floating around. So I want to make sure no catching that. Yep. We always need extra eyeballs. As of working with six eyeballs
is not enough, so I'd like to see the addition of something that we had on the agenda last year, but was continued because of lack of time that I suggested , which is a report on litigation against the sheriff's
department over the past five years. Uh, it can be anonymous, but giving us a sense of where
the, uh, areas of risk are, um,
the types of lawsuits, settlements and adverse
judgments. Um, I heard a
presentation on monday from. I'm sorry, I don't remember his name. The chief of audits for the department of police
accountability and he said that
one of the ways you evaluate
what audit is, you look at the areas of greatest risk in an
organization and clearly, one of
the areas of greatest risk for any organization is lawsuits, judgments and settlements. If
the city is paying out large,
large amounts of money because
of, uh, uh, problems in the sheriff's department, we need to
be aware of that. And we can therefore guide the inspector general in terms of areas where
they can conduct audits. And
it's analogous to hearing from the members of the public
tonight about where the areas of friction are, areas of concern.
Uh, the inspector general is not from san francisco. He's not familiar with our sheriff's
department or with carceral
issues. So I think we have an obligation to help guide him in terms of what he should look at
in his audit. So I would like to see that presentation. Uh, I would also like to see the
sheriff's department respond to
some of the concerns that have been voiced here tonight that
were voiced by inmates. Member
palmer and I visited and, uh, heard from in the jail and issues that were raised at our community meeting in the mission
about, uh, issues at, uh, san
francisco general hospital
campus. So those are the two things I would like to see added to this that are not on it. That's noted. I don't know if we're going to do five years
necessarily. So, um, but but we will look at risk management. I know that there's regular reporting at the police
commission on, um, on, on from
the command staff that actually an individual who actually does
risk management. So I was going to look into that. But um, I
don't want I think when you present particular things, I'm concerned about how you're coming to particular
conclusions. And I want to remind the board members that we are not investigators. We have an inspector general, we have
dpa, they're investigators, and
we are a quasi, um, judicial
body. So I don't want to cross particular lines. And I think when we get to particular comment later on that, um, an
area that member wants us to look into, I'm going to cover
that, um, with the investigation
administrative versus possible criminal. So there's a lot of
things that we can't necessarily
draw conclusions from. And then there are particular things that preceded this particular
administration. So I don't want
to mix things up. And I want to be very clear about timeline and particular things and where we go, um, with this current administration and moving
forward. And, and in light of the recent article about the arbitrator's decision, I'd like
to see a presentation from the sheriff. Well, we're going to get into that. Get into that.
And member mango already is has a particular comment, and I'm going to comment on that
afterwards. Okay. Um, so those
those items are noted. Um,
anything else? Um, member nguyen, I know you had made
submissions particular from the
law enforcement, um, personnel perspective. So we do have that
down there. And I will be
soliciting you. Um, if you want particular speakers as well. Yeah, I see some of the suggestions I made. You put it on here. Yeah. Yeah. So I will I
will check in with you if you have particular speakers that
you would like. Okay. Yeah anything. Member richter no, I'll make a motion to adopt the
tasks and benchmarks with the
additions of member vectors. Uh,
to for the risk management and addressing. So that's going to
be that's also dynamic. And um, I have those actually noted. So
even if it's not on this, I do keep a running list. But again I
also gauge things based on how we're going. And if our priorities are met. And there's more burning issues. But right
now just want to say it one more
time. We are in budget season. So is there a second for member
richter's motion? I second. For
members of the public who would like to make public comment on
line item six zdob priority tasks and benchmarks, please approach the podium when it is
free. Sorry, you are forcing me
to speak out. Even I just wanted to wait for the general public comment. I think you forget it's your priority is. Generally speaking, you forget you forgot
to, uh, put it push
responsibility on critical
thinking. You forgot it is the
top priority. Then after that, everything evolves from that and
then it's perfect and it works. If you don't put that first,
it's going to still going on
like jam. Sorry thank you, thank
you. I don't know, um, I just
want to make maybe I'm mixed up when you guys say when it's budget season and you're talking
to the audience, sometimes, you know, we can get a little confused. I just want to clarify
is some of the things that, um, one of the members mentioned,
like visiting, um, uh, stuff
that happened in the jails. Are you talking about certain budgets that this body is going
to be working on for support, or is that you're just talking
about the budget in general, the budget for the inspector general . But when it comes to visitation, that's something
that I've been thinking about.
But that's part of the sheriff's staffing, and that's something that can be at least addressed immediately. Okay. So then my
question would be just, I mean, or to throw my concern is also
that we're looking at how much money we're investing in. Um, 8420 the department of
rehabilitation staff, um, and their role in visitation because
I. Know that's a big chunk of the budget that the sheriff has
in paying 8420. And what they're
actual role is, um, so just to
put that out there, I think. It's important to note that there's, uh, certain positions,
um, in, in the department and how many positions there is and how valuable and how connected
it is to visiting. And when we
say visiting, I just ask this body to please when we say
visiting inmates, but also. The visitors that come in and that we keep in mind children of incarcerated parents who come in and visit that facility. Yeah. And, joanna, if you'd like to
zip us an email as well, I, you know, I won't use your name. I mean, this is a public meeting, but I was thinking about visitation, too, because I know it's almost like playing the lottery now, especially from covid. And then the staffing, um, if people don't have access
to computers, there's it's hard
for them to, to even know. And then if they show up to say, two and there's a lockdown and you
lose your visit, which happened to me last week, the visit was canceled. I drove from my house
at 530 in the morning to get to san bruno county jail, to my visit being canceled, and then, because I've logged myself into the system. So, I mean, I had a notification on, on on the lockdown earlier, but if someone's already in transit, they might not actually see that. So I don't always assume that people have a smartphone. I don't assume people have
computers. So there's got to be some or checking their email every two seconds. Yeah, but if you're driving, you're not going to. Hopefully you won't be checking your phone. I wish renovo would have like a text
message, a massive text message. But so those are so those are
the kind of the wish list things that I also think about. And
then write down. And then I have it on my kind of, um, parking
lot stuff, and then we can bring it, bring it up and then so I
also like to see, I mean, I like to read schools, so I try to do the high priorities and what we
can do as the easy quote unquote easy fixes. And I know there's a visiting committee that the
sheriff's office runs, but that's not open to the public.
It used to be a long time ago,
but that's also another way of getting data and information.
Thank you. Thank you. I just want to back up what joanna was
saying, because I do also I work
in custody. Um, and regarding
the well, the 8420 is actually for the sheriff's department.
It's the rehabilitation staff. So they're basically civilly
liens that are managing the
sheriff's department programs.
And I'm going to take a chance out here because of what you
said about not being scared that
position. Um, is also known as,
um, a deputy without a badge.
And it is the reason that I have
chosen not to go in custody as
much for fear of what they might
create late and destroy my image
that I've had in san francisco for over 30 years of her serving the public and it's happened to
where, as people are fearful of
the 8420 that's making over
$100,000 to help program staff
maneuver over through the jail
system. Thank you. Appears to be no more public
comment calling in the role on
the motion. I just have a
question. Did your, um, member
bruckner did what you say? Did
that include, um, presentation from the sheriff responding to
some of the issues that members
of the public have raised before us tonight and at other public
forums? Yes okay. So that would be one of the. Yeah I mean, it's
not like it's not in here, but those are things that we're
going to put in and, and um, as you will note, there's going to be quarterly reports as well. So I'm working with the inspector general on particular templates for very basic things. But we are going to include additional
items and so like I said it's a it's also a dynamic kind of
schedule. But I want it in an
orderly fashion because as you
know, right now, um, it takes a lot of manpower to get even the basic reports. So I'm trying to be very efficient, asking for
templates. In this way, we can address additional things. So,
uh, member bruckner, is motion
included in your requests? Okay.
I just want to ensure it's not just data, but the sheriff himself will respond to these concerns because people are
saying that the sheriff MAY not know what's happening in the jails. I think it's important that he does know it. Know about it, and respond to this board
about it. Just as happens at the police commission where they hear about certain issues and they ask for a response from the relevant police commander and the chief of police, and they provide that information to the board and the public, to the commission and a public forum.
That's what I'd like to see.
Analogous here. So do I have a commitment that that will be
included? Um, that was reflected
in so PRESIDENT. I mean, member
wise, we don't have to be. So I mean, I feel like you're doing
inquisitions of people. If you were listening, member bruckner made the motion. It is inclusive. We have general
counsel here. We have, uh, a member of the police department
of accountability here. Um, so
we all work together. And so, um
, I don't know what else to tell you, but the motion's on the floor. There was a second, and
we're about to take a vote. Just to clarify, member wechter the motion did include all of the
requests you made. Um okay. Calling the roll on the
quarterly report, member afua
mengal, I afwa mango is I member bruckner one correction this is not the quarterly report. This
is the this is the yes. No I'm sorry, this is the or sorry the priority. Sorry. The priority list. Priorities and benchmarks on the priority tasks and
benchmarks. Yes. Member. Mango I , I feel like mango is I member bruckner I bruckner is I
remember when I when is I
PRESIDENT Sue I sue is I member
vector I vector is I the motion
passes uh the task benchmarks
with dan. He's just supposed to deal with one tree at a time and a forest sometimes gets thrown
at him. Uh, to prioritize tasks and benchmarks. Is adopted with,
uh, member vectors requests. Calling line item seven. Amend zdob rules of order 1.14.
Discussion. Possible action item
amend rules of order 1.14 regarding requests for agenda
items. Okay, so this is pretty straightforward. Um, the timeline really wasn't realistic, especially when, um,
things have to be posted and so
just to make it really clear, because our meetings are on
friday and it should be as early as possible, because if we want some responsiveness and we want to be able to give someone ample
notice, we already know from um,
chief ju that he requests things , uh, request at least three weeks in advance. So I'm asking
for 21 day calendar days. So
it's the friday preceding a regular board meeting. And the
notation was that, um, the friday preceding the regular board meeting is too late because the agenda is finalized on the monday preceding the
meeting at the latest for
posting on tuesday. Okay. But there's still room for emergency
urgent items to be added at the discretion of the PRESIDENT And
vice PRESIDENT. I have a question for member bruckner. When you served on the police commission, was there any
similar requirement? Not that
I'm aware of. Thank you. It's just that there's too many
there's too many requests, like
right before the meeting and so
I've made it sort of a rule that I don't even I won't even look at an email. Really. Um, even two days before the meeting,
because there's a lot of balls to juggle, and it's, it's
disruptive of, um, when I'm coordinating with the vice
PRESIDENT, if I need to run anything by the city attorney, and then it's just very
disruptive to dan's schedule to.
So I would support. Uh, ten
days. I think 21 is too much because that basically means just a in many cases a week after the last meeting. And this
doesn't apply to a similar commission or to any other
oversight commission. I'm aware
of. Um, things come up and
people have to digest what's happened. At one meeting and MAY
think about what, um, what they'd like to see at the next
meeting. So so I'd like to amend
it to ten days. I agree. So ten
calendar days isn't actually even enough because since we meet on fridays and there's a
weekend, so I just think 21 days
calendar days is excessive of
um, and I think 7 or 10 business
days is fair. If jason is, as
jason mentioned and, um, since
we now have an inspector
general, we have dan as staff who can help coordinate these
things. Say, I've worked at two other oversight entities and
they accepted items in less time
and were able to put them on the
agenda. Uh, they were also staffed by consisting of
volunteer hours. So I think we should be consistent with what
other similar. So my question
is, who do you think the staff is for the inspector general at
this point? Right now? He says he's working very closely. Well,
he has dan. And dan and dan's
been carrying like three roles. And he continues to do that. So
I'm being very mindful of that. And so that just also means we
have we have more coordination. Um, between the vice PRESIDENT And the PRESIDENT At this point.
Um yeah, I agree with the, uh,
PRESIDENT. Uh, there's a lot of a lot of workload that, uh, dan
is doing, and a lot of information that's being requested. And I think this
would be sufficient. 21 days
would be sufficient, uh, for those requests to get vetted.
And, um, brought, brought to the board's attention. I mean, we
could we could change it to whatever dates it just does. It just means that it might even be
punted more farther out if there isn't adequate time to vet out
and actually put it on. So um, you know, you could you could do
it later on. It just gets gets moved. But if we have it out at 21 days, there's a greater likelihood that it gets into
that. That month's meeting.
Well, this isn't required that
it go in the agenda. Uh, this is simply saying it has to be
submitted. So if the agenda is
full or if it's not possible to gather the information, it doesn't require you to place it
on the next agenda. Also, I
wanted to add to the emergence
and urgent items MAY be added at the discretion of the PRESIDENT
And vice PRESIDENT. I know the
PRESIDENT Gets to set the agenda
, but I guess I guess I don't really agree with this language
because it I don't know. I guess it deems it it's up to the
PRESIDENT And vice PRESIDENT To
deem what is urgent. Oh no.
Well, it was more meant to be in a positive way. If there's
something urgent, let's say you've approached me. You saw something that you thought we needed to address. Then we can
we can add it without going like
the full blown calendar. And we
can just. It's meant to be more dynamic, like. Yeah. And it's meant to like, we could just insert it and maybe, um, if we need to postpone something else. Got it. Yeah. Yeah, that makes
sense. I'm okay with this as, uh , just with the ten business
days, um, instead of 21. Member wechter would you like to make
that a motion? Yes, I move that we adopt this changing where it
says 21 calendar days to ten calendar. So can we go to 14?
Can we go to 14? It just it's
just I get bombarded by a lot of emails. I mean, even just with, with member. And this last thing that we worked, which was relatively small, I will
honestly say that, um, I have a I don't think people realize
that I have a regular job that I
have to attend to, and I do write a lot, and, um, because i am an attorney, um, and I also
am am accountable to the public, I get a lot of public requests
for assistance. Um, so. So I
what I don't appreciate is I get
bombarded by emails, so think about your position and then multiply it by so many other people and then clearing things
through so I do need time to sort things out and consistently
and if we're going to be transparent member wechter, you've consistently given me
things like the thursday before
or friday before the monday and
then when you had the jail visit with member palmer, you had
member palmer email me and I
said, oh, this sounds serious. Give me some more information.
In the meantime, um, have of the those individuals make complaints through the
department or police department of accountability. Give me more information. I'd like some information so I could possibly
draft a memo to the sheriff. But I also want to clear things with the city attorney's office,
because we don't want particular identities of either deputies or those in identified. I heard
nothing. And then the following month, I got urgent. Urgent. But it was like the thursday or friday before again. So in that intervening month, I got nothing. And then again, like nothing. So this is trying to be
more methodical. And thoughtful and actually accomplishing goals and addressing things. So this is why I'm actually having some
some time. So everyone's on the
same page. Um, and down the
road, it's also like requests of
information or people will um, because that way it's more orderly because guess what? I
also get the complaints. So when people people are upset and they don't want to necessarily
participate, this is not helping
our work. So that's why I'm just trying to make it more orderly.
So I'm going to um, I would vote
I would vote no on ten. And I
think I'm going to I'm going to make a separate motion unless I'm going to say 14 as a compromise. And can I add one caveat to this? Yeah. Can we go
15 business days? Right now it says calendar days. But it still
gives us to three weeks. Yeah if you take yeah, yeah. 15 business
days. Yeah yeah I would compromise to 12 calendar days which would put it on the monday
before for the one eight days before. The agenda is due to be
posted. I mean, right now, you know, it's set for a friday, but who knows if the calendar ends up changing. I just want like particular days to vet it out. It shouldn't be that difficult. We're talking about calendar days. That doesn't change
calendar days remain the same.
So I'll make a motion that it
reads 15 calendar. Sorry uh,
member brooke, there's a motion on the table. Is a member. Um
sue's, uh, member webster's okay. Yeah. So I would amend
mine to 12 calendar days and add the city referenced with the jail visit. That was the
community session you had with
member palmer. Not with me. I sent those materials to the city
attorney for her. For them to review. Okay. I don't want to. I don't want to get deep into that now. But then what you did and if we want to be transparent, then you had the city attorney
send me a heads up that there was a document. Residents who were going off the path. No, I
get it. But but this goes to the
particular days. And so that was
like on a friday and heads up and then, um, the city attorney
informed me, if you'd like to
calendar at this item at a date, please feel free to contact me. But you took the initiative and
then just dumped the document on
us without member palmer even having looked at the document.
So, um, that is why I would like
more time. And that way, if I need to seek legal counsel and get clearance and make sure
everything, uh, is, is clear to be released to the public, I
would appreciate that. So I'm so
. I won't be so I won't be supporting adding whatever
amendment you had. I'd rather go
with member brueckner's motion. So, uh, I'm sorry, PRESIDENT.
Um, so there is a motion on the table. Okay, I've amended my motion to say at least 12
calendar days. Is there a
second? I'll second. There's a
second. We'll take public comment for members of the
public who would like to make public comment on line item seven. The amendment of the
rules of order 1.14, please approach the podium when it is
free. There appears to be no no
public comment. Call the roll
and the quarterly report with the amendment to change to. I
mean, I'm sorry I said it again
accordingly. Uh, calling the roll on the amendment to the
sdlp rules of order 1.14 member
wiktor's motion to change to 12
calendar days. Member. Mangal I
mango is I member bruckner no. Bruckner is no vice. Uh member
nguyen. No nguyen is no member. Sue. No. Sue is no member.
Wicker. Yes. Director is. Yes.
The motion does not pass. I'd like to make a motion, uh, that
it reads 15 calendar days. Is
there a second? Second? Thank
public calling. The roll on the
motion to 15. Business days. No,
it's calendar days. I'm sorry. 15 calendar days. Correct. 15
calendar days. Member. Mango no.
Mango is no member. Bruckner a bruckner is a member. Nguyen a
win is I PRESIDENT. Sue I sue is
I member wechter. No victor is
no. It's a majority but it's. 3
to 2. 3 to 2. Um but that's not
a quorum. Okay. Because it's a roll. Because you're amending your rules. Like, usually sort of procedural matters and things like that. It can be a majority of whose present. But you're amending your rules of order. I think that for that you should have and unfortunately we have
member. Carry on absent. So we
MAY we MAY continue it I guess.
Yeah. If member karen wants to bring it up to the next meeting, we can entertain it at the next meeting. Then the motion does
not pass. So I make a motion that we continue this item for
the next meeting. Second.
Calling the roll to continue
this item. Member. Mango I have
a mango. Is I. Member bruckner I
bruckner is I member nguyen a
win is I PRESIDENT Sue I sue is I member victor I victor is I.
The motion passes the line item
will be continued to the next
meeting. Uh due. To time constraints. And since we already went over future agenda items in the priorities list, I moved to, uh, continue the
future agenda items. So. So, dan
, I just had one, one item
because it was in the news. So we're going to touch on that. Okay? Colleen line item eight, future agenda items discussion and possible action item. And I'm going to call on member mango. Yes I would like to for a
future agenda item I want to discuss the situation regarding the rehire of scott new, the former deputy that was responsible for the fight club scandal and costly settlements
to the city. So and I just wanted to make a clarification
on at this particular juncture,
this is, um, and, uh, general counsel baumgartner, if you want to correct me. So this was
arbitration. So, um, this situation arose so there. So excuse me just it's you're adding it as a future agenda
item. You're not discussing it?
No. We're just I'm just making a comment of what presentation we're going to have. Okay. Clarification yes. So this was
arbitration. So this but there has not been a rehire yet. So whatever happened in the news is
a little bit premature. And I
want to have a presentation on on administrative investigations
and criminal investigations. And the two shall not pass. But given that we have separate entities, uh, that shouldn't
happen again. And, um, also, you know, the fifth amendment issues , but this happened ten years
ago. So this is not part of the prior administration, obviously not part of the current leadership of the police department of accountability and general counsel. Baumgartner this is a personnel related matter and cannot be discussed
in public. Okay. And that's my
opinion. Your city attorney will and I would agree with that. And
I just want to make sure again, we're inviting people to discuss it at the podium. And commenting on it further. I think you're outside of the agenda item at
this point. Okay so that's that
is a concern. Um, and I can't
even talk. I mean, what's in the newspaper is not even I can
talk. So yeah. So I mean, the things that have been reported
in the media. So I just I think we've made it clear in the past, even when we were hiring the inspector general, people were saying, oh, we weren't recruiting nationwide. And we actually had someone fly in from florida. And I authorized the cost. So I'm just reminding people that whatever you read in the media is not necessarily accurate, but I still want to have a particular presentation. So it's not on this particular
case, but in general about the separation of administrative investigations versus criminal
investigations. Ones. Um, and that can certainly be talked about in public. Yes. And that's and that's what we wanted to talk about. And and that, um, it's not under one roof now. So
it's um, so something similar is unlikely to happen again. And so that's I think what I want
people to, to think about moving
forward. Yeah, I'm sure that the sheriff's office will respond to
the request for information about the particular subject matter that you request. Yes. Um but I just wanted to point out
that that particular matter is a personnel related matter.
Understood yeah. And so that's that's also why when I have requests for, like from the da's
office, why cases get dropped or we have absolutely no idea, you don't know case charges get
dropped for various reasons. And
it's not necessarily a poorly run investigation. And you know, has. So it's I'd like to
entertain particular issues and
how we prevent issues negative issues from happening. But we
can't go into the minutia or even mention particular cases.
But I do want to address the
separation. I don't know if you
would like to do it, or we could
have. I'll have to talk to chief chiu and the sheriff's office about that particular thing. I okay. Or we also dealt with the civil litigation regarding that particular matter. So I haven't been involved directly in okay or we could have MISTER Kine also talk about since he's prosecuted cases before on
police misconduct. And so I do
administrative law and then I have to deal with superior court. So I'm also familiar. But I'd rather have someone who's, um, you know, familiar with law enforcement cases. Yeah so just so I understand. So we're I get that we're not able to talk about that particular person,
but what are we what's going to be on the agenda item then for future? The agenda item is talking about um, administrative investigation ations, criminal
investigation actions, the fifth
amendment. And so talking about
how a similar for such
situations in terms of
investigation means that, um had
shall we say, co-mingling. I don't even know what the proper word is. That wouldn't happen
again. That might cause
particular actions that that the public is expecting to happen.
Doesn't happen. So I know I
think I had had a conversation with you about, um, just in general about particular
investigations and so how
they're conducted, how they were conducted in the past versus
moving forward and how they're
conducted now is different from what happened in this particular
case. I would also like a presentation from the sheriff on
what procedure, if any, he has
to refer to certification of
deputies. To the post in light of a public defender. Manu raju's letter regarding this issue that was published in mission local about the option
of law enforcement forwarding
requests for decertification of
a sworn officer to state post, not specifying any particular
individual, but just is there a
procedure. And has it been used?
And if so, how many times? I'm sure the sheriff's office would you know we can forward that
request to chief dunn. Talk about that process. There is a process in place, but okay. He can talk about that process.
Thank you, thank you. Okay and
actually how long do we get to have you grace our presence
because I hear that your, um, joy of traveling and other
things, other than work is in
the near future here. Yes, I am my retirement date is APRIL
12th. That's I'm retiring as of that date. After 32 years of
service for the city. I think
it's time. But yeah. Um, so I won't be here for the MARCH meeting, but I will be here for the APRIL meeting. Ronnie's out of town that week, so I'm making sure I'm there for that week.
But, um, that will be it for me. We you will be missed. Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you very much. All right.
Dan sorry. Going back to you. Was that all the discussion for future. Thank you. For members of the public would like to make public comment on item eight. Item item eight. Uh, future event agenda items. Please approach the podium when it is
free. Calling line item nine. General public comment. At this time, the public is welcome to
address the board for up to two
minutes on items that did not appear on this afternoon's agenda, but are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the sheriff's department oversight board. During public comment, neither sheriff personnel nor any board members
are required to respond to questions, but to buy the
public, but MAY provide a brief response. If you would like to make public comment, please
approach the podium when it is three. As a reminder, you have two minutes to give public
comment. Thank you. Um, as a
parent of someone who is incarcerated, what happens
instead in the media is very traumatizing because we don't know what happens behind locked
doors. I just recently read an
article in the mission local that was very frightening to me
and many parents. I run a support group called families understanding the system, where we all have a loved one that's in jail. We're either mothers,
grandparents, wives, etc. The first thing that we read was share will rehire ex-deputy
behind S.F. Fight club scandal. That is the most scariest thing that I had to wake up to and
read. I hope that this oversight board really looks into this and that things like this don't happen. Imagine for those
families that had to endure that. I actually one of the parents that come to my support group, one of them is her grandson. We're talking about an
80 year old woman who does not have access to emails or
computers or mobility to even be there to visit her son, her only way of communicating with her child during that time, on the seventh floor, was through the
cards that she buys from the dollar store, as she stated, and I hope that these meetings are
also moved to the community. So people can have more access to them. Because coming to city
hall and looking for parking for people like MISS Jones, who can't come here, is not
accessible to the community. So if you want more community
voices and want to hear the
horrible things like myself that a mother has to go through, then please make these meetings more accessible to community. Thank
you. Thank you. And I just want to put out to those of you who attended today, we do need your
assistance. So, joanna, I don't know if you know that we had planned a lot of community meetings. If you look at our
annual report and some of them,
we had maybe just a handful of people appear or we didn't have a quorum. So we'd like to revisit those again. But we do
ask for our community members to have a commitment to be there
and voice your opinion and dan works really hard to get. It's an extra layer of work for him to do the community meetings, but we are that we're about
being out there and some we some feedback we got was some people
like, why are you even doing this? We'd rather come to city hall. So we've been kind of juggling different. I have to call in sick to come in. So yeah. Yeah. So for us, you know, just to have more accessibility, I mean, maybe you can use the sheriff's platform. He's really popular on instagram and tiktok, so maybe you guys can post some of those meetings there. Okay.
Thank you. Hernandez. If you can
send me your email, then I can, um, let you know if we do plan
community meetings. Zdob. Yeah,
just zdob at sf gov. Org. Thank
you, MR. Phil. It's a sort of
follow up from what I started by saying to the board of supervisors, uh, two weeks ago
now, but I'm going to extend
it's okay. We don't care who you are, where you come from, the
skies don't care what matters is
what you do. So the time is
running out to in order to be
happy. And that's the goal. So in order to be happy, you have
to do the right things. Because
no matter what, nothing's free. So you are going go. Sorry,
you're going to have to pay for
what you do, what you've been
doing. There's no escape. There
is nowhere to hide anymore.
Under. Ground, nowhere. The sky is no where you are all the
time. It's not a religious thing . It's much beyond that. So you
can't hide. So do the right
thing to be happy. Stop acting
like a zombie or a fake surgeon,
sir. Because it's not going to make you happy. And make others
happy. After that, your time is
done. You earned your life and
happy. So the sheriff, his role
is to do what? Because it's going to have to pay more.
Because he is failing. Maybe to
enforce the law. And so you see,
understand. It can't be happy at the end of the day. So that's the problem. Again never mind. I
have to pay for what I do too. I
pay big time. I'm happy. In fact , for doing what I'm doing. But I pay because it's an extreme
pressure on me to try to pass
the message to you to be happy. I'm not joking. It's a tough job . I like it because I know I'm doing the what I've been ordered
to do. I have a good afternoon.
Thank you, MR. Phil. It appears
to be no further public comment. Calling line item ten. Adjournment action item. All
those in favor? Aye aye. Any
nays? Meeting is adjourned at
4:40 P.M. Thank you."

2024-01-05,"so we wanted to extend our deepest condolences his family and colleagues and close
friends. Our office department of
insurance moved over to oakland right before the pandemic FEBRUARY of 2020, and the bay
area is a small community.
So our security detail at our
office, is just one or two degrees of separation within
our bay area family.
And one of the security guards
offered to me that the community really misses officer lay. He expressed that he loved his
job so much that the only way
he was not going to do it is if he was severely or killed in
the line of duty. He made the ultimate sacrifice
and we are glad that the bay area community law enforcement
local state and national came
together and suspects were apprehended swift'.
So thank you for your service, officer leigh. I'm sorry, public comment on

2024-01-05,"I want to recognize that
member duane is now present.
And so next item on the agenda?"
2024-01-05,"calling item 3 announcement on inspect or of hiring of
inspect or general."
2024-01-05,"so our inaugural inspect or general is terry wiley and it's been post approximated.
He was sworn in by the honorable mayor willie brown on
DECEMBER 20th. Affective date of his
appointment is JANUARY 8th, so
we welcome inaugural inspect or terry wiley."
2024-01-05,is there any discussion?
2024-01-05,"yeah, I have a question why it was presented without announcing him in advance from the actual event. Which is unusual."
2024-01-05,it was announced.
2024-01-05,"not in advance.
I never received a copy of, simply said that selection
inspect or general would be announced on DECEMBER 20th."
2024-01-05,right.
2024-01-05,"so why was it not, his identity inspectors are not
announced in the original press release that we had a week before."
2024-01-05,"we had a public event and
weigh wanted to people that could attend the public event. and we lined up anything. It was not a mystery, but I think there were some leaks at
the press which I deal with. But everything was followed by
procedure."
2024-01-05,"a ruple remarked that it was unusual. I found it unusual that I did
not receive a copy of the press release under the name of the oversight board.
I'm not sure why it was not
distributed to the members."
2024-01-05,"it was publicly posted.
I don't know if member carrion was there, vice PRESIDENT Carrion was there too to also
make remarks and we know that
member a fuhaamango is the communication and she was
unable to make it and we had
member brookter that was there."
2024-01-05,"it was brought to to mia tension when the board of supervisors outnumber the
appoint he's on the board was not very good, it made it seem slanted."
2024-01-05,they can contact the board directly and make their public comments.
2024-01-05,"and I also think that maybe
they MAY not understand the dynamics, most have worked with
each other regardless of who
appointed us, really, it's about bringing our particular
skill sets to the table and working to make sure that we are moving forward with a mission of this board.
So I recognize that some of that political slanting is out
there, but I personally don't
think that I interact with
supervisor appoint he's than I
do of mayors because of that.
That to me is a waste of our energy, because it's not fulfilling, excuse me, our mission.
I understand the politics and perception but hopefully people can recognize and especially by
the fact that we have been able to achieve this incredibly successful recruitment with
somebody that is as qualified
as our inaugural ig that, you
know, that our work is speaking
for itself in terms of us being
able to reach consensus and us able to reach majority votes in
meeting our goals."
2024-01-05,"well it did not feel very
inclusive to me and others I know, it would have been appropriate to have one member of the board who should be
appointed by the board of
supervisors at that event and all members should have receivesed a press release in
advance. When other members of the
community.
I only learned about it because
another member from the
oversight told me about it."
2024-01-05,"that's surprising since we had emails that are not press
released.
And you're cc on all of them
and I find that dis ingenuous you've been part of this process all of this time. And you're part of the emails all of this time. So to be able to say na I
didn't get a press release and
therefore I had no knowledge, does not seem credible."
2024-01-05,"well if I was getting all
the emails why didn't I get an email about the press release if it went out to the members of the oversight community which I'm a respected member
and leader as a member of the board of directors.
I found that puzzling and others in the oversight
community found that puzzling."
2024-01-05,"sorry, so we noted some comments in the press made by you.
So I think it's dis ingenuous
to say that you said that you
had no knowledge. I do want to cut this
conversation.
We are fortunate enough to have
the sheriff here, to deal with the disciplinary process with the sheriff's office and we want to be supportive especially now that we're in
the budget process. We have taken inventory and
know what we need to do to
support the sheriff's office and the office of the inspect or general and to make the sheriff's office the best in
the country. So if dan, can you call public comment."
2024-01-05,"board members of the who
would like to make public
comment online 3, please line
up along the far wall. As a reminder you have two
minutes to give public comment. It appears that there is no public comment."
2024-01-05,"thank you, next item on the
agenda, dan."
2024-01-05,"calling item number 4, sfso under sheriff catherine johnson
will appear to give reports on
operations, budget and staffing
how the oig can help in getting it upgrades for data and
reporting. Undersheriff johnson.
Thank you for being here today."
2024-01-05,"good afternoon, PRESIDENT And board members, thank you
for having me.
i'm the undersheriff.
Thank you for your time today.
Ifls asked to do a report about discipline.
So I'll do a short presentation
and then I'm happy to entertain questions at the end.
I'm going to start with vetionz. Vetionz start with a complaint. Every office of the sheriff is suppose to have a process in place to accept complaints. Those can come in in a number
of ways.
We have a form on our website
or you can walk into the office
of the police accountability.
After na, it's forwarded to the undersheriff in this case, it's
me. And is review the investigations and I render a recommended finding.
Next slide, please. Any complaints of serious allegations and they're defined troughs items 1 through 5.
Use of force causing an actual
injury or death.
Controlled device referred to
as taizer and impact weapon.
Our investigated by the dpa as
well as sexual misconduct, a
pattern and a practice of retal
occasion towards an inmate or
wreckless disregard for the
well fair health and wellness
of inmates.
Those are defined bit loa, most recently in communication with
the police accountability there
was an update to add any
investigation of a death in custody unless that death was
illness base.
That's the most resent update with dpa.
Next slide please. So the conclusion of the
investigation I review it and i
have the option of render one
of six findings. They're not sustained, sustained, no finding or just a documentation.
For the purpose of this presentation, we're going to
focus on a finding of sustained.
So finding of sustained is my level, I have determined that there is some misconduct or law by the employee of the department.
Once that happens, we move into, we end the investigative phase of the disciplinary
process and go directly to the discipline and once that happens, the employee for any
civil employees and there is a
different for versus those who are on probation.
They are entitled to a due process hearing which is commonly referred to as skaily hearing and that happens with
the sheriff.
So they conduct the ploys' has
an the opportunity to offer
officers factors in mitigation.
Why or how that happened. They provide a finding and the sheriff can either, maintain
the discipline as it was
recommended, reduce it or
dismiss it perhaps the, the
factors and mitigation that the
sheriff dmisd altogether. However, if they sustain the discipline and they receive
what are the discipline is,
whether it's a written reprimand or suspension or termination. And many think that's the end
but it's not.
The collective agreement have disciplinary grievances so the employee union can file a
grievance which is a way to say they want to go to avenue
racing.
And then an ar by tore, so
while the sheriff can and does
impose discipline regularly,
it's up to the arbitror, it
whether that's the set.
We've had arbitrors have the employee return to work. So that can happen.
There is a lot of discussion
internally within our office
and within the public sphere about our hires and separations
and what our staffing is like. We have a significant deefficiently see in our staffing, we are short staffed and we're work to go close that
gafp.
Gap, you'll see in this gap,
fiscal year that just closed
because the first time that we hired more people than we separated. So we peaked. You'll also notice that this data, shows the significant spike in the number of separations.
It should be noted that those
surprisings were from employees
that did not meet the covid-19
vaccine requirements and that's
why a spike in that.
In JANUARY 2020, we had a 100
sworn vacancies.
In 2023, we had 195 so almost
double and it should also be
noted that the sheriff support longevity premium to keep our
ploys longer while we continue to hire and we're aggressively hiring.
Thank you. This chart just breaks down by classification and rank where the vacancies exist.
As you can see we have 154 vacancies in the deputy sheriff
alone.
That is the significant greatest vacancy that we have
in the department. On boarding websinger have 10 deputies expect to go graduate
from the academy.
We start withed 12, we're down
to 10 and we hired four academy trained people.
And then in MARCH, we have another four graduating with
four more academy on boarding.
So we hope to see some relief with the draft thating is happening with the new staff that is coming on board.
Next slide, thank you.
So budget, so the sheriff's
office has just under 3 million
dollars budget, huge budget, that is the greatest number of dollars spent. In this particular case, I want
to talk about the deficit.
We've heard a blot the budget
26 or 29 million over sent.  -- spent.
So I want to break down the
actual deficit, these are of as
NOVEMBER 30 of last year, so just six weeks, this includes taking every pot of dollars and putting them together.
So we took the money that we
had in permanent sal vaoez and
work order dollars and what
we're spending on overtime we.
Show significant saves in permanent salaries because we're so short staffed but we show an increase in over siem because. So you when you take all of those dollars and put them in a
pool, we have a deficit of
about 1.9 million dollars.
Part of the deficit, there was
an error in the Calpers, that error totaled about 18.8
million dollars.
We have been working to adjust that error, we anticipate by mid-JANUARY that number will be down to zero.
Then we've also looked at what
we're spending for apec expenditures were about 1.8 million.
And then the expenditure of 3cg
annex it was the small jail
shut down several years. We increase in jail oplation
and we have one housing unit. When you take the dollars as
the city of san francisco has
agreed to rei am bus with the
apec and adjustment of Calpers,
we have deficit of 2.9 million.
And in order to meet that deficit, we put in reserves 5.8 million dollars.
As it stands right now, we're not expect today ask for supplemental and that's been
the case for many years.
We have not required a
supplemental in many many years.
Le in in case the deficit is
overtime spending.
A little bit about operations. So the request about operations
was broad not so I picked several areas to talk about.
I want to talk about electric monitoring this is within our
community programs. We have 4 divisions and within that division we run community
programs which is a program within our department that provides services post
incarceration. Specifically electronic
monitoring is a level of
supervisions, so an individual
is incarcerated and they MAY request electric monitoring as
a level of supervisor.
That's what this data shows.
so this was taken in JUNE of
2023, and it's called snap
data, we looked at everybody that was in our electronic program.
And what you have before you is
the data before that.
So 138 people, released were
charged with a serious or
violent offense, it's.
Another 149 were classified as other felonies or excluded felonies.
The vas majority of people are on our electronic are charged
with felonies as the data shows.
At that time, there were three teem charged with members with electric.
Lewd acts on a child, robbery
and domestic violence.
Is brings this data up not to scare people but actual data point.
There are some people that are
charged with significant crimes
and it's incumbent of the office of the sheriff to
monitor these people.
We do that through realtime monitoring, monitoring individuals on electric
monitoring.
We also realtime interventions to exclusion airy.
Somebody MAY have had a stay
away order. We do home checks and compliance checks.
The other thing we do is we
offer warrants if an individual is not compliant with the order of the court.
It's up to the judge if they
want to sign that warrant but we do write a evidence.
If a judge signs a warrant with
we actively go look for the person to return them to secure
detention. for last fiscal year, 1323
warrants offered, that's a high
number of warrants.
Of those 167 were still out
stand anding 51 relevanteder
and 401 were served and individual returned to custody. This is important because
electronic monitoring is a tool
to use to release people while
they're in the community and many times it's successful and
other times it's not."
2024-01-05,would you like us to wait to ask questions.
2024-01-05,totally up to you.
2024-01-05,"fuzz have data available of
those with serious violence,
how many of them actually violated their requirement."
2024-01-05,"I don't have that data but I'm happy to get it and forward
to you."
2024-01-05,"question, which unit which
officers serve the warrant and do they have training?"
2024-01-05,"sure, that's on the next slide."
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,"the next slide is our
deployment into the tenderloin.
There is three goals for that
unit, we lose illegal drug use
and increase public safety.
Along with the warrant serves
unit and.
The reason our unit is
primarily tasked with the enforcement piece of compliance
to warrants.
So their primary task is to switch out individuals and obtain a warrant and return
them to secure attention.
They get, they have additional
equipment, so yes, that all happens and it's primarily by this group."
2024-01-05,"are they uniformed?
Or non uniformed?"
2024-01-05,"they're in plainclothes,
they do wear uniform when they do task assignments."
2024-01-05,"I think you mentioned multi agencies, what other agencies do they work with?"
2024-01-05,"it depends on what the opposition, sometimes it's with
the police department and sometimes probation and U.S. Marshal so it depends on the
task force."
2024-01-05,"does the fret, are they
still operational?"
2024-01-05,"they are, not as heavily as they were maybe 10 or 15 years ago."
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,"you're very welcome.
Programs and services.
Now we move to our custody operations divisions.
Part of what we do is provide programs and services so when
somebody is releases, they have programs. Prior to the pandemic, the office of the sheriff was a national model in this area. And we have been striving to
get back to that national model but we have incredible services for the incasered rated.
And I want to start with the
discharge planning.
We have case managers that
review data and we look at the
highest number of uses of the
jail system and try to provide
service to see that group so
they don't return to scud.
And part of the custody, is
they work with an incarcerated individual and help them to
provide for bridge housing, we
have a program called safe
passage, safe harbor. This officers individuals cab rides upon release.
So they have somebody to go so
they don't end up back in an
area where they will get involved with an illegal activity.
The last fiscal year, we housed 49 people.
And part that have is to get them corrected through coordinated entry so there is more perm nal house hading
available. We've increased our out of cell
time and some of our programs, road to recovery officers shifts and one family with all up and running.
I want to talk a little bit
about rsvp and roads and sisters, those are staple
programs that have been in
affect for decades and they offer services.
And the picture you see on the
top right is from our cover
pod, our pod that deals with veterans and we provide services to veterans to help them as well.
The lower picture that you see,
I'm going to tie into norbert
in a most resent ruling, we
were ordered to provide direct
sunlight access to the incarcerates population for
those who have been in jail a year or longer.
And the ways we met the
requirement is removing the loover, and that's what you see so the sun can come in. The difference of meeting the
requirement of the court. We believe that we met the court's requirement and we'll see how this, this process advances. So that's the picture on the
lower right there.
And then the last thing is the
I want to talk about the grants.
cal aim, we got grant for 680,000.
And the second for a million dollars to administrator medical enrollment as part of
the post release.
We're in the process and we
will do that in two parts. The first is for 500,000 and
the second for 4.5 million. The reason we're breaking is based on the way that the grant was awarded. This is just an indication of
how we seek other venues for
funding when we can't find funding for what we're doing. The next slide talks about employee wellness.
We know we have a huge deficit in our employee base and we know people are tired.
This is hard work, being a
deputy sheriff is hard work.
It's difficult work and difficult work and it's
rewarding work and we have those that work for us. We applied and awarded a grant
from the board directions for 531,000, we issued an rfp and part of those dollars will also
be used to stand up down rooms,
to create lactation rooms for employees return froming maternity leave.
So all of that is in the works
because we do a lot of to offer sfses for incarcerates we have to do more to help our employees. This is on that area of helping
our employees more.
Just some completed projects,
some of the things we've taken on.
You can research any of our policies, they're on our
sheriff's website. We first and primary concern is
human life above all. And narcan has been. I have a short video for to you
watch at the end here.
We had requested for funding for a record management system
and we did not receive the
funding so we created our own report writing, that our staff
created in order to better
imagine our reports and produce
data from those reports.
And we upgraded the data. So we've introduced tabulate
use and in order to do that we
had to upgrade the wie feiz.  -- wi-fi.
So the picture on the left for
at least 30 years, we had
parent-child visits.
So the incarcerated parent can visit with their minor child.
In this case, we want to make sure that when minor children come to the jail, they don't feel like it's a jail and they're able to have quality time with their incarcerated parent. So what you see here is the final product.
And the picture on the right,
is the kitchen remodel.
This is the incarcerated kitchen for incarcerated people.
One is for staff but this one is for the incarcerated
population.
The standing up of this kitchen
will separate and provide food
for the incarcerated population. This will go into operation in
a couple of weeks. That will happen within the
next few weeks.
And just data on what we do.
This is last year's data, we
received 31 people by the
department of narcan.
The number of guns removed, 10.
our sheriff's patrol unit recovered foern 10,000
contraband items of those four
were guns and five airsoft guns
and 47 knives.
We had over 3 2000 in-person court transports for court appearance. This bridge housing is the
number that I spoke about earlier, totaling 189 nights, so people that were released to
had a place to stay and a bed
to go to.
So just some data about the work of the deputy sheriff.
And in the end, is would like
to show a short video this is
deputy bloom and he talks about
what he does everyday. He does foot controls in the
areas.
-- foot patrols.
. Department and he talks about what he does everyday. He does foot controls in the areas.
-- foot patrols."
2024-01-05,"the library, we basically keep the liberian and staff safe by eliminating drug use. I started here in 2018 and this
is before we were issued narcan, there was an overdose almost everyday, there was a
lot of heroin.
Then I was ran into a man that was called the narcan angel, he was checking in with me daily because the word on the street
is I was aifg a lot of people
and when I used narcan with
people overdosing from heroin,
they would pop right up. The narcan a year later, does
not work well. If somebody looks like they're sleeping, we make sure that
they're okay.
their skin is blue tinge, no chest rise, so we immediately,
we give them a shot of narcam,
and if that does not work, we
give as many narcans as we take.
It's tough, it's not my
responsibility to judge
anybody, it's just my responsibility to save somebody
on my watch. And it feels good, once I've done something. It makes me feel like I'm doing
my job. Deputy bloom, that's ha z been with the san francisco for
about 28 and a half years."
2024-01-05,"so just wanted to close on that video, it's important to
show the good work of the
deputy sheriff and how impactful we are to saving
lives and with that, I'm happy
to take any questions."
2024-01-05,member afuhaamango?
2024-01-05,"yes, I had a question, it was talking about the different
types of, I don't know if it's conclusions, of like the complaints that come in and the findings."
2024-01-05,uh-huh.
2024-01-05,"I think it was like 1 through 6, do you what the
percentage of those results are? What gets deemed?"
2024-01-05,"sure, I do.
Dpa does issue reports and we have our 2022 report, and I'm happy to send it to you.
I don't have that on me."
2024-01-05,"okay, thank you.
And then also, you mentioned about returning, I don't know
if this is the correct word but offending officers, is there a
process."
2024-01-05,"sure, that's the arbitration
process that I spoke of.
at the conclusion of the hearing, the sheriff's renders
a decision. Let's presume for this
discussion, that an employee
has a sustained find anding he imposed a ten-day suspension. The employee does not agree,
they go to the representative from their collective bargain
anding they file a employee grievance, that's the final. So the grievance is the way to put it in writing and say, I
don't agree with this and I
want to arbitrate the matter.
And then an arbitrator, decides.
We have to follow what an arbitror says."
2024-01-05,"okay.
Thank you."
2024-01-05,"member nguyen, let's go to
you."
2024-01-05,"he's one of the employers
that he works everyday, he represents that."
2024-01-05,member wechter.
2024-01-05,"yes, I do have others.
I do have questions. How longevity."
2024-01-05,"we do have longevity premiums, they're small in comparison with other reports. They have sought for an increase and the sheriff has long said that he does support
an increase in premium to help employees work longer.
The way to close the gap is to have employees work longer while we continue to hire aggressively. And the way the employees want
to stay longer is if there is a reason and also financial incentive.
This is the time for na to happen because city wide negotiations have started and the city and county of san francisco. I don't have a better answer
for you than that because that will happen during the process."
2024-01-05,so our longevity is in affect and what are the amount ?Z
2024-01-05,"one is 5% and 7, I will research and let you know."
2024-01-05,how does that compare to sfing pd and other law enforcement departments.
2024-01-05,"sure, I think that's what
the position will be that they
want longevity pay for what they receive for their members."
2024-01-05,"okay, and going back to the arbitration recollection verse al of disciplinary.
Do you have any figures on how the number of disciplinary action that's have been reversed by sfsh traitors."
2024-01-05,-- arbitraters.
2024-01-05,I don't but I can research. How far back?
2024-01-05,couple of years.
2024-01-05,"sure, I will get that
information for you as well."
2024-01-05,"and then you mentioned the
tablets, do you know what they
can access on those tablets?"
2024-01-05,"sure, there is entertainment
apps, also seeking to do what
we call direct messaging the
ability for the incarcerate today connect with their case or teachers of the program that
has yet to be implemented. We have run into difficulties. Those are the apps, I can get
you a full list as well."
2024-01-05,"yes, when member palmer and
I went to the jail, one thing expressed is that they don't have the same access
information and I checked on the access and they use something like vie a path and I
got a list of the things that
they can access including the
california dmv to renew their
license and english as a second
language, counseling for
alcohol and drug abuse.
I want to see if police department are in par with the sheriff's."
2024-01-05,"we deliver a lot of programs
in-person, we have a a programs
where case providers provide that direct service either in
groups or one on one.
We MAY not have those apps but
it's because we deliver the services in-person either
individual or in group to
include independent study or so
receive their high school
education or ged."
2024-01-05,"to receive that counseling on substance without having to
come forward and talk about it."
2024-01-05,I will research.
2024-01-05,"thank you so much for the presentation, it's great to see
the numbers and videos and see the good works.
I also think that they provide information and showing how the sheriff department is out in
the community.
But I echo what member wechter was eluded to.
So to hear that we're providing services for member and women inside, would be great to hear
and know what the services are and what organizations we're
working on I'm big on prevention as well as not going
back.
What access and other resource that's are available for them.
I did want to hear a little bit
you touched on something as
we're talking about budgets and understanding that human
capitol is people are the most expensive that you have on any business or department.
What are we thinking about in terms of recruitment.
I mirror we touched on it, but
are there any innovative ways,
but to give the people, so we don't have people working 16 hour shifts working three days nays row and exhausting themselves."
2024-01-05,"sure. So I want to touch on the drafting and the working three days in a row.
We currently have a policy in
place where, the actual employees, the employees from artial to artial which is the
draft. Employees will not be drafted
for more than two days from ado to rdo.
So that's in place, so currently employees cannot be
drafted for more than two days
from their day offs.
We do recruitment, we have done radio ads and bus ads, however
I think the best way to recute
is deputy and word of mouth. Talking about how great the job
is. Barry bloom, the video you just
saw. He's proud because he saves
lives and he does that everyday.
Whether you work in our field operations, we make an impactful difference to the people of san francisco and that's the word that we need to get out to make sure people
know that this is a great job.
It's a regarding job and we can make a difference in people's lives.
We have found that."
2024-01-05,"okay, now, I appreciate that. I was really having a conversation earlier today, just around workforce
development in looking at the next generation, that's coming
in and to line of work and
thinking about how we get to
folks a little bit earlier
about some of these
opportunities and how is here."
2024-01-05,"sure we have, we've done a
lot of research and talk internally about how we improve our numbers.
And the generation I came in
on, would not come in.
We just won't see those numbers probably for another generation.
Buzz we know that people coming into the workforce really learn from social media. Really learn from a quick
contact, really learn about the department from something very
easy that they can see and read. We've done recruitment and hugely successful.
We post quite a bit on our
website and social media accounts."
2024-01-05,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
2024-01-05,"I asked a question but I
want to echo what board member wechter said, what the programs look like. That would be helpful and thank
you for your time here.
Taking away from the work that
you're needed to do.
When people are using those the
tablets, are they recorded the communication between case managers.
I know that jail calls are recorded, right? Are the tablets being recorded?
Is there some kind of more of a privacy with the tablet or less? Or same expectations."
2024-01-05,"great question, I just want
to touch on the jail calls. Jail calls has an announcement, before the line connects, they
are advised that the call is
being monitored or recorded. And any individual is excluded.
For example calls from
attorneys, from the office of public defender are not recorded.
In terms of the data on the tablets, nobody has asked and I have not researched I will find
out and let you know.
And I will include that in the packet that I submit to the board as part of the requested data."
2024-01-05,"and I do believe that. We've had multiple presentations, right?
From the sheriff's and I believe that we have been presented some of that information.
But I will be frank as somebody
that is not working day in and
day out, it's important that we
articulate in its full understanding and, because also
assuming that there is changes to that."
2024-01-05,"I don't want to give credit credit for the past presentation that the sheriff's
has done in where the sheriff has provided that information
beforehand.
I want to recognize that work. So if you're right there, you're like I remember that."
2024-01-05,"I appreciate that.
I just want to really call out,
our director, she does
phenomenal work. Thank you for that I appreciate that. Thank you vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
That was just a comprehensive
report, and I'm sorry, I kept on saying, can you talk about
that.
That's how the report grew. You saved us from some of the
questions.
It's good for the public to
know the breath of the, some suggest it's just the courts
and buildings but it's on the
ground and really saving lives. I also want to remind the public that everything in our meetings has been archived and it's in our website. And I want to remind our
members that we can look back at minutes and detailed
presentations and most of the presentation are in-person
presentation are delivered to
our commission secretary dan
and it's posted on our website. So I wanted to know about the
current cost of the academy training?
And then, is know that our hiring time with our city takes a while.
We've been through the process
of getting an inspect or general that is non civil service.
Do you have an idea of the loss to other jurisdictions because our hiring process is lengthier than some of the other
jurisdictions?"
2024-01-05,"so to the first point, I do have those numbers, I submitted
during the last budget cycle.
I'll include it in the packet, in terms of knowing how many
people go to a different agency, because another agency offered them a job first.
I don't know that we maintain in that fashion.
From start to finish for each time we test.
So say for example we had 100
applicants. so that data we domain tain but
in terms of who left to go to
another agency, I don't know how to track that data."
2024-01-05,"and then about the current
employees who leave for other jurisdictions, do you do exit
interviews to find out."
2024-01-05,"we do exit interviews if the
person wants to participate but we do track data, I'll get that to you."
2024-01-05,"thank you, and in terms of disciplinary action, if it's not really serious is there a
plan for corrective actions? For newer deputies who actually show promise but don't have the experience?"
2024-01-05,"that's a great question.
So we do, we work very hard to
provide training rather than imposing discipline on the
front end. It's hugely important to teach new employees what in job is
about? We've taken uphold the constitutions.
When you raise your hand and
take an oath, it's special.
So the pass academy to pass the
board of direction corrections, it's meaningful and costly. So we want to help employees
along. We do offer collective
measures, it could be a conversation, it could be a written counseling.
It could be a mediation, so there is a number of different programs that we use on a regular basis."
2024-01-05,"and what else can I ask you
about?
So, I was going to ask you reitying the organization that
we partner with, we would like
to invite them to speak. next month, we're having the
public defender, so we want to know about the organizations and we had nick from present legal services.
So the only kind in the nation
which is pretty impressive.
So we wanted to figure out how
we dove tail more to find out,
prevention, but somebody who is in there to prevent recidivism
so we can be more successful on
that."
2024-01-05,I'll include that in my packet.
2024-01-05,and we note that you have recruited.
2024-01-05,"we have! I'm very excited
that patrick is here, I told him at least a dozen times."
2024-01-05,we look down the road to inviting him and see how we can be supportive of the budget.
2024-01-05,"I think that's great, I appreciate that very much."
2024-01-05,"thank you very much and if there are no questions, we will let you go back to your busy day."
2024-01-05,thank you very much.
2024-01-05,"thank you.
So is there public comment on
this agenda item?"
2024-01-05,"for members that would like
to make public comment for line number 41234 please line up
along the wall and approach the
podium when it is free. It appears there is no public comment."
2024-01-05,"so dan, the next agenda item?"
2024-01-05,"calling line item number 5.
The department of police
accountability presentation.
Alexandra direct of mediation of dpa, will appear to give a presentation."
2024-01-05,"thank you for being here
aly, so I want to tell the
viewers there is a rhyme and
reason for how we're calling.
Down the line, we'll see what
we want to delve into but it's
good to get."
2024-01-05,"great, thank you for putting
that into context. Just a tiny housekeeping
manner, I think dan is my technical assistant, so wonderful. Thank you all so much for
having me today.
I'm aly, schulthies, and I'm
the director of mediation.
I'm so proud of our ma'am. I'm a recovering lawyer,
graduated from what was
hastings back in the 90s, after
some time practicing civil law
and raising a family, I became
certified as a mediator in 2015
, harmonious of mediation to
the adversary process. I actually started volunteering
as a mediator with the occ. Soy came in as a participant
and loved it so much and ended
up working as a investigator
and senior and investigator and
now as director of mediation.
I'm continuing with education
and dispute resolution types of
education, just completed a class in restorive, so always interested in what is happening
and what is new and how we can
brings that to our program and how that can inform the things
that we do.
So I want today give you a little history of our mediation program, it's been longer than
people think, it's been around
since 1995, that's when it was formerly established t.Used to
be called the office of citizens complaints O.C. C, so
it went under that name.
For quite a long period in
early to late 2000, it was
headed by a woman donna salazar
that was employed by a nonprofit organization that
some of you MAY be familiar with, they provide mediation and all kinds of civil disputes, they have all sorts
of programs in the city, a
really great organizations.
Donna recruited a lot of her colleagues from community
boards to be mediator with the
occ programs and many are still volunteers and fantastic
mediater. In 2018, paul henderson took over as the directer of what
was then, known as the dpa still known still now known as
the dpa.
Now that's me.
The former occ mediator that's
now moved into that role.
Some of this is a little related to that. Where does mediation fit in in
our process?
It is an alternative to the
investigative process.
It's a way to resolve results.
What we do is we set up
in-person or virtual meetings
with sfpd or whoever the
complaintant MAY be in a calm,
safe productive manner. Between the officers and the
public.
It's to help improve and it's
to softer conversations where
the reports are free in a calm
and productive environment.
I spoke a little bit about how
I was a mediator.
We are incredibly lucky to have
a variety of unpaid volunteers
who are highly skilled and,
well trained and have. They don't have suggestions to
either of those agencies. Currently we have about 25 on
our panel.
They're unpaid, at least a 40-hour certification training in mediation which in
california is sort of the
standard for being hold
yourself out as a mediator.
They come from a variety of back grounds some social
workers, some have attorneys.
All over the boards so they bring a lot of perspective and
skill set to the job.
In order to avoid any conflict
of interest, we have restrictions on who can
volunteer, they cannot be a
current or former member of sfpd, not being part of criminal practice as a lawyer. I will not read everything on
here, but you can see that we
have limitations so we can
avoid any conflict. So thed critical features of
our program, this is a non disciplinary alternative to the investigative process.
So I think I had said a few moments ago, this was an
alternative. This is kind of off-road from
the investigative process.
At the end of the mediation, we
don't make a determination as
to fault, no fault, we make no recommendations regarding
discipline.
We consider the heavy different
thing to have bnl conducted.
So once the mediation is done,
the case is closed.
It's a voluntary process, nobody is coerced in the
process.
If a complaintant wants to and
the officer does not want to,
it does not go forward. We have to have folks who want
to be there and fully engaged. some require settlement
agreement, we don't. In fact, we don't really
require anything. We require that the parties
show up.
And sometimes there are
apologies, sometimes there are robust discussions, usually
there are robust discussions. Sometimes there is information
chair that can be useful. But we don't guarantee that anything is going to happen and
we don't require that a settlement agreement be created or signed off on.
Really the item behind this is,
it's a forum, in a calm place,
with skilled mediators. Where we can bring the party
together and have them see each
other as humans and talk about
their perspectives.
They MAY walk away not agreeing but at least each had an opportunity to sit and fully
listen to the other person.
And each had the opportunity to
express themselves. Giving them the opportunity to express themselves is so important and sometimes all people really want and this is
a forum that does allow that and every one's full attention
is on them. We also have interrupting
services.
There is some dim nations on
the weighings of cases that can
be mediated.
9 more, the easiest to say this
is the more complicated like officer involved shooting that
dpa is involved with, those are
not the things that we have the
ability to mediate.
For our program, there are more
than.
such as conduct on becoming an officer, that could be
rudeness, a person feeling that
they were disrespected that
type of thing can easily be
candidate for mediation. Negative duty, maybe paperwork
was not filled out.
Our type of case on one complaintant and one incident,
that is the easiest one to do.
Of course if nrr -- if there is couple of officers, we can do that.
The more complex in terms of legal issue, maybe constitutional violations, allegations and things like
that. Our program does not the band
with to handle those. They're all serious of course but these are less complex
cases that we're talking about. So the complaintant has to deal
with the fact that the complaintant is there to participate in this.
This is not way to get information for a future
lawsuit, they're in good faith.
For the officer, it's a little
more complicated in the sense
that we have restrictions, you
cannot get complaints filed against you everyday and
mediate them all.
If you've had, against that
officer, a certain number of
time has to pass.
I stole from baltczar."
2024-01-05,it's very pretty.
2024-01-05,"it's very pretty.
But you can see there in the top middle, the blues section,
I want to orient where mediation is in this process.
So it does not go through the investigative process, it does
not go through, we don't make
discipline recommendations. To mediation if appropriate and
it ends there as well.
That is something that every
one signs on.
We don't make a guarantee as to
what is going to happen. Once it has mediated, that's
the end of the road.
I think I have that coming up."
2024-01-05,"well, I I think it's this slide and I'll talk about it a little bit more. This is how it works.
So the complaint would be filed
again, that's advice a this person can come into the office
and email us et cetera.
The intake investigator whoever
is on intake or taking cases
that particular day. Will interview and get a sense
of what that case is about. And take a recorded statement
and from that complaintant and
hopefully, if appropriate bring
up the concept of mediation. Tell the complaintant and see
if they're interested at all.
Then work within a team model.
The team is comprised with a investigator and a team
attorney. Then that team, will look at
the case, they look at all of that investigator's cases to make sure that they're all,
this is how we want to proceed with this particular case and make sure everybody is on the
same page.
So say the investigator says,
I've identified this case, the complaintant express some sort
of interest, I would like to
refer it to mediation.
That team, consisting of senior
investigator and attorney, will make the determination if it
should be referred to me.
and I get people to agree to participate or gauge whether
they're interested and sort of
see their eligibility and so on.
And yeah, I think I completed
that little process.
All right, the objective, these
are similar to our mission but
one of our main objective is to
improve the relationship between community members and
sfpd.
As I said before, you get
people together and get them to be human beings not representations of something
else.
We are trying to foster
conversations. We have third party mediator
and we're trying to impact the attitudes, the understanding and behavioral of officer and
community member.
Often times, the community
member will leave saying, oh
wow, I didn't know that was
what they were suppose to do. I'm glad that officer explained
that process to me.
Often times we have an officer
going, I didn't really think of
it that way.
Or that was a hectic situation.
I didn't realize that the way I
said, hey, buzz off, was so
impactful.
So there is a way to think about that with their future
and behavior and the way
they're interacting. This last subjective is different from the investigation. It allows the parties to resolve the differences themselves. Rather than depend upon the
judgment of others.
What I mean here is the investigative process is
fantastic.
But because of confidential laws associated with law
enforcement associated with law enforcement records.
When a complaintant files a complaint after they're given a
statement, there is little involvement that the complaintant has with the rest of the process.
The investigator takes it and does a fantastic job running
through the process. But that complaintant who,
understandably thinks about that case as theirs, you know,
is not a part of the interviews
with the officers, right.
Is not part of watching any
body worn camera and not part
of reviewing any materials.
In the mediation, we don't watch body worn cameras but we do have a complaintant and the
officer there together and the complaintant can ask whatever
he or she wants. And they really can participate
in a way that is meaningfully
different than how they can safe in an investigation.
So it's a way to feel empowered
in that way and we think that
that's really important.
The participants, we do an exit
survey at the end of mediation.
Of course we with covid we
changed entirely to online.
We are now in a hybrid model, so we use either in person or online.
And sometimes we do double hybrid, we do whatever works, whatever works to get people
together in a comfortable way.
We have the officers are,
almost always, 93% of the participants say they were satisfied or very satisfied.
That's everybody. Complaints as I said before, they had an opportunity to listen to them, always a good
thing.
They have an opportunity to meet members of the and explain something na happened that they
didn't have a chance to explain
in the heat of the moment. So these are quotes from the
folks.
Some say that the mediator do a
great job to express themselves. This is again, we can go to the
next slide.
The case is referred to the mediation, it's the lower left
circle. Then the mediation team, me reviews the case.
Then, I will contact the complaintant and the officer to see if they're interested.
If they're not interested, then we do go back to investigation.
It's just done.
If they are interested, we
schedule a mediation.
We have a mediation by person
virtually some hybrid.
This next diagram is to show, I think eric used this for his
presentation.
I'm always available to answer anything later but I'm happy to answer questions now as well.
I also realize that your name
was misspelled."
2024-01-05,"it does not follow any
grammar rules."
2024-01-05,"MS. Afuhaamango, do you have any questions?"
2024-01-05,"yes, I do have a few questions.
And I also want to say this,
just speaking from my own
personal view point with the
system as it stands, it's so
unfair and I love that there is an alternative avenue to reconcile with the two parties."
2024-01-05,"thank you. Point of clarification, what happens when a complaint happens, it either goes to one of those two routes?
They will never be an instance where it would not go to either?"
2024-01-05,"there is not.
I mean, I have all sorts of
ideas about third ways, but as
of now, there is no other way.
It would go to investigation or mediation, those are the only two routes that we currently have available."
2024-01-05,"that's great.
And then the second point just to clarify, maybe you mentioned this h when you're talk about
thing safe space for the two
parties to express themselves,
it happens, meaning, whatever
they say in that space."
2024-01-05,"thank you for asking that, I didn't emphasize that,
everything is confidential and
really the confidentiality is about using that for future
proceeding. Everybody signs confidential
agreements before the session starts and the mediators or I
go over that again, at the beginning just to make sure that everybody is on the same
page. We don't typically have an
issue but it's important for us
to make sure that everybody take that seriously so that people are of course free to speak openly and they don't have that fear, and that's on both sides really. So they don't have that fear that something they say is
going to get them in trouble or
come back to haunt them, yeah."
2024-01-05,"thanks, member nguyen."
2024-01-05,"thank you, regarding the
settlement, what is the criteria that you're going to include that."
2024-01-05,"our program does not require settle agreements and we don't really, to be honest, I've never been in one where
somebody has wanted to have one
just because we don't present
it as an option.
Part of the difficult is to
somebody has to mon or that
agreement is being adhered to.
We don't, as this is, I'm the entire department, we don't
have the resources.
And I don't think it would
require anyway."
2024-01-05,member wechter.
2024-01-05,"thank you very much.
I worked at dpa for 18 years
and worked closely with donna
salazar who was a good friend. And you did a great job
explaining it.
We have a mediator and we
promote it as strong as we can.
As equals which is great.
Few questions.
As the 7 percent that were not satisfied, what reasons did
they give?"
2024-01-05,"yes, I will say, there are
cases where people just aren't
satisfied, and what they're
really not satisfied about is there is nothing that can really be done.
These are complaints that are
valid, it's frustrated, it's not that the officer did
anything wrong.
For example, we have immediate
ated a number of cases that
have unhoused population. And some feeling frustrated
about calling the police and
unhoused folks are still there,
something like that.
It's more complicated so we can
talk about that in the
mediation but ultimately is the encampment outside of somebody's house gone at the end? No, it's not. So there have been cased like
that where people are frustrated that the underlying
issue is not resolved and sometimes those are larger
policy issues that volve a lot
of other agencies as well.
That has been the case in many
situations with the 7%.
Otherwise, we can remember one scenario where the complaintant
did not feel like the officer
was, just didn't really feel
the officer, not that he did do anything, but she didn't
connect with him and she didn't
feel like he was owning up to
what he had done, that's rare but that's an example of
something that happened."
2024-01-05,"two more questions, in
regard of team's straining of
mediation.
Assuming the complaintant is
agreable and officer are agreeable and they qualify because of factors.
When I was there, many
occasions, a fair number typically involving traffic
stops, they felt they didn't
deserve the ticket, they want
today mediator. But it failed, and sustained that allegation and count that as a sustained case.
Is that still happening?"
2024-01-05,"I guess the best thing I can
say is it's a case by case
basis it depends on the team on whether or not it could proceed
or not.
I understand what you're saying
and there could be ways that the mediation process can be
forwarded. I'm a big proponent as of moving as many cases into mediation.
So when I do know about cases
like that, I throw that perspective in but ultimately,
it is a team by team and if
there is real, disagreement it
can go up the chain of management to make a final
decision."
2024-01-05,"then after donna salazar retired, did hal have any
experience managing the program?"
2024-01-05,"I know na, MS. Alsle had
worked with other programs with
the ag's office but I'm not sure precisely of her
background in mediation."
2024-01-05,"and do you know whether the
number of mediation decreases
or increases?"
2024-01-05,"you know, I don't I don't know, I can get that
information.
Donna had a well-oiled machine to ensure, she created the program. Is know that she had a number of mediations going. I know that they had made some
changes to some of the protocol
when sharon came in."
2024-01-05,"I would like to focus on
what is on for our board for since we're pressed for time today and what is on agenda.
I wanted to move on to member
brookter and his questions."
2024-01-05,"thank you for that.
Thank you for the presentation and really no questions, really
familiar with dpa on my time
with the police commission. So I had an opportunity to sit
through what you shared.
As we bring in our ieg and even with my colleagues.
In what was the key take away
that we took from this, and communication, communication, communication. So I saw that in here and I think it's a good thing when you can bring folks together. And we can communication and
have some of the difficult communications and create a space for us to do it, thank you."
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
2024-01-05,"yes. Thank you for all of your work
and thank you for being
well-oiled-women department, I
had a lot of experience with mitigation and litigation and
all court of areas and I think that, depending on the
mediator, it can be inxraedably
positive and fruitful process. If mediation does not work, it goes back into.
So when I hear about the 7%, I
understand the example like
this is, there really is no
remedy but are there exemptions
that you thought in the process, this officer MAY need
to be investigated. There should be an exception
for this case because as I'm
sitting here, there is conduct that really should go back into
this system? Or not system, but into the process of complaint investigation process."
2024-01-05,"sure, sure.
I hear your concern and I think that our mediation model is
different than a lot of other
mediation models.
And to the point of the skill
of the mediator, I will say
without reservation that our mediator are incredibly skills, amazing to observe.
Having said that, I will also say that sometimes they barely
need to do anything because what really the power of this program is to put them in the
room together.
We use a comediation model, so
we have two mediator at each mediation, we have a calm environment two people together and we say, we have an hour here, we don't have anything else to do, this is what we're
doing.
And the people themselves, we always start with the complaintant, the complaintant
tells his or her story and gets
it out and feels listened to and feels heard, the officer
responds and sometimes, they
are off and runing, they're communicating, going back and forth and the mediator, frankly
are just there, you know.
Kind of waiting."
2024-01-05,facilitating the sfrtion.
2024-01-05,"exactly.
We have we can focus and make sure that we have productive
session. We don't, there has been times,
I think there have been some times when the case has been
investigated and at the end the complaintant still feels frustrated.
And we have sent it back for
remediation.
It's unfair, it's a resource issue, it's already gone
through the whole process and
send it to be redone.
I have never been in a mediation where I thought, oh this officer needs to be sustained. That's just never happened.
Now this is going off the rails, I have personally, never
had that experience. We already made the offer in
agreement to the officer, if he
or she agrees to participate, this is a non disciplinary format.
So it could be, now we say, oh, psych, you're going to be investigated. That's not to say that I'm not open of other ways of thinking
about things.
But in that case, I don't think
we would recommend.
Where the disciplinary could be
imposed for the sake of integrity and what we bargained for."
2024-01-05,"I have to say as a trial attorney, I tell folks, if
folks would be able to communicate a little bit better and understand each other, I would not have a job.
[Laughter]
That's what my job consist of.
Lots of people don't want to communicate, you're well
employed for many years to go."
2024-01-05,"so, when you said, that you
don't take out certain cases constitutional cases, is that saying, basically, you don't take excessive force of use all of those cases?"
2024-01-05,yeah.
2024-01-05,"it's a great point and
constitutional cases would be
like 4th amendment, but also,
forced issue typically for not
mediating force issues."
2024-01-05,ally your voice is so calming.
2024-01-05,yesle
2024-01-05,I -- yes.
2024-01-05,"your law school was just renamed.
I wanted to ask a little bit about your language lines so having been the commission and
worked with women who are
victims of domestic violence or human trafficking, I'm always
struck by that we think that it sounds great, like we have a
language line but so many is communicated through body language.
So now with zoom and other face
time, do you engage in video interpretation programs?"
2024-01-05,"it's a great point and a
great question. And unfortunately, our current situation is that we have
literally aligned. So an old fashion telephone
line, so we patch them in
verbally only.
I would love to get access even
a zoom type situation or
in-person, of course would be
even the gold standard.
I completely recognize the need for, you know, we obviously need to have the resources available for people where english is not their first
language.
And what we do have right now is just the telephone."
2024-01-05,"most of the law enforcement officers carry pocket cards to
make sure that their contacting
a language, if they realize
that the person they stopped or
victim is not english pro efficiently."
2024-01-05,right.
2024-01-05,"so the other part, as vice PRESIDENT Carrion pointed out, it's about communication and
listening and the other person feeling like that they're being heard.
And I just heard that attention
span has been reduced to 47
seconds from 2 minutes. So with interpersonal skills and I think about in a
generation that I grew up in,
large extended family, if you didn't behave, your older cousins would pummel you. Just to listen and be respectful of each other.
Do you offer training and then,
with that, with your mediation,
do you category things and
lessons learned so that you can
go and tell officers, you know what, and becoming of an
officer if you just waited an extra second for the person to feel that they were able to explain that situation. That that MAY have prevented this from happening?"
2024-01-05,"we don't currently have something like that. But it's a fantastic idea.
I do go around to the stations and remind officers about
mediation remind them that they
can actually request mediation.
They think that it has to be requested bit complaintant but
that's not true. We do about the general things
that come up.
But I don't necessarily go and
tell them about those issues."
2024-01-05,"I see enough on next door
where I feel like there is a bad perception, I made a call
and the person did not show up.
And often times I say participate in your monthly
captain meetings.
I'm nobody special but if
somebody happens, and I'm engaged, I'm able to call the
stations. More important than not, please
save and say thank you, positive reenforcement really helps."
2024-01-05,"it's a great idea, I think communication is critical and the more that we can do, the
more that we can be reminded that you know, people are out there trying to do the best they can. I think it's a really positive for way forward."
2024-01-05,"and you know, vice PRESIDENT
Carrion, pretty brought to mind one, as attorneys, we do bring it back to the system.
I also had a number of
experience as a public
arbitrator for resolution that
became thinra and we had a
complaintant we do securities
as well as issues and we found the conduct so agrecious, we stuck the complaintant with the fees and everything else.
He was doing things on his own and he was doing the trading
and it was not, you know,
direct the broker to do.
I feel like maybe there MAY be
an avenue.
And so, also doing enforcement
actions for the department of
insurance."
2024-01-05,"I wanted to add a comment,
to have a safe and constructive space to be critical of lawsuit where they MAY not necessarily feel safe saying these things to officer when they're on the street because of who they are
and life experiences all of
that, and it's an opportunity
to have an officer be educate beside a different perspective and about how, you the way that they interact.
Because know, folks don't know that we're on the commissions what we do things, they just
see who I am.
I have had an situations and
officers and deputy where I'm, I told them something about
themselves, let me tell you.
But I, I think that's really
valuable for officers to be
able to listen directly."
2024-01-05,"I'm amazed by the poise and
the strength of some of the
complaintants who participate
for being able for being very
direct, they don't get into yelling matches but very direct about their criticisms and
their frustrations. It's a great environment for
people to talk about."
2024-01-05,"just in general for law enforcement, for general
communities and people who have had repeated negative interactions, if they come from
a community where they're
feeling like they don't they're not hurt.
It would be nice to have some general findings and it can be a mutual learning experience."
2024-01-05,"that's great, thank you for
that feedback."
2024-01-05,thank you so much. We have to get to budget which is so important for all of us.
2024-01-05,"thank you so much.
If anybody wants to discuss mediation anytime, I'm always available."
2024-01-05,I appreciate your time examine comprehensive presentation. Thank you.
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,do we have any public comment on this presentation?
2024-01-05,"for members of the public
that would like to make public
comment for line item 5, dpa presentation, please approach the podium when it is free. It appears we have no public comment."
2024-01-05,"next agenda item, please."
2024-01-05,"line item number 6, sda-oig
and sdob budget item. Nicole armstrong, coo will have presentation."
2024-01-05,it seems like only yesterday we were discussing it.
2024-01-05,I know it comes up every year.
2024-01-05,and now we have fewer dollars to work with.
2024-01-05,"yes, that's the case but
that's the case across the city. We're facing a large, deficit this year for the city.
This is the city is trying to
make up the cuts where they
can, and it's all the general
funding department. Dpa, sda and all the rest of us.
So I'm going to give you, I
just have some numbers and I want to answer questions, the six-month report is due next week. So we're still working on some
of the data so it's still in fluctuate and the big report
will be at the end of JANUARY and beginning of FEBRUARY.
I have a little bit of numbers to give you but we're looking at the forecast and what is going in the future."
2024-01-05,"and while it's top of line, so you can point out particular
dates where we MAY schedule a special meetings to have a hearing."
2024-01-05,"we're going to do as much. We're going to make sure that we have one at least here at
the beginning of FEBRUARY. The other one just has to be the public one where we ask the
public for information about it for dpa, we're going to
schedule at the library. So that way, we can get as many people to join.
i'm going to talk to the ig to
see how he wants to do it. But I will offer and let him know if he wants to join us at
the library, he's more than
welcome to. We started on monday, I have
not been able to brief him about the budget or any of the information.
I can tell you that we did have
a mid-year budget cut.
The budget cut included some positions that they had to give
up because they had a number of
empty positions and 60,000, so it's becoming a piece meal and each of the departments have
been asked in addition to the
mid-year budget cuts to do
additional cut for next budget.
So a 10% for the first, and then an additional contingency after that.
So, these are going to be
should very very hard times for sda because most of the budget will go to filling positions. You will notice when you look
at the budget books, it looks
like sda have larger positions available but there is not any
money to support those.
So part of any discussion with the ig is identifying what
positions to fill and what funding is actually available, it's not just funding, it's
going to be the fringe benefits and also operational costs.
And then of course they ask for additional funding that we can do in the future.
But I can tell you that because of the efforts, that dpa team has done. I think we saved a significant
of amount of money.
On day one, ig is going to be
able to go in and I made sure that the desk is up. He has a workspace and he's
going to have the systems, he's
got a cell phone, all of these
things are up running for him. Within the sda system for him to walk in the door the first day. And we're really excited to
help him out.
And, dpa is going to continue
to support no matter what.
So I can give you some numbers, I can give you things but it's going to change because what is
going to come out for the next week once we have these things
figured out.
As of right now, there will be some significant money left over but that's because, there
is no positions filled.
Most of the budget, you have one position, and then you're
going to have the ig.
But the ig is starting six
months in, that's six months of
salary saifks, that will be because you have a years of
salary. They also have some savings
because of that, so we do have
extra none this year. I'm not anticipating having
extra money next year.
We laokds at hiring total 5
position that's comes out 1.2
million dollars out of 1.8 million dollars budget plus
additional budgets, so that's
going to be $400,000 or $300,000 operational costs that they can use to do their op raisesing.
As you can see, the money is shrinking very rapidly and
we're trying to use it for the development of the program and
dpa will continue to support it for as much as we need for what we can do."
2024-01-05,"so, when you say dpa will
continue to support it, does
that mean that no complaints
will kind of be delayed, they will be continued in the process? And they will be timely addressed?
Is that, I just want to clarify
so that the public understand
that if they complain right now because there is a transition."
2024-01-05,"there is going to be a whole transition plan in place. Dpa is taking complaints, I think we received them on a
daily basis. Our team is dedicated to doing those.
We're not missing any of the deadlines, all items republic sent to the sheriff's on time
and dpa will continue to do that in the future until they're ready to take over and go forward."
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,"we have a work order with
sda which is reviewed by ig but
if we're doing work for them, then we get paid for that work
that we applied. So like our investigates, billing on those items but it's
a work order that is with the ig and will be talked about next week."
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,"and will those payments be renegotiated are they standing
because there is the memorandum."
2024-01-05,"it will be discussed about what the work that they still
need. And dpa will do whatever they need, they're also balancing
what they need as well."
2024-01-05,in the budget there are certain position that's are in the books but there is funding for some of them.
2024-01-05,"so which position right side
funding for the fiscal year undering JUNE 30th?"
2024-01-05,"so it's more about how much money is available to do that.
It's not like a direct line to
line item, it's large amount of monies and identifying what positions can be filled.
And it will be up to the ig to decide, some positions will cost more and some less. Some positions are not
available if it was used for
attrition to cover the other cuts that were available."
2024-01-05,"I think you mentioned a
figure earlier about what the budget cut for sda is, can you
repeat that, I didn't catch it."
2024-01-05,"it was 60,000, the mid -- year cut and two positions."
2024-01-05,and how many will be reduced?
2024-01-05,"it's going to be 330,000."
2024-01-05,"330, so what level discretion will the ig have about how to implement those cuts?"
2024-01-05,"both, ig is in charge of their department they will be doing whatever they need to do
with to identify the funding."
2024-01-05,"to, do they have a full discretion where to take the money from?"
2024-01-05,that's correct?
2024-01-05,okay.
2024-01-05,do you have any questions?
2024-01-05,"no questions, right now. But thank you for the presentation."
2024-01-05,uh-huh.
2024-01-05,"member wechter.
-- member brookter."
2024-01-05,none now.
2024-01-05,we'll be back.
2024-01-05,"thank you for your on going
support and also dpa in general.
i know how hard this has been.
You made the past year, very easy on us.
And we're just happy to have an
ig board to work with you. I expect the transition period to be at least, I think I've been saying it a lot, at least
a year to 18 months and depending on which positions
might be civil service or not
civil service for the investigates mostly civil
service so the timeline is to get more investigators on board."
2024-01-05,we'll follow through the process that the city requires and follow all the guidelines and we will continue to support as best as we can.
2024-01-05,thank you so much.
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,thank you.
2024-01-05,do we have any public comment on this line item?
2024-01-05,"for members of the public
that would like to make public
comment for line item 6, please
line up the far wall and
approach the podium. Appears to be no public comment."
2024-01-05,okay. So next item on the agenda.
2024-01-05,"item 7 and 8 were continued,
calling line item 9 future agenda items, discussion items."
2024-01-05,"so colleagues, we had a laundry list that dan kept for
us on future agenda items that
was in our NOVEMBER agenda.
So I tried to incorporate that
into our 2024 timeline task and
benchmarks.
And it mirrors what we did in searching for inspect or
general.
I like that member afuhaamango
said, what are our targets.
So I ask that you study that
particular document as well as review the quarter q4 report
and our annual report.
They are just drafts.
I ask that you reviewed your
biography we probably need to
update our biography.
And we're going to have that do
to the board of supervisors and
department of sheriff in MARCH.
So I'm going to ask member afuhaamango to help us make it
look nice.
I had scheduled a board photo
in MARCH, but we MAY want to do it sooner, next month. I would like to request to tha
any request of our sheriff's office or any for information, actually go through dan.
We need to have a more coordinated approach, so chief chu, does not have to go through.
And also things like jail visits, that it's more efficient if more of our members, if 3 of our members can go at the same time. And I think it's important to have three members at the same
time, so if there is any difference, at least there is
three people to verify and any request for agenda items, idealy three weeks in advance.
We already had the list of future agenda items, but what,
is not helpful is to have request the day before the
agenda is due to be posted
because, there is not time to vet through particular materials or think things out
and then, it also puts an extra strain on our secretary dan, because he's got a things to coordinate and often times it MAY be room issues and
additional it issues.
and so I think, vice PRESIDENT Carrion, you had additional comments."
2024-01-05,"yeah, I do.
We have established, right, every one, here has established
we voted on our priorities. We have identified what they
are.
And I think that let's stick, I
think our priorities are going to be working through this process as we learn from our
new ig of what, he sees, as
being things that need to be addressed more or some pitfalls or all of those things.
So I think it's really
important when making these requests when sending them to dan, as PRESIDENT And vice
PRESIDENT, that we should review those requests and be
able to vet them and say, are these within the priorities that we voted on? And if not, they should be
brought to the board, as a future agenda items, and then the board decides, you know what, this should be another
priority, right? Terrestrial rather than having
15 emails to the sheriff for
this, 15 emails to dp a for this, it does not serve the people that are trying to do the work.
So I would like to propose that
not only do we send any requests through dan which I
know, dan is working so hard and you know, we thank all the people that present all the time, but dan is here day in
and day out, so thank you dan for all the work you do.
But that we also as vice PRESIDENT And PRESIDENT, we get an opportunity to ensure that
they're in line with what the entire board has decided our priorities to be.
So I would like to make a
formal motion that that would
be the process moving forward
and that, three, if you have a request of the sheriffs, we received that they need at
least three weeks.
Send it three weeks before you want the presentation, myself and PRESIDENT Soo will review them. Check off that they're in the priority list.
If they're not in the priority
list, we can get back to the sender and say, this is something that you MAY want to
bring up to the entire board to
see if they want to make this
to add it to our priority list. I think that this will streamline the process. And I think that also goes into the heart of us working together as a board.
Where it's not just one individual acting by
themselves, it's that we are going to be moving forward on
the things that each and every one of us had a say on and agreed to.
So I would like to make a
formal motion to move forward but, interested in perspectives
and thoughts and you know, suggestions of how you think it
can be improved or if you have
a different strategy, this is an idea that I was going
through, of how we can be
efficient and also recognize
what the board has decided as priority."
2024-01-05,"I agree that the city attorney commented, not one member can act for the whole member, we have to talk about
the issues. And be in agreement in a majority.
So I department agree with that."
2024-01-05,I don't recall us voting on priorities?
2024-01-05,"yeah, we didn't vote."
2024-01-05,me either.
2024-01-05,"so that was going to be my
only discussion.
I'm all for it, in agreement. Should be stream lined, it should be efficient and I'm all about systems.
But I don't think, I think this was the beginning of our creating our priorities is we were going to pull together all
the things that we have put under future agenda items and find where the common threats were so share those were the priorities.
That's the only thing that we had not agreed upon our priorities."
2024-01-05,"so I don't think vice
PRESIDENT Carrion, if I can amend your motion to make it
for of a process.
I did take the priority list and put things in a particular order. You'll note that, from day
oncinger I asked about jail
health and way it's way back in
APRIL, like a year later.
And then we're gaining ground on being more community oriented. So that's listed there.
But I think in terms of process, you know, I think
maybe we do need to make a
motion, because we tried to do it informally it has not been
successful.
But all requests go through dan
that includes requests of reports from other agencies, supporting agencies and agenda
items as well."
2024-01-05,"if my memory serves me
correct, we were asked by MADAM PRESIDENT to submit our priorities."
2024-01-05,yes.
2024-01-05,that's what the start.
2024-01-05,how we suggested it.
2024-01-05,"and being able at what was
sent to dan and find the common treads."
2024-01-05,"I would accept that friendly
amendment for the process.
I would then suggest that the future item for next month,
that it not be only a discussion but discussion and potential action item.
So that way we can establish,
we can gak to these priorities
and consider what is it as a
board to select maybe our top five based on the preliminary, the work that has already been done."
2024-01-05,"and then.
Thank you for reminding of that."
2024-01-05,"and then, I would ask that,
I would ask that as we reviewed
since we continued, and I
apologize, I told dan the mind
was willing but the body and
mind restraints were. I didn't expect a decision
today.
To review the q4 report to see
where we're going and the
timeline and benchmarks. We're getting more information
on, and budget still top of
mind, but next month and member afuhaamango has asked for a presentation from the defenders
office.
I have spoken to defender and some of the organizations and member if you would help out, if you have organizations who
would like to present. And then, we that the following
month or moved it to MARCH, so
jail house is not a full year.
So that MAY take some time and
I need to go through chief yu to make that requests.
And the following the to is
respective of the deputy and member nguyen had asked about
the on going process. Working conditions and safety,
and so we can talk who MAY want
to present and maybe it's the
union had, and also, you spoke about report writing.
So I know that, the undersheriff had mentioned about report writing to make it
more efficient.
Then we move into MAY, we MAY have an opportune time to have
a town hall.
And I'm a proponent of joint commission meetings and the human rights commission MAY be a good commission to join with
us.
And the san francisco jail
coalition justice with that.
And we go into JUNE and more budget I. T. And the intersection of office and inspect or needs. And JULY is all about
reporting, we MAY not have time
for a presentation.
You've already noted that I lifted additional hours of
board training, that took a lot
of coordination and expense. The cost has gone up 3 2000 in a year.
So we had 20 hours of training. We were looking ambitiously to
80 hours.
We had a year of training, I
think we had more training and
the depending on budget and
what particular topics we think
are more urgents, look at you
general council of what you
think we might be most jermaine for us for us to training in the presence.
And then in AUGUST, we'll,
we'll get the prosecutorors, I think somebody mentioned prosecutors and victim services.
And then we get to SEPTEMBER.
So part of the charter is to use force policy.
And by time, we're looking at OCTOBER and community events, quarterly reports and then NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, I've left
it open and we MAY reflect and review what is going to happen
in the next year, whoever will be PRESIDENT, vice PRESIDENT To
move the ball forward.
But, the use of force policy review and recommendations is,
listed in the charter.
And I forgot to mention one crucial part, NOVEMBER meeting,
I was elected to work with
deputy city attorney on language amendments for our charter section and possible revision sxz getting a board of supervisor sponsor.
That deadline is coming up so I
want to remind board members to make your submissions, because
the deadline is MAY for NOVEMBER ballot, which means we
should be working on it now.
So that we can, not only discuss but finalize language
and have it vetted by the city attorney's office, have a particular sponsor and get it
done before MAY."
2024-01-05,"great, thank you for all of
that work. And the thought that went into
it, right. That's a lot of thought, work
product.
so then, I would revise or
change my amendment to say, I
move that, that all commissioners provide any
requests for the sheriff or for
dpa three weeks in advance to
the requested presentation."
2024-01-05,as well as agenda items.
2024-01-05,"as well as agenda items, at
a minimum 3 weeks. Not this morning, not
yesterday, three weeks. Since na we've already had our partners let us know the
challenges and you know, I
think, they want to do a good
job, we want to support them in doing a good job."
2024-01-05,"I just want to clarify.
If I wanted a property from the sheriff's office and I submit three weeks in advance, I shoot it to you guys."
2024-01-05,to dan.
2024-01-05,"and then dan, and then he, we vet it, we see if it's available.
It will MAY not be for the next
agenda item but at least we've
had it way in advance."
2024-01-05,"if I can jump in, the PRESIDENT And they cult with the V.P., that's what we want
to have the time to do is to reach out and ask the sheriff,
hey, this is the request that's
been reached out. Because we can't have every single request that is not in agenda form.
For example, the sheriff is
getting independent emails can you tell me how many reports for this, or are we getting
this kind of report for this,
right, then you know, we should schedule it at a time that they're going to be doing a report. That should be part of the agenda."
2024-01-05,uh-oh.
2024-01-05,"that would be part of the
agenda.
I think, the main concern is not having commissioners, independently ask the sheriff
for a thing a day or two before, and then expecting them
to prepare something.
It's not meant to curve the requests, it's meant to make sure that the requests are in a timely manner."
2024-01-05,exactly.
2024-01-05,"but also coordinator, if
chief chu, does not get the coordination, it's better to funnel the communication and say, this is what the board
decided. If it's something of urgency,
we'll bring it to the board. But we need to have it in
advance.
That MAY have sensitive
information, that we vaelz the
identity of deputy."
2024-01-05,"the rule has basically regarding agenda items, all
items must be submitted before the close of business.
And I know this was listed as possible action but you were
amending your rules.
So that requires ten days
notice."
2024-01-05,"grairkts I withdrawal my motion and we can have this discussion next.
We're all primed for the motion that will be coming next meeting."
2024-01-05,"even the week before would
really make a difference."
2024-01-05,"as a common courtesy, can we do that for now until we change the rules.
Let's be thoughtful."
2024-01-05,"so are there any other?
one last thing that I wanted to mention though, I am working
with the inspector and I welcome input that you can send to dan.
We're trying to come wup
templates so when I ask chief
chu, do you have a report, when
I saw marcel kind, do you have
data on these particular things that for the quarterly reports,
oh no we have to scramble for different things.
I want it to be we're collecting this position and we always want it."
2024-01-05,"and these are the things that we want, the categories, the break down.
What I will not do is ask to
you give monthly things that compromises the safety of the
city and operations of the office.
While you MAY be collecting it
monthly, and we can discuss it
at the next meeting, I will ask for quarterly numbers. So if you see in our time chart, we will talk about
quarterly numbers. And I've moved our deadline because we will be waiting for
things from the ig's report to integrate into our report to the sheriff and to the board of supervisors."
2024-01-05,"can I ask, MADAM PRESIDENT,
just for point of clarification, I want to make sure that you and vice PRESIDENT Are going to take this document and at the next
meeting, we can see that these are our five priorities?"
2024-01-05,"yeah, this is sort of a -- I
don't know if I need to make it in the category, but I went off
the list and so this is sort of a living, breathing document.
so even if we need to formerly
adopt this timeline, it is still flexible because if something comes up and we think it's more urgent, we will move it."
2024-01-05,"and again, I'm glad we're
having this discussion, because
it's just for clarity for me,
especially since we talk about priority of what we want to look like. To make sure that we're
generally on topic."
2024-01-05,"yeah, it's more like topical
and it was, so at different minutes and as I was going through the past minutes.
As I was doing the annual report, these themes keep oncoming up. Like you know, we still need or we have not heard from.
So I look those and mentally made a note and that's how I made it higher up."
2024-01-05,"can we make it more, I need simplicity, can we just."
2024-01-05,"if you want me to break it
down."
2024-01-05,"like this discipline process.
I would like to see that and topic and those are our
priorities."
2024-01-05,that risk that we saw at the last meeting.
2024-01-05,"just five, this is just for me and how I learn."
2024-01-05,"no no, yeah."
2024-01-05,"yeah, now I'm looking, the
fact na it's highlighted."
2024-01-05,"yeah, so I highlighted the
theme and put more stuff and
I'm sorry that Is got crossed.
And I put little details
underneath so I can get input
on who MAY be presenting, if it's something different from the vice PRESIDENT I had in mind."
2024-01-05,"thank you, no sure. And to vice PRESIDENT's
carrion's sharing, thank you so
much for pulling this together. I just think, I'm very systematic, so being able to
see the first step and going from there for me, definitely works."
2024-01-05,"so I was referring to a list.
But even then, when I was
looking at it, what is quarterly and my brain start
today shut off."
2024-01-05,"so for clarity then, the request that I'm understanding from you, is that at the next meeting, we just have the topic?"
2024-01-05,correct.
2024-01-05,"that we had already worked on, right?"
2024-01-05,correct.
2024-01-05,and submitted and that we have seen.
2024-01-05,"that was in NOVEMBER the
straight sheets."
2024-01-05,"correct, the straight sheets."
2024-01-05,did everybody see those. We were asked to send our priorities to dan.
2024-01-05,"so dan, if you circulate asked reproduce, so we use it as a guideline. But at the same time, I can just take out a list too."
2024-01-05,"I guess what I'm asking, we
know dan does not have to print
those for my edification, if
folks say, yeah, we do agree
that this was sent to dan and these should be our priority. Keep going."
2024-01-05,"okay, so do we want to calendar it?
I take this and I have that
list of five and then we resend it again and then we have input to dan?"
2024-01-05,no.
2024-01-05,"I think we should have an
opportunity to resend it.
I kind of worth smith, I kind of collectively and people want to compare.
I can do it like that. And those that gives us notice, these are the things that we're
going to consider, you know. We did this work in NOVEMBER.
There MAY be changes and that
way we can just be more aligned
in terms, we can say this is
what we made a decision to prioritize as a board going
forward. And it's flexible."
2024-01-05,"and the other thing to note
is na the request will go
through dan but we'll be working through inspect or general.
We want to be in alignment and we do direct, the priorities
with the inspector general as
well.
And I suggest that he'll be
touching base, we need to know
what is available and then how
the it MAY be should youinging
along and what is actually more
readily available this information we need for our
mayor's work. Look at us working through this."
2024-01-05,"communication.
Communication.
But just for my sake, I would
like a day of the land map.
Because I think it's important
to see what the impact."
2024-01-05,"and I think the presentation from nicker was very aye
opening and we did ask him. It's helpful for me to understand."
2024-01-05,"so na would be part of
receiving a part of future agenda item?"
2024-01-05,"yeah, and I'm saying it out loud, but I don't want to know
who does the work. This falls under what we're
going to do in FEBRUARY anyway.
So I am going to work on the presentation anyway.
And if it helps us, I like the
happens who is an n G.O. And
who gets funded by the city. And then how maybe people make the request for the services."
2024-01-05,"yes.
I feel like even with the presentation, I don't remember two months ago.
I do want to remind people to
look back at past minutes
because dan has been great at archiving things and also the power point presentation are sent afterwards, if we don't receive them and they're posted
as well."
2024-01-05,"in this manner though, we
have asked both of them to give it to them.
So we don't have to go back in the minutes because we asked
them."
2024-01-05,"but the point is, it will
get posted.
Once we have adopted the minutes, you don't, dan will
put it back under the actual
original meeting date.
These are all different
agencies that are piece meals.
And down the road, it's helpful
for the public once we have
made it more comprehensive.
So you can see a map and then a
drop down of where to find
people or contact people.
And also to clarify, that would be complaint facing, that's for somebody to understand where
they need to go. I think it's helpful for us with the prioritization."
2024-01-05,"yes.

:  , on what his department does for incarcerated individuals."
2023-12-01,"good afternoon. I'm nick gregoratos, director of prisoner
:  ."
2023-12-01,"here is melinda another
attorney in our offers and this
is asia who is our paralegal we put together a power point over
there I can't see my phone and a
quick presentation on what we do
that will cover-a brief
introduction a short history and
with with where we are to have the contraction a few challenges
and open up for questions."
2023-12-01,thank you.
2023-12-01,"so here we go we have put
together this is in front of you; correct?
I don't know we has and history
I don't know know if you have
the history not testing you but
put together about 10 or 12
years ago and covers back we
think that is good reading so we
thought you might like that the
legal services was started by
the sheriff prior to becoming
sheriff and became sheriff in 77
and got funding and when we
always had to report since we
had three sheriff's and they
supported us in 2019 and viki
adopted a policy and codified
your position in the depth
department and city and that's
where we're at to assist the
sheriff and do that and helping
people and the issues they deal
with the things and I were in
touch but unfortunately, the
population didn't have the wherewith all."
2023-12-01,"we make sure that every
incarcerated person has been
bought to the court that is y
why we're here our main mission
and provided the mission
material not only about a
divorce on that level they
understand your case matter."
2023-12-01,"they all have public
defenders and attorneys the
attorneys only have so much time one hundred and fifty people on
the caseload we will let you
know what that is. We provide
access to the administrative and
legal remedies and they're
guarantee for the right to the
information and when the oig
starts and assist with barriers
to reentry with people released
and driver's license anything
MAY help them stay out of jail
and get their lives back we help
the sheriff objective with his
mission and the treatment of people in the jails."
2023-12-01,"we fit in and under
sheriff's legal a direct line we
can talk to the sheriff 2340I789
we want for the trying to bother
him, too of but go through the
regular chain of command we work
with the chain of command but have direct line to the sheriff
if we see a problem we are
allowed to bring it directly to
him and not through the chain."
2023-12-01,what makes us different [Off mic.]
2023-12-01,"we won't go there
:
What makes us different access
to all jail facilities and times
in the middle of night in we
choose and have records and consumerized records if there's a problem in the jail somebody
is not identity in time the
attorney calls us and instead of
having to be a senior deputy we
can skirt all that and figure
out what the needs are and call
the court to help anti this is
who we are you met us so move on.
:  ."
2023-12-01,"um, like I would early we
direct the services and have
services to the sheriff's office
and assists the community and
the created people are helped
with the remedies with the dpa
eventually the oig. Claims
against the city other kinds of
administrative grieves we'll
help them in getting access to that right and give them forms
and materials to anything we
want to file that is happy
birthday corpus what we have
they want to file we try to
direct them the best we can."
2023-12-01,"and a long process we'll
include legal fee research we
don't analysis the form but we show historically we run
libraries and staffing and like I said, we give help them
correspond with elected officers
and government officers as
needed. Um, we do a lot of
support for pro-per for
prisoners to represent
themselves and most of our
services are a large chunk of
one wall of our office and flyers we have hundreds of
information that we developed
over the past 20 odd years if
you have a question an
burglaries whatever we have
information if we don't we'll
put it together for people to
understand what is going on."
2023-12-01,"and again, I talked about
barriers to re-entry we helped
thousands of people and asian
had a large chunk for someone
that who were broke we wrote and
check and they'll have their
agreement. We help with evictions and don't represent them if they need an attorney we
get them one if they're ejected
we support that lease of the
property and make an agreement
no eviction on their record and
make arrangements for the people
to move their property help in
custody and child support and
facilitate marriages we do all that."
2023-12-01,"we daily with the power of
attorney benefits and help them collect settlements."
2023-12-01,"one or more interesting one
we recently started if their in
custody prisoners have been
arrested frustrated individuals
get arrested an animal goes to
animal control. Any time for a
long time animal control sent a
letter to their address and the
person responds in a number of
weeks and unfortunately their
dog can adopted. And send us
angler and the dog we get the
paper signed and the animal is
able to be um, home with something else and not up for
adoption a good part about that
is when people come to jail
their stressed and a lot of going on. Above and beyond just
the case they're facing and
people love their animals and
they're nervous and don't want
to listen to the deputies they
on the want to get their animal
back it helps the jail if
someone is stressed can cause
problems with other inmates the
deputies will try to remove all those barriers with the real
estate problems we help the
court says someone a has 9 three
days time served and it is
transposed on the record of 39
days we figure that out and see
what is wrong maybe warrants in
the counties in the warrants are
not valid we get that taken care
of and so many warrants and
people in every county is
different 50 odd counties so
sometimes people oh, that
warrant is good turns out not
good and a lot of back and forth
we are better at it than we
should be because we've done it so many times."
2023-12-01,"we always registration
people to vote in 2003 started a
voting actually started that for
the prisoners in the jail
incarcerated individual. In 2006
secretary of state made it
known. And then in 2016, a lawsuit was filed from a
plaintiff in the county jail and stays throughout the state and a
lot more people can vote they
used to in a felony conviction
will never vote again but now in
2020 almost everybody in the
county can vote."
2023-12-01,"our programs in 2004 we have
a very close partnerships with the department of corrections
and last year gave us pods and
their ballot into the pod the
way we work we walk them through
the jail and so glad no election
this year 4 in 222 and last year
that's all we get and we're far
behind if people want to vote we
track them down with questions
and once the ballot comes take
the ballot to them and pick up
the ballot and many times they
register we have to go back and
get more signatures each person
votes sometimes four or five and
2022 alone over 3000 people
voted in the jail. We think that is pretty cool."
2023-12-01,"and we actually get calls
from other departments how do
you guys do if we make that a priority and the sheriff's
office has been a priority. How
do they found out about us incarcerated individuals I'm
sorry we have a little poster
hanging in every pod they know.
By the time they're out of the
county jail the deputies tell
them everything else to they can
call us on the phone that is
2003 voting we were actually walking up and down the old jail
and talk to people in the pod
now we don't have that jail
anywhere people know who we are and ask questions."
2023-12-01,"they fill out the requests you can see lots of them we
don't have to go through them."
2023-12-01,"and the fill those anti we
try to respond to them in
writing if not, we'll go and talk to them."
2023-12-01,"a quick example a dealing
with traffic tickets all the
time I can barely read it."
2023-12-01,"fast services to the
department we constantly going
to policies with change and
sometimes, we get people at the
table and done reports and
auditing and with workout
between the media and our media
person and person who are incarcerated the media would
like to talk to. We are a barrier and talk with the person
and hook up with their attorney
about they make a statement we believe that is important though
know what they doing."
2023-12-01,"we also deal with compliance
people
undocumented on hold or sends
requests for hold that happens in the state of california
requires it now to notify that
person that ice wants them we
give them a pamphlet on all sort
of resources when they get out
to work on their relationships
and do core training for
deputies. We help out with-
and video inviting when covid
started everyday trying to help."
2023-12-01,"we do speaking combeechlts
like this and on the defensive
bar every single criminal defense attorney in san
francisco knows though, call for
help with their client.
Prohibition and courts contact
us three basic big internal
projects in the summer and have
full-time internship and during
the school we have they come in
on a weekly basis and talk with the incarcerated individual and
come back to our office and go and respond to the answers so we
get the answers back to the
person who had the question.
Many of our challenges are
staffing [Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,"not always this is fine but
other interims have challenges
with staffing and downsizing we
are down one person spanish bilingual."
2023-12-01,a paralegal we people-
2023-12-01,[Off mic.]
2023-12-01,heard it here first and wow.
2023-12-01,"we get our champions we get
support for the administration
20 years ago the support. But we
constantly can get things done
and sometimes have to work
around people like any other
bureaucracy and generally, we support."
2023-12-01,"considering we work with a
one person department and as far
as we know no other law enforcement in the united states
has this this is a cool thing and communication, communication
is a challenge sometimes in the
department. Sometimes with the incarcerated individuals but
some of the big challenges and
now. Your turn any questions?"
2023-12-01,we have questions.
2023-12-01,"wanted to put it in the
record that [Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,"let's begin on
:  ."
2023-12-01,"board member wechter since
you're here you have any questions."
2023-12-01,"216 three 1 of the reports
regarding specific practices and conditions can you, you give us
an idea and the second part of question will those with accessible to the public and board?"
2023-12-01,"so we have done-ones on
discipline mostly and A.D.
Second reports and recently in
the past few years e-mailed those kinds of things that's as
far as getting the mail but get
you copy of one of the reports
so I see."
2023-12-01,can you clarify that [Off mic.]
2023-12-01,"administrative actually called administrative separation
I believe one there."
2023-12-01,"many years ago we need the a
few that were they covered all
the jails especially we have the 5 or 6 opened difference in
every jail this is a super report we got push back but
recently go through the list and
looking say okay hasn't happened
some public defend will say the reason it's there we see
problems in the write up and look at everybody who happens to
be in on that day and look for
problems and sends up to the
captain and 9 other of ten times they'll knockoff where one person at that time the person
was out of custody and nothing
gets done that's what I mean
about the communications and
support that is better today than 20 years ago."
2023-12-01,off the top of my head no questions right now.
2023-12-01,no?
2023-12-01,thank you for that.
2023-12-01,"presentation. And also the documents. Heading it sitting
still out-of-sight but not out
of mind what-how do the effects
being held hear about you folks in terms of the other services
we provide.
:  ."
2023-12-01,"unfortunately, many of our
-a lot of our population are,
you know. Come in and out
frequent flyers they know about
us and someone new comes in and
has an issue this guy was done
here until 9 or someone just
word of mouth is saying up that
I would say if you walk through
the jail 9 out of 10 people know
about the legal services and use
our services about been interest
so long and as a matter of fact,
that's the point where family
calls and some attorney sails
the deputies send an e-mail 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at
night never used to happen they
fill you out a former. That is
funny our jail obviously is not
a place everyone wants to be and
from other jails over the jails
and represented people in santa
clara and monterey and while our
jail is not a place you want to
spend the night, it is so many
better than any other jail I
still see problems with that
that's why you guys-those
things having us do the core
training hey someone is having a
problem they're stressed you
don't have to deal with them
call us. And one person is not
who is stressed can mess up the whole pod we'll walk negative
impact and talk with that one
person and hear people yell and
it they'll start screaming okay.
I'm getting out of here they know us."
2023-12-01,"thank you for that and might
not be able to answer this but
I'll be interested might not be
what organizations are we
working with outside of the department people coming back so
what are what he able to try to
make sure that people are not coming back, you know."
2023-12-01,inside of jail but thinking about connections.
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,(Multiple voices.)
2023-12-01,"and question more towards the
programs and I know as far as
us, we- [Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,"as far as we work with um,
the evictions collaborative and
work with plaintiff what help people with legal agencies refer
them and as far as like housing
that is not us unfortunately."
2023-12-01,"we'll help them not get e
vishthd but we get a lot of
questions and amending the
programs or give them resources
that hey we knock on all the doors."
2023-12-01,"outside of resources and
answer the question before we
don't have to answer directly go talk to this it organization they'll help."
2023-12-01,"right I think that is more
for allen."
2023-12-01,or who whoever is out of town.
2023-12-01,"thank you coming up with
even with wish lists from each
agency or department working
with us, we should know about

2023-12-01,"so you know for years the
aclu had people come in and had
we called them please stop
sending us collect actives every
single year but people know with
do it and that's cool."
2023-12-01,"I have just a few questions
the type questions you receive
which is I would say the majority?"
2023-12-01,so I upstairs.
2023-12-01,you know. I mean.
2023-12-01,"I think the breakdown is
that 70 percent for materials
and information. So questions
about the criminal law process I
have a primary hearing next week
what does that mean. Or a
hearing in the public defender's office."
2023-12-01,"they rely on us for support
services for their client."
2023-12-01,"so you guys-
:  ."
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,"yeah.
[Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,yeah [Off mic.]
2023-12-01,"and then what is the
percent that your team-the

2023-12-01,we're open to all.
2023-12-01,"we haven't actually-
:  ."
2023-12-01,"there are some that utility
utilized our services."
2023-12-01,"most effectively way to be
in the jails and cell to cell
that is difficult for the
staffing we really rely on our
intifrmz that is critical like
uc sf an enormous help we go to
the areas and cell to cell when
we do that everyone who is like
door to door."
2023-12-01,"I was occurring in the
population of seven hundred plus."
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,thousand.
2023-12-01,"okay. At one point that was
like [Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,they have everyone speak into the microphone.
2023-12-01,a sorry.
2023-12-01,so we can capture it on the video.
2023-12-01,it's all the questions I have.
2023-12-01,"I know you have a couple of
questions I know you have a
busywork today."
2023-12-01,"the public's edification we
have serious questions for mou I
want to know about the in custody services so say
something low level someone
needs a supply like hygiene
comfort supplies and in terms of
particular grievenlz how is that filed."
2023-12-01,"the grievances are technical
under custody we get flievenz
against person services a lot of
those we got one today we go to
the database no record we responded some stuff let us know
what you need. But a grievances
that should be they need a razz
our should be answered by the
captain in the pod and deputy
will sign off on the grievance
and have a prisoner sign off a
title paper or toothbrush and
grievances the policy. You have
access to policies we- [Off mic.]"
2023-12-01,"oh, well I printed them out I think I left them in the
office we can get you guys a
copy of the policies. Basic the
policy says I get a grievance no
title paper my job here's your
title paper and; right? I gave
inmates title paper the inmate
signs off if you want to appeal
if I don't get you, your title
paper that didn't happen but appeal it to supervisor and
they'll try to respond that didn't happen they are in the
happen with the response so it
goes to um, facility commander
the same in the office and asian
will answer first, I'm then answer after that."
2023-12-01,"an ladies and gentlemen, al
gas station of staff misconduct.
And we'll route it properly, you
know. Margaret for their review."
2023-12-01,"that's actually in the
policy and follow-up with the
kieflgz can or the under sheriff
and margaret or sheriff's counsel. However,
counsel. However, I'm sure I lost your questions."
2023-12-01,the grievances.
2023-12-01,"if we get one that says hey
a sexual assault and advise the
facility commander right now and
get an ""x"" excess force and also
times over the years made and
complaint about excessive force
and get a copy of all and pass
it on to the command and so to
make sure that-and I think
almost everything now we work
with the dpa a little bit we
have one of our packets actually
tells how to get ahold of dpa
that will change in JANUARY and we'll get that information
drirtd to our incarcerated
population to them to contact
the oig office to set that up hope that answers your question."
2023-12-01,it does.
2023-12-01,"a final question on the invitation by family and if you'll work with the
communications and family and I know that is really difficult
with the staffing to actually
try to schedule so there are certain things you think are
high priority a way to get a family member?"
2023-12-01,"if a family member-oh,
yeah. I we get contact phone
calls my daughter or son is in
jail we fascinate it since covid
started and it is hard to get
the families visits we started
last week isn't that; correct
and two more nights a week we
visit and some have problems
getting-making the
appointments I spoke with the
chief about that and they're
complaining about customer
service and hoping she reached
out today but we, you know. Have somebody called from new york
and from out-of-town and worried
their child and want to visit
fly out of friday and the we've
been able to work around and get special visits for families
members but generally those are
in our main-we only step in
when we can do some good and
make an extension that is part
of whole access that is cool
about our jobs we can slide in and out to help people."
2023-12-01,any further questions?
2023-12-01,"deputy winning okay. Thank

:  ."
2023-12-01,public comment.
2023-12-01,"persons for line item 2 line
up and as a reminder you'll have
up to 2 minutes for public comment."
2023-12-01,it appears no public comment.
2023-12-01,calling line item three
2023-12-01,"3. Department of police accountability presentation
:   (Informational). Erick baltazar, chief investigator for dpa. Will talk about how investigations are handled."
2023-12-01,sir.
2023-12-01,thank you for being here.
2023-12-01,"all right. Good morning
PRESIDENT Soo and members of the
board and public I'm erick baltazar, chief investigator for
dpa. To provide an eve of how we conduct investigations."
2023-12-01,"a little bit about myself
I've been with the city and county of san francisco for
twrgd years and investigator
with the chiefs office and I
then got a job with the police
of albeit conducting police
misconduct and then a senior
investigator for 8 years and the
now the chief of investigations
for 10 years responsible for management of the investigations
team. So throughout any career
with the dpa and servicing 7
thousand cases in addition he
responded to and or supervised
shootings in the last years."
2023-12-01,"a little bit of history
about dpa. Dpa was with the
office citizen complaint in 1992
called the office of citizen
complaints and became our
operation that charter as
amended in 2003 expanding
commissioners from 5 to 7."
2023-12-01,"and also gave the department of police accountability
director the power to-which
I'll talk about in a little bit."
2023-12-01,"there was an amendment to
the charter in 2016 that
mandated us to investigate all
ois and prior to that if a contemplate is filed after the
amendment was passed in 2016
they were requiring us to immediately look at officer-involved shooting and it
also gave his us the authority to investigate-"
2023-12-01,so what is our mission?
2023-12-01,"dpa mission it looking at
cases against sworn members of police department and look at
the police practices.
Investigator when we get a
complaint we are open monday
through friday and located at
one south van ness and have an investigator assigned for the
day including a back up anyone
that comes to our office monday
through friday can file a
complaint also online on the
website and file a complaint and
also mail their complaint and
we'll reach out to the complaint
and get their statement. Lastly
complaint anyone that wants to file a complaint against a
police department can go to the
a district and they're farther
to our office."
2023-12-01,"ordering a copy of incident report and body cameras so we
get information and part of this is required to provide us with
the majority of information we
have own an incident and send a
request to the department and
they're required to comply
except for sensitive materials."
2023-12-01,"once we get the information
about the incident we'll
interview witnesses if any and
then we'll question the officer
this gives the officer the opportunity to respond to the
allegations and after we question the officer we'll make
our finding those finding will
be sent to the complainants and
officers addressing each of the allegations."
2023-12-01,"claimant compromise we'll
get one complaint and involves
two officers or al impacts against each officer."
2023-12-01,depending on that happens.
2023-12-01,"and again, as stated those
al al irrigations will be
addressed and the officer is
invited four california gives if
they fail to turn on body
cameras we have anything related
to a behavior anyone yelling at
the complaint and the officer
using profanity we'll bring that outline u we'll bring the
allegations and the officer
address all the allegations."
2023-12-01,"so we have two ways of
getting information or having officers respond to the ocala
gas stations one send out a
member respond o response form a sit down of questions sent to the officers and owes officers
are required to answer and the
officer the subject officer that
officer MAY seek advice from a
union rep or attorney."
2023-12-01,"we can also bring the
officer in most cases that
involve use of force obese those
are mandatory so bring the
officer into an interview and
this officer is entitled but they did officers are required
to look at the investigations
our finding if we find
misconduct that the officer
violated the policy we will
close that case with improper
conduct if we determine the
officer conduct was proper but
unfounded with the allegations in your insufficient evidence
not enough evidence to prove or disproof what happened and
supervisor failure and officer
failure. Other finding just
withdrawals claimants decides to
withdraw they call the office. Information only if the
complaint is not ground in
reality not grounded in reality
rental units sometimes we get
complaints regarding department
of emergency or the department of emergency management and sometimes I didn't think so parking control officers we
don't have jurisdiction so we'll
refer that on and we have a
program I'll touch own in a little bit."
2023-12-01,"really quick our review
process 4 teams of
investigators. Sfrifrd by a
senior investigator when a investigator concludes his or her investigations the investigator will prop finding
as to the allegations against is
officers those will be reviewed
by a senior investigator and
reviewed by the attorney and
myself the chief investigator.
We have pretty intense review
process we want to make sure we get it right."
2023-12-01,"so if we find if-enough
evidence the officer violated
the general order or misconduct,
we will prepare what we call a sustain report and forward to
the internal affairs the chief
with endorse discipline up to 10
days-in dpa believes that is greater than 10 days the department dangerous the
authority that was given to dpa
will give the dpa authority to
file charges and within 10 today's days. (Rustling of papers.)"
2023-12-01,"double discipline written
reprimand a quick note the the
department didn't have the tort
to look at felon investigation
but those incidences wherever to
internal affairs for a criminal investigation and other
non-discipline counseling and
training."
2023-12-01,"I mentioned our remediation
program we can send it it
mitigation for mediation I
highly encourage the board to
visit the mediation director ali can talk about the program and the mitigation program is a
perfect opportunity for the
officer and complaint to have an
open discussion about what
happened in a neutral setting
fascinated by a medicine for they can get together and talk
about what happened and this is
just an lastly no one OCTOBER 2020 OCTOBER 2020 the dpa has a better use for data collection
and a report that audit was
nationally by the association in
2021 we urge you to read that
report it a detailed report
about the departments data
collection and reporting."
2023-12-01,"and that report.
Regarding dpa and I'll be happy to answer any questions you MAY
have thank you. I want to
remind the members I sent some
information to look at the
association of audit for local
government and that is a link
available to the public also as
well as the citation by the
california department of justice
I want to note pretty imperative
not a backlog of policy accountability agencies with
taking a backlog and not able to
get their cases with no discipline or failed an
investigation thank you for the
theory report and open up for questions, board member nguyen."
2023-12-01,"can you give an example of
the and witnesses and a problem
when the and witness officer
turns into a person that is questioned."
2023-12-01,"the officers are not under
the government code not entitled
to representation but mandated
and not-in instance in a and
witness officer that can be
brought up on some charges for
failing to coordinate with the
investigation so they must coordinate not entitled to
representation and in the middle
the interview that the witness
officer what about a subject
officer we'll conclude and
notice the officer to be a maybe
officer that officer will have
an opportunity for a presentation that happens if
from time to time rarely that
happens to one of the sheriff's the officer what about named
we'll name the officer and give
the officer a right to
representation and swear that in
after the investigation."
2023-12-01,thank you
2023-12-01,you're welcome.
2023-12-01,board member wechter.
2023-12-01,"no, thank you I was on the
operation of 19 three three I'm familiar with that thank you for the presentation."
2023-12-01,and served on the police commission.
2023-12-01,"and I want to say for the
accolades dpa has-I was a lion's to dpa so the amount of meetings and the investigation
and is meetings we have with the
legal folks and it is a lot and
complex. Before you just want to again, just to share one I've
been part of the work and see
the work that dpa has been doing
with the good work and looking forward to continuing to move
forward but I prefer it very,
very, very familiar with all of that."
2023-12-01,"and board member afuhaamango
and yes. I have a few
questions. I know you mentioned
the interview how the inmates will issue and complaint and as
far as I understand one is an
option submitting that online
and other one is mail and the third being a phone."
2023-12-01,"we can do it by phone and
anyone can go to any station to file and complaint those
complaints are forwarded."
2023-12-01,got it.
2023-12-01,"and honestly new to I'm like
10 years old but when the comply
issues a complaint how I guess I'm trying to understand the
process how they're able to issue a complaint without
republic concussions down the line."
2023-12-01,"up to the complaint what the
kwlant has criminal charges pending we advise them to check
with their attorney and our
records are confident unless subpoena
penned by the court and take a
robbeded statement and go from there."
2023-12-01,"maybe that is a question for
marshall I know in his quarterly
report the types of reports 88
percent were misconduct filed under misconduct 12 percent
marijuana more operational
questions. I think I wanted to
ask if you're team or the dpa
tracks like how those numbers
are on a quarterly basis."
2023-12-01,"in terms of numbers of misconduct we have an annual report that breakdown that and
the finding so we do have-do
an analysis of the trend and so
encourage the board to look at the annual last year's annual
report on the website and track
those changes and yeah they're
all in there."
2023-12-01,thank you.
2023-12-01,you're welcome.
2023-12-01,"so I wanted to thank you and
I think down the road with
trends the number of work hours
for a particular deputy um, and
any kind of misconduct complaint, you know. Shift
changes as well the job is very informative and no further
questions I'm going to let you go."
2023-12-01,thank you.
2023-12-01,"colleagues, I want to say
those presentations are meant to
educate us as well as the public
and expect the inspector general
to follow up and get acclimated to the resources available but
this is just so we know what
we're trying to follow in the
next meeting hope to have the
under sheriff I know chief has been working hard on the
scheduling and under sheriff is wearing three or four hats trying to get the budget in
order and helping as a financial
officer and under sheriff so the
next phase we'll ask her what happens once the investigation
is completed and lands on her
deck and how she parcels out the complaints and how she proceeds
with that and I think I will go
offline and make a request to be
kind and ask for remediation
after the presentation will work well."
2023-12-01,"so is there any public
comment on this presentation by
the erick baltazar, chief investigator for dpa."
2023-12-01,"anyone like to make a
comment please line up."
2023-12-01,appears no public comment.
2023-12-01,thank you next item on the agendas.
2023-12-01,"4. Quarterly report
:  ."
2023-12-01,"review and discuss the
somebody needs to do something evaluation outreach for sf charter 4.137."
2023-12-01,"colleagues where we left off
was that I believe that board
member brookter I made a
suggestion to augment that and I
apologize. I think when I set
the highlight this is a dark
circle sort of mask the text
that is added in the additional
um, addition was also the police
and fire map that vice PRESIDENT
Carrion attended at the
invitation of chief carter."
2023-12-01,"I have an edited version I
sent to dan and the members I
have hard copies for the members and for dan and janna and copies
for the public if I can pass that down."
2023-12-01,"so I think we sl should have
an opportunity to consider that urgent."
2023-12-01,"it is actually-if not
massive changes we can go on one
copy we'll safe trees and have a
robust conversation."
2023-12-01,"see the changes in the track
changes
:  ."
2023-12-01,"which one are we racking to
an under the sdob I deleted
something on page 2 I felt was
opinion rather than fact that
the report should be strictly factual."
2023-12-01,there's a copy for you.
2023-12-01,"well, I need a copy also. I
gave my copy to you."
2023-12-01,(Laughter.)
2023-12-01,any discussion? On this tim.
2023-12-01,"so I guess I introduce a
notice copy we-left off with board member brookter asked
where the community outreach
part the jail to be included."
2023-12-01,"and since last meeting member board member afuhaamango
said she thought the attachment
where the notes can be formatted
we can produce the new version
in for mat he of the was more appropriate."
2023-12-01,I think I'll let board member afuhaamango speak for herself.
2023-12-01,"for the rest of the board
I'm not ready to move forward it
was more the flow I was trying
to convey would be different for
me to digest. I did-I think board member wechter mentioned
that misconduct is not within
our scope of work so my suggestions to removal that
altogether and julie mentioned
that borad member palmer didn't
have a second to approve this
might need to-make sure he sees it."
2023-12-01,"actually he saw a version
with everything that is courage
in it and additional text owe
removed at MS. Clarks opinion
and I don't know how sentences
she of the would not be
appropriate in a public document."
2023-12-01,"I'm not going to haggle with
hearsay but vice mayor wunderlich didn't have an
opportunity to look at they was present at the last meeting a
conversation that I had in-person with him."
2023-12-01,"dan would you be able to pull up what we're looking at so
members of the public can look
at that that one at the for for putting that information
starting in the report and document that definitely needs
to be under I'll okay with the
portion that um, board member
wechter is putting before us I
want to strike out and have an attachment to the report I think going back to the last meeting
owe see it on the agenda, you know. We talked about able to have reports infrastructure
members. So I think this should
look like a member goes to the
chief and under chief don't have
to belabor us sending in our
report to the board since we're
on a time I I'm okay with that
strike out the summary and I
think up for discussion and
maybe PRESIDENT Soo we deleted
the last sentence on page two
this information advanced work
was crucial and you're directed from the departments by the
budget of three percent get our thoughts."
2023-12-01,"I put that in there I
believe that is a factual
statement we're trying to save
money and the is being is coming
in with his hands tied I think
that is crucial to mention that
so try to ask for that to it is
important we recognize dpa and hoping the board of supervisors will have recognized our effort
to try a safe money but we still
need to operate."
2023-12-01,"yeah. I disagree that was crucial I expressed concerns
with some of the things that dpa
has done. But I think will
protect the oig into an
expensive database the oig might
not be is office convenient for that is members of the public for people and individuals in
jail. So I feel that is your
opinion didn't reflective on my
opinion but needs to be factual."
2023-12-01,"I don't want a back and
forth dpa has done a good job
and example pa will make a
decision and no office or data
the report provided to us who
that sales force came up with
the complaint system for dpa
with minimal changes and helped
to make it available important
sheriff complaint and their made
without going to scratch and
saving us money and it is not
costing additional money to have
-saves time for the inspector
general so I don't want to
haggle on those particular
points. I will entertain to
motion from board member brookter."
2023-12-01,is that in the memo.
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,we can do the dpa separately.
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,"so I think-I want to
maybe get help with the words PRESIDENT Soo it is similar in
terms of what they're proposing under the community outreach
under what board member wechter
proposed I don't know if a combination."
2023-12-01,"I'm not sure if I'm sorry
this color came out at the start
but I had written board member
brookter and let me put on my-"
2023-12-01,"borad member palmer and
board member wechter visited the JULY county jail and board member
wechter is proposing board
member wechter and borad member
palmer visited jail number 3, in
san bruno and received input are
the san francisco police
department jail conditions and
period and summary and included
attached to this report my
recommendation to take that last
out but some sort of combination
between what we have in front of
us here and board member wechter."
2023-12-01,"I used three rephrasing
comes from the charter language
says input read into the record
s d and that's what I quoted
here for this purchase as stated in the clearly one of our
required duties. I'd like to see
that language in there and not
support a motion to-that
would not have this summary
attachment there is a precedence
will be headquarter reports on
community meetings we attached
the minutes I'm supporting the sheriff and board of supervisors
to see what input that language
was in a charter we solicited
that from the individuals
impaired and I agree with you jason but agendized and the
agenda is attached those minutes
are very accurate again members
just be able do go out and
induct our own conversation with
the opportunities and should be
more for listed in terms of
should be more of a memo goes to
the sheriff as we do enough work
and figuring out was that looks like."
2023-12-01,I respectfully disagree.
2023-12-01,"yeah. I would ask especially, since borad member
palmer is not here would feel
more comfortable if we had more
of a formalized process I like
it is summonized in the
outreach. And I'll add that san francisco step forward, sir
operation report to the jail conditions."
2023-12-01,augments in the color.
2023-12-01,so the input.
2023-12-01,summon.
2023-12-01,yes.
2023-12-01,yeah.
2023-12-01,when I visit the jail on SEPTEMBER 16th.
2023-12-01,yes.
2023-12-01,"and when you questioned the
inmates about the jail
:  ."
2023-12-01,"yes. Deferred to william to
do most of talking and did the notes.
:  ."
2023-12-01,yes.
2023-12-01,okay.
2023-12-01,and I was surmised.
2023-12-01,with the sf jail conditions.
2023-12-01,"just to make sure I understand what your recommendation sends it to the
chief and maybe more of an
internal memory owe to help prioritization."
2023-12-01,correct.
2023-12-01,"so we actually have motion
based on the quarterly report
and made by board member
brookter asking for the friendly
amendments to conclude the jail conditions."
2023-12-01,we're going to augment that.
2023-12-01,"this it motion will not
include attaching the note to
the visit to the-; is that correct?"
2023-12-01,"that's correct and
respectfully appreciate the support."
2023-12-01,fair enough.

withdrawing any kind of changes you want the remainder of the
report was still on the quarterly report."
2023-12-01,"no. No, I'm not."
2023-12-01,"oh, so if board member
brookter you want to make a
motion to conclude the comments for our budget."
2023-12-01,"the motion is I recommend to
keep the language as is and not
to have the language deleted from the report."
2023-12-01,"so I understand (Rustling of papers.)
We have dpa so if you compare
the highlights and then pip under other?"
2023-12-01,"look at the second paragraph

I have so many piece of paper
and colors on the the chair operations."
2023-12-01,"that was the motion we if

sentence. Board member wechter
asked that last sentence to be-
and board member brookter make a
motion to approve as is."
2023-12-01,"and approving this language

that because the gentleman said
borad member palmer I'll feel
more comfortable talking to
after the information we receive
were actuate we could have a
different person he could and I
saw that with more information
and didn't express any concerns."
2023-12-01,"you I understand I'll feel

order kind of a honk postage."
2023-12-01,"yeah. So can I add a presentation in the public

be made and made pubically
through communications from the sheriff's office."
2023-12-01,"as well as-we don't have
a communication right now I'll
ask board member afuhaamango to
step in as a community person
and she's well-versed in
information through particular
communities and envision and
community of outreach I prefer
that come from this board so I
see a conflict for the sheriff's
department making that announcement."
2023-12-01,"I'll be work together with
them but the communication
person through the sheriff I
expect the sheriff will be there. As well so-"
2023-12-01,"maybe we can work with the
existence person to the board of
supervisors with walton's office
to carry the legislation and
I'll be invited as well as the
mayor I can do it. For
legislators so I'm well-versed
but make sure that um, dpa was
present and so that's why I'll coordinating and making sure the dates are available-

parts but can what he take a
moment to digest and come back

the oig and prioritize."
2023-12-01,"when is the oig and we

consideration for any of you."
2023-12-01,"you I don't personally mind

oig only because we kind of know
a little bit more than the oig

great to get our top priorities down."

2023-11-03,thank you. Next item.
2023-11-03,"line item 2, report from dpa on sheriff's investigation. Report on recent sheriff office investigation for the third quarter by the department of police accountability. Diswill be limited to determining whether the calendar any issues raised for future board meetings. MR. Kind."
2023-11-03,"thank you. Good afternoon board members and PRESIDENT Soo, vice PRESIDENT Carrion. I'm here to represent the department police accountability by way of background, department of
police accountability provides
administrative investigative service for sheriff
investigation for the purpose
of investigating misconduct.
Prepared a brief presentation
to go over stats and trends to
keep this board informed about
the current state of the
investigations. Displayed on the screen right
now is just a very brief third
quarter snapshot indicating for
the month of JUNE-sorry, JULY, september and AUGUST of this
year, we opened 12 new cases. That involves 28 new allegations.
We closed 11 cases.
We had two improper conduct findings.
In other words, we made recommendations for sustained
findings on two investigations
and the source of most of our investigations are based in
county jails 2 and 3.
This next slide represents
quarters 1, 2 and 3 providing a
comparison from 2021, 2022 and 2023.
We had already gone over data
from 2021 and 2022 at the last presentation. What's this slide demonstrates
is the current trends at least in not deriving anything necessarily from these numbers, because they are relatively
small numbers and numbers fluctuate. We are high compared to last two years.
Opens 31 cases to date in 2021
or 31 cases in third quarter
2021, 19 cases in 2022, and 35 cases in 2023.
Also seeing a significant increase in the number of cases
that we are closing in the first three quarters.
In 2021, we closed 8 cases.
2022, 11, and 2023 22.
That is experience and experitous with the investigators and also getting more investigators trained to
be ready to handle any upswing
in the number of cases that we receive and number of investigations we need to conduct. One notable trend this year or
not large enough to say it is trend, but one notable change
in the data is we added three death investigations this year
and the largest number of death
investigations we've opened in one year.
It MAY not seem like a large
number, but as you imagine
death investigations are most
in depth involving the most
amount of resources."
2023-11-03,"would you prefer we hold off
questions to the end or do you want us to interrupt you?"
2023-11-03,we are here to serve the board so at your preference.
2023-11-03,"okay, then I have a question.
12 cases were opened, 11 cases closed.
Are those 11 cases of the same
12 cases or are the level 11 cases from other quarters and
if they were from other cases
how old were the cases that were actually closed of the 11?"
2023-11-03,"most of the cases were closed from previous-actually,
some of them overlap, but some
of them were from 2022.
I don't think there was cases older then 2022.
All were closed within the 278
days and don't believe any of
the cases closed had been told under statute of limitations so all of them have been closed within the 270 days. Some of them, much shorter I
think because we have been getting records much faster with the sheriff office, and we
have been able to conduct interviews sooner, and hopeful
that with more training, more
experience and more in-house expertise developing with sheriff case, we'll be more efficient with these type of investigations."
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,"this next pie chart simply represents that we are still
getting the majority of our new
cases as referrals from the sheriff office, meaning that most of the complaints are lodged with the sheriff office
and then forwarded to the dpa for investigation.
Our hope is that with greater
attention paid to the fact we
built an online portal and little more encouragement we
can get more folks to use the
online portal.
Of course we would not close
down any of the different
avenues we created for opening complaint because we want to be able to have it as accessible to the public as possible, but
there are a lot of benefits I think filing complaint through the online portal provides, namely, it will get the fastest service as well as provide us
with the most accurate data."
2023-11-03,"I have a question about phone complaints.
If someone calls from the jail after hours, how does dpa follow up on that?"
2023-11-03,"so, the message would be forwarded to intake
investigator and intake investigator would then start a investigation into that and
reach out to the inmate."
2023-11-03,"also for the referrals, are
all the referrals from the sheriff office?"
2023-11-03,"yes, I believe all of these represented in the third quarter for referrals from the sheriff office. Weal will sometimes get referrals from other agencies,
but think it is relatively rare.
This next pie chart simply
demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of our allegations received and you'll remember from the appendix in
the last presentation, the
categories of misconduct are
the broadest so that tends to
be in every statistical snapshot we looked at
misconduct tends to be the
largest or broadest category of
allegations we receive. Similar to what we presented
from the 2021, 2022 data, the demographics of complainants
continues to be primarily black
or african males, age 20-40.
That will be the demographic
that we would obviously focus services for."
2023-11-03,"excuse me, regarding the allegations by type, do you break down allegations more specifically then just general misconduct?"
2023-11-03,"yes, there is a lot of allegations subtypes.
For example, use of force or
unnecessary use of force is misconduct subtype."
2023-11-03,could that be reported to us with the break-down?
2023-11-03,"yes, as we had reported in the previous report, we broke
down by all the subtypes of allegations and something we
prepare for the annual report
and we would be prepared to
present to this board a full
2023 statistical report some
time hopefully in FEBRUARY or MARCH.
This last slide simply
represents where our new cases originated.
As I mentioned from the snapshot the majority are
county jail and county jail 2 and 3.
One case from the san francisco general hospital. The allegations from those
three cases are fairly eveningly distributed, meaning that the case from san francisco general hospital
involved more subject of
investigations and yielded more
new allegations and we had two
sustained allegation from a incident at the hall of justice."
2023-11-03,"is it possible to give a
breakdown of locations more specifically then by jail but
pod number and also by time so
would identify which shift?"
2023-11-03,"that data is all available
in our database, so I'll make a
note and we could easily
identify with more specificity. I know secretary leung
distributed to the board the
article the jail was opening a
annex to offer more jail space
due to the increase in the
inmate population so imagine that we will get potentially
more areas where there are complaints."
2023-11-03,"just to note, chief cline,
when I think of disclosing very
specific information about like
the pod not just the jail and
the time, I assume of course
that is only after an
investigation is concluded, because anything pending investigation will be problematic and different privacy issues. Correct?"
2023-11-03,yes.
2023-11-03,"that is something in your analysis you will be looking at
to seeing also if it is appropriate to be -- to report on those things given the status and posture of the investigation and case?"
2023-11-03,"thank you for raising that point. All our presentations we run
through the len of confidentiality. If there are [Indiscernible] From a particular investigation
that are so unique that it
would reveal information that remains confidential under that statute, we would of course filter that out."
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,"dpa -- has on the website case
summary reports which are anonmizeed summaries of the allegations of the summaries for all complaints against san francisco police department. Could you create something
similar for the complaints against sheriff department personnel?"
2023-11-03,"we are posting what you are
referring to is 293 summary or
what we are calling just a ammoninized summary of what
some of the allegations are, and that'scurrently posted
monthly in the monthly report.
If you simply filter out sfso versus sfpd cases in that
section where there is short paragraph about each case you
find the summary posted online right now."
2023-11-03,"I think of what called the complaint summary report, which listed each allegation. It was anonmizeed, didn't have
names or locations, and it
summarized the evidence. You still post those on the website on a monthly basis?"
2023-11-03,yes. Yeah.
2023-11-03,that's what I'm talking about. Can you produce those if the sheriff department?
2023-11-03,"yeah, all that data is
readily available for us to assemble and any presentation for the board.
I'll make a notation of what this board requested if there are additional pieces of information or other
statistical data you like us to report on, certainly just
filter it through secretary
leung and we'll prepare that hopefully for a annual report
for this board some time in
early part of next year."
2023-11-03,"posting to the website for
the public would be helpful for transparency."
2023-11-03,certainly.
2023-11-03,"what is also helpful probably is the staffing
members and the population numbers.
I am looking and know there has been-I won't say dramatic increase, but a increase with what is happening in the tenderloin with the police officers and other law enforcement agencies."
2023-11-03,staffing numbers for the sheriff office?
2023-11-03,"yeah. Particularly where the
complaints are happening and
then I suspect with the annex
and growing population there MAY be other issues."
2023-11-03,"we can make that request of
the sheriff office, and the
daily population I think is posted and updated every day on the sheriff website as well."
2023-11-03,I don't think it is separated by jail.
2023-11-03,that's correct. We can see if we can get that data from the sheriff office as well.
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,"this board has a lot on their plate.
Anything else that I can assist with?"
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,we appreciate your thoroughness. Thank you.
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,"next agenda item, please."
2023-11-03,"yes MADAM PRESIDENT. Line item 3. Public comment on closed session.

2023-11-03,public comment

2023-11-03,"just quickly.
The guy from the department of
police accountability come from?
Or do they become part of this department?
Who pays them?
Are they elected or [Indiscernible] Otherwise, you have to make sure that the
information you get from these department is not only
[Indiscernible] Follows the process of integrity.
It is so important today, otherwise we are --- going on and on on things that are not
reliable in the end and don't
work in our best interest all
together because no matter the
activity we are having, we are
[Indiscernible] That was my only remark."
2023-11-03,"thank you.
Now call item. Public comment on closed session.
Public comment on all malters
pertaining to item below closed session. If you like to comment on
closed session line up against the far wall and approach the
podium when free."
2023-11-03,"quickly.
I said this last time so timely, just [Indiscernible]
The concept of closed session
raises questions all the time,
because why is it closed session?
Everybody must feel it. The problem is most people dont care anymore. That's it the problem. But we should care. Closed session means what are you talking about that the
public shouldn't know
immediately? [Indiscernible] Thank you."
2023-11-03,"thank you. Calling item 4, closed session

2023-11-03,is there a second?
2023-11-03,second.

Call line item 6, quarterly report.
Discussion and possible action
item.
Review and discuss s derks ob evilyuation outreach and third quarter report due to sheriff and board of supervisors
pursuant to sf chapter 4.137."
2023-11-03,"I like to in addition to community outreach to include the community outreach member palmer and I did at the san francisco county jail to
receive input from individuals incarcerated in city county and
I like the notes that we took
of the input we received to be attached as addendum to the report just as the minutes of the public comment at come
community meetings we held with previous reports. I can share those here."
2023-11-03,"I have a question, because  -- I think there is difference betweening a community member that is in the opinion and
someone that is actually incarcerated.
I don't think that we want to put anyone who is incarcerated in a position that anyone with identify who they were and who
the comments were coming from. So, I think that to me is
something that comes to mind
is, to protect the confidential
because we want [Indiscernible] Without concern of retaliation
so that is a issue I like to address."
2023-11-03,"yes, MRS. Clark reviewed these and she her suggestion removed certain things she thought might be too specific, but she felt everything in here is quite general.
It is not specific to any
individual, and would not in
any way identify anyone, but
the charter does mandate that we solicit input from persons
incarcerated in the city and county under mandate for community outreach so I think
what we did is a form of
community outreach."
2023-11-03,"my concern isn't the second part.
I agree with the second part completely. Thank you for going. It would have been best if other people would have been aware when you were going to so other board members like myself
who asked to go would have been
included in that. i think that there was a general consensus we wanted to move forward.
I know myself I said specifically several times I
wanted to be part of that
process, so it is unfortunate there wasn'tcordination.
My concern isn't the public being able to identify, it is
the fact sheriff deputies saw
you come in, go to a particular
jail house and you visited certain pods. They probably saw you going to particular places and talking
to folks and I think that's the concern.
It is not publishing to general comment.
I think it is important that the deputies especially if we
have deputies that MAY be the ones the concerns were raised
about, and word of mouth spills
very easily from the custodians
to all kinds of folks.
I want to make sure that the
folks we are soliciting input
from are safe and I don't want
any deputies that MAY be
accused of misconduct to use
this process in any way to potentially retaliate from
somebody who is incarcerated. Someone incarcerated.
So, that is just the realty.
You went to certain things at certain times where certain people were housed.
It isn't hard for people to figure out.
That being said, I haven't had
a opportunity to review the notes.
I don't necessarily have a disagreement with generalized
statements as a whole.
But if -- see, I would be-my concerns are real."
2023-11-03,"if I can respond to your concerns.
As someone who is formally
incarcerated and have retaliation by correctional
officers in prison and deputies
in jail, when you come forth and you voluntarily give your
name, you are already know you
received the brunt of retaliation. They came into these spaces knowing that they were willing
to put themselves in harms way, not to say that they are in harms way, I don't want to accuse any deputy that would do
further harm to anyone, but
myself, I was ready to take on harm that comes my way because
the importance of oppression and brutality in the jail system means someone has to
make a sacrifice and that sacrifice will come from people
who received the most oppression and have the heart and courage to stand up.
First of all, I want to commend those men who came forth and
was willing to give their name and information in order to stop the brutality and
oppression happening inside our jail system and let it be known, it is happening.
Second, we took their names off
out of respect for them
individually, however, to your
concern about them being hurt,
we make sure I took every
precaution that we went to a
number of pods, not just one, so that there were enough
people coming into a private situation, we closed the door,
we spoke in confudentality and
for the most part they were protected. Their voice was protected and
we make sure that we took great
care of documenting their exact allegations.
Jason did a amazing job in doing that.
I did most of the facilitating of the talk knowing what to say
and what to do.
We do plan to make another trip
there and you are definitely invited and encouraged to come
see for yourself the
heart-wrenching testimony of
men behind bars with no voice
and no apparatus for the most part to get their complaints out.
It changed me.
I am fighting back emotions
from just remembering that day.
I received trauma from having
to experience what those men
talked to us about and I'm one
who experienced such conditions.
It has taken every discipline
in my body not to step outside
of the bounds of my position on
this board to use my voice at
kpoo every tuesday between 12
and 4, and newspapers that I write for.
Organizations that I move with.
We just had a meeting with the
sheriff department and it took
every restraint I had not to
violate my position on this board and any other position
that I hold.
But these men gave us is why we
are electing our we appointing
and hiring an ig.
Their voice, their concerns,
their outcry has gone unheard
when it comes to abuse.
Their diet is one we wouldn't
feed our dogs.
Their clothing are causing them
to become sick. Physical rashes they showed us.
I can go on. it is very important that the
hiring of this ig and the investigation of what's going
on inside these jails be made public and that their voices are heard by any and everyone
who gives a damn."
2023-11-03,"I thank you commissioner palmer for opening yourself
like that, and being vulnerable
and really connecting in a meaningful way, and placing
yourself in that situation
where you experienced trauma and possibly relived your own trauma.
I think that it really demonstrates how important it
is and how valuable you are to this board and the perspective
you bring to the table and I
know that those individuals felt more comfortable because
they were talking to you, and because you have been there and
walked those steps and I cannot
imagine or even contemplate
imagining what that experience
MAY be.
I-my goal is not and I want to make this very clear just because there is interpretation, my goal is not
to silence those voices.
My goal is to protect them so
other people feel more comfortable also expressing their voice. I looked in my e-mail and couldn't have missed I didn't
see the notes or what not.
I'm very much aware of retaliation and harassment, and
the impact of what it is to be the loan person who stands out
and fights for justice.
And fights against injustice.
I do not in any want to silence
the voices, I want to insure because I haven't seen the notes.
I haven't seen the notes. I don't know the details of it. I dont know if it was the days are on there.
I dont know if the pods are there.
I dont know if that specificity of information I would be as a
past prosecutor of police and
sheriff in the city and county
would potentially put a victim, right because that's what they
are, they are victims of police
misconduct and police abuse at
any risk. So -- I'm sure city attorney clark has done a great job
reviewing them and what not, so
I just want-I think that it is
important to just be thoughtful
and insure that that is being
done to protect those voices so
hopefully we can by our process
empower others to feel comfortable to know they are
going to be as much as possible
protected and given the
opportunity so maybe next time we have another-so the next
time we have more visits, maybe
more people will talk to you. Many more people will be able
to be frank because we are
going to demonstrate to our incarcerated population that we are here for them when they are
victimized by the people who's
responsibility is to do the right thing."
2023-11-03,"the notes are right here if you want them.
I could not send the [Indiscernible]"
2023-11-03,okay.
2023-11-03,did not approve until yesterday.
2023-11-03,"I will intervene because I
received an urgent e-mail and I responded to member palmer
right away, and I said, the
immediate course of action
should have them file complaints directly, and I
didn't get any follow-up and frankly uncomfortable publishing this now because not
only do I see possible retaliation possibly from
sheriff to inmate, but between
inmates, and I want to remind
everyone, we are a quasi-judicial board here, so any kind of things that come before us we have to make a decision. I don't want to taint any investigation.
That is quhi why I thought it
was best to have the complaints
directed to dpa, and we also had discussion about how inmates go about that and assignments of tablets.
I was concerned about even
having information where people could be identified, and I don't dispute it is a urgent matter.
I didn't get any further response.
The other part I'm really concerned about is, this should have been a entire board kind
of meeting and we could have
gone in and I want discussion
with the city attorney, but the
entire board should go there as closed session and observe and take testimony because it
shouldn't be just one or two
people going so we are all there so that the people
effected by the justice system have confidence the entire
board is watching for their
wellbeing and the conditions.
So, that's a really big concern of mine."
2023-11-03,"I have a question for
commissioner palmer if that's okay. Commissioner palmer, I just received this for the first time now.
It is about a page and 3 quarters of notes.
I haven't been able because we just literally passed around a piece of paper and didn't realize this is what we were talking about. Were you the person who drafted
this or was this commissioner
wechter, and do you think-what are your thoughts?
I would want your perspective.
If you read this, would you be-understanding my concerns I
think that I articulated.
I don't have a issue with
identifying direct concerns. Like expressed concerns.
These are very specific things. I wonder if there is ways
though to do that without mentioning-I dont know if we need to make this public
because it is considered. I hope not.
When it was happened --"
2023-11-03,it wasn't agendized.
2023-11-03,it wasn't agendized.
2023-11-03,"can I interject. I think what you are talking about is whether to include this as part of the quarterly
report is my understanding. Is that not what you are discussing now?"
2023-11-03,yep.
2023-11-03,"in general, the content of
it I agree and understood that
would be at another meeting."
2023-11-03,I see.
2023-11-03,"this is the first time hearing about the proposal included in the quarterly
report which I don't think is necessarily a problem, but i just want to be clear, that is
what you are discussing, because I agree, in general the content of the jail visit and how you address that in the future, whether you have another site visit, all that I
think should be on another-should be agendized to
have the fuller discussion but now is whether this should be attached to the quarterly report. This should be part of the quarterly report."
2023-11-03,"it is even having that
particular visit was that a full board sanctioned outreach?
The other things we had have been publicly noticed and it
has been open to every board member."
2023-11-03,"right, butthalities that's not on the agenda."
2023-11-03,"no, but we are talking what to include in the quarter report.
All that community outreach
were things publicly announced and ownen to the entire board. This particular issue was not
open to the entire board and
wasn't per se a board sanctioned community outreach."
2023-11-03,"I have to say that it was
open to the board to go. Jason made it very clear what he wanted to do here in the meeting.
I said yes, I would go.
The vp said she would go, and
we made it under the three
panel that we have done for
other projects, so this wasn't not -- this wasn't like it wasn't disclosed. We said what we were going to do and anyone was welcome to step up.
As far as the dpa is concerned, of course, we can let them know what we found, but after talking to you I wanted to make
sure this was a discussion we all had as a panel of what we
say and go to them, because again, I didn't want to step
out of bounds as a board member. However, when we went in it wasn't a question of what are
your complaints, what are
your-what is going on here.
We were not asking them to say anything other then the question was, what would you
like to see the sheriff office improve on and what not.
What would you like to see the inspector general? They are no idea what any of
that was about. They gave a rats you know what about that.
What they wanted to say was, what is going on and what is hidden.
I work with the san francisco jail justice coalition under our great leader ann retiring
and taking time away. Shout out to her dedication.
We fought to get those tablets
in there so there could be a 602 process which is an appeal
process that will be able to be immediate, that will
documentation when it happened, time stamped and would be a
record that couldn't be thrown
in the trash can and all we
heard the 602 on papers were thrown in the trash. It was given to the person
complaining about and it did go
somewhere it was thrown in the trash. Dpa should know about this.
The reason it is not because the people inside the jail is making sure it doesn't.
we want to make that very clear."
2023-11-03,"my question is, how come
that information isn't on the notes? If that's the first thing they
came and said, how come it
isn't in the notes? Commissioner palmer, I really
want your leadership in this, because and thank you because you are being a leader and have
been a leader on this.
I are want to go about this thoughtfully and carefully in the right way and I think there
are perspectives I have as
trying in my interest of
producting victims that are just like immediately come to mind, how can we insure these victims are protected and but at the same time that their
voices are heard in this process.
I think it is challenging
balance to score, but I believe
that it is our responsibility
to do the work to get to that balancing. I never like getting things
handed to me and saying, hey, let's agree to this now.
I would have been helpful to get this in advance.
Life happens, I understand
that, so if feels a little-"
2023-11-03,"[Indiscernible] Remember this was the last meeting.
Right before the last meeting I
was approached and I said, I am uncomfortable having openingly discussed because I don't know
what is in it and don't want to reveal identities, but give meings additional information. Between right before the last
meeting and this meeting, I
didn't receive anything, so my only question and my only
response at the time was, can
you make sure it gets directly
people know to get directly to dpa now and you have the information so you could as proxy and don't know if you did it or not. I am hoping you on behalf of the people who trusted you to
be able to advance their
complaints to dpa so it has been immediately addressed and
then part of it also is to know
whether or not these particular
issues are being investigated, because if it hasn't been investigated then we know they
never received the complaints that should have been advanced.
But if they are investigating
it, this adds more.
This also I guess if you will, closes any gaps in terms of the
investigation and the whole process."
2023-11-03,"can I say something because I want to make sure I understand. The issue is maybe we should
have a more formalized process
of how we outreach with the inmates, or --"
2023-11-03,"my issue is, because their
names are not on here so dont understand the retaliation piece of it.
Second, I do agree with palmer. They are coming to them and telling them information
willing to go on the record for it, but you guys made the
decision to remove their names."
2023-11-03,"I guess, but is that true? I don't know that.
Did you ask them if we could publicize what they are saying?"
2023-11-03,"yeah, I asked them. We asked them and they gave us their name and made sure he wrote it down correctly."
2023-11-03,okay.
2023-11-03,"second piece I want to say
is that, what jason is saying part of our charter of the board we have that right to talk with inmates and I want the open line. Yes, we have a existing process
with dpa, but that process is
clearly broken because that was
there before the fight club scandal.
So, again, it is just further prove like, hey, you can go to dpa and also come to us, but I
understand what you mean about you are saying about we might
be doing double work. What they are complaining about is already handled by dpa."
2023-11-03,"it is not even double work,
but also making sure there is
con confidentiality and record keeping. If there are not complaints on record that is evidence that it isn't getting through.
If it is currently being
investigated how long has the process been going on and why has it taken x amount of time
to address it. Obviously it wasn't addressed.
I say a document like this doesn't really help to resolve
the issues and it is too
detailed for a quarterly report."
2023-11-03,got it.
2023-11-03,"what do you think about commissioner palmer, if we were
to not go into details, but address the issues? Like if we could address these
are the general issues and-because the quarterly report to me is what's the purpose of it? The quarterly report is to inform the board of supervisors, the mayor and more importantly the community of
what is it we are doing. So, we want to make sure they know, we have gone out of our
way and yes, we can work on making the process better for
all board members. We are learning and we are
learning and I give credit to that. Everyone makes mistakes,
believe me, I know, and we can do better the next time. That is fine.
For the purpose if our purpose
is to highlight the issues that
these folks talked to you
about, then I would recommend-I don't know if the time table,
if there would be a-I like the idea of the issues.
If we had one sentence of a
issue for each one, I think that makes sense. That kind of incorporates all
those things without the detail, but because I think that's kind of what we have in
the minutes for the comments
for the community.
Community members some spoke a
lot longer, but their statements were synthesizeed.
I assume there is already a
synthesis of information to hopefully incapsulate all that, right? And some of them don't even
have the detail.
So, if the purpose is to
identify the issues and
recognize that by identifying
the issues we inform the public who MAY have -- unless they have
a loved one or have experienced
themselves, would have no idea of this. How else can we use this
information in a meaningful way?"
2023-11-03,yeah.
2023-11-03,"because I don't think-I don't want to make it seem and
I think this is what we should never do is, throw away good work. You did great work going in there and thank you to both to doing it. I would have wanted to be there as well, but that's okay,
because I will next time and that's okay.
So, for the purposes of this quarterly report, I think I
want to be able to say those voices, we already have it on our agenda. The more I think through because thinking through as we
talk about it, we already have the agenda of where you guys
were going and the date, right?
So, that's already public knowledge."
2023-11-03,was it on the agenda?
2023-11-03,"was it on the agenda?
It wasn't on the agenda."
2023-11-03,"it discussed.
This is the suggestion that I
have -- is that, for the next
meeting, we could synthesize.
Remember when I asked about priorities and I didn't receive
from you member palmer, but I assuming that it was about community and especially conditions, so I talked about even having health and we
didn't get the director of jail health, but I think what would
be more helpful and easier to
address and more generalized is
if we have health conditions and then underneath bullet
points of things that you found
and observed and then, we have --"
2023-11-03,[Indiscernible]
2023-11-03,"health and medical. but under that also goes to food conditions, because that
was brought up a long time ago
and then the lack of access to fresh air and sunlight and then
I think there was a report that required more outdoor exercise not held.
We have it in different
categories, and then
communications, grievance process.
Not existing and so if we just
have topical categories and some more specifics so still general and bullet points, I think that would be something that could be addressed more
readily and then we can have
reports at our meet ings.
I don't want have to presentations people come and talk and doesn't lead to something.
That is why I try to be ord rly
and have a calendar year worth of benchmarks and hopefully next month we will see a ig. I expect we will have town halls and community meetings
with the ig and I also want to
be there as a entire board at the jails.
I think it is very important we
all be present so that at least
there is a perception there is unity and we care and we want to address these issues.
When it becomes piece-male and we have discussions, if we are there and observing and
listening, then it is a
concerted effort and I think it
is more expedient and things could be addressed in a more reasonable fashion."
2023-11-03,"I make a motion that these notes be attached to the
quarterly report as an addendum
so that will be transparency and we can do all the things
you want to do later on, but I
think it is important that the sheriff and board of supervisors and public hear
what we heard, and this has been stripped down quite a bit
to remove any identifying information. None involves a specific complaint. I did tell the people we met with, if you have a specific complaint, here's the phone
number for dpa, 415-241-7711."
2023-11-03,"yes, you did."
2023-11-03,more comfortable for-
2023-11-03,I made a motion.
2023-11-03,"let's have discussion on it, please."
2023-11-03,"very interesting. First and foremost and want to
thank you for going inside and having the conversations. That is what I want to lead with. As colleagues, which we all are, there are times where there are events that do take places where everybody isn't going to be notified t. Is the
nature of what it is we do. We have schedules and families and jobs so I'm okay with that. I think what I'm hearing and what needs to happen is it
needs to be something more formal. Maybe even a suggestion on our agenda that there is a section for members to be able to report out on things you might have done on your own in terms of discussions with the sheriff
department, or with other colleagues as well.
I am completely okay and comfortable with the document itself.
I think what I'm hearing and
would be comfortable with is if we say that moving forward I do think this sort of information should be in our quarterly report, but I think we would need the time to work through exactly what that looks like so
all folks and all parties feel comfortable. Again, I want to lead with,
thank you and I do agree, jason, this information does need to be out there.
I just think we need to figure out exactly what it looks like
and where it goes within our quarterly report."
2023-11-03,quick correction. Second person I did thank them as well.
2023-11-03,"for sure, but I want to be the first to lead with it."
2023-11-03,that is very true.
2023-11-03,"I want to say, that visit was the most meaningful time I
have spent on this board.
Walking into those rooms,
shaking each hands of each of
those men asking their name, telling them my name and letting them know we are here
to listen to you and I probably
said a couple dozen words and did most of the talking and I took notes.
But it was a very meaningful experience for me to hear those stories. I think it is very important.
I want to continue doing it and
I think what we heard needs to be out there and that's why I want this attached to the
quarterly report and certainly
going forward we can talk about doing this collaboratively and more people going out there,
but if we are reporting on outreach activities we did in the past quarter, this was one
of those outreach activities.
Just as the night out activity was."
2023-11-03,"MAY I make a suggestion?
My suggestion is -- I do believe
we should take up the date.
It has been discussed, but I
think that we should take off the date.
Just a little bit more.
Maybe I'm being a little more
precautious, but I had to be
because I had witness, victims that were incarcerated all a sudden turn and say they are no longer going to testify.
I had to stop investigations because we [Indiscernible]
Because the victim who is an
incarcerated person won't move forward.
I understand what the goal is.
I understand what we are trying to do.
I think we can go about it next time in a better fashion, but
we can go forward and based on
what I'm hearing and I think
the good faith I would support
this being attached as is as a collaborative effort to
recognize that we are working
together to move this board into getting these voices being heard in the best way.
I would request that just a
date be exclude d."
2023-11-03,okay. Good idea. Thank you.
2023-11-03,"my suggestion and just
because I would have liked time to digest this a little bit more, but in terms of attaching this as a report, I just think
I get a little lost about like,
maybe if we could optimize it to be-to prioritize the issues a bit. I don't know -- I personally dont
want to publish this because I
think if we can refor mat it that would be my suggestion. Yeah, that's it."
2023-11-03,"I like how you formatted and
presented things when I ask ed for things informally. I don't know if this is the document that is best to address things.
I agree with-there are all high priorities.
I like to see it more where the sheriff can take action
immediately and this I don't know if people will parse
through it and then I also
think I would rather see a memo
we put out by the board
formally to the sheriff office."
2023-11-03,"I agree.
I want to say that I support
sheriff me miyamoto.
He is one of the best sheriff we have had.
He is fighting a extreme uphill battle in transforming the
culture of the deputies inside the jail.
I go into the jails myself as a
artist to beautify the space so children visiting their parents don't have to visit them in a
space that is so sterile and incarceral and have that type
of effect on them. There are other people who work with the sheriff inside the
sheriff office that have a lot of respect for.
A lot of times their hands are
tied because they are working
outside of their visual, their every day experience. Sheriff miyamoto does not work
a 8 hour shift inside a pod.
He doesn't know what's going on
continuously inside a pod, and
some of the assistant sheriff and under-sheriffs so my goal and sure jason's goal is to work with this board to do the
best that we can for those people inside that are forced
to live under these conditions and whatever that looks like,
because we say we are all learning, we are -- I'm new here
in this experience in this
level of agency, so everybody on the board I respect. All the opinions that were stated, and how best we move forward is good.
Let's do it as a team."
2023-11-03,how would you suggest it be reformatted?
2023-11-03,well-
2023-11-03,"I don't think it has to be
on the spot to suggest how it is reformatted. Just for consistency. I do think it should be added
just because of the date we do
have, but should look similar to the section we have under community outreach.
That is what we called it. It should share within this document that is going to the
board of supervisors that we
did go inside and visited the jail.
And then I think what should happen moving forward are these
notes and this sort of specificity to me should come
in a report from the individuals that went so that
we can move on some of these
things that are in here. If we can as a body. If that makes sense. Saying it should be addressed in the report, I don't think in
this level of specificity as an addendum it needs to go with it.
If you read here under community outreach it takes
about the members invited to national night out. Chinatown and engaged the community. I think a similar sentence that
go tuesday goes to the board of supervisors. Suffice for quarterly report, and we should have member reports that come out from us that are a lot more specific like the document we have here,
so we can discuss format and
what can we take away from what it was that was shared."
2023-11-03,"I think that limit transparency. I think the reason these men
talked to us is they want these issues known.
They want them out and-"
2023-11-03,"I think when we share public, everything is public record. This is all-"
2023-11-03,"right now this isn't.
Not unless we put it in-not unless we attach to the quarterly report.
That is why I wanted attached as addendum."
2023-11-03,what I'm suggesting is put on the agenda for the next meeting we have then it is public this document.
2023-11-03,"actually, can I just
interject for a second, because materials that whole board is
looking at on a item that is in closed session, it is something that the secretary will have to
post at the close of the
meeting, so it is -- going to be made public. Whether or not it is part of the quarterly report is a different issue."
2023-11-03,"that's why I was troubled that something was circulated
before a meeting and so --"
2023-11-03,"I don't want to be surprised
by other board members last minute before hand on a
document that will be really integral to our mission.
Just for the future. Let me finish please. Let me finish. I understand there is good intention here and I understand
we got really great ideas.
I apologize to bookter for my incorrect correction, because
like I said, we all make mistakes. But that brings up another issue.
This is why we have to be thoughtful about these because we have these procedures and
they are there for a reason.
I agree with brookter's approach, this is cat is out of the bag. Let's make a commitment to each other as board members to try
to think about what is our main goal. I know we are all here because we care about these issues.
We are not getting -- for some it
is time away is time lost in so
many different ways.
Financially, all these different things. So, I don't want to be surprised like this in the
future where it is like lets do this and do this because I want to be thoughtful of this and I
want you all to be my team
members and we are team members
whether we have strident and contentious disagreements and
thought processes and you don't need have to like me but I
demand you respect me and it
feels disrespectful to be bambuzzled with this and it puts my guard up because I go
into what are we doing, how to protect victims, how can we best do this and we are having
a lot of conversations in a way
that it doesn't have to be antagonistic and doesn't have to be that way.
I hope that this can be yet
another learning experience for our commission.
I really appreciate commissioner bookter's
suggestions and agree with it.
This is already -- now since it
is passed around, public record.
So it will be available and it
will be available now, so I think -- we dont need to attach it because it is available on the website."
2023-11-03,"let me explain again why it is -- I did not have any intention bringing this forth
until MRS. Clark approved it.
I had sent her a copy of this with additional information, she highlighted sections, she
thought I should remove, I removed them.
I sent the revised version and
it was only when I got her approval that I thought to bring it forward to the board
that I did so.
That was late yesterday."
2023-11-03,"I think you should have
advised me as the PRESIDENT And the vice PRESIDENT And we are also attorneys, so I think we
have good judgment legal judgment about what would be
proper and it was a whole month
in between and I never got any
response back after I first got
notice that it was -- things were urgent. Again, I dont want surprises.
I don't want to hear things in the newspaper that often times are inaccurate. We had one candidate who interviewed and said I read
this in the paper and it wasn't accurate. That's-again, it is a
disrespectful way to do things and undermines-not just confidence in our board,
confidence in the process and
you know, it is just inexcusable and you say you have so many years in investigation.
Now I wonder if you kept things confidential and done things by procedure. This is not a good way to do things and the information here is very useful. It could be presented in a better way, but if you had come
to any of us or brought it up
ahead of time, we could have discussed it. That is what I'm troubled by
and it also means that there might have been delays getting
these things addressed and I also want everyone who is effected by the justice system
to be able to come out and feel comfortable, but this is not
the way to make them feel comfortable."
2023-11-03,"if I can MADAM PRESIDENT there was a motion put on the table.
Just to kind of pull us back.
I guess the great thing being a democratic body there are safeguards of us being able to dething. There was a motion on the floor."
2023-11-03,"I do want to point out that discussion in the previous
quarterly reports you made a
motion PRESIDENT Soo to add
language we hadn't heard and
added and there were several paragraphs included in the
final vurz version that we didn't have a opportunity to vote on. This has been occasions when
things have been brought up at the meeting where the quarterly report was discussed where additional language was proposed."
2023-11-03,"you wereprint present at the time to present the report but didn't present early enough
to meet deadlines so I offered to do things. You were PRESIDENT For a entire year and didn't move things forward and tried to help you.
We are a entire body.
And you want to present your own personal agenda when we are supposed to work together and
so, if you are trying to make
any one person look bad you are
making the entire board work bad.
I let my work speak."
2023-11-03,"I think the personal attacks
over me over the last year made the board look bad. Most people who observe the meetings commented upon that.
They felt it is unprofessional. Oversight community has been
looking at this and has a very negative view oof the way this board behaved. I worked in the oversight committee a long time.
Well known and well respected and people hear your personal attacks and go, that's not true
because they know me."
2023-11-03,"you portray as a victim and you have been victimizing
everybody else on the board."
2023-11-03,"can take a 5 minute break maybe?
Just a suggestion."
2023-11-03,[Multiple speakers]
2023-11-03,"the board will be in recess
for 5 to 10 minutes.
[Recess]"
2023-11-03,"we are back in open session.
The time is 347 P.M."
2023-11-03,"I want to suggest we put
this over to the next meeting to discuss. Another opportunity to look at
this and think about it.
I thought it might be a
compromise to diffuse things."
2023-11-03,"just want to confirm it
deadline doesn't issue with it deadline, the reporting I want
to make sure we don't MISS Anything. The quarterly report is due what date again?
I just dont know that-not sure."
2023-11-03,I think there isn't anything in the charter that says a due date so dont think there is a due date.
2023-11-03,"alright. Just wanted to confirm that.
I have no problem with continuing this conversation
and hopefully it can be
conducted in a different way."
2023-11-03,"I'll make a motion to
continue this agenda itedm
item to the next meeting. I withdraw my earlier motion
and make a motion to continue
this agenda item 6, quarterly
report to our next meeting."
2023-11-03,I second.
2023-11-03,"for members of the public who like to make public comment
on line item 6, report quarterly report, please line
up at the far wall and approach
the podium when it is free."
2023-11-03,"long to wait, but fine. Interesting to listen to you.
I know it took you 45 minutes
before saying the word, goal.
So, the goal it seems to me it
is to improve the system which
has to be a mess in jail,
because if you look at what's
going on out of jail, it is a
mess, so the pgoal is improve. You should [Indiscernible] Generally speaking you must push the concept of
responsibility and critical thinking.
Remember something, when you
are-you have nothing to fear if
you know what you are doing is good. There is something important to
remember is the bad guys like
it when you speak honesty [Indiscernible] They respect
that very much.
It is not necessarily the best solution. You chicken out and nob mob when you have something to report. That is the way it works.
So, keep that in mind, please.
You can definitely improve the
system if you -- not that easy obviously, but remember, responsibility-don't be afraid
to speak the truth.
But again, you must make sure
first you did nothing wrong. [Indiscernible]"
2023-11-03,"thank you.
Do we need to take a vote?"

Member wechter, aye.
The motion passes. This line item will be

discussion and possible action."
2023-11-03,if I MAY.
2023-11-03,yes.
2023-11-03,"I was thinking for future agenda items, I like added to the agenda a section that talks about reports from members, because I also think it would be good given that you gave us instruction to provide what we
want to look at as members that we have that section to where
when we go to events or we have
something that we want to bring to the body we can do in that section.
It doesn't mean every month someone has to come with something. You MAY have nothing but it allows that section when things
are new that do come from city attorney or come s last minute we can at least be able to have discan cushion about it. Doesn't have to be a decision
made, but allows for members to give presentations on things they are doing within community
to the full board."
2023-11-03,"I am looking at the city
attorney right now."
2023-11-03,"I'll work with the secretary.
Ideally you would give the secretary a sense of what you are going to report on just so
members of the public have an idea-doesn't have to be a lot
of detail or final, but -- so, if I was understanding correctly
it is like reports from members. Ideally someone would let the secretary know ahead of time if they are planning to give a report so you can have the subject matter what you report
is on the agenda that would be
better. While I'm talking one thing mentioned to PRESIDENT Soo at the break probably important to tell everyone, I don't think
you can have a closed session
visit to the jail. There are only certain things that can happen in closed
session and I don't think this
falls under that, and you guys remember how you had to have the training and groups of
three so you didn't have a
quorum so you were not having a meeting.
But there is nothing to prevent
three people at a time or some number fewer then four going around the same time to
hopefully accomplish the same task."
2023-11-03,thank you.
2023-11-03,"future agenda item I love to discuss. I xoe we are all most at the finish line with ig.
Should we at some point chat about the priorities that we want?"
2023-11-03,"yes. That was -- so, I think I had
asked for priorities again and
we had discussed it before.
I was hoping we would have the under-sheriff make a report.
She is quite busy. Chief indicates she MAY come
next month or extend to JANUARY because she's definitely in the thick of budget and they are
trying to onboard a cfo, which
is crucial right now.
But, part of what I hope she
would report to is how they handle things internally once a
full investigation is completed from dpa.
Just in general terms, and how
she parses out particular
complaints and investigations
based on severity.
The other -- so, the top priority
is we community engagements and
then I had mentioned health.
We still did not calendar
somebody reporting on health in particular. The doctor in charge of jail
health and I think a lot of these issues hopefully will be
addressed and this was at the particular doctor who was on
leave for quite a while and so
that was an issue as well. I am not get nothing to reasons
why she was on leave, but it is still a major issue for us and
I think that will be ongoing
and then I think as we synthesize these particular issues members palmer and
wechter found out at their jail visit, looking at how we can
get those addressed and
remedied in the quickest fashion.
Then from member nguyen, he
would really like to look at
the working conditions of the
deputy-how to enhance officer safety and working with a strong partnership with other law enforcement agencies
addressing the mental health of the deputies.
So, those are some issues and
think that really-a year goes
by pretty quickly so why I like
to try to prioritize things. We discussed health so long.
I think the other priority we
talked about were services, so
reentry prior to reentry, a lot
of educational opportunities and the apprenticeship and job
training opportunities and then supportive services on reentry.
I think member palmer you would
be very instrumental in that
particular-those particular
portions."
2023-11-03,"I like to for future agenda
items find time if fot here in
city hall, special town hall or
san francisco jail justice coalition, they requested they would love to appear here and talk about the things they do
and find and work on for the
jail population, but two fridays have been very difficult for most of them, so
we could find a better opportunity for them to appear
before the board or in the community outreach program,
that would be great.
Second, this might seem kind of trivial at first or
superficial, I like for us to
take a board photo and to
create a culture for this board and legacy for the board, we
being the first to sit on this
board, and possibly design a
letterman jacket so we can wear
and create that unifying team
spirit that we should be having."
2023-11-03,make us new bracelets? [Laughter]
2023-11-03,that would be great too.
2023-11-03,"so, will you send the contact information on the
justice coalition to both me
and secretary -- that way if we
need to have a special session
or it could be coordinated with
maybe another community meeting.
And then I think another
priority was to recalendar the glide meeting."
2023-11-03,"actually commissioner palmer, didn't they say at this
point they needed some space? Glide? Because we rescheduled and they
put a lot of work and we kept
rescheduling and canceling, so
I think -- I think maybe we should work-reach out and say, what are your next event plans
that you have and how can we
come to you and your constituents, rather then doing all the work they have done for us.
I think we need to make-I feel
the need to make amends. If I MAY finish.
I would like to maybe possibly
reach out and see there is ways
that we can work within their
schedule if they are open to us
or if it even just testing the waters of is it too soon. That's all."
2023-11-03,"just answer that question, they did say any type of
engagement with us will have to
be next year. The next available --"
2023-11-03,"dan had communicated that to us.
But I think in the future because dan had expended a lot
of energy on trying to calendar meetings that it would be much
easier if we were invited to that meeting, so in particular, even town halls by the
different supervisors as well."
2023-11-03,"in addition to jail justice coalition I like to hear from representatives of public defender office because they
are the most frequent contact
with people in the jails about what they are hearing and the concerns they have.
I also since we now will have
an inspector general I like to
have presentations by experienced oversight
practitioner on best practices for establishing an investigative and model agency. What is going to be necessary
to make that agency succeed. The required training,
resources and staffing which
also the source of support for
when we seek budgeting for those items.
If we have recognized experts in the field saying this is necessary to make a office succeed.
I also like the presentation on anonmizeed information regarding lawsuits and
settlements against the sheriff
office and judgment for the
past 5 years. That resulted in significant
maybe over $25 thousand settlements and steps taken by
the sheriff office to address
any behavioral or conditions systemic behavioral conditions
that result in the settlements or adverse judgments and again that information can be anonmizeed."
2023-11-03,"as a past prosecutor that
worked on this, I have to say I would also appreciate that there is a lot of wealth of information in the da office that actually works with these victims, these particular victims, and deals with the
complexity and the challenges and investigating and
prosecutors this and I think I would agree with commissioner
wechter that the public defenders are very important in their perspective but think we
should also reach out to the
prosecutors that work with victims and families of doing
the investigation of police and sheriff misconduct as well as through the prosecution of them."
2023-11-03,"you mean victims and families of people incarcerated thin jail?
Jarks"
2023-11-03,"yeah.
they are the victims identified
and the potential defendants are peace officers, deputies."
2023-11-03,"maybe we can get anonmizeed information on the criminal referrals they made.
I think they have a separate
internal affairs that handles criminal investigations they refer to the district attorney office. I have no idea what the numbers of those are. I would hope they are very low,
but I just don't know."
2023-11-03,"not going to venture
anything mid-case."
2023-11-03,"they wouldn't-no one talk about mid-case if you are a prosecutor.
You aret noallowed to.
Even afterwards there is confidentality you are not allowed to."
2023-11-03,"since dpa only investigate certain classifications of complaints, typically the more serious ones I like regular reports from the sheriff
department on the number and type of complaints received in the last month or quarter. The number and type of grievances submitted by incarcerated individuals within
the last month or quarter,
including facility or location.
We can have a sense of where complaints are coming from and
what they are about.
I also like a revisiting to the statistics chief gave us about the sheriff office design to the special patrol operations in the tenderloin. I think that was a good presentation showing the statistics on the arrests,b the
number of people referred to drug treatment programs, and the number of people who entered those treatment programs.
I think it is very useful to be kept abreast of what's happening with those ongoing efforts and the tenderloin and
south of market."
2023-11-03,"I think last thing that I
hear some of that, maybe-we get
reports from the sheriff and I
mentioned this at nauseam prioritizing what we get from
the sheriff, but it MAY be helpful to identify key categories we say every time you report can you give us a update on this, because these are the things that are so central to the work we are
doing, so it doesn't become a situation that we have tons of
requests that might not be-that
are difficult to come through.
It goes back to -- I always go
back to the idea and even this
is very public right now of, the under-staffing of the sheriff. Maybe we can think about this
as a future agenda item of, as
a board, can we-we have identified the priorities that
we want them to focus on, but
for the reporting, if we want to-if it would be helpful and
maybe we can just ask the
sheriff too-is it going to be
helpful if we consistently ask for the same things so you don't have to reinvent the wheel of getting the
information and you can be more
expeditious or maybe we can work with the sheriff a little bit more about those reports."
2023-11-03,"if I MAY vice PRESIDENT Carrion, that's what-one of my favorite words is template. I tried to be very consistent
what I ask for and it has got to be germane to what we are doing.
I don't want reporting just to
have a report or someone speak.
Things we can utilize to see if
there are particular trends or improvements. The sheriff office is vastly different from the police department. I have seen the police department be able to push a
button and be able to pget a report. That is not the case and
already had a presentation from
it as you MAY recall from sh sheriff office.
Until we are there, I think if
we get maybe monthly or quarterly reports on categories of the complaints and how they are addressed.
I think it will be helpful when
I do get to meet with the under-sheriff. We were supposed to meet and been quite busy.
And then more I guess on a little of a scary note, she will retire soon as well, so
hopefully she will be able to
get the cfo up to speed and then her successor. She has a wealth of information and I want to make sure we get
at least a presentation from her for a overview and so that when we do ask for things that it is very direct and germane
to what we are doing and helps
to improve the sheriff office."
2023-11-03,"in speaking of the district attorney office, if they give a presentation I like information
on the number of arrests made by sheriff deputies on the special project in the tenderloin and soma that they
dismissed and the reasons for
the dismissalism I think they usually have categories like
lack of evidence or-you would
be more familiar with that vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
I think that would be useful to know."
2023-11-03,"the only issue-that is correct.
There are different codes you do like need future investigations in interest of
justice, there is about 20, 30
some on different codes for that. The only thing that I have to
say, I think that would be-my
interest in bringing the da was more a education kind of process.
We are looking at oversight and those issues, versus our role
and what we do is only-it is
not criminal, so it doesn't seem as specific to request
that data and I'm not sure because I know the disclosure
of that might be governed under
certain rules. I wouldn't tell a bunch of people, this case dismissed because of this reason.
There are certain protocols for
that, and I do also think while that is helpful information,
does it go to what we do as a board?
There is a difference to me
from the criminal process and the different administrative
process that we deal with now, because our inspector general is not going to be dealing with the criminal.
They go to the da and I think
it would be important for us to
build a partnership, but we MAY be over-stepping by going into
a realm that we are not charged
to look at by the charter. Doesn't mean we can't learn from that realm.
I think that's more of my
interest is learning best practice, because I learned so
much and I find that that experience is instrumental to what I think I can contribute here on this board."
2023-11-03,"the reason I ask for that is
because I recently attended the international association of chief of police conference in san diego.
There was a excellent
presentation there from a prosecutor who worked with the
police agency and found many of
the cases were having to be dismissed or were dismissed on
appeal because the bad search and seizures.
He talked about how he
addressed that by doing
intensive training with that
unit on constitutional law and that significantly improved the
outcomes in court.
It could go to are the deputies making these arrests, did they know enough about constitutional law or is there a area there that the sheriff
MAY want to look at and improve the training."
2023-11-03,"I don't see how that connects because you are asking for data. You are asking for specific
numbers of why it-the codes for
dismissal for specific cases. It isn't asking about the training.
We have all that information right now."
2023-11-03,"also add to scope of work is
not within-that is something
for the sheriff office to deal with."
2023-11-03,"if deputies are making
arrests that are not adhering to constitutional law that it is something we should be aware
of and that would be one way of gauging it. That is a recognized outcome
you can look at to see the
success of a oversight entity
is, are the law enforcement officers making an arrest or doing searches that are thrown
out by the courts because they
are done improperly."
2023-11-03,"that is not how it works, but -- interesting because that
is a search and seizure
argument that then is litigated
in a criminal proceeding. Right?
So, that information is not
something that would be the charging.
If there is a illegal search
and seizure, there needs to be evidence like possible cause for that,b which includes the warrant and if it is
warrantless, all those things.
It isn't as if you find a code that says unreasonable search and seizure.
You will see a lack-you will
not get that-it is not data
that can be easily pulled first
of all, and again, I-commissioner afuhaaman just also commented, it is outside our scope, so we have a lot of work to do.
We have a lot of work to do."
2023-11-03,"jail conditions, I think it is looking at working
conditions of the deputies, improving staffing.
And we got a budget to deal with. We don't have a budget we are
not going to do any of this."
2023-11-03,it does fall under patrol operations which is something we charter.
2023-11-03,"it does, but that part of
the patrolling is smaller so I
would think it is lower in priority and if you want to
address the jail conditions and
then also families effected by
the criminal justice ist systems and the visits are limited now because of staffing."
2023-11-03,"one interesting way to look at it rather then thinking
about criminal is how many misconduct complaints have been
done due to patrolling.
That is information we could
get from like dpa, how many
misconduct complaints have come from patrolling?
That I think would be more in
line with what we are charged to do."
2023-11-03,"that really won't reflect whether deputies are making
good arrests or searches. It is something a continuing
process and not something that
they do as a normal course of duty the way the police department does. They have traditionally very limited patrol duties. This is a new fairly new assignment for them."
2023-11-03,especially they trained.
2023-11-03,"right.
I want to know if they carry
out the training effectively by
making solid arrests or are some arrests dismissed by the da office because they see they
did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion.
That is what I'm curious finding out."
2023-11-03,"I believe we can get that information from the sheriff,
not the da office because they have to file the reports.
They would have record of that, not the da. Let's get the information from
where we can get it from and we
are operating to.
Me bringing in the da seeing a valuable partner we can learn from in different ways, just like we can learn from the
public defenders in many ways. I understand the concern.
I think I agree with looking into that issue to make sure
that the sheriffs are patrolling appropriately, I
don't think method of getting that information is by going through it da office. I think we can do that in a different way that is more aligned with how we are charged to do our work and what we are authorized to do our work,
which is to work with dpa and
to work with the sheriff.
They should have the-I can't imagine and we can ask, does the sheriff have the
information of how many cases their deputies submitted to the
da and not charged? Right?"
2023-11-03,"if they keep that information.
They MAY not."
2023-11-03,"that's a good question. Maybe they need to. We don't know.
That's all I'm saying. I'm not trying to [Indiscernible] The issue, because I think that is a valid
issue, especially since it is
new and a resident of the tenderloin I live in this environment and it is my home
and these are my neighbors, so I recognize the importance of it.
i just again want to go about it in the way that aligns with what we are charged with."
2023-11-03,"maybe someone listening to
this will make a public records request of the district
attorney and obtain the information."
2023-11-03,"so, member wechter, I will
try to refeign making public record request when sometimes a simple request works a lot
better and we want to demonstrate how it improves our work, but right now I dont
think going to the da office
for this data necessarily improves and helps us with what
we are doing."
2023-11-03,"I respectfully disagree, but
we can disagree, it's alright."
2023-11-03,any other future agenda items?
2023-11-03,"just as reminder, chief requested that when I give him items and if any items come up that at least there is a three
week turn around time so he knows which particular
personnel he needs to call on."
2023-11-03,"if no other discussion for
members of the public that like
to comment on item 7, please
line up against the far wall or
approach the podium when it is free. Calling line item 8, general public comment. The public is welcome to address the board up to 2 minutes on items that did not
pupeer appear on the agenda

jurisdiction of the board. Personnel nor board members are required to respond to
questions but MAY provide brief response. General public comment is items
that did not appear on the agenda.
If you like to comment line up against the wall and approach
the podium when it is free."
2023-11-03,"yes.
I just want to [Indiscernible] Something about bad guys.
I think it is important to understand there are bad good
guys and good bad guys.
It is very important. Guys who [Indiscernible] Bad
guys but pretend to be good guys.
I wish-I want to address something -- I'm amazed by the
way you wear your mask by a surgeon where the surgeon [Indiscernible] And you still
are able to talk.
Amazed by this. Honesty.
To the sheriff miyamoto, you
don't -- you have to make your team strong.
Please, you push the concept
through you-talking to the sheriff-push the concept of responsibility on critical thinking. You must do that.
Going to help a lot.
The future will be beautiful,
but we are the [Indiscernible] All comes from the wrong system
of education. [Indiscernible] Been going on for ages.
So it created in some people emotional disorder leading them
to delusion of [Indiscernible] People who want the control the
world, not knowing they can't. It is impossible. So, now the future will be
beautiful, but we have to deal
with this unintelligence. 20 seconds.
Something to help you here -- technology works against
us today because the way it is
now it has become our enemy, so just help you.
When you use your cell phone,
understand you are working for
the weaponization of
technology, not good idea. You are taking part. The future is against weaponization if we want beauty. Otherwise we are not able to achieve that.
It is a process, but -- just a idea for you to [Indiscernible] Thank you."

Good to see you again.
Always slotod friday before a 3 day weekend. I appreciate getting on before 4
P.M. I will not take 2-1/2 hours
I'm marshall I'm chief of staff
for police accountability and
concluding our (Agsz on the
statistics and providing the
progress report this board and
the new department.
Where we left off on this slide
where we are summarizing our
support for this board's effort.
What we have [Inaudible] Is a
link to your website that has
all our build out for the infrastructure of the new
departments our invoice, work
orders and information as timely
as we get temperature the office base construction is manage in
planning stages we are trying it
convert a space to include natural light and increase security with reenforcement on
the lookos the door to the office suite.
What I am happy to report is we completed the work on the work
station for that space.
We built in 8 work stations there are 36 square feet a piece.
They are designed all new furniture, with sit and stand desks.
It took time to configure this space.
You will see an odd shape.
Has a lot of features to that
pace like supports for the beams for the wall and electric monuments build in the floors that could not being moved.
We upon went through I dozen configurations and maximized the
space and it looks nice and
inviting we hope to -- add some windows to that pace so we have
natural light as well to make it
as hospitable a work space as possible."
2023-10-06,"that work order and pricing
is all accessible through the
link that is on the presentation slide now.
The case management system, we
will hopeful low be able to
deliver to the board a fully
functional and customizable case
management system that has been
designed for the sheriffs
investigation and disciplinary
work process.
Off the current system for sfpd word processes. As PRESIDENT You pointed out the last meeting we have been able
to achieve that at a savings for the budget.
Back in 2018, when the patriot venders built the sales force
system for the dpa, it was
around 400 thousand dollars to build this from scratch.
You will see from the work order
that is posted on the website,
we are -- hopeful low going to
achieve that 40 and 60 thousand
by back upon the existing architecture of the system as
well as leveraging the expertise
this in house staff had developed around the case
management system we have been
spending months doing use our
testing and -- and -- we are now in the migration phase for all
of the data and component in the case management system.
System will hopefully improve
upon the current system that dpa
uses we are now able to link the
case files to the case
management system by utilizing a free cloud based service the
city and county subskroib to.
No additional cost utilizing
cloud space on microsoft cloud that we the city already has a license to.
And we will be able to integrate case files in the case management system.
Hopeful low that will all be
something that we will provide a
deliverable by the end of the year.
Of course, we are continuing our core service on all investigations that we receive
from the public from the
sheriff's office and from other
government agencies. Presented on the 2022 stats and
the 2021 stats at the last meeting.
We will continue to provide all
payroll accounting and admin support for the board and until
the new sheriff's department of accountability office of
inspector general is stood up.
Want to acknowledge and thank the finance team and tech team
at dpa who have really doing double duty and your secretary
MR. Young who has had an outside
role in the budgeting process
that a board secretary would not have.
I mentioned the last meeting, we
have also started the beginning
of the year reporting on sheriff investigative stats on our
website and all of those reports
are available on the link that
is posted up here.
We are hopeful and it is -- my
belief reporting needs to
improve and evolve and I'm
hopeful at some point we'll be
able to move away from monthly
properties and get all of the
data into role time dash boards. Where this board and the public
will able to look at all of the
numbers updated hopeful low daily.
But for now, we -- are operating monthly reports that will
continue to be updated on this link.
I'm happy to also share with the
board onof our investigations
this year identified a training gap between with the
interactions of sheriff deputies
and the inmates that they super vise. They recognize third degree in our case reports.
That was submitted to her she
immediately ordered this --
training be developed to fill
this gapful many members of our
team attended the last core training and the behavioral
health raining put on by the sheriff's office.
The day and a half training we
thought was good that -- really
educated the audience about the different mental health issues
that inmates suffer. Plight
that -- that they are in to
hopefully develop a compassionate approach and providing them with many of the
tools to be able to identify
many of the signs of mental ill
ness and how to de- esque lit and
engage in the situations with minimal or no force.
We were pleased seat history's
office it -- integrated this new
train nothing their core
training.
Our staff submitted the budget
proposal for the oig.
As with many departments there
were budget cuts but important
low we survey and memory yellize
the critical needs to stand up an inspect department.
That's you will have that as an evaluation for some of the
things that the department would need.
Notablely, as I mentioned before, nothing was budget in
the for anybody to provide
clerical support front desk medicaling accident.
Budget analytics, budget officer.
Technical advisor and missing
there is no real estate budget in the budget. So.
for the time being, the dpa will
be able to house the o ip no
cost to the budget.
But in the future, if the desire
is to develop the as a completely separate office and
operate physical pace there will
be a need to create the real
estate budget. As well."
2023-10-06,"we as you are aware upon
launched an online portal.
To allow complaintants to
electronically submit complaints about both the members of the police department and the san francisco sheriff's office.
We are building a new portal specifically for the sheriff's office that will communicate
directly with the new case management system through application programming
interfaces so well is seamless connections. Through and through.
From the electronic complaints
through management the case
electronically throughout case management system.
We also had discussed with the
sheriff legal the idea of
putting a link or an app on the
tablets the inmates have in
custody to be able to lodge their complaints directly through the portal as well. Tell increase accessibility and
increase the speed in which we
receive the information and of
course, tell allow us to
tabulate the data more
accurately by creating data
points that need to be filled out rather than we receive forms
that have a lot of missing information. It also reduce the amount of
time from an inmate's mailing a
physical form to the dpa will be instant. We can't require everybody to ewize the electronic portal.
But hopeful low it am increase
the process and provide this board and the public more accurate information."
2023-10-06,"I have a question regarding online portal.
Is well going to be a self service kiosk where people can use the computer to up load if they don't have access to the
internet or not able to.
And the second question is, how
accessible is the portal of the phone.
A lot use their phone now to submit everything. Really."
2023-10-06,so how would this work
2023-10-06,"great question.
As I had mentioned in our
DECEMBER presentation, there is
a hope at some point, requires a
lot of funding and resource, a
hope that at some point we could
partner with the board to
strategicly place kiosks at locations for individual this is
minot have a phone or a computer.
To lodge complaints
electronically. And the link to the electronic portal can be accessed by phone, tablet or any device connect to
the internet t. Is accessible through a variety of different electronic ways."
2023-10-06,thank you.
2023-10-06,I have several questions. Diagram shoes work stations for 8 employees when is the total number of employees they will have?
2023-10-06,"it is hard at this point to
predict wha the budget will support.
But the oig by the statute or
the -- where are the other
employees other than those 8. ? Now going to be situated?"
2023-10-06,"now there is in the a budget to hire 8.
So I think it is adequate for
the time being but that is all
the additional space we will
able to spare without any cost.
At some point if the department
grows we will have to tackle
where or where to place the folks."
2023-10-06,would the inspector general [Inaudible] The work stations
2023-10-06,"that would be the discretion
of the ig we'll probably post
some additional space within the dta.
But if the ig wishes to sit with the investigators, the ordinance itself provides that there is
one investigator for every handled deputies.
We estimate that would be 6-7
investigators.
Um -- when do the statistics public low post on your website"
2023-10-06,starting JANUARY.
2023-10-06,when will the first 6 months of 23 be posted?
2023-10-06,"I think they are already
there if I recall, I think
JANUARY-july are posted we are working on financializing AUGUST
and assessment. But I think JANUARY through JULY are there."
2023-10-06,"on the location chart, it
lists on the graph.
Cj low and lists break down for
pods 2a, 4a, 4b and safety cell
does this indicate there were no complaints from pods other than those?"
2023-10-06,"are you referring to the
slides on the about to get to? Investigative locations."
2023-10-06,I'm always going to cover that. Okay.
2023-10-06,in an in a moment.
2023-10-06,currently the ig has 7? Positions? I'm sorry.
2023-10-06,"6 or 7 investigative
positions budgeted jot form well
from the statute of 1 of 100 and
there is somewhere between 6 and
700 deputies on staff now.
So between 6 and 7 if more
deputies on boarded and cross 8 huh human we valid 8"
2023-10-06,"what other positions if any
for the ig budgeted for current fiscal year?"
2023-10-06,"there is not much else budgeted for this current fiscal
year razz you are aware during
the budgeting process much the
budget the positions exists the
budget was cut based on attrition.
Is there a budget for administrative staff"
2023-10-06,"I don't think there is an and position this has been
established for an
administrative staff, that was one of the resource deficiencies
we pointed out in the budget proposal.
Once the ig is hired and set up
what will your be?"
2023-10-06,"to support as the ig MAY need.
Will you remain an employee?"
2023-10-06,"for the time being, yes."
2023-10-06,"do you expect to seek a
position at the oig"
2023-10-06,member. We are veering past when we need to focus on now.
2023-10-06,"I would prefer like you to answer the question, please.
Joy would ask, no, I think this
is going to personnel issues and
no one is entitled to this information.
second of all this, is beyond
the scope what the presentation is.
I don't see why MR. Kline here
is subjected this inappropriate line of questionying."
2023-10-06,"I think it is important for
us to focus now. Budget has been
cut because we were behind the 8
ballot budget I want to
acknowledge nicole armstrong and
MR. Klein for cobbling a budget together and having our secretary to present that.
We had enough cut specials we
are trying to preserve as much
budget we want.
The future I fwshgs to be successful. I'm grateful that we are already
have this layout of effort to make sure that some of the
transition is firly seamless. Because I expressed on the
public before I expect the
transification period to be a year. Some of the hiring investigator fist they silv service MAY take
a year to hire.
And reminding of the limits once
a complaint we can't suddenly
cut off this because there are
time limits to address the complaints I don't want anything to fall through the cracks. Investigation has to be completed within a year and our target is shorter than that."
2023-10-06,"I quickly wanted note that
all board members have this budget principle we have gone through it should then and there information I believe this happened during your presidency
in wechter you should have this information available to you"
2023-10-06,yes.
2023-10-06,"and hopeful low all the
efforts we have the work stations built. The case management system built.
Tell allow the ig to save a year
in getting the infrastructure up and run to be operational"
2023-10-06,if I can sexual harassment can we hold questions until he gets throughout presentation as well.
2023-10-06,thank you.
2023-10-06,thank you.
2023-10-06,"we also actively garthing and obtaining tools to assist with the investigations. We want to thank the sheriff's
office for providing us access
to the body camera footage
through the native platform.
Previously, and many jurisdictions operate with
simply media files that are shared with them.
Rather than the ability to
utilize the native platform that
was a concern excessed by the oversight department they got
evidence dom and makes a big
difference the to thes allow to
view the way they should be and
synchronize video frames to view all together rather then and there each one operately and
gives access to the audit trail
we know who has access to
increasing the security of the files."
2023-10-06,"and then lastly, in terms of the brief progress report for
the board we're in negotiating
areas for oversight.
We are in discussions now.
Update the letter of agreement
include other [Inaudible]
Involving deputies and under
bill 481, which started left
year, the sheriff's department have to create a military
equipment use policy.
And that has an inspect
oversight component. And we are
in the process of hopeful low final iegz the negotiationos that and will creating an
additional area that we will
provide investigate and I have
review services.
The next 4 slides we created
following the SEPTEMBER meeting
in response to the questions
from the board.
This slide represents the
demographics of deputies
investigate from the poof case
close in the 2022.
We are still pondering when --
value this informs us about.
But -- if there is take aways,
the most frequent age of deputy
in this pool is 30-39.
Asian deputies make up the
largest pool of race in the and 95% male.
Again thshg is something that
was or in the letter of
agreement we would report on and
was raised the last board
meeting we're evaluating what
value this has in informing the board and the public.
We also -- intentionally separated the demographics from the rank.
To be mindsful about confidentiality when we put too much identifying information
together, it creates issues with the confidentiality that we all
have to abide by.
So, come as no surprise the largest pool of rank is with the
deputies they have the highest
indebts of complaints and
highest incidents of sustained
allegations.
This next slide simple low represents the location the only
for the 2022 cases that were
closed following investigation.
The location where there is the
greatest frequency of reports
come from cj3.
And the pie chart breaks down
where within cj3 the most
complaints came from the intakes.
Area followed by the safety.
Again, these are just members for this board to decide what
value this offers.
It potentially with large are
numbers MAY give an indicator of
a potential hot spot these
numbers are too small to make
that extrapulation.
The last inquiry of of dpa was
what we thought was the best
idea that we have heard related
how to view or stats.
Vice PRESIDENT Carrion suggested
we look at the work shifts and
over time of to see whether or not there was correlation with
the frequency of complaints and
sustained allegations.
The theory being that long hours
special long shifts lead to
potential low exhaust union frustration and more complainted. We went become trying to develop
how to harvest this data I will
share this is a work in progress. This is far from enough
information to draw conconclusions.
The numbers we have now are too
mall to be significant of but I
think it is an important area to explore. We had a conversation with the internal affairs unit and
sheriff's legal and they agree
this is a worthy under taking.
Right now, you can see the
spread of -- where in a shift
from the beginning of the shift to somewhere mid shift to the
end of shift to over time.
we see just an up and down terms
of the complaints and sustained allegations. So.
Really don't have enough or
complete data to draw any interference here what other change in collect the data.
We want to thank internal
affairs for under taking a lot
of the heavy lifting in this project.
When we learn friday them the
work shifts are storeod paper in scylloed locations.
And hand written so we were
unable to extrapulate from it.
Completely going back to 2022 records.
To develop this full etch on the
right side of the slide is just
a sampling of how we upon tried to categorize the information.
What we want to do is delve
deeper in what were the shifts that deputy MAY have worked that
week or a few days preceding that.
We are -- changing our processes
as well to include that in our
interview scripts as well as our member response forms.
Over time we will garth more
data to either support that theory or not support it.
That is a work in progress and
thank this board for coming up with a good idea."
2023-10-06,"and that completes our presentation.
Open for questions.
I wanted note that one of the
things that I think is important
for the public the public is
this the sheriff has pledged 30
by 30 initiative, which is an
initiative in the united states and canada by other law enforcement official and
research exerts nonprofits that
by the end of 2030, 30% of the
police or sheriff law
enforcement recruiting class is 30%.
I want today let the public know.
There are steps made to
diversify our diverse staff pool. I want top make another comment
before we have questions in that
we are a quasi judicial body we don't
don't do the investigations
members if you have been on a visit and someone talks about a concern are complaint refer this
person to dpa we don't want to compromise identity personnel
issues that gotta go through a process.
And if we compromising that, we
don't have the complaint that is the core we want to investigate.
I want to make sure everyone beds that. We are quasi judicial body it is
important there are fire walls.
An upon independent complaint and don't jeopardize the identity of the complaintant and does in the want to be revealed in any way.
To the public, just so you know
we try to preserve privacy always unless someone is coming
public low on their own we don't release information. That extends to family and
friend who is want to file
complaintos behalf of a bhorn is
in the custody or otherwise affected by the criminal justice system"
2023-10-06,"thank you.
And the reason why I share the
informational lit are tour so
have you that and we can provide
additional copies for the board members when interacting with
anyone with a complaint that should provide clear instructions on how to file their complaint."
2023-10-06,do we have questions. MR. Palmer.
2023-10-06,"one question.
You talked about putting the
appeal process on [Inaudible] Those that are in custody.
How are you going coensure
[Inaudible] Are functioning the app is functioning and that the
thez are in custody have access to the [Inaudible]."
2023-10-06,"that's going to be work in
progress project with the
sheriff's office. Sheriff on his MARCH third presentation to the board indicated desire to put the
tablets in the hands of every inmate in the jail.
So, if that tablet makes its way
and available to everyone in
jill we hope that will increase
accessibility to make the online complaints.
We will not be ail to provice
PRESIDENT Technical support to
the hardware the sheriff's office provides."
2023-10-06,"miami current tablets are not
in hands of every person in custody. And even when they are in the
hands of those in custody, the
let is disabled so they can't
use it now.
What is the office going to do
to make sure to guarantee w what inspections and audits.
What the sheriff MAY say MAY not translate what the deputies
allow to happen in those jails. How will you know that the
people in custody have access to
that appom that tablet to make
sure they have grievances go
directly to the office?"
2023-10-06,"I think that might be a great
solution MAY be survey of
individuals in jail or -- upon
I'm audit has specific
requirement and it is a very
heavy under taking to conduct an
audit usually performed by controller's office we have one
in house auditor and he is busy already with sfpd audits. I'm not sure we will have that capacity but that is one of the reasons why we suggest today is
important to have a data analyst
on the staff with the sheriff's
department account act.
The year's of experience is that
information you garth and include.
The information regards to drafk
system not information we have access.
We went to the sheriff's office
and they were good enough to
garth that to present it to the
fwhoord is based on your question from the left meet nothing terms of the information we would have direct acstoesz,
it is the information contained in our investigative case files and information that shared from
the sheriff's office this is one we MAY have to request specific
low if it is information this is
value to the board.
We had a list by deaf appointment we could determine how much years of service they had"
2023-10-06,"with the sfpd we are
operating under the charter.
Which forwards to dpa information required provide to
the dpa.
Which gives different access to
information than where we are
operate nothing our letter of
agreement."
2023-10-06,"and then I want to say i
think moving forward thank you for this.
An ig coming in has to r. Up and
handle the complaints so I think
we talked about this in the past focusing on priority and
whatever reports and presentations. So. We will get this later on but I
would like the members to
forward their 5 top priorities
to dan and remember to do that. We talked about this in the
exclusive really it is moving
forward to have a real time complaint process.
When we talked about is
roadwaying to get the ip system
for sheriff's office to pool report and not all on paper. And also that any present
anticipations we doment from the sheriff's office directly should
be requested through dan and me
and we go through chief ju to be able to pull the correct people
and make sure there are proper personnel.
When I don't want to happen is
we cannot intrefr with daily prescriptions of the sheriff's
office we have to be mindful of
requests and the availability."
2023-10-06,thank you.
2023-10-06,"thank you.
Have a nice weekend. Any public comment on this report and"
2023-10-06,"for members of public when
would like to comment for item 7
if you are present lineup. Otherwise call the number and
use the access code on your
screen.
I'm not sure I understands the
goal of dps what they are trying it achieve.
Because also that -- they prove
that it is imperative or prove
it is reliable?
Who is controlled the -- because
the system is so messed up.
Upon who control who? Who pulse the strings. We near trouble here. We have to understand the goal
of this exactly.
I don't get t. Did not mention a goal.
Talk about money. What is the end goal?
To improve the system or to just
stay as it it is kind of with [Inaudible].
We have [Inaudible] You have to understand.
We have to raise our
consciousness so otherwise
that's it.
Sorry about that.
That's my -- absolute beyond
belief."
2023-10-06,"thank you. There are no perking callers.
Before we move to the next item
can we take a 5 minute biobreak"
2023-10-06,sure.
2023-10-06,"we will be on a break for about 5 minutes.
Line item 8.
San francisco charter section 4.137 discussion on and terrible
changes to the sf charter 4.137.
As keep have seen the language
of the charter constrained us
with candidates we are past the MARCH -- ballot date. You know with a charter amendment that went through the voters we to bring it back if we
want changes.
I actually was in discussion
with both our assigned city
attorney and her supervisor.
We are talking about define when
we meant by law enforcement and inspector general or personal
not working for an agency or a
labor organization reporting law
enforcement we narrowed this
down to get more candidates and
made sense and the other part
what do we call ourselves.
I will let blue angels.
Over here. So.
We had issues with the mayor's office.
We are referred to a sheriff's
department of ash counsel at in
the budget I say follow the
money we are constrained back with the charter.
I go through language and even nuance.
I think the way we are named now
and we are no longer sheriff
department when the sheriff took
office he wanted to distinguish
himself elect today is the sheriff's office.
Other part is do we want to
mirror the d. Police account at it denote to the public it is
separate but named now it sounds
like we are an arm on the
sheriff to get more minutiae
about warding if police sound
plural and sheriff is the one individual. My investigation the department
of sheriff and personnel ash counselability.
Because we do review the entire
office and not just the sworn
officers that is manage I'm
throwing out and fwlad to have
council for the sheriff's office
to absorb and want top make sure
we have this discussion and
before you continue, the time
right for NOVEMBER if we get to the ballot office.
So I wanted have I robust discussion now.
You know that even with the
things we have done the mission
statement did take time.
I wanted nut out now and i
suspect we refind it more.
Then will need to go through the city attorney's office.
The other thing I noticed is
sometimes it was inconsistent
when using the acronym the article, the and sometimes not.
I would like to be consistent. So.
I have a question about the process, right?
We would have to kind of harsh through the changes proposed from the board in order to ghet on the NOVEMBER ballot? Correct. What would this electric like in terms of a sometime line and how
would it function.
Why I can once I
-- once we --
if we decide to move forward exit think it is crucial we do.
We would work with jana clark
and john and we would clarify
the language they would look for
a board of supervisors sponsor and we would get supervisors to
put it on the ballot t. Is a clean up than recreating
something but -- you know it is unfortunate sometime when is it
goes to the ballot and there are changes and any little change to
put a comma require it going back to the voters."
2023-10-06,it would be a technical bill.
2023-10-06,clean up bill.
2023-10-06,"yea. And also you know MAY be more
than just technical if we define
when we money by law enforcement agency.
I think when most voters voted
they think in liperson's term
its is police and sheriff.
And not federal office of inspector general or secret service.
In my position I'm not considered necessary low law enforcement but I do work with law enforcement.
We can see how jumbled the
definitions work of an attorneyor investigator would be."
2023-10-06,"okay that makes sense to me.
I request I don't think we need
a motion for this but I'm not
sure if this is necessary I
request you work with our city
attorney's office to be able to appropriate a draft to come back
to us to review and further
discussion. A motion.
I will make that motion."
2023-10-06,"I will second this. Discussion on this.
So -- I would like us to include line this is in the charter regarding the department of
police accountability.
Which bars any member from staff
from been a uniformed mfbt
sheriff's office or employee or labor organization representing law enforcement employees.
I would like to see revision to
the training requirement the intention when written when
barbara and I looked at it was for nacole.
The public defender's office and borrow association to play an active role in training.
I would like to see something
saying, 180 days assuming office
each board member receive 20 hours of training on constitutional policing.
Civil yen oversight practices and prince pels.
Law enforcement and sheriff's office policies and procedures.
The ig and the sheriff shall
work together to develop the
curriculum arbitrating based on
guide lines recommended by the
association civilian oversight
the bar association of san francisco and the san francisco
public defender's office training by the appropriate
experts determined by content.
That was recommended by an
oversight expert I reached out to several to see the suggestions that was written 3 years ago the field advanced since then.
Other offices established.
Another suggestion we board
limited to 2 suggestive terms
feeling 8 year system sufficient and you typeset get now people on board and commissions like this rather than the same people
on for a lengthy period."
2023-10-06,so. My suggestions.
2023-10-06,"why don't we do this those I think this is grit you have suggestions for the language but that is a lot of information I
don't know if I could have taken that down.
MAY be every board member
provide submit them to dan your
suggestions so that way those are being taken in consideration
when woo working on this draft to them present."
2023-10-06,"yes.
When I will do as what I have with other document in thes past
do word smithing and submit raw
comments as is to jana clark. We will work together and have
her make presentation as we evolve in terms of language.
So as all of you recall, it took
a long time to get the training
we were slated have 80 hours of training.
We got 20 in a compressed time.
And a year and a half ago."
2023-10-06,"but also takes personnel and budget.
this is another issue, too."
2023-10-06,"what would be the time line
that everyone so we all have
like a time line to give to you
comments or give to them.
So this way everyone has an
opportunity to you know prepare contributions for consideration?"
2023-10-06,"6 weeks and this is
OCTOBER -- so hopefully DECEMBER
I can ask jana to have a presentation and we have ample time.
I don't have a calendar in front
of mow when we need to get we
are now it was MARCH. And NOVEMBER.
Would it be safe to say end of next meeting?
2 weeks before and 2 weeks to give comments."
2023-10-06,"I was looking at the calendar to get manage on the MARCH
ballot the deadline was in assessment.
It is a sick month r. Up time.
And at the same time we can
reach out to -- supervisors or
ask jana.
Lauren, do you have any --  anything to add?"
2023-10-06,that sounds great.
2023-10-06,"all right.
2 weeks from now is -- OCTOBER 20. Would that be sufficient time
for board members I know we don't have 2 members men then if you can.
Joy was thinking later and
even -- into I'm traveling I was
going to say MAY be by thanks giving and 2 poke in NOVEMBER.
The earlier the better. But at the latest the second
week of NOVEMBER to get the
comments and then we will ask januarya to do a presentation in the DECEMBER meeting."
2023-10-06,great.
2023-10-06,"our next meeting is NOVEMBER third.
So why don't we say by NOVEMBER third? All right. Does this sound good to
everybody that gives enoughly
way so our commissioners were
not here today and gives you know commissioner wechter an
opportunity to memorialize his suggestions are."
2023-10-06,does this sound good?
2023-10-06,"yep.
Do we have public comment on
this before the vote?"
2023-10-06,"more members of the public
for item 8 if you are present lineup otherwise call the number
and use the access code on your
screen. No public comment. We'll take."
2023-10-06,let's go for the vote
2023-10-06,"on the notion to work with
the city attorney for a revised language. Member brookter. Why aye."
2023-10-06,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
2023-10-06,aye.
2023-10-06,member palmer.
2023-10-06,aye.
2023-10-06,PRESIDENT Soo.
2023-10-06,aye.
2023-10-06,member wechter.
2023-10-06,aye.
2023-10-06,"the motion passes.
Calling line item 9.
Nacoleth ethics remove previous
item from the tibl for a vote on
adopting the nacole national
associating for civilian law enforcement code.
I like to make a motion to remove this from the agenda."
2023-10-06,"I was starting to make a
motion that we remove this from the table."
2023-10-06,great.
2023-10-06,"great yoochlt let's if there
is no objection let's remove it."
2023-10-06,all right.
2023-10-06,"I med a motion to remove it
from the table to vote on it."
2023-10-06,"well, I'm sorry vice
PRESIDENT Carrion had aing motion already."
2023-10-06,my motion is to remove it from the agenda. Is there a second.
2023-10-06,why is that.
2023-10-06,I will second.
2023-10-06,I can make my motion I don't mead to explain it.
2023-10-06,well is a second.
2023-10-06,why you want to remove it from the table so we can't remove it.
2023-10-06,"I than we have discussed this item.
And ad nauseam.
It has been repeatedly on agendas.
We have discussed some of the
issues with the nacole potential low conflicts of interests on the board and discussed some of
the substantive problems with the incorrect information and
the writing of the nacole.
I am not appropriated nor do I
believe this continue waisting
time on I matter that has been addressed so many times we are
looking at the same document.
No improvements to the document.
We have I board member of
nacole, the actual ethics has
incorrect information about our department.
About who the signod to it.
No effort to correct that.
And it is in the full sentence.
I mean it is poorly written and as PRESIDENT Wechter you
mentioned 3 years it a long time ago this was written how long ago?
You indicated that the oversight
positions have drastically changed.
I don't think that at this point when is before us men if you can
go back to nacole and get a
better coved ethdices this would be great.
At this time I'm not interested in entertaining another
conversation that wasted time of
all of not only our personal
time and our professional time
but all of the city staff time.
This we have all the individuals
here that are taking time to discuss something this we have
discussed repeatedly. This is not does not make sense for us to keep wasting time.
Can we focus when we are charged on doing?"
2023-10-06,"we never had an opportunity
to vote yes or mow to adopt the
nacole code of ethics.
What is it did b this this is incorrect? Which of the elements of the
code of ethics do you object to.
The list of agencies adopt today
are not part of coved ethic this
is is morely a list of agencies
that nacole is aware have
adopted that is incorrect.
Over the last 3 years sincelet
MAY of 2020 nacole has spent thousands of hours consulting with communities around the
country that come to for advice
and expertise on stake over site.
They are separate the lives agency this is adopt side not
part of the code of ethics we
would vote morely on the code of
ethics itself not the list of
agencies that have adopted.
I believe you have been asking
our commission pay for nacole events? No."
2023-10-06,"I'm surprised have you not voltoryed do training since are an expert on this. I don't understand we would not
use our resources I answered
your questions."
2023-10-06,"I would happen to train for multiple boards and commissions
around the country through
nacole through the police commission in madison, wisconsin.
I would be happy to do this and
have an interactive exercise follow board will reserve the time I doll this free.
I med the board aware of training opportunity from nacole
and elsewhere and when dan was putting together a budget he
asked me about budgets for
nacole webinars I received no compensation for my service.
It is completely volunteer board.
I want the board to be aware of
any opportunity to expand or
understanding of the field of oversight and constitutional policing.
I will take in a different direction of so.
First I don't think the document is well written.
I my ethics are to the city of san francisco.
I'm all a member of the california bar.
So, I feel like those are my
ethical obligations we are not
members of nacole if there are
changes we don't have a say in the language.
I note most important low in the
2015 listing you have the san francisco office of citizen complaints no longer the office of citizen complaints. And I don't see that the department of police accountability has signod.
And I respect upon the w this is
coming out of the department of
police accountability and member
wechter you med youran mus
toward this department known.
It is here endous after all the
work they have begin and they
adhere to the code of the city and the state bar.
And they also received a number
of, wards and I wanted to recognize you never let us talk
about the award this was dpa
gotten been given and honors
that they cell news report desparaging our body and members individually. I want to gnaw on the record out there and if the public want to
when is going on, to tune in to
our meetings directly to look at
the actual proceedings rather than having something plant in
the questionable publication."
2023-10-06,"as I said before I think the
personal attacks are not useful.
They don't advance our mission.
You did make a specific
allegation I have distain for the department of police accountability.
Untrue I worked with the police accountability.
And work and have special as an investigator. He supervisors the unit that investigates complaints against the sheriff's department I
workmen of investigators I have
no qualm with the agency my
qualm is with pull henderson."
2023-10-06,"that was your interception I
never felt pressure from paul henderson or anybody."
2023-10-06,"[Members arguing] Called members of board.
You need to stay on the topic of the agenda."
2023-10-06,yea.
2023-10-06,"you made an allegation
against me and I'm explaining my feelings. Called me and said I don't think
you have time to search for an
inspector general. I thought that was inpresent and
object to the fact when his
agency hires noncivil service positions they don't follow the best practice."
2023-10-06,okay.
2023-10-06,"so we will call the city
attorney advice and cut off this discussion right now.
I think it inappropriate. And that's where one individual
interception of a thing.
We discuss third degree in the
board openly and we said this before.
No one was against using a recruiting firm the problem was
youune let irrelevant went out
to a recruiting firm and hr
referred and we asked them to
look in recruiting firm. It made it."
2023-10-06,"we made it look like that one
you had med it electric like the
process was tainted.
That's why we decided weed go and thank you very much for the
hours I spent having helping to draft and PRESIDENT Wechter you were PRESIDENT You had time to do this.
And input and everything seems
to be after people have already
done the w and the criticism.
We are here to act as a board.
We can't have discussion on things we had over. We had a time line.
I drafted one it keep us on
track that was -- I think a
request of member afuhaamango.
We tried to we are on the time line xu make these comments like
had we hired a firm we would had
things done in 16 week list is no guarantee.
It was an exercise for all of us
to gone through and come up with
questions w with dhr I have confidence in the press we went through.
But I don't have confidence in
adopting another code of ethics
I'm willing to take it to"
2023-10-06,I think there was a motion. You second.

not been my experienceful I am

Why I want it make sure it is clear."
2023-10-06,"we will discuss it before I
put it on a calendar that is why
sooner rather than later we have a seamless report each month.
Thing is it make it so that it
is informative to the incoming
ig and not having reports for the sake.
Suggest a dealt of OCTOBER 27 a week before the NOVEMBER third
date of a friday would that give you sufficient time so there is
no confusion?
As to when people should send.
Noted if you don't send the priorities it hampers the
ability of this board to be moving forward.
If you don't send priors don't come to the meetoth next week
and say these are my priorities but you don't sends it.
So issue sends it. Thank you.

I was surprised it see my name am o. Report from the [Inaudible].
I don't remember giving my name last time. I saw something.
The rest is difficult if I guess
the transcript was my accent.
But I never tell the mayor to
push the [Inaudible].
And critical thinking.
It is responsibility.
Because, otherwise, I mean that is it.
Everybody understands when responsibility is about.
Why it is clear.
It is not happening.
So the other friday 2 weeks ago
I went to the mayor's office to ask is the mayor okay?
I want to make sure I don't see trace of the concept
responsibility on critical being
in the city.
Is the mayor okay? Okay.
Now -- I want to be nice and it is tough times.
Who protects the sheriff? You? Protect the sheriff?
Because when protects you?
So that's why we need to work together here.
Otherwise there is no MAY it is a mess.
There is no future here, guys. For nobody.
Because well is this pressure on
us start looking for happiness, no way.
work for [Inaudible] We don't
want to be [Inaudible] You have
to really pay attention, you
work and try to get rid of the emotional disorder we are in
because it upsets the intelligence. And if it affects our
intelligence it affects our consciousness.
Which means we're lead to a [Inaudible] Discussion that's
when we are facing. Technology is part television.
Intelligence walks with emotion
and technology today works with mechanics. Against a machine.
That's why we are trapped. Technology is our enemy.
We have to redefine technology. That's the future.
The sheriff, I don't know, look,
the sheriff takes care of the government government serves the people happiness of everybody
according to this we don't want
to become stupid because we are
the [Inaudible].

SEPTEMBER 1, it is great.
Starts with a the sheriff -- most people know me here from the

remember me with my french accent.
My name is jerry.
I came to tell you that
the sheriff has a
specific role to play
to protect the government's officials. The problem is, you
have to make sure the government is

It isn't going to work.

against such as ugliness. It isn't going to make
you happy. Nobody. [Indiscernible] Is not serving the people. One thing, nobody wants war. Nobody. Do you? How come the

promote all the city the concept of responsibility and critical thinking. How come we don't [Indiscernible] How come?

on the line. Good afternoon caller,
you have two minutes."
2023-09-01,"hello.
My name is michael petrelis.
I spell my surname so there are accurate minutes on this meeting.
I filed a complaint in
APRIL with the sheriff department against officer andrew martinez, because I
believe he had harassed
me before the meeting started and he chilled my first amendment rights. i video taped his
interaction with me, this lieutenant martinez. I filed a written complaint with internal affairs at the sheriff's department
and then after about
four weeks of never hearing from anyone at
the department to ask
me any questions about
my complaint, I received an e-mail from deputy kevin mcconnell telling me that they
have conducted an internal investigation, again, without asking
me a single question, and they absolved their
colleague of any wrong-doing. I mention this because it is one more reason why we need this
commission to get its act together.
Hire the inspector general. Start investigating citizen complaints.
We have waited years an unconscionable number of years for this commission to address the abuses of the
sheriff and the deputy. We cannot wait much
longer for you guys to hire someone and get
that person up and running as the inspector general. basically, what we will eventinally need in san
francisco is a law enforcement commission, instead of one commission for police department and one for sheriff department, we
need a single law enforcement commission. Thank you for listening."

2023-09-01,"hello.
This is michael petrelis again, and i
want to address the
draft meeting minutes
from thursday JULY 27.
I see here that there
was no general public comment and then you
went into closed session, and again
there was no public comment about go
nothing into closed session. I'm very concerned about the lack of
public engagement and public comment about this meeting.
And then, you went into closed session and it says here, discussion
in closed session will not be disclosed.
This terrible lack of
transparency has to be addressed. Speaking as a person frustrated and trying
to get some investigation, some independent investigation at the sheriff's department,
to see that your
commission met in JULY behind closed doors. This was about the inspector general and there is no public that
was there, no public comment recorded, and what was discussed will not be disclosed. Boy, this is a reason
why so many of us are distrustful of any government oversight of law enforcement,
because we just do not
see transparency and it
is crucial that there be transparency about
what you are doing on
this commission in closed session, because we have no idea when we
will get the inspector general.
Please, tell us what
happened at that meeting on JULY 27. Thank you."
2023-09-01,"thank you caller. There are no other
callers and no other public comment. Calling line item 3,

One caller online.
Good afternoon caller,
you have two minutes."
2023-09-01,"hello.
This is michael
petrelis again and I'm greatly disappointed
that there is not a substantive discussion taking place right now
before you go into closed session about
hiring the inspector general.
The fact that we can't
learn how many have
applied for the job or how many have submitted
answers to the questionnaires is
really harming the public trust in what you are doing, or what I should say, what you are not doing, and that
is not giving us transparency. It is really not just the lack of transparency, it is the
extreme lack of urgency.
we are in SEPTEMBER of
2023 and this commission is still dragging its feet on
getting us an inspector general.
I need to repeat that at some point san
francisco needs to merge the police commission with the oversight body of the sheriff's department
and let's also look at oversight regarding the district attorney's office.
We need a
comprehensive single law enforcement commission where we the
people go to a body with power and voice our complaints, where
we list our complaints against the various law enforcement agencies at
the local level in san francisco and how crime
is not coming down and the trust in law
enforcement is also declining. Please tell us what the
heck is going on with the inspector general's search. Thank you."
2023-09-01,thank you caller.
2023-09-01,"I like to mention
that the commission and hr, dhr is required to follow several different employment
laws, which protect the personal information of
some of these inspectors, potential inspector generals and applicant, and we have been abiding by that and therefore we use the closed session to insure that information that should not is illegal for us disclose
is not disclosed."
2023-09-01,"and just to add further context to that, we have been since beginning of this
year as we were going
through this process, dhr, been transparent about the timeline it takes for the interview process and just gathering information.
We are going by
standard timeline."
2023-09-01,"no other public comment. Calling line item 5, public comment on closed session. Public comment on all matters pertaining to
item 6, below, closed session. For members of the public who like to comment pertaining to line item 6, closed session, if you are present please line up at the podium, otherwise call the general number and use the access code on the screen and follow the
prompts to be added to the queue. Good afternoon caller,
you have two minutes."
2023-09-01,"because you all set
a calendar for yourselves this year that you are following that calendar. It is unacceptable that
we the people are still
waiting for not just transparency, but urgency!
Where is your sense of urgency on getting more public engagement at your meetings and also
the urgency that is needed regarding hiring this inspector general?
How much longer must we wait? It is now the 9th month
of this year and we have no idea even what the number of applicants is.
You all are hiding behind the bureaucratees of personnel laws. I do not believe that you're going to violate
those laws if you tell
us three or 30 people
applied for this position.
really, the lack of
transparency here is harming community accountability and law enforcement and now you
are about to go into closed session about this and we are going to have to wait who knows how long you will be in closed session. We have to wait until you come out of closed
session to make public comment on the other
items on your agenda. You really should have put this item for the closed session at the
very end so that we could hear the report that follows this item and also be allowed to make general public
comment on that. So, please show some urgency here. Thank you."
2023-09-01,thank you caller.
2023-09-01,"if it were up to me we would disclose the number about the number
of candidates, but I can't compel dhr to provide that information. We have to abide by the laws as interpreted by our deputy city attorney, so my
personal feelings do
not trump the rules
they are following."

up maybe a committee on the hiring of the inspector general so it continue to go on-because you all meet once a month. Maybe the committee could meet every two weeks in order to speed the process. I heard another gentleman call in and I know we want to get this resolved so we can start moving ahead, so that was my question. Thank you."

we are on track of the
timeline and that the appropriate information is being sent to commissioners.
The commissioners to avoid -- make sure we do everything correctly,
we don't discuss things
outside, only our amazing clerk here will send the information to us so we have a
opportunity to review
everything and have a more thoughtful engaging conversation here."
2023-09-01,"just to add, we did have community meetings. Unfortunately a number had to be canceled for lack of quorum but we
got feedback from the public. That also came to inform us what kind of questions we wanted to ask our potential candidates, how we crafted the job announcement to begin with, and had closed sessions during the regular meeting to get
updates and have a discussion with the department of human resources and as well as our city attorney
and then we had additional separate closed sessions on the recruitment as the inspector general specifically."
2023-09-01,"we greatly appreciate you coming here and being engaged
in this process and welcome you back."
2023-09-01,good to see you again.
2023-09-01,"yes.
I recognize her."
2023-09-01,"there is no other public comment.
We'll take the roll for the motion.

2023-09-01,good evening.
2023-09-01,"thank you. Good afternoon board members. Let me apologize saying
between you and a long three day weekday. My name is marshal kind for the benefit of the public who MAY not have tuned in into past
meetings, I am a chief of staff for the department of police accountability and our
role currently is to provide civilian oversight for issues of sheriff misconduct while this board builds the new department.
Our congratulations to
PRESIDENT Elect soo and vice PRESIDENT Carrion and congratulations to the board members appointed this year, board member palmer, board member afuhaamango and vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
Look forward work wg all you as we continue
to try to build this new department with you to support this board as well as hopefully realize your vision
very very soon. I'm here to present on
behalf of the dpa. Little bit about our work. We are always pleased to be able to present the work that we have been doing for the past nearly 4 years now. As you will see, we
started with ad hoc
requests back around 2018, 2019 that developed into agreements with the sheriff's office and we now have a working agreement that defines
the areas in which we have jurisdiction to investigate. We included in appendix that basically lays out
those areas that we have jurisdiction over investigating. As you all know, we started without any commitment of resources or funding, so
everything was built on borrowed resources, but as you will see in the presentation, over the
past 3 years we have really ramped up and built in particularly accelerated over the past year our capacity for taking on more work and more investigations. Our output.
Our reporting and our data capabilities. So, without further
ado, any there are any particular questions
I'll present a overview of our investigative
work over the past two years.
As requested, we have prepared data for open
and closed case statistics, complainant demographics and break
37 down of allegation types. The 2021 data we
included to compare on open and closed cases in 2021, we did not start using the current case management system,
which was built around 2018 until mid-year to later part of 2021, so
a lot of this data was added afterwards. The case management system was also built specifically for sfpd
cases around the sfpd processes, terminology and definitions, so it wasn't something that was a automatic fit for sheriff cases, but we built processes to make the case management system work because it is better to have all this data automated
then not in a automated system. That decision was made
in the middle of 2021. What we ended up with
however when we looked at the 2021-2022 data was some of the
terminology and classifications used entering data in 2021 was slightly different
then 2022. For example, classifying referrals, which is what we call cases that we receive or report from the public or the sheriff office about a misconduct case that we ultimately determine that the dpa does not have jurisdiction over
under the letter of
agreement, and we end up referring the case
back to the sheriff department internal affairs unit for investigation. That can sometimes occur on its face when
we look at the complaint itself and clearly not within our letter of agreement, but sometimes that takes a number of investigative steps to make that determination.
As you are aware, our
letter of agreement gives jurisdiction over
use of force with injury, use of force with weapon, and those are not readily clear in the complaints.
We MAY have to go back
to get medical records, conduct interviews and look at surveillance video to see if there
is a injury or whether a weapon was used and
sometimes that is a considerable investment of investigative resources before we make the referral.
There is a lingering question at what point do we consider that a referral or is that a case we investigated and closed. What we did to the last
meeting to this one is data reconciliation to make sure we capture everything using the same terminology nomenclature and classifications so we have a better apple to apple comparison of
data for all of you. This slide represents a very very broad
overview of some of our 2022 statistics. As we continue to work with this board, we hope that you will share with us what kind of data is important to
this board so we can refine our data capabilities, capture and reporting of statistics.
This is a very broad overview that has
different ways of calculated sustained rates.
We can look from the perspective of case sustained rates which is 42 percent, 5 audited 12 cases we investigated and closed
in 2022 resulted in sustained allegation. You can look at it deputy sustained rate,
which is a number of deputies we investigated on closed cases in 2022 and that
was 99 deputies. we sustained or make
findings to sustain 11 deputies there. The allegation sustain
rate is another way of computing it, which is out of hundred allegations investigated and closed, there were 20 sustained allegations.
We are not ascribing any particular weight
to the calculations, these are just numbers. Ultimately we like you're feedback what is the most valuable data
and way to present it
for this board. We included also something that is increasing year over year, which is the amount of time our investigators have to
go over a video footage. Many investigative arenas with advancement
in technology and how cameras are, [Indiscernible] That is
also growing as the sheriff department enhances and augments
surveillance system as well as deploy more and more body worn camera
there will be more and more camera footage and
as you can see, 416
hours dedicated in 2022 represents about
20percent of full time
investigator's work here.
I also want to make a
note and provide a little more context to this data. Obviously numbers don't
tell the full story as
to the type of investigations that we have been working over
the past few years. Because the investigations only involve serious cases under the letter of agreement there is a high concentration of
very serious and complex investigations
and all them expand considerably from the initial complaints.
In the sheriff setter, often times a single call for help will
result in a entire platoon of sheriff
deputies responding to
a scene. In sfpd you MAY get smaller cases where you have a discourteous officer in a traffic
stop or delayed response to a low priority call for service. With the sheriff investigations, these cases grow considerably because every time
there are as many deputies that respond
to a scene, adds a lot of complication, body worn camera footage gets obscured when a number of bodies in close contact start
making contact and not providing as much
clarity as a body worn camera would provide from further away."
2023-09-01,I have a question.
2023-09-01,yeah.
2023-09-01,what is the one investigation that -- was there one investigation that wasn't about deputies?
2023-09-01,all the investigations are about deputies because the letter of agreement only allows to investigate sworn members so we don't have any investigations on non sworn members.
2023-09-01,why is there hundred investigations allegation investigations and 99 deputies investigated? Are you talking the number of counts of allegations?
2023-09-01,counts of allegations. There are two separate data points.
2023-09-01,thank you.
2023-09-01,what is sustained mean?
2023-09-01,"great question.
For the purposes of this report, sustained
means that that is our investigative finding. that is not the final determination. The final determination
of a sustained finding
is defined under penal code 832.8 which is after all the appellate remedies or appeals processes have been finalized. That is something that we find very challenging to compute because we don't have
direct access to the sheriff's appeals data and often times the appeals can actually
pend for years. We actually without disclosing particular
details have been
involved in arbitrations from incidences 5 years ago
so it is a slow process
and often times it is hard to correlate the
years findings with the ultimate determination as defined by the penal code. There is going to be a
lag between what our determinations are in the investigations, what we send to the under-sheriff who makes the initial determination whether she concurs or disagrees after the investigation and the case summary report. i would say that since the time I have been
there and in reviewing past investigations before my time, we have an extremely high concurrence rate with the under-sheriff in
terms of sustained findings.
That is promising and also indicative of I
think a very complete investigation."
2023-09-01,"concurrent meaning like what you are finding they are also
finding on their end?"
2023-09-01,"yes. After we make our investigative determinations, we
issue 1 to 5 findings consistent with the way the sheriff issues their findings. There is an appendix in
the back that provides
definitions from the sustained, not sustained, exonerated and so forth. That report and that
investigation and all the investigative materials including all our interviews and everything that we took into consideration is sent over to the
under-sheriff first. The under-sheriff reviews everything and makes a determination, does she concur with our findings or
disagrew with them and
that is where the under-sheriff arrived at the same conclusion."
2023-09-01,"okay. Just since you pointed out that some of these cases could have started from 5 years ago, I think it is
helpful to kind of parse out the-what
cases were started in 2022 and maybe years
past as ongoing."
2023-09-01,"definitely. We will probably have to consult with sheriff legal and city attorney office how we might be able to share data
related to specific cases that are -- that have the confidentiality
afforded to it under 842.7, but what we can
figure out is how much we can anonmize it and if the board wishes to
have more details when -whether we can go into closed session to share the information or details."
2023-09-01,thank you.
2023-09-01,"this next slide is simply a graphical representation of the cases opened to give you a idea of from 2021
we had 24 cases, 2022,
we opened 21 cases. also gives you the number of cases per quarter. These are relatively small numbers. I would find it difficult to draw any particular conclusions from these sutistics.
What I can say, an icdotally this year we have seen a significant increase in our work load.
Increase in number of complaints, increase in number of
investigations we are taking on.
In the first half of 2023, we opened 23 cases so in 6 months we opened all most the same number of cases we opened annually for the full year of 2021 and 2022.
We are on track
potentially opening 40 cases.
A lot can be attributed to the work of this great board and bringing attention to the services we are
able to provide for sheriff oversight. Similarly, the next slide is a graphical representation of the
cases that have been
closed in 2022 and all these cases represent
in terms of the case closures with few exceptions that where the timeline is told under government code 3034.
All of them will be relatively within 270 days which under the letter of agreement we have 9 months to close the investigation. The 2022 cases you expect vast majority of
them to have occurred
or reported and started that statutory timeline within 9 months to a year. These are some graphical representations of cases closed by quarter.
We closed 20 cases in
2021 and 12 cases in 2022.
In the first half of
2023 alone, we closed
11 cases, so I think
with some additional oversight and some tweaks to our efficiency, we are also
increasing our productivity. Year to date from JANUARY to SEPTEMBER
now we closed 15 cases this year. The numbers are relatively small, so
hard to -- this year we added three death
investigations so a
total of 4 death investigations.
[Indiscernible] One a tragic vehicle pursuit. This next slide captures the
demographic data of the complainant as reported.
67 of the complainants provided their
demographic information. That means nearly 7 out
of 10 provided their background information
as to race, gender and age. This is completely optional so the data is self-reported from the complainant.
43 percent of our reports were referred-were made to the sheriff office and
referred to the dpa, 33 percent referred directly to us or made directly to us by phone.
Our most frequent demographic for race is 38 percent black or
african american, 67
percent male and 33 percent age group 20-30 years of age.
I would also note that
the complainant isn't always necessarily complaining about themselves.
It could be a complaint about somebody else in the jails. The complainant could be a family member of somebody in the jail or somebody that witnessed something. Whatever that is worth,
that is part of ourf
demographic data for complainants. Our case findings. As I indicated, we
issue 5 investigative
findings consistal with
the sheriff policy of exonerated, not sustained, sustained, unfounded or no findings, the
definition is in the appendix.
We also-one of the determinations that we struggled to classify a bit is referrals.
Again, when do we call it a referral? It is easy when it is clear on a space that it is referral, but when we investigated months of investigative resources to it, that should be represented
as a work-load as well. I would also point out
that these definitions along with definitions
for allegations and classifications for the types of wrongful conduct are also all included not only in
our appendix but more expansive definition within the sheriff policy itself.
One thing that I thought was noteworthy
with the highest percentage, 65 percentx onerated, 20 percent sustained, but also we
have a very very low
not sustained rate of 2 percent. By happenstance it happened that these are out of a hundred allegations so the
percentages correlate to cases.
Because, not sustained is basically an insufficiency of evidence to make a determination one way or the other. I think this is a good reflection that the investigators put immense amount of work
to reaching a well-founded conclusion based on evidence, rather then simply
falling back on there, there isn't enough evidence to make a determination. That is the advancement that probably allows us the greatest clarity in
resolving these types
of challenges is
surveillance evidence. This next slide will probably be difficult
to see from a distance. Hopefully you all have copies of this presentation. It is basically a
breakdown of the various allegations that we investigated.
The top 3 allegations
raised, number one is unnecessary force, 2, retaliatory behavior
and 3, the improper use of safety. The top 3 is failure to
check on inmate in a
safety cell and inaccurately filling out safety cell observation sheets.
I would say
that-unnecessary force is a-the top allegation reported, it is also the most challenging that our investigators
find to resolve. This next slide represents allegations
as classified into the type of improper conduct. Again, these definitions are
included in the appendix.
The top or 20 sustained
allegations fell into three categories, misconduct, unacceptable job performance and neglect of duty."
2023-09-01,do we know how many of these happened during over-time period?
2023-09-01,"no, we never looked into that and that's a good point.
As we all know, lengthy and extended overtime as a considerable
amount of stress but we never tracked misconduct allegations as it relates to whether it is regular
shift or overtime, but --"
2023-09-01,the location and the shift.
2023-09-01,we do track locations and able to go back and cross reference shifts so we might be able to see whether or not that data is readily accessible or something that we might want to start tracking in the future.
2023-09-01,"because if you can track and present information on the pods of the location of the jail and the shift, we could then determine from the sheriff department records whether deputies were working overtime there. I think it is a good
point to gauge."
2023-09-01,"in terms of trends, it might be-I don't know if it is hard to get the data, but I think in the last few years there is tremendous overtime so we would have to go
back 5 or 6 years. I think deputy MAY be able to speak to this.
Now there is not voluntary overtime, but mandatory so know it isn't uncommon for deputies to have 3, 16 hour days in a week. Is that correct?"
2023-09-01,"I have to go back
and look, but we could
get drafted -- 2, 3
times
a week and --  [Indiscernible]"
2023-09-01,"but your maximum
day is 12 hours so if you
get drafted -- 16."
2023-09-01,[Indiscernible]
2023-09-01,"but if a regular shift would be like 12 hours, and if you added the drafting it is maximum 16 hours?"
2023-09-01,"we have 12 hour shifts at county jail 2
and then we have 8 hour shifts at pretty much everywhere else.
We also have 10 hour shifts as well,
specifically at different locations, so but the majority is 8 hour shifts."
2023-09-01,"I think it would be
useful to receive a breakdown of location. specifically as you can provide it.
Where the incidents originated, the shift, the number of deputies involved. I don't know if you can also provide their rank and if you can
categorize the type of
situation that was involved. I don't know whether you gather that data."
2023-09-01,we'll be able to from the complaints we classify under a variety of different allegations that fall into misconduct.
2023-09-01,"give us a idea where the friction points are and maybe looking over
time to see whether the increase-where complaints are increasing and when they are increasing and
what are the situations where you are seeing more complaints now then you did last year."
2023-09-01,"okay. We'll go back to the data to see if we have
that in our data pool
or what we might need to cross reference but we heard the concern of
the amount of overtime and perils it places on the deputies and safety
of the jail, so we'll delve into this."
2023-09-01,"let me ask you, when you reach sustained finding, the agency where I work, we
prepare a memo of aggregated and mitigating factor and a mitigating factor might be the fact the deputy had been working
overtime three days in a row. Do you compile anything like that with reports?"
2023-09-01,"no. Not formally as aggregation or mitigation but in the narrative of our
reports we have indicated agigating
and mitigating circumstances. The letter of agreement doesn't allow us to delve into what the discipline should be. That is office of the inspector general MAY
be able to provide more insight into, because the charter also provides that this department will be recommending discipline
like we do for sfpd."
2023-09-01,thank you.
2023-09-01,"I have another
question on sustained cases.
Do you actually code in particular if the deputy or deputies were following policy protocol or whether
they there is a policy violation? This gives insight on what policies we need to consider amending or including?"
2023-09-01,"yes, all the allegations are tied to
a very specific policy
I what the violation was."
2023-09-01,"and then, since
there has been like a
over-haul of the sheriff policies, all
the deputies are required to abide by the new policies, correct?"
2023-09-01,"yes. Moving forward, but as
we look at the cases that pre-date the policy, we operate under the policy that was at the time out of fairness and notice and due process."
2023-09-01,great. Thank you.
2023-09-01,"I have a question. The allegation findings slide, just because of -- this is helpful to know prioritization of what types of allegations. Do you track which officer did that or is that something that is
you guys are not privy to?"
2023-09-01,"every single incident we-the goal of the investigation is
determine every act by every officer involved and they are separated
out in terms of what they individually did and what they did together.
One of the big challenges in close
quarter of group is
trying to attribute every grid-lock, every leg strike, hand
strike, hold to each deputy. That requires often times a lengthy careful study of all the available video as well as very detailed interviews."
2023-09-01,"I guess what I'm getting at,b if there
is a any overlap with a particular employee
that was like maybe had multiple unnecessary
force incidents."
2023-09-01,"certainly.
The beauty of all this being automated, if you enter a employee name
you will see an entire history there. We are aware.
These are things that are confidential unless
they fall into the categories under senate bill 1421, 16 and 2."
2023-09-01,I have a question. The under-sheriff is responsible determining what the disciplinary will be?
2023-09-01,"for the investigative determination and then
those findings are forwarded I believe
to-I believe it goes through sheriff legal
to under-sheriff the, under-sheriff makes the factual determination,
sends to the sheriff for disciplinary review."
2023-09-01,"do deputies that get sustained findings, do
they still get their pension or does that part of disciplinary action? I don't know if is a appropriate question, but I'm curious."
2023-09-01,that I don't know the answer to.
2023-09-01,I could answer that.
2023-09-01,probably deputy nguyen can answer better then me. I think you have to commit a crime.
2023-09-01,"speaking as someone who has a city pension, you have a contractual right to your pension so I believe unless
you are convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and vested in the system you are
still entitled to your
pension."
2023-09-01,[Indiscernible]
2023-09-01,thanks.
2023-09-01,"very briefly, this
slide is more detail
into the type of
improper conduct. Our last substantive slide. Wanted to provide as requested share a update and provide this board with progress
report on what the dpa has been doing to support this board and
to assist with building infrastructure for --"
2023-09-01,"I do have question.
I asked for demographic
information on members -- such as length of service, age, race."
2023-09-01,"that isn't automatically tracked in our system.
We would have to go to
personnel records to cross reference all that. I'm not sure if we have direct access to the
those records."
2023-09-01,isn't that tracked for sfpd officers?
2023-09-01,"I believe they are tracked for sfpd officer but we act under the auspice of the letter of agreement
and only provided the information that we negotiated in the
letter of agreement."
2023-09-01,"is this information
on your website?"
2023-09-01,"this information,
yes. As I was-I'm going to
lay out where to find the statistical information."
2023-09-01,has it been publicly disclosed prior to the presentation to this board?
2023-09-01,"yes.
In this portion as I'll explain, starting
JANUARY this year we started publicly
reporting on sheriff investigation data and
we have been building
upon that, so it has been a iterative process.
The case management system wasn't originally built for sheriff cases, so we have to work around some parts of the system to make it work
for sheriff work processes as well as fit the terminology and
classifications we use for sheriff cases, but
as you see on our website, starting JANUARY in our monthly
reports you see the monthly data of cases
coming in and I think
some time a little later maybe MAY, JUNE,
the data pool keeps getting expanded. Demographic information is on there as well now."
2023-09-01,is that presented separately from complaints about san francisco police officers?
2023-09-01,it is on the same report.
2023-09-01,"you might want to separate them out for
the ease of the public to find them because they are separate departments. I looked at the website and didn't find information about the sheriff department investigations and so
someone looking for that probably-because it is separate function and separate department, might be useful to separate those out."
2023-09-01,"we had a discussion about that. One big issue and we
don't have a data analyst dedicated to this work.
We don't even have specific investigators that are specifically paid for this work.
They bill back to the sda for their investigative hours,
but they are not on
this particular pay roll.
We are struggling for resources in building reports.
All of the folks that are currently doing this work, this is adding additional work to their current work
load, which is why it is currently reported
and the link is
included on the presentation."
2023-09-01,"I wanted to thank you for being budget conscious for us, because if we had to
build a entire system from scratch.
Want ed to thank dpa for doing that. Couple immediate questions. In terms of the most egregious cases that
could be referred to a da office, would you do
that or does it go through the under-sheriff first?"
2023-09-01,"if you are talking about a investigation that yields potential criminal conduct, that
is under the letter of agreement requires to
refer back to the sheriff criminal
investigative unit for investigation.
As you are aware, we
don't have neither the jurisdiction nor legal authority to conduct a criminal investigation,
but of course in the administrative
investigation we MAY
uncover potential criminal misconduct,
but there is also very
specific rules on fire walling administrative investigations from criminal investigations, because
the administrative interviews are protected which are
considered compelled and not voluntary statements and if you have commingled of evidence you can potentially compromise a criminal investigation and criminal prosecution. It is currently built
such that any time we uncover potential criminal conduct it is referred back to the sheriff department criminal investigative unit and they are then responsible for conducting the criminal investigation and making appropriate referrals to the appropriate prosecuting agency. As you are also aware, not all will necessarily go to san francisco da office,
san bruno is san mateo jurisdiction."
2023-09-01,"we are out of time so we need to continue the rest of this line item, and do we have a motion to continue the rest of this line item along with line items 9, 10 and 11 to the next meeting?"
2023-09-01,I'll make that motion.
2023-09-01,do we have a second?
2023-09-01,second.
2023-09-01,"thank you.
All those in favor?"
2023-09-01,aye.
2023-09-01,"thank you. We will call line item 12 now, general public comment. At this time the public is welcome to address the board up to two minutes on items that did not appear on this afternoon's agenda or within the subject matter jurisdiction of the sheriff department
oversight board.
During public comment neither personnel or board members can respond to the public but MAY provide a brief response. General public comment is for items that did not appear on tonight's agenda. Those present, please line up at the podium.
Those not present call the number and use the access code and follow the prompts to be added to the queue. There appears to be no general comment."
2023-09-01,"I just wanted to ask-thank chief of staff for such a thorough job.
This is a great presentation, easy to read and think the
public is going to benefit from seeing this."
2023-09-01,"before I believe and
next time I have one more slide, I'll leave you with the literature we produced. We still have to get the funding to produce more of them, but this provides information
about the services dpa currently provides for sheriff oversight."
2023-09-01,thank you.
2023-09-01,"I do have a question for city attorney.
Are we the persons that
are-are we the body responsible for the budget that can give them more money or is that through the sheriff because I know
they have a mou."
2023-09-01,[Indiscernible]
2023-09-01,"I see.
I see."
2023-09-01,"[Indiscernible] Any city department can
work [Indiscernible]"
2023-09-01,okay.
2023-09-01,"but there are some
things that are within
our budgetary control now? We actually -- we had dan make a presentation to make sure we got some kind of funding to continue and dan is sort of our only person
who wears 3 our 5 hats
as working for us essentially. So, we do have some
control over the budget.
The other thing too, I think before we leave is, depending what we
are called down the road and maybe -- are we at future items yet?"
2023-09-01,"no, we continued everything else. We need to close the meeting."
2023-09-01,the sheriff-the investigators at dpa doing investigative work on sheriff cases are billing back to fda under work order.
2023-09-01,"yeah. And then that leads to down the road since we are public here. Figuring what we are called because we are referred to so many different ways in the charter, what the mayor office calls us and the
budget, what we call
ourselves, so I think
we need a solid identity. I tend to follow the money, so however we are getting funding maybe we need to go
under a particular acronym being used by the mayor office, but that MAY require a charter cleanup then

2023-07-07,"calling item 3 recruitment of inspector general discussion and possible action.
Update from dhr on the
applications.
Hello members of the board I'm bench min rich consultant with human resources.
Providing a brief update on the
recruitment for ig.
The announcement period closed
side JUNE 24 open for 3 months. We received 37 applicants during
the posting p.Ed and we conducted screening.
Reviewing the qualifications so far.
We have 5 applicant who is believe meet qualification in
all areas and qualified to move forward.
We will be sending an update e
mail to all applicants letting them know we are reviewing
application and moving forward.
we sent reminder to all board members to complete the fairness in hiring training.
Several of you very close thank you for that.
And as out lined in our time line we presented to the board
the next steps are to appropriate for the interviews.
I believe we discussed questions
for written is up elemental and
in person questions."
2023-07-07,"what role did the eccollusion of law enforcement experience or
any hiring because it is so broad.
Play in having only 5 applicants from the 37? It was significant.
We had a number of candidates
excluded based on the -- largest
thing that disqualified candidates"
2023-07-07,"would you estimate that numberism understand if you don't have an exact number.
Like 5, 10, more than 10."
2023-07-07,"do you have a break down of
how people were disqualified based on the qualification
requirement and 5 years of management experience?
So for the prequalifications the bachelor's degree. Educational requirements.
5 years of management experience.
And then the no employment in law enforcement agency.
Nobody was disqualifyod
education all met that.
There were about hesitate to get this specifics about
candaceidates we are in open session.
But I would generally say that
we had about half of them in the educational questions of law
sxifkz out of that we have 5 who
met all 3 qualifications.
at this point will we be
prohibited from looking at
candidates who had let's than 5
years of management experience?
So the posted announcement the
job requirements in it if the board wushgs to change those that would be up to the board to
take a vote on that.
Dhr recommend repost figure we
make a change to qualifications.
Come who did not and meet MAY have chosen not to apply if they
meet the new ones they MAY apply.
Gi think in response we have a thorough discussion and I think the board had voted and determined that 3 years was
insufficient given we were in a
long covid period and I think
with the agency like this, it
really commands on hand's
experience and people skills and managerial skills I'm in favor
keeping the 5 years I think it is really important."
2023-07-07,"given that we have 5 candidates who cleared the
hurdles what were the next step
in terms of time and the role of board members given that looks
like we MAY be going on recess
in AUGUST and therefore the next meetingly would be the first week in SEPTEMBER? What would you need from the
board what decisions need to be made?"
2023-07-07,"next steps would be to develop the questions for the
questionnaire and in person interviews. We would recommend.
Closed session for this to have
an open discussion and developing the selections that
is next step to move forward."
2023-07-07,"and would you create those questions?
all of us have an opportunity to suggest questions?"
2023-07-07,we would look to the board members to suggest questions.
2023-07-07,"I think if I MAY suggest MR.
Richie that, perhaps we ask all
the board members to submit
questions to MR. Brown and I can
act as a liaison and asemble those questions for to you
refine and then we MAY if we are
at recess have a zoom meeting discussion of the questions
would be closed session, anyway.
And you would have the written
questions at your disposal that
will be a save and if there is a lag time for the oral questions
that the -- interviews would not
happen until SEPTEMBER, anyway.
Does that sound like a good plan?
Yes, that would work."
2023-07-07,is assessment the earliest we could conduct interviews with the 5 candidates?
2023-07-07,"that happened be up to the board.
As to the time line.
Time line we have is advisory
but up to the board if you choose to meet sooner or schedule interviews we work on your schedule."
2023-07-07,"I'm concerned any decisions
about what questions used made by the entire board.
We should all have input."
2023-07-07,"I think that is the purpose
of people submitting questions
and weave have a closed session
via zoom in light of the brick
in AUGUST we would still have an
entire board discussion."
2023-07-07,"regarding the applicants were
total there are upon 37 that applies.
Do you find 37 is common. Where it has been posted.
Out of curiosity that if we are
not satisfied with the 5 do we
need to open up recruitment and exhausted all of our options."
2023-07-07,"po sfigz posted on dhr's jobs website.
And it was highlighted on the
main page and in addition it was
posted on a number of external cites the job board.
They were all the boards
suggested by members.
There was a lives 20 -- ish place
somewhere free and some were
paid. .
The 37 do they meet requirements for alternate hire if the
initial hyper does not make it through?"
2023-07-07,"there are 5 applicants that
meet the qualifications I'm not sure."
2023-07-07,how to answer.
2023-07-07,"did the other applicants
meet qualifications or all disqualified.
There were 5 total that met the
qualifications.
MR. Richie back to the time line was something written in the post that was shared.
For me I'm all about quality
versus quantity f. We have 5 quality candidates that check
the box in terms of qualifications, great. There was anything written in
the application that suggested to twhem a time line might be or electric like that we need to
make sure we are upholding our end or needing to share the time
line will be pushed out because of x, y and z."
2023-07-07,"only time line was the
closing date for the announcement.
This is post on the bonjoured's
website in the meeting minutes.
For you were absent in the left
meeting we had a closed session
we discussed the exclusion part
of the charter this says no one employed by a law enforcement agency, which is broad.
Employment at the agency and not categorizing by jobs.
Wlp a social worker or a sworn
officer television is immaterial it is law enforcement agency.
That I think caused a lot of the
applicants to be disqualified.
Having been on a panel to recruit department head for the
city I think 37 is substantial amount of applicants and
especially when it is posted 3 months.
I know as a liaison I thank the
board members for suggesting places where the job
announcement was posted."
2023-07-07,"deputy city attorney clark
participating remote? I have comments.
First I'm happy to answer questions.
You should not discuss in closed
session without a row to disclose.
You are voted not disclose. And that's the first thing and
the second thing is I'm not sure
I understand the suggestion need
to bes clear board can't meet remote. So photocopy the body it has to meet in person"
2023-07-07,even if it is closed session.
2023-07-07,that's correct. ; is that correct. That is noted. Thank you.
2023-07-07,"other questions for deputy
city attorney clark you answered my question."
2023-07-07,"okay.
I had a question.
Say that we give off our
questions the candaceidates are interviewed. Brought before us.
And we still are not satisfied
that this person should be were
in that position permanent low.
My question is this, because of
the eleventh time take us to
hire someone, would we be able
to select out of the 5 temporary
person to get office up and raining and staffed because that
process will take a long time no
matter who or when we hire someone permanent.
Is that a possibility? This situation? I don't know the toorns that question.
I can look into it and get back.
That is a good question for the
deputy city attorney can we
select someone as an interim role?
I think it would be interesting
as an applicant fiapplyd and you
know I'm selected as an interim."
2023-07-07,"still with in running for permanent. But you know.
Give a chance."
2023-07-07,"jana?
I don't know yu couldn't but that's [Inaudible] [Inaudible]
Move forward with that.
And [Inaudible] [Echo] If we can
look at your point this is your first go around talk to clothe fist there are positions or
department heads hired upon interim capacity and what that looks like.
You know moving forward.
There were suggestions from
experienced people on oversight boards and one suggested that --
if it took a long time to hire
somebody and needed to get things started to consider
having someone on contract a
retired inspector general.
city attorney clark will you speak to your labor folks and when do you think can you and
get become to us on that so this
way we have that around. Yes. Okay.
I can I will.
We see you now.
Since our next meet suggest in
AUGUST I'm concerned whether we can meet again had JULY to finalize those and give them to the candidates.
And then set a date or date in swhaept we would conduct the
interviews which we have to be
in closed session.
If members have questions submit
instead next 2 weeks that -- at
the end of JULY I don't know
what members calendars look like.
Schedule a special meeting would
that -- have to be on sfgovtv or recorded as the upon community."
2023-07-07,"there is no requirement you
meet on sfgovtv."
2023-07-07,okay.
2023-07-07,you have a public remember meeting
2023-07-07,"we would not need to meet in
a room with cameras might give
us more flexibility for meeting
location.
I think the issue issing we had challenges with community meetings and thing this is come
up because we are human.
So -- I think you know I'm for meeting again in JULY I thank
you seems like a possible.
I do think that in terms of
making that decision, we should promptly give our schedule to
dan to figure out if this is possible. For JULY.
I can you know.
We will be the one coordinating
and figure out if we can cothat
the last week of JULY?
I have a clarification. I will most likely not make the special meeting."
2023-07-07,"we can submit questions we
want I mean I submit to dan and tell be shared."
2023-07-07,okay
2023-07-07,"there are question this is
dhr has in terms of formal
interviews that dhr that you guys impelement. I have been in city interviews
there are standard questions as well."
2023-07-07,yes.
2023-07-07,okay.
2023-07-07,that would be good
2023-07-07,"and member brookter the
training and certification."
2023-07-07,yes.
2023-07-07,"MR. Richie can you tell us how the interview process will
go and how the rating process will go?
When we have out lined in the
schedule is that there would be
2 rounds of first supplemental written questionnaire cent and
fill it out and return it.
Those question arias rated and
then based off that the board
can bring any or all in for in person interviews.
And those interviews would be
rated and the board make a sdichlgz as far as selection or impeleven other selection processes they wish to use."
2023-07-07,"couple of follow ups. .
Who would be rating the
supplemental written applications. Board members."
2023-07-07,wield?
2023-07-07,yes.
2023-07-07,and would you give us a rubric to rate those?
2023-07-07,"that would be a discussion we
have developing the questions is
the rubric we develop. Standard practice we have
examples or rubric for suggestions of responses and
average and low responses."
2023-07-07,"would the board member rate
those individual low or meet?"
2023-07-07,"so.
The standards practice the board members each do their own
ratings and meet to review them.
Our are guidance is that the
final scores should be within a point of each other we don't
have to have the exact scores.
We want to avoid wide range of individual questions don't want
one rating a 5 and one on the
same question if using the same
scoring guidelines they should be close.
Alternative to the board do we
reuse subject matter experts or
dhr rates the written questions themselves?"
2023-07-07,"it is possible to have experts.
The board general low considered
subject matter experts for this process.
In the charter board is
responsible for the selection. I can't -- upon I would
recommend the board if the board wants to look at alternative I have to check in not sure if this is an option."
2023-07-07,"I agree, also with that
statement because you know we do
bring as a past prosecutor doing investigations and we all bring different skill sets I think
whether we figure out a 1 to 5
and 10, I think we can manage
doing that. Together.
. Dot rating of where I want questions that would not require an additional meeting?"
2023-07-07,that would be a question for attorney clark.
2023-07-07,"I was texting the labor.
Can you repeat that please."
2023-07-07,"if the board members individually rate the subelemental written question
and answers, would we require an
additional meeting of the board
before we could dot interviews? So.
We you would -- the main thing
you cannot do is community back and forth outside of a public
meeting if you are sending nochlgz dhr and you have
delegated to them a task or something to do with the information that does in the create a brown act problem.
If through the dhr information is shared amongst board members
that is a problem does that
answer your question?"
2023-07-07,"what I'm hear suggest we
would not need to have an
additional meeting regarding the
answer as long as they were
independent and complete a cert ivengdz we have not communicates with another board member about
our rating of the is up
elemental questions? And sends the final questions
special hopeful low we can send
out the questions by AUGUST on break.
.
As long as you do copy and don't make substantive changes."
2023-07-07,"I mean I said I'm sending the
raw questions I'm pretty
proefficient at copy editting."
2023-07-07,that's the definition copy editting.
2023-07-07,"just catch up the frontline
we meet the end of sdwro will discuss questions. they go to you.
You sends them to the candidates
and give them time to responded.
Then in SEPTEMBER, if there is
discrepancy with ratings we need
to meet to discuss this? Correct? And then?
And then we would need to meet
to conduct interviews?"
2023-07-07,"yes.
This could take place in SEPTEMBER? I believe so.
Dhr is make that work"
2023-07-07,"with interviewing 5 can that be done in one day?
In a venue like this? Closed session?
General low based on candidate
schedules tell be difficult to confirm. Difficult to confirm 5 in one
day it is possible but deupon
pends on the candidate availability."
2023-07-07,"and we are developing the
questions for the candidates. That's correct.
Would they be participating
remote?
A question for attorney clark.
I don't think than I have to meet no requirement that meet in
person in terms of the public
meeting laws.
Gi wanted make a clarification
when we submit the questions the
board members submit questions
on the is up elemental written.
Questionnaire and also secondly
we submit them to dan which we
ask orally.
Are oral questions grade like is up elemental"
2023-07-07,"MAY be different but you know everything is confidential and so we want to make sure
everything is uniform and we are
not missteping and asking the wrong questions. I don't know if you have done the training make sure are is in
the biassed or follow up
questions that are you know --
off the cuff this might violate
employment law."
2023-07-07,"okay.
Should we take public comment on
this or go to MR. Bloom's presentation and then public comment."
2023-07-07,"it is up to the board.
For you take action you neil public comment before action
otherwise can you have it any time.
Why don't we have MR. Bloom's
presentation and we can take public comment and deal with
motions the board anyone MAY
want to propose. In"
2023-07-07,"the second part of line item
3 presentation by russell bloom
inspect police auditor bay area
rapid transexit former mfbt
berkeley police commission."
2023-07-07,"good afternoon. Board members. PRESIDENT Wechter.
Thank you MR. Lum for setting up my presentation.
I hope you hear me limp I appreciate the opportunity to join you.
Let me start by -- giving a bit
of my history am I'm currently
the inspect police auditor for
rap is transit district.
Started there as an investigator. In 2014.
Where I remained for 2 years
before moving to the role inspect police auditor.
Prior to that I spent 3 years as a volunteer review police
commissioner for berkeley.
I was vice chair and chair of that commission.
That is where I developed my
passion for the work of police oversight.
Also a mfbt national association
for civil an oversight of law
enforcement and a certified
practitioner certification I
received from [Inaudible] As
this organization is known. I'm glad to be here today and
give you a baptist input about
the structure at bart.
Let you machine a bit more about
how I do my work currently as
the inspect police auditor and to answer questions you might
have as you move forward with
this recruitment process and I was fortunate to be able to
listen to the questions you had
and discussion you had about this process and there are a lot
of moving pardon fist there is a way can I help inform the
process a way that is beneficial
to you I'm glad to provide that.
Bart oversight model was formed
as some of you MAY recall in the shooting of grant on the
fruitville station platform in
2009 early new year's day.
The grant family and advocates
and one of the early viral
shooting videos rem put significant pressure on the
elected officials that runt bart
district to look inward at the bart police department, which is
a police department that has the
same peace officer powerhouse as
a law enforcement agency in california to which look whether
need to reform that department
and they found there was a need.
And part of this reform included
stake civilian oversight.
Structure they chose to impose
was a very robust hybrid mottle.
And as you MAY know.
the structures MAY have been of
one type.
Monitor a model or a board made
of volunteers.
And revisions to those.
The in model that the bart board
crafted ultimate low implemented
is includes all of those aspects.
We have a lot of areas of
authority and responsibility in
my office and we work closely
with the 11 member bart police citizen review board.
Those members appointed by the elected bart directors and have
one member appointed by the bart
police officer's association and
police manager association.
Representative the police officers at bart.
As I mentioned in areas of authority and responsibility for
me does include investigations and conduct inspect
investigation in complaints.
We have the authority to over see internal affair
investigation and monitor for quality.
When we complete investigations
we bring those to the bart
review board in closed session.
Make sure they agree with our
recommendations and findings.
Am those are forwarded to the
chief for implementation.
The way that our model differs
from others and historical
models is the default position
the findings and recommendingations of the
structure. Approved by the voluntary review board implemented by the chief of police unless the chief of
police appeals that.
My experience with the bart the berkeley police commission our recommendations were those.
and the chief of police was
welcome to accept or refject our
recommendations with regard to
discipline. The default those recommendations shall be
implements the chief has an
option to heal that is rare
leave exercised.
I want to highlight aspect of
the model I think is valuable that has been part of model since inception.
Championship is this requirement
to do a review and inward look
to determine whether the need
exists to improve the model.
With most things.
Climate changes, context change
bunkham we experience aspects of
our work we MAY not seen before
and learn as we encounter sets
of s did not contemplate
circumstances this we encounter
and require revision or there
are simples that -- are new am
unique and novel that had not
upon been occurred 11 years ago
when it was crafted.
This gives the board to make
provisions to the model based on
when we learnd and grow and how we e involve and the police department changed.
And how the communities we serve
changed especially what we learned from the people we serve
about what they need and want
from us and when they want and need from the police department
that provides public safety.
Able to have a model in this way
to be flexible over the years.
Can served us well and I think
provide us with a healthy,
growing oversight model that
speaks to the needs of various
communities we serve and unique
in that 5 counties.
An funt for you to are effective and the police department to
grow in way catharsis health and he important."
2023-07-07,"so I'm pleased with that.
Moving forward, I think as you
look at what is important in selecting an inspector general.
It will have to be in my opinion
someone who has experience.
Who -- has -- a history of manage and am a team.
And -- what I like to highlight
for you is -- take away from the
work I have done is having input
from the people we serve and
work is what the model should look like and the leadtory
understand how to serve the
people that are in meet of over
assignment assignment. I'm q.Ed to answer questions you
MAY have I think moving forward
it is challenge to set up an
office from crash as at bart.
Able to listen to the stake hold
exerts community members and
leadership in the sheriff's d.
And the line level an important
thing to do something this motes the needs of the people that
will be impacted by work.
Thank you for having me. Happy to answer questions."
2023-07-07,"are there questions for MR. Bloom yoochl thank you for make
time out of your schedule and for that presentation.
Air part of me like you sure you
don't want to apply for the job.
You indicated that the model had
to be flexible to address
community needs what authority begin the opportunity top have that flexibility.
We are governed by a charter
spes fies 6 things we have the authority do do. We are a recommendation commission.
we are not -- a clusion that
dictates what shall happy if
there was an appeal process in your case.
I'm durs to figure out how do
you manage that ex"
2023-07-07,"able what was the authority
and did you go back and revise
your documentation.
In order to address the needs?"
2023-07-07,"the original language from
sacramento granted bart board to
craft what over site they saw
fit n. Doing so they crafted a
model that allowed themselves
the ability requiring thoemgz go
back periodically and do a revision.
We have done one in 2018 when we
brought in outside the oir
group.
To -- how to improve our over site side.
54 recommendations for improvements and the board of
directors approve the 50.
We implemented and in the
process of doing our second
reexamination and will see what
come up time in the next year.
You said 54 policy
recommendations and 50 passed."
2023-07-07,"protect.
The review group identified 54
areas to improve the existing model.
Some small some will large.
50 were approved by bart board for implementation.
Was that -- did you guys pay
money for that oversight board
to do that work.
We paid them to come in and do this review.
At this time."
2023-07-07,do you know ballpark figure how much it was am understood it is 2018.
2023-07-07,"I don't have that number
perform you are welcome to roach
out off line and I still have
the documents.
The how dpu get input from communities?
I know you mentioned that was
importantful with different stake holders."
2023-07-07,"so -- for that project the
oir group did their own out
reachment I kept myself arm
avenue length from that project
to avoid that I had my thumb on
the scale for this. I will not
speak to how they did that.
My team and I primary low through our work with the governmental race and equity
came away from -- our educational process with that
group understanding deeply that
all work needs to be informed
consistently when we better than
from the people we serve am in
every way we can try to listen
and learn from the people that
we serve.
Avoid a top down imposing prop
to police over site and to that
end create a position in my
office on the engagement.
Tricycle to enhance all of the
ways in which we both create
awareness about the work this we do.
And services we provide and collecting information about --
whether we are doing it properly
or being effective or meeting needs.
Connect with people at all and
making them aware of our
existence and -- what the people
are satisfied with and for us
the best measure of successes
and failures there are ways we
are doing that and trying to be better. It it is an on anything process
we are learning how to do better upper dame etch"
2023-07-07,"sthk. Jury room thank you, MR. Bloom
for sharing your time and
thoughts with us.
My am fetalks to the experience and backgrounds of the
individual members of the audit group.
You believe MAY be aware our
charter precrudes staffing.
From everybody employed by law enforcement it is sweeping.
I will note that I receive over
site and reform as holistic the
people we serve to the people doing the work.
Staff at sheriff's office or
sworn officers.
I neat michelle philip in oak
lands come from a law
enforcement back grounds.
I upon listened to the issue as
listen to being you earlier this afternoon.
My perspective and I think -- I
know -- ig philips and mreesht
the experience. And obviously.
Am objectivity to the work we do
is paramountful regardless of history and work experience
requires one it do it objectively.
There needs to be you need to be
able to move if if you do it that way.
And you need to reassure community and law enforcement
you do work objectively and
don't have a dog.
I think you are unnit for the
position.
Should be less important when your work history is and whether
you are able to approach it
objectively and do it tlur and properly.
It is important to be thoughtful
how community perceives the
possibility that somebody with law enforcement experience MAY
be less table to be unbiegsed
doing law enforcement over site
work and thoughtful how this MAY
be perceived addressing that is important it is challenging I
don't think I can advise you how
to manage that problem or where.
I think we identified you are
potential low e eliminate
qualified candidates having a
sweeping minimum questions of law ifkdz.
That is a potential issue for
work this challenging and difficult.
And and standing up in new
offices quite complicated.
So to pull somebody who has
experience doing this work, you already significantly limped
your pool of qualified people of finding somebody not currently
employed is challenging or who
is and electric to leave work to
do this extremely challenging
work -- and set up a new
office -- I think -- widening
the pool is wise. Considering each case by case
rather than e millennium laying
nerve that way MAY be --  something worth considering."
2023-07-07,"thank you for being here
today. I have a question.
Do you continuing is good for
the ig to go through law enforcement training for the newi g to understand what
deputies go through every day, daily?
I think on going chaining is always important for anybody and
who is doing this work. Law enforcement training is
always e involving stayingum to
date and speed is important. I would expect anybody qualified
do this work at this level now
should already be have
experience significant law enforcement training. Fwlang to the work. But00 autoanswer to the question
is, yes ig in this role should
be prepared to indang in
training.
Understand when they are experiencing and expected to
know and adhere to norred make assessments about the quality of their perform of I thank you it
is a long way of saying, yes.
And not speaking on the will behalf of the sheriff's
department upon is it good for
the sheriff's adopt have
training like the use of force
for the ig to go through to get
a better feel what deputies go
through daily etch I myself
found that training valuable.
I will say dependsos who is
operating the simulator.
My experience when oversight
professionals sprngs the sip
later we get simulations where
we don't well.
Provide upon insight to what law
enforcement professionals MAY be
experiencing on the job and that
perspective is valuable when you
are evaluating performance.
I did not do mrchlt I realized I
have to concur with ig bloom and
value.
Alsoy think the sheriff's
department is unique they have the use force that is general
to -- all california law enforcement.
But some of the stuff not on the simulator is what deputies go through in jails.
Of so -- you know an addition
they go through ghaen is on the
behalf of the department.
Department can put things they
feel per nan for the ig to
understand the these are issues
we face and when they make
developary reactions.
If I MAY say I think that I'm
compelled to say that converse
low it MAY be helpful for departments to have opportunity
to listen to community.
And people incoverserate exclude
learn about what their
experience are like.
Deputies understands what that
is like for the people they
provide law enforcement services to."
2023-07-07,thank you.
2023-07-07,"are there other questions.
Why I have 2 questions.
Thank you for your time.
Issue raised by appointing
interim inspector general.
Based on your experience do you have thought busy this?"
2023-07-07,"I do.
That is I then and there where I
have been recruited for this position tell be difficult on
pull me away to do something
that would be short term.
Without the promise of long-term
permanent position. MAY be there would be some I
think I will leave it there. That is challenge spig think the
lack of continuity would be a
problem for the office.
You do select a logo and I I record out going messages.
This is per of standing up in
office is -- deciding what is appropriate, who work there is
and the tone and the will
culture.
And perform and b ask common to adopt that."
2023-07-07,"right.
I think the second person would
want to reorganize that stuff so
you would -- be reinventing the
wheel for round 2.
that of was my take when I heard that.
It seems unwieldy to me."
2023-07-07,"havure ever served in a
role reviewing applications for
oversight management pro position.
Written or reviewing -- on a
panel.
I sat on so many panels some for
leadership to suspicions.
Staff with over site at every level exit continuing is
important for mow to am mention. Rate the answers to the questions.
I think there suspect nuance in
the way people answer questions. Subject matter experts listen
the way the questions are answered in the moment of the it
is very important to have
subject matter experts craft the question and ask question and
highlight again I think it is
important to have community
input on both crafting the
quills and awfuls grading or
rating the quality and the vault answer.
Long way of saying I'm not sure
PRESIDENT Wechter fisat on a
panel for a leader of an agency
but found many and it is
important to brought my
anymorise and experience to the
process and I thank you lt lead
to a probust selection process with better success."
2023-07-07,"last at the last meeting we
had a presentation from los
angeles exit was struck boy lack
of diversity amongst their
members.
The berkeley review board?
It is varied and changes every
couple years.
I don't provide staff report well is separation.
Without me looking at the list i
don't want to comment that.
And it is diverse and that's
important to me.
I have pride of the diversity of
my staff and the different
experiences and perspectives we
bring to work. Thank you this has been helpful."
2023-07-07,"thank you for having me.
Good luck with the process I
hope you find a great canned
dhat is important work. Thank you"
2023-07-07,"goodbye. Before we take public comment I
would like to make a motion have
comment based on MR. Bloom's
statements we ask dhr to
incorporate experts from the civil yen over site community to
the rating of the supplemental
answers provided by the
applicants."
2023-07-07,"I wanted to provide insight to get feedback.
From my colleagues so the revouft supplemental question
arias consensus process is a
suggestion but not required for
this recruit am. And some of the standard we
require t. For this one it is
optional.
I have an option for the board
it meet in closed stoegz discuss
the sxool then there develop interview questions.
To schedule interviews and --
able to make decision based off
the review of applications for
candidates to invite to interview in the questionnaire.
I wanted share that information"
2023-07-07,does that mean we would seat applicant's applications at this meeting?
2023-07-07,yes the board can review the applications.
2023-07-07,"okay.
Will you be doing it like blind applications blocking out name and identifying backgroundses"
2023-07-07,"for the review.
Yes we would.
Upon public comment for item 3. Lineup or call the number and
use the code on the screen.
To me it does not make sense the
people don't make sense what so ever.
I think that was clear I listened. Does not make sense to me.
You know when I'm saying it is
clear as day to me it does not
make sense I don't hear anything.
I don't see or hear anything.
What were the guys talking for

Calling item 5 presentation by
the sheriff's office informational item."
2023-07-07,"sfo will give reports on the terminology a description of the
data base or other methods used
by sfo to track grievances
availability of data and
availability of reports.
Readily available information is in the process.
A number of departments pull
data examples of personal hours. Today's presentation will be
given boy it could not be here
but is remote.
Heel dot presentation to you remotely.
His name is martin. Thank you. Good afternoon.
[Inaudible]."
2023-07-07,"presentation on the sheriff's
office for the information
around data. I'm trying to thank you very
much. Chief said on the [Inaudible]
The sheriff's office and I'm the
chair for the rather community
there have experience on this bay area. [Inaudible].
And novelty take too much time.
Next.
Today we have a presentation on
talking points which are [Inaudible].
Will go through the [Inaudible].
The data [Inaudible] [Cannot
understand speaker] [Echo and
muffled].
Sheriff's office like many other departments.
We have an I t department and we
work in different areas.
You see [Inaudible] One talking points is [Inaudible] The
description of the data base.
one thing I want to state here
is sheriff's office upon around
for a time and there is data information.
The [Inaudible] Is what is
[Inaudible] And [Inaudible].
On the top you see [Inaudible].
The 2 collect data from
different sources and departments.
We use [Inaudible].
We have services as limp one of
the talking points the
[Inaudible] It is key area we
are dealing with on the process
[Inaudible] [Inaudible] The next
upon one case management upon
system the [Inaudible]
Management system.
And that is one-4 hours.
The documents which is one could
this unit the money is driven special mulltrician and hope.
And one to have could have this
information.
What is the week [Inaudible].
[Inaudible]:so -- another
talking upon point where are delay and challenges.
The dlis are associated with
various reasons.
One of these received we don't
have a standard [Inaudible] Of
data points.
And you have clip and request
and from that is there.
So -- depending who it is and
you are asking questioning this information and putting together
this support could be a challenge.
I think the dedications the
because of multiple sources we have. Single servers.
There is an honest time we need
folks back next to [Inaudible].
[Inaudible] [Inaudible]
[Inaudible] What sell at the sheriff's today. multiple sources. And in the surety when we want
to do is you want to move from [Inaudible] The rare vision from
the sheriff's office we need to
get [Inaudible] That concludes
my presentation.
[Inaudible]."
2023-07-07,"thank you. Very thorough presentation and
I'm sure we will have many questions."
2023-07-07,"I have a question. Thank you. Director.
For this very an excellent presentation to sing thyself
that information in a clear way. I appreciate it.
I have to say thank you for your work.
What you presented is bleak. More then and there I thought.
And in terms of I can imagine the frustration of someone trying to do their job and in
the able to access that information.
I had a question about the how
much of00 autodata and the
information the reports are in paper records.
When did the scanning part start?"
2023-07-07,"so. So.
Thank you very much am so the
[Inaudible] What year did the
scanning start?
The scanning [Inaudible]
[Inaudible] Thank you for the presentation one comment on one
of the slides I was confused
what information is stored on
each data base like pdf and
microsoft sql. How is this irrelevant haven't
to what the board is able to
action on? I can say. so vice PRESIDENT Carrion asked we prioritize.
What will inform our work ooze
well as the ig when they are
walking into is able it access
and data and produce reports. This would be relevant to the
public and also hoping there
could be some kind magical data
base like the -- san francisco police department has where the
public could actually access
data and look at a snapshot in time."
2023-07-07,"so this is really relevant to
the staffing of the sheriff
because now we -- obviously a lot of personnel thundershowers
produce the reports.
Why this makes sense and I can see that it probably will take time to put information.
I was thinking this it is a
problem for the sheriff's
department to solve for. One thing we rescue noise and thoughtful about the fact the
sheriff suspect under staffed
when we make requests we want to understand the impact of making that request.
If we make 50 asks but not
jermaine to what our 6 obligations are.
Then MAY be we had not make those requests now. Should be prioritizing which of
the requests should be making
that meet those 6 specific obligations in addition, I think
it is something I would be interested in asking as a follow
up question and hope that all candidates would talk about
their experience with technology
and how is an inspector general
going to come in come you know
with these setbacks going to see
their vision to pull the necessary information to do their work."
2023-07-07,yea.
2023-07-07,"makes sense.
I agree with the prioritizing of
the different complaints and the how they. Yea"
2023-07-07,requests.
2023-07-07,"I want to make sure member afuhaamango I don't know if you
answered the question the pdf's and."
2023-07-07,and thank you. Yea.
2023-07-07,"director? Yes.
6 areas we did on the grievances
and how they need to start.
And for example the [Inaudible]
Example. Other questions"
2023-07-07,"yes. Thank you director.
You have a very challenging job.
I was looking at the case
management system and in your
table about how readily available information in the process. First you indicateed us the systems don't talk to each other
that is -- a priority need.
But to take claire fight minimum
initial personnel.
You have 1, 062?
Can you explain that more? Sure.
So -- for the [Inaudible].
I talking about I system in the
general office.
Sheriff's office [Inaudible] 150
to [Inaudible] 62.
And the case management system [Inaudible].
I money that all of them as long
as [Inaudible].
Information in the system.
This system is monitor system. In the general manager system
there is [Inaudible] In there we
can use for [Inaudible] The
challenge with this is totaly
you have thousand in the system.
And then -- depending when is
asked of the unit.
How much can access that data.
So -- well is general
information you could -- ask
anything in the 1062 to provide information.
And you can [Inaudible] In
areas.
Number of licensing if we asked for I report it would not take
this many to have input it was
pin pointing who has the
available information?
I will ask you we have the look
and keep on course.
This this informs us on the budget and the advocacy and when
we would look at in inspector general.
I see improvements needed what
would be your wish list? Cost.
And then -- the conversion time line to intgreat the systems and
stream line the systems you have
something beautiful like the
structured data?
Thank you.
[Inaudible] [Inaudible] One final thing you MAY not answer
mou but manage to think about.
In terms of as we make improvements the sworn officers
deputy hours saved even during our training session I know
that -- there was like a dozen
natives deputy on a day enter
things by handled in scheduling
and things like that that takes
time but we are also -- we know
the staff is stretched thin if a
system will automeat and whether
the time sheets.
We have to balance with the personnel hours saved.
So that is something you can
think about. Thank you."
2023-07-07,"numbers nguyen do you have questions.
Quick question and thank you.
Upon not an easy space this is
in line with folks at the departmentful I begin to think
about plat forms utilized not
utilized, using sales force you
answered the parent. One thing this stood out I did
not see as we think about moving
forward and leverage technology more is just around cyber
security which is huge. I think now come across. Something I would like to see
and the question I had how does
your department work with the d. Technology?
Within the mayor's office.
Of I have been interested how.
Works and so that was the only question I had. How do you interface.
How do than I play in mostor conversations about resource and budget we don't very much I
wonder what are things that might be financial for and help out in terms of the department
and was one of the questions I had."
2023-07-07,"yes. Thank you.
The technology [Inaudible]. Frozen.
Tough question. While you get him about
objection to taking a 5 minute biobreak."
2023-07-07,no.
2023-07-07,great. Thank you.
2023-07-07,"all right.
We are back in session how does
the sheriff's have compared with similar sheriff's office.
Given this we are u nobodying we
are a city and county.
And other counties have broader patrol practices"
2023-07-07,"most the departments I
visited are I high-tech it is
better than ours nouchl they is
a council or supervisor that
passports them to give them the infrastructure. What do than I have this you don't."
2023-07-07,"you know I'm not a techy I
know I so them push the button
it MISS In up seconds tells me
it it is a good system.
Opposed us when we manualy do it.
Why if you can, I want to make
sure I understand the process of handling grievances and complaints. Grievances come in handle written?
From people in custody?
They get on yea not hands written but a computer they go
on word and goes on a form
example print it out and mitt it in."
2023-07-07,electronic and someone scans and enterses this information.
2023-07-07,yes. What is the volume of grievances can you mate.
2023-07-07,"I don't have that number.
I think it is admit this much perform I money it it is big but not thousands."
2023-07-07,"what about complaints isn't complaints go through to our
website for if you are talk
about this. They go through our
website or call directly.
Do most criminal from the public or neap custody?
They do come from the public and
dpa and investigates and refer
to us after. Any to the sheriff's office"
2023-07-07,complaints?
2023-07-07,"yes.
Than I go to our website or e
mail if someone in custody how would they.
Go to the proper channels in the division. What would that mean."
2023-07-07,I don't have the procedure for that.
2023-07-07,"do you know where the cut off point between the investigative complaint and
manage handled as a grievance is."
2023-07-07,"that go through ia and they will make that determination I
don't know their procedures."
2023-07-07,"for the public I ia internal affairs that would be useful for
the ig to have a sense."
2023-07-07,"sure.
Internal affairs when they sit
down with them they will explain
the process including the police accountability.
So that procedure will go in first. Okay. The complacements statistic you
gave us a couple meeting ago did
they cover all complaints that
dpa did not handle that did not fall this what they have jurisdiction over.
I think that the and referred by
dpa yes and minor 1s that came. Personnel. With ia."
2023-07-07,they handle na.
2023-07-07,"I'm asking about the
specifics 2-3 meetings ago.
It was begin on mow by ia yoochlt were they handled by ia
and not dpa"
2023-07-07,a combination.
2023-07-07,"most of the time when it gets
a referral it go the to the
shiver and sheriff has final decision."
2023-07-07,"mentioned dpa handles certain
complaints oig handle all.
I want a handle on what rolfe um
we are talking about that the
oig will handle."
2023-07-07,"I think primarily you have to
do with dpa they handles the
most volume and we handle our own. Have you to get those numbers from dpa."
2023-07-07,"okay.
You say the number that dpa does
not handle the sheriff is small?"
2023-07-07,"yes.
Thank you."
2023-07-07,"back. Yes. Sorry. [Inaudible].
I had a question for martin. Okay.
So say we were to implement you
know from the vote on the sales
force and it goes through it would be a benefit for to you
have user access rights to that system?
To stream line the process.
Of information sharing between
dob, ig and their team with the
sheriff's department?
You to have the rights and the
sales force [Inaudible]. Correct? Yes.
If we were to row on a sales
force system for the new ig and
his team would it be beneficial. Her or their."
2023-07-07,or her or their. Why yes.
2023-07-07,"beneficial for the sheriff
department to have access rights
to allow information sharing
with the sfso and the sd ob."
2023-07-07,"yea part of that [Inaudible].
The question this did in the get answered."
2023-07-07,"I don't know if you remember not on cyber security or offices involvement with
department of technology."
2023-07-07,"and how you work together
and you befwn to answer it."
2023-07-07,"yes.
For this for the use of the --
the -- the relationship there
they manage them from the city
and the department because -- we
are under the compliance the california department of justice.
The city -- [Inaudible] I had a
final question.
Have you survey other sheriff
departments and counties. Other jurisdictions work well
and what the factual -- issues upon surrounding their departments but I think with any
system there are kinks.
MAY be if you could get feedback
or survey other -- county --
sheriff departmentos it systems.
MAY be we could really pinpoint
when we need and best for us. Before we take public comment
would anyone object if we put
over the report on deployment of
deputies in the field to the
next meeting?"
2023-07-07,"actually I think chief is
here so I don't want to waste
his time. I believe that might be something relevant to the community and especially with
the news of the patrols that are now going on. And people not -- sometimes I think the public does not
understand the sheriff's role. I think it would be helpful to have this report."
2023-07-07,brief.
2023-07-07,let's proceed and take public comment after. Thank you.
2023-07-07,good afternoon board. How are you.

That's the last one.
There you go a background.
History developed a plan to
deploy member unit and the plan
to disrupt open air drug sales.
Our emergency services unit is 132 person unit. This receive additional training
and aeliminate of different areas. Crowd control.
They do civil unrest trin and
training for pods points of distribution and security for fire department and the
hospitals and everything."
2023-07-07,"for planning and training field developed targeted
training for staff per of this operation.
21st the big thing of 21st
century policing deals with
community engagement gaining
trust, accountability and put the practice in place and make sure people know what is going
on that's when we want to see.
We did a lot of arrest refresher
that was we were updated with
challenges in the laws in the state of california.
Make sure we are following
correct low.
We went over the fourth ma'am. Standard in law enforcement and you have to have a reason.
We can't walk down the street and say. Hey. Come here I want to search you. Do this.
Jot public pc is probable cause."
2023-07-07,I'm sorry.
2023-07-07,correct.
2023-07-07,"in the fourth amendment we are to stick to the constitution.
We don't want to violate rights.
You saw new york stop and frisk.
Use of force pol we went become over we understand everybody
understands the use force policy refresher we do train.
Give more refresher. Officer safety temperature is we
have units that work the street
daily this. Is bringing more
outside of the comfort zone to work we want people understand
safety and security.
And understand engagement is okay. Resources, one thing we do and
proud of is resources for the
unsheltered individuals. Utilizing narcotics and alcohol in probable we not ignore the fact. We want to offer resources.
This was a big thing through the
mayor's office and sheriff put emphasis on it.
And other identified topics some how it do proper approach and
car stops and things like that. We did with total additional training on top of the patrol
refresh exert other subjects.
4 pill arts building trust am
policy and oversight, technology
and social media and community policing and crime prevention.
We are not out there to stop
crime we also want to hospital
community we check in with store owners and ask if we make difference.
The to know we are out there we
want a harmonic environment on the streets.
Those so we have resource guides we pass out. i brought one. Pass them out.
Got elder services and veteran services and o. Which is good we
try to talk to people in doing
temperature we have not had takers yet.
We still keep powering away at it."
2023-07-07,"proposed staffing.
2 field training cars with officers they know all the laws
and everything they are out to
help us to report.
Esu squad is 8 members 130 man pool.
Taking 8 people at a time for 2
weeks and working through.
We use our service unit they
receive the additional training
on how to perform a high profile arrests and dangerous stuff. They work on the streets every day. We have a good core group of people train exclude working
every day and working the other members in add time."
2023-07-07,"we get a rounded, balanced group there.
And keep have the fod admin my job.
We are working with the city and other law enforcement agencies
to make sure we become a good partner in this. So.
Operational stats.
Since the start we have detained 23.
7 released on em electronic
monitoring the pretrial and
within in the guidelines and --
you have a nice day.
Present with the 849b let them go on their way.
Issued 11 citations.
Issued from paraphernalia to
arms on drug use.
Oning riding a bicycle on the
street that is a -- that's a --  municipal one and automatic. Give them a warning the
individual unless he is riding around kids, it was a safety issue. Told him to get."
2023-07-07,"the 5 we had 5 most were em
people on electronic monitor
release violated conditions of the court order. And we followed the court orders to the
mixture what it says that's when we follow.
The one of the most proud of individuals offer service.
74 people went to and sleeping on the streets and check and making sure they are okay and offering service.
It is good to see the people have out there doing this and
irrelevant engaging.
And individuals accepted service zero. And it is tough when people are
out there living you know, unsheltered and things to want
to accept service.
Not a lot of trust we are hope to do better in the future.
This is the first 2 week period it was a slow roll out we will
have new members meeting on saturday.
They will be going out there and
with the same core crew to train them. And that's where we are.
Preponder to go for a sick mont
period and at the direction of the mayor and the sheriff. So.
That's where we are at."
2023-07-07,"before questions, can you get
that power point to dan to if you on our website"
2023-07-07,dan's got it.
2023-07-07,thank you.
2023-07-07,all right.
2023-07-07,"I have,"
2023-07-07,yes.
2023-07-07,of the narcotics of the 201.3. Uh-huh.
2023-07-07,what was the most narcotics this was seize said.
2023-07-07,"running 50%, fentanyl 50%, cocaine.
Cocaine in powder form and also rock."
2023-07-07,okay
2023-07-07,and so I understand it I have seen deputies out which med me happy to see them.
2023-07-07,me.
2023-07-07,", too."
2023-07-07,interacting with community and what not.
2023-07-07,"if someone is having aing mental health and drug crisis
and unhoused, what, what does this electric like to somebody?
I think the public hears I want them to understand when how they
can really access that.
If --"
2023-07-07,"so a significant number of
nonprofit and city groups on the street.
The street crisis teams, skirt.
The b hack behavioral health we
contact all those people.
If we see machine in mental
health crisis we call skirt if someone has a medical condition we call an ambulance.
Shelters and other areas, we can
call and use hot teams and other things to find beds for people
and you know if we needed to I have begin direction to drive someone families and kids seeing people out there.
Alegality of times we get -- it
is irrelevant starting to come
together as far as what services and targeting the areas.
So there is a lot more services
you see them provide out there on the street from the street team.
Can't speak about what dph does.
So you know, yes, we contact and
take care of them departments
are c it trains. Negotiators work on the street. And the thing about work the yes, I wills this works for us
we are used to dealing with
people on a different level."
2023-07-07,"a lot of times when
those
come in we-it could be a potential danger. We will step back, let them deal with it and it goes on the merry way, we are just as happy."
2023-07-07,"absolutely. Like I said, seeing the number, 74 was great."
2023-07-07,"correct, and we work closely with general discharge planning too to make sure people who are being arrested for drug use and stuff are being seen before they are released so they can also get services if they need them."
2023-07-07,absolutely. It is two weeks-
2023-07-07,"two weeks-also going to
say, I'm glad that sheriff highlighted special press conference because often times
the sheriff department office is very overlooked so this is a great collaboration we have and also to highlight you are able to talk to a lot of individuals
and some of the individuals were formally incarcerated so think there is a certain trust
level, if you will, to seeing particular deputies out there. I like to provide ourselves on the fact we can have better conversations with some of
these people."
2023-07-07,"that also highlights what we as a board will also look at support for reentry and
successful reinentry and
highlight there are a lot of retirees from the sheriff office and are not armed and act as ambassadors to get people to services. One other thing I was going to
ask about is, will you be tracking injuries to the
patrolling deputies, because I think especially with the danger of fentanyl and mass amounts you are seizing, that is always a great concern about-"
2023-07-07,"safety is always first, and
we do track all that. We do have-safety protocols in place.
It is usually tracked throughout the administrative offices. We do have to complete a supervisor report of injury. That comes to me and part of the data we track and
look at in the daily huddle so
we know what's going
on."
2023-07-07,"the citizens really appreciate the sheriff department for being out there and numerous times citizens will come up and thank us for being out there and doing our job and just patrolling and trying to help take drugs off
the streets and curb violence, so really effective program."
2023-07-07,"I have a quick follow up
question. How do you deal with someone's-unhouse person or someone you are interacting when they have animals and pets. My dog is my first child."
2023-07-07,I got four.
2023-07-07,great.
2023-07-07,"special needs. Yeah, you know what, we have-what will happen, if something comes up we contact dispatch. Animal care control will come and if the individual if it leads to a arrest, animal care and control will come and collect the animal. They basically store-house the animal until something goes on and they will
come into the jail and contact people and say if you are going to be here a long time we want to but your dog up for adoption or something else. When it comes to special needs animals, we are very very careful because of the fact we know that's a service animal and part of someone's ability to get around and work in the world and they will do the same thing. So, we work real closely with animal care and control. We don't just unhook
and let the leash go. You know?"
2023-07-07,great. Thank you.
2023-07-07,questions from other members?
2023-07-07,"I was going to make a final request chief. If you could send information on national
night out and I think
especially for member afuhaamango, and member palmer as well and I'm interested of going out to particular-we cant cover the entire city, that is
why we need to divide out."
2023-07-07,"we are in the process of
working on that. I have
[Unable to hear
speaker]"
2023-07-07,excelsior.
2023-07-07,":   We are covering all the areas and as soon as we get that done-
:"
2023-07-07,"I do have a couple questions. You say 8 deputies
at a time. What shifts and hours are they working?"
2023-07-07,"currently, we are trying to
mirror a lot of the same hours
pd and other people are doing
so deputies are working wednesday, thursday, friday,
saturday night to cover big nights in the city and we work
from 1300 to 2300 at night. 1 o'clock to 11 o'clock at night."
2023-07-07,"is that similar in length to the usual shifts they are working, 10 hours?"
2023-07-07,"we do have 10 hour shifts in the department. This is a unique shift because we are trying to mirror when the most services are out there and everything is out
there so we
can provide the most."
2023-07-07,"several months ago we were
hearing-last year but significant staffing issues, deputies forced to sleep in their vehicles. How is this impacting your ability to adequately staff the jails?"
2023-07-07,"so, we have had hiring sense
then. We had retirements. The
esu unit is paid a incentive pay to be available for these call-out periods, and what we are doing is we are back-filling overtime and the locations we are drawing from. It is my job to manage that and
what I do is I make sure-I dont impact any one unit or division. We pull people from different shifts so we can
balance out the
staffing and overtime."
2023-07-07,one last question. Who is doing the training-the professional training on laws of arrest and probable cause?
2023-07-07,"we do that in-house training
or ftp, the field training officer accordinators do it. They go to additional schools.
We have a curriculum run by
margaret balm gartner
and sheriff legal."
2023-07-07,we have confidence MRS. Balmgartner is involved. Thank you. Thank you so much.
2023-07-07,no problem. Any time. Thank you.
2023-07-07,thank you chief.
2023-07-07,"for members of the public who like to comment for line item 5, if you are present
please line up at the podium, otherwise please call the
general number and use the acsis code on the screen and follow the prompt to
be ated
-added to the queue."
2023-07-07,"thank you. Thank
you very much. Just going to take a
second here to collect my thoughts. Listen, we heard a lot today. We heard a lot. It's not easy sitting through this meeting. The police commission goes to five hors. I was here six hours sitting
here just listening to nonsense. Listening
to police codes. There is no reason for
a guy like me to be here and
put up with this. So, what I'm asking you is, I'm trying to
find out why I'm here. Why am I here sitting through a police commission of seven hours? If I make public comment I stay here and stay here until the end, but it doesn't make sense to me. Nothing makes sense to
me. I dont know how you could do that to somebody. Somebody
just can't help themselves.
You are-doesn't see or know but have wide wide
tentacles that
go iroundaround the city around the city. Who are you is what I want to know? Who are you? I'm trying to find out, who are you? You are talking to me here in this room all the time. I'm down the hallway, down the street. Anywhere I go to the post office, to the shell gas station. You are always there.
Who are you?! Does anybody know? Who are you really? Who are you? I'm trying to find out here. Going on 13 years, I'm asking this question. Somebody is invisible talking to me and preventing me coming up here and talking
and sharing my thoughts. Who-are-you?! Does anybody know? Anybody in the city watching the show,
does anybody know who they are?"
2023-07-07,thank you.
2023-07-07,"hello. Hello. Yeah, interesting with the last
individual stated. Who are
you? Who are you? Who am I?
Who I am? That is a good word
because it revolves around anonymity and complaints and listen to what is going on here
and what it designed for and
hear sharing rights.
:   Like human pinball
:   Trying to figure what is going
on and a lot of times the documentation and record keeping very informative. We are not here as anonymity. A lot of people dont like to file complaints and MAY want to go
anonymous but that dilutes the complaints but not aul al but you are still fallowed around.
Real easy to figure who the complaints is, but who are the
cops? Don't get me wrong, this
is balance, it is necessary. The unexplainable going on and tension get heated and people freak out and referees have to figure what is going on and that gets heated in the cover
of law is violated. Then that has to
:   Due process kicks in because the light of natural reasoning
is not available. The complaint process,
let's think about anonymity.
Simple
:   Sb1421, 832.7.8, chapter 67, sunshine ordinance. Section 3.
Brown act. So, still becoming acquainted with all this, jury mandering, rezoning and
:
So, who are you? I had to be directed to
:
Directed from the sheriff themselves directing me on a straight complaint, okay? Maybe this isn't
:
I got to find the officer
:   Gave the deposition and track him down. I have records of it."
2023-07-07,"thank you. Members, I do
suggest we continue
item 6, 7,
8 due to timing constraints."
2023-07-07,"I would like to discuss the quarterly report just because that has a deadline and it is a requirement. I understand the discussion item for the charter and summer recess, but I think the quarterly report, because
we have a upcoming deadline."
2023-07-07,"let's skip item 6 because it isn't action item and go to item 7. If there is
no public comment remotely."
2023-07-07,"no, there isn't."
2023-07-07,"calling line item 7. Quarterly report to the sheriff and board of supervisors discussion and
possible action item. Discuss the evaluations and outreach during the second
quarter of 2023."
2023-07-07,any discussion or motions regarding this?
2023-07-07,"well, I mean-as present, where are we at? Any report
where you are at at a draft quarterly report and all those things?"
2023-07-07,this is the quarterly report for the second quarter. You have that in front of you.
2023-07-07,this one?
2023-07-07,APRIL 1 through JUNE 30.
2023-07-07,"looking at the
wrong thing?
It doesn't look like a -- I see
it now. Thank you. Good.
Great. What is the possible-why is it a possible action item?"
2023-07-07,it isn't-I believe we have to vote to approve it.
2023-07-07,"oh. That's
what-okay. Was
this sent to us via e-mail?"
2023-07-07,"dan sent it out, didn't you dan?"
2023-07-07,yeah.
2023-07-07,"okay, alright."
2023-07-07,"I think it needs to be
edited because some of the items
[Difficulty hearing
speaker]"
2023-07-07,okay.
2023-07-07,"maybe we end it on a more positive note as we did with the prior reports on what we actually touched on
going into the future. The immediate items identified by hr, and
also in light of all the canceled community meetings that we do intend to have one in particular at glide memorial and that is important to note."
2023-07-07,I can add that. It will be rescheduled.
2023-07-07,yeah.
2023-07-07,I think-
2023-07-07,time certain.
2023-07-07,"sorry, my apologies. Yes, because we will reschedule all the ones we missed in order to have the availability in each district? Or are we saying that we are only going to do glide?"
2023-07-07,"it is just glide for now is and if we decide later on,
especially as we get the interviews and if we
want some community input. I heard some people it was onerous to be in a particular community and maybe have it centralized in city hall again, specifically for community input."
2023-07-07,"okay, I see."
2023-07-07,"I think-dan, I think the
timeline that was augmented by
dhr on the attachments, it did like the onial timeline and they did one specifically for ig hiring, maybe we could incorporate-"
2023-07-07,this is supposed to cover only the period APRIL 1 through JUNE 30.
2023-07-07,"I get that, but in past reports we said we would move
forward to and submit this probably JULY/august, so we will have covered something."
2023-07-07,that was for the annual report. The parameter frz the quarterly report are narrower for the charter.
2023-07-07,"I get that because we missed so many meetings and we actually done more so I think just to know what the board of supervisors can anticipate and then we are still always in a budget cycle, so I don't want to give up anymore of a budget
then we need to and not demonstrate that we are actually moving forward with our duties."
2023-07-07,are you proposing adding things about what dhr intends to do?
2023-07-07,"the timeline. The timeline, because we already established that timeline a while ago, but just to remind the board of supervisors where we are in the hiring. We just closed the
posting JUNE 24 and-"
2023-07-07,"so, can I make a motion to accept the document as is with the changes of the tenses, the addition of glide, and also the addition of the timeline from human resources?"
2023-07-07,perfect.
2023-07-07,I second.
2023-07-07,"so, we just put the timeline
going forward from JUNE 30? In other words-"
2023-07-07,"we are not adding to the
timeline. There was a timeline attachment, so that is what member brookter is speaking of. we are not expanding the
report. There was a timeline about time certain goals we are trying to hit."
2023-07-07,:
2023-07-07,yeah.
2023-07-07,okay.
2023-07-07,"members who would like to comment on line item 7, if you
are present line up at the podium, otherwise call the general number and use the
access code on the screen and follow the prompts to be added to the queue. There appears to be no public comment and I'll
take the roll.
[Roll call] The motion passes with stated changes."
2023-07-07,great.
2023-07-07,"probably should talk about how long can we change this and
get this to --
:"
2023-07-07,dan and MRS. Clark were having discussion about submitting this with the first quarter report to the board of supervisors.
2023-07-07,okay.
2023-07-07,that seems like a good plan. Summer recess.
2023-07-07,"yes, we will skip line 8. Calling line 9. Summer recess. Discussion and action item. Discuss and vote for the summer
recess for the month of AUGUST."
2023-07-07,discussion on the item?
2023-07-07,"I think it is traditional-I
will be the school mom and say provided you submit homework and submit questions to dan in a timely basis we keep on course with dhr."
2023-07-07,I second.
2023-07-07,is there specific motion because I didn't hear anything about the scheduled meeting ing for the first friday in AUGUST. I think we need to be specific.
2023-07-07,"make a motion to take a summer recess and not have a regular meeting in
AUGUST."
2023-07-07,second.
2023-07-07,public comment?
2023-07-07,"members of the public who would like to comment on line item 9, if you are present line up the podium
otherwise call the general number use the access code appearing on your screen follow prompts to be

take a recess in AUGUST. Calling line item 10, future agenda items."
2023-07-07,"should we go back to line item 6, since I see
MR. Kine is here?"
2023-07-07,:   We have 7 minutes.
2023-07-07,we have a future agenda item.
2023-07-07,okay. MR. Kine doesn't mind having to come back.
2023-07-07,"he is here all the time, so-"
2023-07-07,you can come back in SEPTEMBER. [Laughter]
2023-07-07,"calling line item
10, future agenda item. Rescheduling dplide memorial community meeting is one of the items."
2023-07-07,"then we'll have a
closed
meeting for regarding
the inspector general? We'll add
that to the agenda in SEPTEMBER."
2023-07-07,but maybe we want to hear-have the glide before we-
2023-07-07,"yeah, absolutely."
2023-07-07,"so, dan, do you want to send out-should we try to get this all done in AUGUST?"
2023-07-07,"I know that glide likes to advertise it more, so probably won't want a meeting until SEPTEMBER."
2023-07-07,"so maybe SEPTEMBER, and if-our goal is to get every single member there, so if you could send in your total block-out dates and that way
glide can really count on all us being there."
2023-07-07,I will check with glide on their schedule and send that out to you.
2023-07-07,great.
2023-07-07,"we will do anticipate
meeting last week in july in closed session as dhr mentioned?"
2023-07-07,yes.

try to see when I'll be free. When I'll have freedom. I want to get around. I want to do things. I want to buy a milk shake. I want to take
a date

But they say there is a lot of money for you, there is a billions and billions and billions of dollars, you can't do none of those things until we give you the money. Until you get the money you can't leave your house. You can't associate. You can't come here and talk. People are starting to fight me in here. I come all the time

am I first met. Okay I think
someone has my power point that they were going to put up for

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for inviting me to share a little about our los angeles county sheriff civilian oversight commission today. My name is danielle butler boppy and I am the interim executive director of the civilian oversight commission. I've been
in this capacity for since MARCH . And prior to that I was
counsel for the commission. And
then I'll get started as soon as
. Okay perfect. If we could go
to the next slide okay and next
slide. Okay so the los angeles county board of supervisors approved the creation of our commission back in DECEMBER of
2014. And then they proceeded to
create the ordinance in 2016, and in NOVEMBER of 2016. They appointed the nine commissioners
that serve on the commission. The commission provides oversight for the sheriff's
department. Which is the nation's largest sheriff's department with approximately
18,000 employees. It's been in existence for more than 150
years and prior to 2016 had no
oversight. Or at least civilian
oversight. I should say. Um. L a county is the nation's largest county by population and provide
services over 10 million residents. And the sheriff's department services, those residents and 42 incorporated
cities and 142 incorporated
cities in 141 unincorporated cities, and they also provide
the housing and transportation for approximately 18,000 persons
within the carcerano system. Um the l. A county jails next
slide. The vision of the civilian oversight commission is the performance duties through impartial and transparent and it's uh, impartial and transparent manner and to facilitate transparency and accountability within the
department are commission members and staff. We review and
analyze the sheriff department's policies, practices and
procedures, and our goal is to
be providing, um not only the board, but the department and
the public with plans of actions based on the public engagement
that we do. Next slide. The commission has over the years broken down its progress into
three areas of impact. There are cause our actions and our
impact. Um, we're here to help protect civil rights of our citizens support effective 21st century policing and increased confidence in the justice
system. With the public to do that we provide opportunities for community engagement through
town halls. We analyze the issues and recommend solutions to these issues again to the board and to the department
itself. In turn, we hope to make
a difference in our community
and create, uh, helped to create greater transparency and accountability with the
department. Next slide. Our commission is set up. We are not underneath the sheriff
department sheriff's department we report up through the executive office of the board of supervisors, which ultimately
reports to the board. Um we have
a full time staff of eight. Eight staff members, which
include analysts, a paralegal. Community information officer
and myself and our commission does not employ any
investigators or inspectors. We
work closely with, uh max huntsman's office are inspector
general. Um and they are aligned with us in the organizational chart in are also not underneath the sheriff's department. Next
slide. Most of the work and the
action of our commission lies on
the nine civilian volunteers who have been appointed by the board of supervisors. Uh and our
staffs provide support to feel the commission's request. The
commissioners have diverse backgrounds. We have several attorneys, including former prosecutors, public defenders of
former federal judge a retired
sheriff's department lieutenant. An executive from a non profit
organization. And a mental health professional, so vast
areas of expertise and our
commissioners rely heavily on the reports that are produced by our office of inspector general.
Next slide. Much of the work of our commission is done through
our ad hoc committees where since we are a brown egg body,
we work through the ad hoc committees and our commissioners , um, usually get involved where they're very passionate. And so you can see. These are some of the ones that we are currently
working on. Um deputy gangs use
of force. Conditions of confinement where we have just
recently had a series on l. A
county jails. And depending on
what the ad hocks are working on , they bring the issue to the commission. We sometimes request
the office of inspector general to dive deeper into the issues and report back to the
commission. Um and that's how much of our work is done. Next
slide. As you can see, if you look at our website, uh, all of
we direct all of our complaints to the inspector general's office. In our ordinance, it specifically states that our commission is to investigate through the office of inspector
general. Our staff does some initial investigation and
analyzation of issues, but most of the real investigation is done by the inspector general's office because they have the team investigators to do so.
Next slide. Commission has
offered a variety of reports. Uh just recently in FEBRUARY, our
commission who has been doing a special investigation into
deputy gangs, we released a
report with 27 recommendations to the department to eradicate deputy gangs. We've also addressed issues of mental health evaluation to our mental
evaluation teams. Um and many of
our reports, uh, you can find on
our website we many of these efforts have also been done in conjunction and with the help of the office of inspector general,
including the monitoring of body worn cameras, the family assistance program and jail
conditions. Next slide. In addition to the recommendations that come directly from our
commission, we have staff who are currently monitoring the
issues that we bring to the
commission and those in our communities include the issue of
street takeovers, deputies and
health facilities, bail reform efforts, among other things.
Next slide. Our strategic priorities continue to adjust
with the cause of the community.
We, um usually have a strategic
plan, but we do adjust and adapt to the cause of the community and things that they would like
to bring issue to, um, like the
issue of deputies in school, which is a very complex issue
that we are working on right now, um, we recently had the o I g to present one of their
reports to the commission about
the disproportionality. Um that is happening in some of our
school districts in regards to school resource deputies, so it's an issue that the commissioner studying right now we also look into systematic
issues of the department related to hiring discipline and use of
force reform. Next slide. And we
do this work through our the
actions that are taken by the commission at our meetings, which are held monthly open to
the public in 2022. We also had
a series of seven special meetings to hear witness testimony about deputy gangs in the los angeles county sheriff's
department. At every meeting. We
have, uh, representative from
the o I. G s office, the office of inspector general, either mr huntsman himself or his chief
deputy, darryl williams. Um and they are usually able to speak to some of the complaints that the public has filed. Next
slide. We prioritize community
engagement. It's one of the ways that we determine how we're going to do our work and we work to ensure that the communities informed about our work through informational tables at various
events. We also host a variety of community meetings like town
halls and educational conferences to bring light to issues that the community has
shared concerns about. We also have our commissioners who, um, on an individual basis, they reach out and touch base where community members and various
groups. We also use our social social media to provide
announcement post our agendas, call for community feedback and promote reports that the commission has written. Next
slide. Our commission members and staff actively participate
in nicole, um. And our team this year, uh, will be involved in
four sessions. And this is
another way that we you know?
Engage in what's happening in this community. Um and we'll be
presenting as I said this year at nicole for sessions for our
office next slide. We also host
and annual community policing conference and collaboration with the human relations commission and the department of public health office of violence
prevention. We haven't had it for a couple of years due to
covid, but we do hope to reinstate it this year, and that
brings together um more law enforcement officials, activists , community members and local
leaders where we discussed the challenges and trends and future of community policing in the
county. Next slide. Mhm and you can visit our website or visit us on our social media at l. A
county coc or coc dot l. A
county. And that's it for me,
max. Hello I'm max huntsman on
the inspector general for los angeles county, and I'm not going to give an extensive presentation because I think daniel did a good job of presenting to you. How oversight
works in los angeles county. I
think not wildly. Unlike your commission. The inspector general's office, though, is more of an investigative body.
We do a variety of investigative
type activities ranging from what I would call monitoring where we go into jails and simply observe the conditions there. Speak to two prisoners in
the jail, speak to staff. And as well as the supplementary staff that you'll find in any jail,
medical, mental health and other
professionals. And so we so we to be aware there are issues
arising and address them
immediately. If we can we also do investigation based on information brought to our attention over the years we've done a lot of different kinds of work and in our jails are sheriff does more than just jails, but I know that's what's analogous to. What's your
sheriff does here? We did a number of investigations
relating to immigrant issues
when that was a particularly um
high profile issue because of conflict with the federal
government currently in l. A. That's less of an issue because we are not interacting with ice . But when we were we had to follow the provisions of
california law. Focus of our of our office, of course, is compliance with law. We also serve as the preah auditor of
prison rape elimination act. As
I'm sure you're aware, uh state
and local bodies need to come into compliance with those provisions for custody
operations. And so a multi year
multi decade process and we do
the auditing in order to assess the standard of the sheriff's
department in los angeles were not in compliance yet think not
too many places are but but we're working with the
department in that process, and then we do more systemic related matters. As daniel mentioned,
we've done statistical analyses
relating to discrimination or
dispirit impact on minority communities based on sheriff actions out in the street as
well as in custody, so that's the different kinds of work we've done. My office has
existed since 2013 ah, 2014
really, and we prior to that the
los angeles had a different version of oversight us. As daniel said civilian number site if you want to refer to the equivalent of what you are is pretty new in los angeles, but we've had some method of having the board of supervisors keep an eye on the conduct of the sheriff. As you know, that's required by the government code
and in recent years the law behind inspectors general has
become enhanced because of
problems in los angeles as well. Sacramento and other places there has been an expansion to inspector general powers providing for subpoena power.
And just recently sp two regarding certification of peace officers has granted us
additional authority. As well as daniel mitch, and there's a gang
issue in los angeles and we've been given authority under that
statute to investigate and are in the process of working on that. So the inspector general's office in los angeles serves many different functions. We
have 30 some staff actively
working we that includes lawyers , former peace officers,
accountants. Variety of
different sorts of skill sets
that allow us to analyze and collect information regarding
shares activities. We report
that out on our website or I g
dot l a county dot gov. If you want to look at it as reports we've done over the years
current and past and, uh that sort of summarizes our operation . In a nutshell. I realized what you're working on here is a would be a different thing
because you have a very
different terrain and every law enforcement agency it needs a different I think needs a different kind of oversight, depending on the circumstances surrounding it, because what it's all really about is essentially civilian control of the armed forces. You need to have folks without badges and
guns. Keeping an eye on how people with badges and guns
behave so that we remain a
democratic country, because if you pass laws, but then you don't enforce them in a democratic ways, and you don't
really have a democracy. I don't believe so what? The work that you're doing here and the work that danielle and the commission do down in los angeles, which we supplement through investigative
services. I think it is very,
very important and I'm happy to answer any questions anybody has about. Our process that might
help you with your process. Thank you very much. And I will
that your los angeles the los
angeles matter was one that supervisor walton look to and conferred with when he drafted
the charter amendment that
created the oversight board and our office of inspector general do members of the board have
questions? Yes um, first, I'd
like to say thank you so much.
Executive director butler of api as well as inspector general huntsman, I recognize that you are probably incredibly busy and we appreciate the time and effort that you've come in preparing the presentation and
being here with us today. Um so
we are in our process of hiring
r I g. This is a creation of our
new department. Um what are some of the initial challenges now in
reflection? 2020 hindsight that
you think you would advise us to
keep in mind of highlighting
when hiring and inspector general as well as creating this
department? How I guess I'll address that first. We must daniel has something else to
add. But obviously it's a lot of factors at play, and I think
each place is unique when you
reach out in trying to get any
kind of person to serve in any
capacity in government. Uh, you
need to find good people. So you gotta put enough money on the table. You got to make the job interesting so that people will want to come, which I think in this field means the person who
comes has to feel like they have a chance to make a difference. It's not just intellectually stimulating, but also the most
of the people in our fields want to improve law enforcement
functions? And they will come if they think they have a chance to do that. We're not generally a
group driven primarily by pay, although I think pay is important in order to get a long
term, stable relationship, so I think those are both important
independence is very important. You need somebody with the right
skill set for what? You what you want to do and what that skill set is. Tends very much on what
results you want. Um as a case
in point, I'm an odd example in
los angeles because there was a
prior process in place before me
that didn't function the way the carry valley wanted. I was brought in partly because I was
a corruption prosecutor and then our sheriff ended up putting me
under criminal investigation, and that was an important characteristic of mine that I
was able to stand up to that and continue on. Despite the
challenges we had that's unique
to los angeles and our situation. I hope I hope it's not something you face here and
you might seek a different skill set depending on what you're trying to accomplish, and I think it's important to have an independent person. A person with some kind of, um integrity
and sort of little bit of ah um
, willingness to do what they think is right, despite the
consequences, but that can take different forms. And then finally, I think having a good
staff is very important. You
need to look at what skill set the people you're going to have
working around this person are
what numbers they'll have, how
much they'll be paid again because it translates to especially when you're not talking about the top person who might come just you know,
because they want the challenge. Would you work into public
servants at a lower level? You kind of need to put a reasonable
amount of pay on the table. Otherwise, people will feel I'm
loved, I guess is the best way to put it not again. Not the public service are primarily about money, but but it's
important. So I think if you combine those things together, that's the main focus of what
you want to look for. Lot of
other issues. You're bound now by your charter provisions, but I think you need to consider what tools you give to the
people involved and what results you want to get. And then
finally, you all need to get to one sort of uniform place about
what you want to see if you don't agree, and you're fighting when you create the office. I guarantee you as time goes forward, you're going to fight over what happens with the office and that will be detrimental to getting a good
result. Thank you so much. Other questions. Yes, I have other questions. Thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it. Um I was just looking and this is not something that either of you had control over, but I was
looking at the makeup of that commission, and it doesn't seem to reflect the diversity of los
angeles on our particular board
. We have myself and, um board
member lubango representing the
api communities, um so I'm just
wondering, um, how you address the diversity issues and also in
san francisco. We have, um, a
language ordinance requiring interpreters and written
materials. Um for those who are not english proficient, and so I
wanted to see. From the inspector general side in terms
of the investigators. Um the
language, um, capabilities as well as on the commission side.
Thank you. Well, daniel, go
ahead. I'll go for the
commission. Um, I agree with
you, I think that that is an issue that we have been looking
at in terms of the community appointees. We have nine
commissioners five or board
appointed so each, um, member
gets an appointee. And then the community members. There is a
process and a procedure and we
have tried to refine that procedure so that we can do a
better job of making sure we uh , select we present to the
board. Community members that are diverse, including those
that are systems involved, or or
family members of those who are systems involved. We have another commission, the prohibition oversight commission , and they have that in their
ordinance, and their commission
is a little bit more reflective
of the diversity in los angeles. So that is something that our commission is continuing to work
on an address. And since daniel didn't cover all address the
language issue yes, that's
important. And in our public
hearings, I know the commission.
Works hard to communicate with the different groups that interact in los angeles like san francisco, we have a wide variety of different languages
spoken, so their staff work hard
at that. My staff also we communicate with whoever comes
to complain to us. And so we can use trans translators when necessary within the county of los angeles within government
service. We when we hire we hire within our civil service process
, so there's certainly um methods in place to try to ensure diversity. There are
also, uh preferential treatment given for skill sets, including
extra pay for second languages and whatnot. But it's always a challenge both in terms of the language issue and then also in terms of the representation, as daniel said, for the
commission's because the way
ours were structured, the desire
to have it be balanced in between what people might describe as throw police anti police, which I think is an incorrect way to look at it. But
it's a way a lens that people always do. It was very important
to establish different voices in terms of versatility, diversity separate from racial diversity or language. Diversity has
mentioned and I think that pushed a little bit initial
creation as daniel alluded to
some of the positions were appointed directly by individual supervisors, and so that caused
a breakdown that was similar to
the political landscape of los
angeles at the time, but not as good for making sure that you have a complete good mix of
diversity. And then a portion of that commission are appointed through a process that I think is a little better at that. But it's already behind the eight ball because you've got five selected to a different process
and then for selected through a more holistic process, so I
think it's a bit of a challenge.
And I hope that you all, um it when you get the opportunity with your commission to make any
changes you might make in the future. Consider that as as
something you can possibly
improved through the structures that you have in place of how you select commissioners. That's I think that's very important in terms of like I said with an inspector general's office aside
from the selecting the person that somebody who you think represents the viewpoints and diversity of your city, if you can't find an appropriate person hard to do in one person, but but if you can do that, that's
good. But then, of course within the staff as well, that's an important thing to keep an eye
on. But but it's hard in as I think anybody who's worked in government services would see.
And as I say, a lot of our reports deal with racial disparities and so we always
find them cropping up even when people are well meaning they
don't always succeed. And then I had one other question on
budgetary. Um and I dare I say budgetary constraints now, I think statewide and as well as
every 58 counties in california
, we're facing a budget crisis,
so I guess more well, maybe for
the both of you, um in terms of just establishing an office from scratched. What are the priorities given, um, a tight
budget. I don't know again. I'll
jump in on this, and daniel can add in my created or office or
at least I was present when it was created. I didn't get to just do it myself. And one thing I would recommend is whatever pile of money you've got. You're going to want to have lots of people in your office. So you're going to say oh, let's let's
lower the pay and have more people and I strongly recommend against that. I think you're going to find over time that you
need qualified skilled people, and that means paying more. So
whatever pile of money. You
decide you're going to devote to this problem. I suggest that you
try to make it a slightly smaller number of people who were paid more because you'll get a higher skill set there. Exceptions to that. There's a process and inspection process
where you can work with. A different skill set, but but for
a lot of the analysis work that is really critical to this. And even when you're talking about just inspections you ultimately
need to analyze and then present to the public or to a commission
or board. Uh findings and
conclusions you really knew need skilled people for that, so of course, it's hard and budgets
are tight. But if you want to actually have oversight rather than what has been euphemistically called oversight theater when we go through the motions, but we're not really
making a difference. Uh you get it costs money, which is, I think why it's such a challenge.
So many places in los angeles is
very fortunate in a way that were so large so we can have different parts of this puzzle
operating in a way that's cost
effective. When you're smaller
as san francisco is, I realize it's more of a challenge, and I
don't really have a solution for making money grow on trees.
Unfortunately, thank you. I have
a few questions. Um ah, director
, executive director daniel vap e. Thank you so much for your
time and including matt hunter hunts. Max huntsman. Director
general. Um, first off. I just
wanted to say that I, uh, definitely admire the, uh,
working effort that you're board
has done so far since 2016. It's amazing the fact that you guys
have your community outreach and your strategic priorities and ad
hoc committees all pretty much
lined up. Um just living here in
san francisco. I know I can easily find out what your team
has worked on what policies have been passed and haven't passed
so just kudos to your team. Um
the few questions that I had was one. How did you solicit community outreach with the inspector general hiring
process? And then second, um.
And I realized that will need to hire an inspector general for
this happened. But do you guys request does aboard request
that's from the inspector general team. Like what kind of
complaints come into the, um to
their team, and how do they kind
of filter through that? And then the last one is more logistical . It's really just about the tech piece, but I'll save that one after the first to have been
answered. I'm going to throw it to max. Because next doesn't work under our office. I'm sorry , mr huntsman doesn't work under
our office. Uh they are a
separate division under the executive office of the board.
So mr huntsman does not report
to me. Okay we were so we're set up a little bit differently than your than you guys intend to be
set up. The inspector general is
its own body are civilian oversight commission is its own
body. Um, we work very closely
together, but we are separate. And so we didn't. We don't have any control over their hiring or the hiring of the inspector
general would hire max again, but so I'll throw that question
to him. And uh, they hired me when they created the office,
and they haven't had a chance to hire money anybody else yet? So we'll find out how good they are getting community input when
they get around to that, so it's a challenge and it's a it's a problem. It's certainly been a problem with selecting
commissioners, danielle is now has replaced a executive
director who moved out and is in that place and they're going
through a process of deciding long term who they're going to have as the inspector excuse me, the executive director, and as
far as I know, there hasn't been a lot of community input into that. I think a little bit. I think there's been some reaching out and getting information. But the process isn't built to really allow that because I can't speak for san francisco but in los angeles we have a little as I mentioned. We have a lot of civil service rules, a lot of rules about the hiring process and because we are such
a large bureaucracy with, um at will leaders on top of it, that
a lot of the way we hire the
leadership is set. By the way we
hire our general, um, workforce
and so it's not the wide open community involvement kind of
process, which I think we often
think could be better for certainly for a commission where you're trying to interact with
the public. And as daniel mentioned, we have a strong desire for more justice
involved, um commissioners. But but that didn't happen when the civilian oversight commission was created, and there's reasons
why it would be a challenge as I'm sure you're aware and the work you do. We recently created a probation oversight commission . More recently, I should say
not too recently and in that one. We have more justice involved people, I think,
because the board of supervisors became more comfortable with the things you're talking about the involvement of the public and in a selection process. The
involvement of people who have had negative experiences with law enforcement in the process of overseeing law enforcement,
so it's I think there's been a broadening of the sort of vision of how it can be done over time. But when I was hired there was no public input to speak up.
There was a firm that did some search and couldn't find anybody
and then the special counsel to
the board. In some of the scandals. We had kind of reached out and found different people, and then the board did it themselves. And that tends to be
how hiring is done in los angeles county for the top level
positions, so I wish it was the
way you say, but it is not that way and I don't think it will become that way anytime soon. I forgot the other question,
though. Oh yeah. The other
question was. Well maybe this is , um you guys just clarified
this, but it seems like your team works in parallel, but you guys don't report into each
other. So as I understand it the strategic priorities. The board, um, creates those separately
from your office. Um. Mr
huntsman? Yeah that that was the board, of course, runs the county and we both daniel and I
both work in the executive office, which reports straight to the board. So the board is our boss in theory, but when your boss is five people and they have to meet publicly to
vote, they don't give you a lot of specific direction, so my office operates very independently. We have a set of,
uh goals and criteria that that we follow that was set by the
board. And we do, uh, the bidding of the board when they when they tell us what they want, so they'll they'll issue emotions sometimes and say, do a
report on this and we will and the commission as well. We'll say, hey, we want to investigate laws, enforcement gangs or whatever issue and ask us to do that, and we do it. On paper.
They supervise us as to the work
we do, but in function, we're pretty independent and there it's more like there are
customer than our boss, and it's kind of the same way with the board as well. Although they are our boss. It's more of like a
customer relationship where we seek to give them what they're looking for again because of the fact that there are brown act
body with five members. Who meet revoting. You want to keep them all happy rather than one
individual board and so you try to provide all the information they want. So you ask about statistics and information? Yes
we do a quarterly report. And if you want to know about that you
can look on our website and you'll see our quarterly reports and you'll see the kind of information that's in there. If you look back to close to 10 years ago when we started doing
it not the same information, and
that's in large part because of feedback. We've gotten from board offices about what they want to see your feedback from the commission about what they
want to see or feedback from the public about questions they have will issue a report. A bunch of questions will come in, and so we'll supplement it with additional information in the
next report. Nice thank you so much. So not exactly apples to apples, but maybe like apples to
oranges. Um, okay. Last piece was more logistical. But the
tech piece who the website and like the facebook pages and all
of that. Is that currently like
one of your board members. Are they in charge of that? Or is that something that you guys
hired like? Did you guys hire a
staff member to kind of um I don't know, like create those
websites at the commission. We
have, um eight staff members and one of our staff members is our
community information officer and she handles our
communications, which would be
all of our social media
promoting all of our. You know, meetings and community town
halls, our entire staff, though we reach out to community
members who know certain staff just might have a contact with certain community based
organizations, so we send those
out. I also send out um if I to max's point earlier. If we communicate with the board, it's usually through one of their deputies. So I usually when we're promoting something, or
we're gonna have a meeting, I send that out to one of their deputies and ask that they send it to their network. But in our office, we have one person who
does that, um, because they do all of our communication, which means anything that we send out
kind of runs by them. Um there,
you know, as active as they could be on our social media, I think, um, as you mentioned budget, I think is if the budget was expanded, we would probably
that would be one of the things where we would seek additional personnel so that we were able to reach out to the community
more. Thank you. Yeah no. Um,
thank you for that. Um so first and foremost want to say thank
you again director butler of ap
and, um, I g huntsman for being here and taking time with us today. This has been very thorough and I think very helpful for myself and our members as we continue to go through the process and one of the things that I was thinking about, and I g huntsman, you
kind of brought it up. Especially as we're talking about budget. We know that there's strategy and advocating that takes place for that. But being this body, there are some things that we can control. And so my question is just right
around the process on how you guys came up with the ad hoc
committees that you guys have. It's like as a commission are there ones that we should be thinking about as we're bringing on an I g. That could help strengthen the infrastructure. Once the I g is here that we need to be looking at more so than others as we continue to prioritize some of the things
that we're doing as a commission, so it was kind of the process for these committees
that you guys have I think when
, um our commission usually
meets at the end of the year. We
sort of review. The work that
we've done and we look at what's what, you know what's happening. What's going to be ongoing
issues. We need to follow more
closely. We usually look at some of the inspector general's reports to see if there are things in places we want to
review and then we usually the ad hoc come up as our meetings. Something comes up at our meeting. One of the
commissioners decides they want
to do emotion about it, or they want to look into it. Then we
form an ad hoc, obviously with less than a quorum, so for us that's usually for members or
less. And then and then those
bodies get to work and like for something like deputy gangs,
it's been ongoing for a while because the deputy gangs have been ongoing for a while. Other
at hoxby form and then they MAY
, um after we look into the
issue, and they do a report about it, we do a report about it, or we do recommendations to the border. The department than
that, uh, at high committee would disperse, but it's usually
based on what's going on with the department or what we hear
from the community as concerns
so another ongoing one is use of force because unfortunately, that remains a problem in the
department. So um, that
committee usually follow some some of the use of force incidents that we hear about the news. Get more information either from the I g or the department directly, so that's
how we form the adcox. And they change over time. Yeah. Okay.
Thank you. Other questions from
members of the board. So I just have one. I think final question. I know you talked a
little bit about um the
attributes we should be looking for, given the fact that our inspector general is going to be creating an agency that does not
exist. There will be staffed. I think, with seven investigators
to supervising investigators, analysts and at least one
attorney and support staff. Um
other particular experiences or qualifications that you think we should be looking for. For
someone who will be becoming our first inspector general and
creating this agency. I must.
Daniel MAY wanna she might be more objective about this, so you might want to ask her, but
I'll say kind of the same answer I gave before it depends on what
you want. Um I have been at this
job for 10 years and I have come
to value management experience and knowledge much more than I
did 10 years ago. So if you would ask me this question when
I first began, I'd say now you what you need is somebody who has the skill set and the drive
to do the work. And I think when , when I was hired, I didn't
have any staff and your person might might or might not have staff up front and that's kind of important. We were much smaller organization than even
even when I had a staff, so you
need your your boss to be able to do the work as well as
supervised now that my place is bigger and I have a management
team. I wish I was a better manager. I wish I had the skill
set different than the skill set that was critical to get me through in the beginning. Maybe I've learned as I've gone along, but it's you know, it's a hard thing to do. So I would say you've got to kind of balance those two interests. One is having a subject matter expert with a skill set that's going to
allow them to do the work you
want them to do. I can't speak to what happens in san francisco, but I can tell you in california in general and in l a. In particular we have horrible problems with overcrowding. Problems with delivery of services to prisoners. Horrible problems with the prison rape, eliminate
nation act compliance. We've had
nasty, uh, fights from our sheriff's department regarding us just doing our job and we're
not the only county that's had
that that takes a certain sort of person and skill set to address if you didn't have those challenges as much if it wasn't about the expertise, then you
might want an experienced
bureaucratic kind of leader who was comfortable with people
working together in organizing.
My personal feeling. Is that for
the work the way you describe your office, you need somebody with a lot of subject matter
expertise. But if you can get both the subject matter, expertise and a smooth talking person who knows how to get along with everybody and get
their staff to work effectively and fill out performance evaluation sometime and do other things that bureaucrats have to
do. Then you're doing very well . And I think both those things
are important. Hmm but it's hard
because they often conflict. And so you know, I don't have a
magic bullet for how to make them both work. But danielle, who has a different sort of
viewpoint on some of these things, because of her experiences might might be able to give you some better advice. No max. I actually agree with
you. I was going to say, I think you need someone who can do both. Because I don't think just
subject matter expertise alone. Um, is what you need for someone who needs to be in that leadership position. I think I think subject matter. Expertise
is great. But I do think you need someone who can be a manager and not just, uh, not
just, um someone who knows all about it, but unable to handle their team. So I would agree
that you need someone who has
both. Okay, that's that's very
helpful. So then, over the questions well, thank you again so much. We very much appreciate
your time and your insight and your sharing your knowledge and perspective with us. And, uh,
thank you. Absolutely thank you for having us. Thank you for the time and good luck. Because good
luck.
I think we. I think we now have a presentation by dhr. According
to the agenda. Did you? Did you
do public comment or is going to need to vote public comment
about this? Separately about the
d h. R p s. I didn't mean to interrupt. Sorry about that.
Yeah. I apologize, guys. No problem moving into the closed
session without good afternoon board members, paul green from the department of human resources here of my colleague ben richie. Ben will get into
specifics regarding the status of the inspector general recruitment, but I just wanted to publicly acknowledge all the effort is put into secure the
vendor contract to get the job announcement posted on the various organizations that this
board members identified. There was a lot of administrative hurdles to accomplish that. So I just wanted to congratulate ben
again that done but also at previous meetings, we had discussed individual outreach efforts. Some of the board
members MAY conduct regarding identifying possible candidates. And so I just wanted to follow
up, if you know, in order not to duplicate it efforts. If you have any documentation, or does any candidates you wanted us specifically to follow up with
the help submit applications. You cannot give that information to your commission secretary and
we're happy to add those two are files into any follow up that is necessary. And with that, I will
turn it over to my colleague, mr
ritchie. Good afternoon board members. My name is benjamin ricci. I'm a senior human resources consultant with the
department of human resources. For the inspector general recruitment. It is currently
posted online on our website. We are accepting applicants. A
current closing date is JUNE
10th. As paul mentioned, we did complete the posting of the
announcement on a variety of
websites suggested to us by the board members. Those announcements are posted. We are continuing to receive
applicants. They are coming in
on a regular basis, and as I mentioned, the announcement will
be closing on JUNE 10th, at which point we will review the applicants that we've received and I believe our next steps
after that, or to prepare lists of qualified and best qualified applicants for presentation to
the board for review.
approximately how many applicants are there? Do we have
a general estimate number? I think we're in double digits around 30 or so applicants.
Thank you. Board members have
questions. Um I just wanted to
say thank you so much for making everything seamless and very comprehensive and I know,
especially with the vendor that
required payments on some of the websites. That was a big
challenge. Um, since no one's done it before, so I really
appreciate it. It was my understanding that it might be
extended. Possibly, um passed the 10th if necessary. Is that correct? That's at the discretion of the board and then
in terms of ramping up for the
second phase, um how do you anticipate that we do that, especially with the written questions? Um, that would be
around. So after we identify the candidates that meet the minimum qualifications, we can present those candidates information applications to the board, and
from there, we can arrange questions that you MAY wish to
submit to them in writing for them to respond in writing. Um
so I would encourage you to work on those developing those now ahead of time, so we were ready to go. We can send those out and we're happy to review those
questions ahead of time and answer any questions you MAY have or provide feedback on that process. So yeah, but if we need to extend the announcement based on the number of qualified applicants that you know that would be pushed out a little bit further. But yeah. Thank you. And then I just wanted to
highlight two my colleagues here
that we do have the timeline and task benchmarks that I had
prepared and then from d h. R.
Um, they were find that the timeline specifically for the I
g hiring, so I just want to
highlight that for everyone, so thank you so much for that. And thank you, commissioner for
preparing that. So, um. The
places where the job was originally posted. I think original list of the deadline is
in MAY have has. Oh didn't change to show that its applications are still being
accepted. Yes, the current posting that's live on our
website does not have, uh, does not have we remove that MAY due
date and so there is the due dates not posted on the website.
Currently I'm talking about some of the other websites, some of the other professional
organizations. Um I believe they're all updated. We did
catch one and asked them to update that announcement. The other ones. I believe they were , uh, the updated announcement
is posted. I know the
announcement just went up a day
or two ago on the nicole website , and that would have
erroneously says applications accepted until position is filled rather than giving a
specific date, so I think it would be worthwhile to extend it
so that and get that fixed. So it does list the specific date because I think that's where
we're likely to get a large number of applications. From people in the oversight
community. I think the only question I had was, if we think that there's a possibility that
we might want and or need an
extension from the dhr side, do we think that we would be able to clear those hurdles that
maybe we're in the beginning that we're already kind of forecasting and thinking about if we potentially do need to
push things out. Yes I think it would go much faster this time. I'm just I'm specifically speaking like on the vendor side, right if we had to pay an additional month to get keep
things. Yeah, I mean, there will be, I assume will be additional fees if we have to post it
longer, but the vendors already been secured now and that was the major roadblock, so it
should be a lot faster. And just to add when we moved to close session, you'll have a more specific update on the number of qualified applicants, and that will help lead the discussion if
the extended or not. And so if
we do want to extend the
deadline do we need to take a vote on that. Is that what you're saying? Yeah ok, you're
city attorney. Have a question.
Maybe this is more so for julie for the timeline for JULY, noticing the additional 20 hours
of training is that required or is that kind of optional
depending on we originally when
we were on board? I understood that we were gonna get 80 outers 80 hours of training, so we were
only trained for 20 hours, and that was what was available in
the budget. So um, I expect that we're going to have ongoing training. So that's just why I
put it in there because we hadn't had training in a while.
It's been a year over a year. Alright okay, that's not related
to the shares. The timeline that
I put was just overview of what we should be doing at as a board . I think for the entire year and to remind us that we have our quarterly reports. Annual
reports got it. Got it. Um, the shorter one was specifically to hiring the I g and refined by,
um the human resources department. This is very helpful. Thank you. Yes I know you would ask for it from day
one. So that's so hopefully from I think our FEBRUARY meeting.
Yeah thank you. The sheriff's department communicated anything
to us about additional training. So I guess one other question
and this is sort of cart before
the horse in terms of staffing,
say investigators. Uh huh. Is civil service. Still about a
year out. I know that the civil service commission has been trying to streamline the process, so it doesn't take a
year to onboard somebody. No, I
mean it's always been less than
a year just but yes, there's a lot of rules changes in progress right now, and we've already seen reductions in the amount of time to hire. Those efforts are ongoing and continue, and we hope it will be far less than
that. I think I don't want to predict how long it would take.
But no, it will not take that long. If someone's already in civil service, obviously a shorter time, um, when they're
playing alright, correct. They don't have to start transfer.
There's various mechanisms. Big
and who would be, um, drafting the civil service job description for the investigator ? Positions would the inspector general be playing a role in
that with dhr primarily be doing
that if it doesn't I believe their existing classifications already is that correct? Time all the classifications exist, so we already have the class descriptions. Um the inspector general could review them, and
if there's changes that need to be made, they would work with our class, incompetent and compensation and division at the hr to amend the classification specs, and then they could be
posted in adopted and they would be used to for the job announcements. Are you talking about the classification respects for classification. 81
24, investigator for d p a.
Yeah, plenty. Uh so the 1 24
classifications existing. Um, I
believe that is the class that's in the budget for the department . So but as paul mentioned the
inspector general feels that there need to be changes to the classification or if there needs to be a different classification. Then that process we go through dhr and we
would work with them too. Help with those help those
amendments. Okay, thank you. Um
I have one last question. So
maybe this is after we hire the inspector general, but, um, is
there like a budget break out of
the supporting staff. That included with MISS That tomorrow, okay? You know? Look
for it. Thank you. So we're ready for public
comment on this agenda item. Discussion of the emails. Did
you want to? Oh, email. Any discussion on the two emails
were received from um, mr
huntsman and MISS Alice. Okay?
Um, also, there was. Did anyone want to discuss it? He broke community meetings in the
upcoming JUNE community meeting. You're just announced the date time and location of the JUNE
8th meeting JUNE the JUNE meeting will be at glide
memorial on JUNE 8th from six pm
to eight pm thank you. And if there's no further discussion for members of the public who would like to make public comment for line item three. If you are present, please line up
at the podium otherwise, for those watching remotely, please
call the general number and use the access code appearing on your screen and follow the prompts to be added to the
queue. The inspector general. Is that a permanent position? Civil
service.
We have one caller calling in
remotely. Good afternoon collar.
You have two minutes.
My name is francisco decosta. And I'm very interested in this
issue. I have given my comments
before. And what I feel is that
we need to do a deep
investigation. Into our jails.
Um. We have a very primitive
jail system. We have to do like dead investigation into ourselves. Francisco police
department. To the gap of their
workforce. And what is happening
over there? And I think we shouldn't be because we can
listen to lots. Angeles has a
population of 4 million. We have
a population of 820,000. And if
we go the route of putting too
much emphasis. An area that has
a very large population. And
it's very close. To mexico with all those things happening MARCH as we have on at the small
scale. We will marry the waters.
and I think that those are few.
Well. Send it on this board.
Have to focus on empirical data.
And expertise, real expertise.
But that work with the inspector
general. I have lost enforcement
experience. And I know what I've document about. Thank you very
much. Thank you, caller.
The next item on the agenda.
Calling line item for public
comment on closed session public common and all matters pertaining to line item six. Closed session, including comment. Public comment online
item five vote on whether they
hold items six in closed session for members of the public who would like to make public
comment for lying on them before you are present. Please line up at the podium. Otherwise please call the general number and use the access code appearing on your screen and follow the prompts to be added to the
queue. There appears to be no
public comment. Calling line
item five vote in closed session
action item. Vote on whether to hold items six and closed session, including vote on
whether to assert I'm sorry. Vote on whether to hold items
six and closed session. Do we
pay public comment first? Um I think you already did prior
item. Is there a motion to hold
the closed session? Because I just had a point of order, usually on closed session. There's some at least line item, whether it's a personnel issue or something else. And so there's nothing to really guide
the public to comment on. So
what's required is that you list
the position and what, basically
a description of it. It probably would have been better to have
it, say personnel. Matter, but that's what the item is. Yeah okay. Well, I feel like we
should state it because if it's unclear would be unclear to the public to make any kind of
comment. So vote on closed session. The closed session
items will be for personnel
matters.
Is there a motion to have the
closed session. I'll move that we go to close session, okay?
Second second thank you. We'll
take the vote on the motion.

anger is I remember bruckner. There is I, vice PRESIDENT.
Carry on. Carry on is I member
sue. So as I PRESIDENT, director
I. The motion passes. That closed session will not be disclosed to the public. And
next dynamite on the agenda, please line item eight coordinator early report to the sheriff and the board of supervisors, discussion and
possible actual item. Discuss s
d o b evaluations and outreach during the first quarter of
2023. Do we have any discussion
or motions? I just want to express to the public. I regret
for having to cancel some of the public meetings. Um and just remind them that we always
welcome comments through our emails or through our calls at
our regular meetings. Hmm. And to emphasize again, um are JUNE
8th meeting with glide memorial.
What's the action item on this? This is the core to report to the sheriff. The board of supervisors stand out in your
packet. Hmm. Is there any of this further discussion or emotions? 10. What
is the motion? It hasn't been that you mentioned any further
discussion or motion. So was it the past quarterly report that
was made or a future one. It's
the JANUARY 1 2023 through MARCH 31 2023 quarterly report. Be
sent to the board. To be sent to
the board. Did we get another
copy of it or was was that from
what we had in the past? Should be in the packet. That's the
last pitch. Sorry. Sorry I was looking. I had looked at one in
the past. There you go. It's in.
It's in the back.
Oh, here.
Thank you. I don't. I don't know if we needed to mention anything
about the budget, that's all. It was the emotion on this agenda item. I just feel like we need
to just um, include include your
your budget. That presentation.
I think our budget presentation was in the it wasn't in the
first three quarters. What's on it, or you made the presentation just a couple of weeks ago,
right? I guess you're right. I guess you're right. You're preparing it. Although, although
I was going to say, um. I still think you know stuff with nicole
armstrong helped us with and preparing for the budget. I
think that was essential. Just that we can we thoroughly considered budget items in and
setting up a fresh office. And high and highlighted budget
because in your presentation, we highlighted budget items that hadn't been previously anticipated. I think that's
really important to highlight. I'll make a motion that we
approve the quarterly report.
Second we asked. I think I want to include that budget park.
Yeah I mean, I'm happy to do it.
I mean, if we send them out
quarterly, it could also be, but it was important to have it in the past quarter because that's
how it got to be moved forward in his presentation was given it was it was given in. I want to
say, OCTOBER NOVEMBER the first is the JANUARY 1st. It was
OCTOBER number would not support us and the charter states that
the of the quarter reports. Um
regarding sd obi evaluations and
outreach and, oh, I g reports
submitted to the s d o b. So those are the only things that it's asking for in the quarterly
report. I think the two evaluations that fall under your
guy's powers and duties, are it
uh huh. 4.137 b two and three um , evaluate the work of the org which the person's or that
entity is not set up yet and then compile, evaluate and recommend law enforcement,
custodial and best and patrol best practices. I think those are the only evaluations that are fall under your duties.
Yeah. So. I'm just pointing that
out now. I'm okay. Okay? We'll
take the vote on the motion to approve the public comment. 1st
2nd. Yeah, I second it okay?
Public public comment for members of the public who would
like to make public comment for
line item eight of your present, please line up at the podium. Otherwise please call the general number and use the access code appearing on your screen and follow the prompts to
be added to the queue. There
appears to be no public comment.
So we'll take them vote for mine item eight to accept the quarterly report. Remember, I
feel hot mango. Bye. I feel like
I'm angle is I remember bruckner director is I vice PRESIDENT
Carry on. Carry on his eye
member su I su as I PRESIDENT,
rector. What there is I
mentioned passes. Calling line item. Nine future agenda items.
Discussion item. So I would like
to, uh, for the future. The
next, um presentation from the sheriff's that we had moved from
today to give us the kind of
discussion that we had for the inventory that we had requested
to the next meeting. In addition , it is common practice for commissions to take a summer like a month off during the
summer. Um and I think that
given our efforts to hold
community meetings and having some scheduling conflicts that then resulted in that a counseling. I think that we
should discuss. Um whether this board wants to take one month
off, and if so, which month? Would that be given the work
that we're doing? I have a
preference for, um AUGUST. Just because of the first, you know, traditionally, AUGUST AUGUST, okay, well, I mean, just because
my kid is in summer break something that we put on the future for next agenda exactly exactly for the next agenda. Um but that's something just to
highlight for y'all to discuss. Because if we wanted to do it
earlier than we'd have to vote now for JULY, I think, and I think it's yes, it's important. And then, um want to bring another, it might happen. It happens generally in AUGUST, but there's also nationally night out, so there's some community things that I think that we
should be, um engaged in at
least so I'm looking to you for
member off. Oh mongo, um so that we could go go out and do those
things and so we can put in a request with the sheriff's
office to also highlight some of the community events that we can
go out to. And I think, um, city attorney if it's purely social,
and we don't discuss any business. We doesn't matter if there's a quorum out there doing
the social thing correct. Um I
think that's right. I have the good government guide here, and
I'm tired, but yeah, that's right. I will look at it while
you were continuing to discuss and if I'm wrong, I will correct myself. Yeah friendly reminder to everyone that pride it is
JUNE it is pride months. Yes so hopefully we'll we'll all be out there in community celebrating
and when is national night out?
Um it usually happens in AUGUST,
but then there's also specific ones in san francisco in
different districts, and I know
the big chinatown. One happens
in, um, SEPTEMBER. Also, um, I think something to think about
um. Well actually, we might even invite them to the glide
meeting. So dan maybe we contact
um, director cheryl evans davis , but with the human rights
commission during that, um during the presentation that we had, I was reminded that maybe we should include the human rights commission and possibly the youth commission to give us some input. On an inspector general and then conditions
with, um incarceration. Um and
then I think also. Down the road coordinating or or getting reports from probation and
parole. So just to interject
about the social gathering, so
um in attendance of the majority
of the members of a policy body to social ceremonial
recreational gathering is not a meeting. If it's not sponsored for you guys and you refrain from discussing the business of the body at that, at the gathering things like meetings of other policy bodies, that's a
little bit more complicated, and but that's talked about in the good government guide. If you guys ever have questions about that, obviously, you can ask me
but it's like around page 1 35 in the good government guy. Thank you. Thank you. That's it
for me. Do we need to discuss? I know it was a line item about
the mandatory training that the 20 hour training. We just need
to finish it before JULY. Or is
there? No, we didn't. I just happened to put it in there
because we hadn't had, but it's
not a mandatory fixed deadline. That's that's another budgetary issue, but I think it would be
good if we got some more ongoing training. But that's also why I
even put just hearing from, uh
from probation and parole. Um just how things dovetail in terms of services. Um, I think that's a that's something that we need to be better informed
about. Yeah. I don't think you have to repeat the training. Is
that what you're? I'm just looking at the 80 hours and we
only got 20 hours so basically, we want more training, okay, that's different. And it was, I think, yeah, I think the outline
was already MAY remember that. I
just wanted to make sure you because it says you're supposed
to do. I'm looking at the charter to be trained within the first night within 90 days of your first term, which I read that I think there's a fair read that you don't have to repeat it for your second term. Third term ongoing understand. Now you're asking about something different or you're talking about something different. I think we're talking about supplemental training. That's not even supplement. We didn't finish our initial 80 hours. That was anticipated that we would have
and the whole outline. Yeah. I think if we're going to hear
from probation, we might also want to hear from the public
defender's office to hear their
perspective. On things. Well, yeah, I mean, I just said probation and parole because that's that's sort of dovetails into the sheriff's work, so
yeah, yeah. Maybe we could have all three of them presented one meeting to give the varying perspectives. Is that considered
training if they come and do their presentation, or is that?
No right then? That's yeah. Um. All the other boards and commissions do receive ongoing
training after meetings. So that
the charter says that sheriff and the sheriff's designee shall prescribe the content of intel
administer the training, so that doesn't mean you can have other training. But right, right? Yeah. Thank you for looking that
up. Any other, um, future agenda items that people would like to
see. I think I think down the
road really, to have community meetings that that we didn't have for the particular districts, but also coordinating
better with, um the supervisor's
office is to have them engaged. And then emphasized to them that it's their constituents. We want
to reach. And then dan, if you
want to do the chinatown ones and have language interpreters,
I can help you with that.
Next item on the agenda. Ok so for members of comment on that, yes, that's general public comments are members of the public who would like to make
public comment for line item nine. If you are present, please line up the podium. Otherwise
please call the general number and use the access code appearing on your screen and follow the prompts to be added

public. Come in on online. Good afternoon collar. You have two
minutes. But I would like to bring to your attention is that
we need to have. Hearing with
you commissioners. On how we
proposed. Two. Address the
situation. The 88. It looked as if you haven't been to 8 50
bryant. It's despicable. So with all the talk about inspector
general and you know the details
about meetings and whatever. There are thousands of people
over the years. That have been
suffering because of the. The dirty situation switch flowing
all over the place. And you're a
nonchalant about this situation.
So I think we need to have a hearing so that you can hear
from the people. At city hall.
Rather than a seven o'clock and eight oclock in the night in the
tender line, and that baby opera house nobody's going to go
there. People are not stupid.
Nobody guarantees that security. We're going to have this hearing
at city hall. That's what you
all the commissioners so that.
Find out exactly what you have in mind to have this inspector
general if you're really care
about rehabilitation. You've got
clowns before. Care about the
PRESIDENT. We had to fight so
that um, they could get rid of the belt situation. And jeff
adachi was dead. And talking
about the shine apartment. I need order to really get them on
board. And make them have some
empathy. You guys have to do
something. You know? Thank you.

2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,"wonderful, thank you.
Imented to talk about the press
I went through being selected as the [Inaudible] Oak lands.
Some of the knowledge and leadership I think is important
when selecting an inspector
general [Inaudible].
[Echo, muffled [ Words breaking up].
The office of the inspector general here with the [Inaudible] To where there were
3 interviews 2 of those
interviews were with the -- the
commission go through a national
search and through candidate
[Inaudible].
Inspector general background the
oversight background nationally.
2 of the interviews were
[Inaudible] Public.
And then the last where the
public forum I went head and put
the public forum notification
for members of the public to
view.
[Inaudible] Candaceidates I think [Inaudible].
The police [Inaudible].
[Choppy] Sum row regarding the settlement [Inaudible]. So that prompted -- to explain about, prior to the [Inaudible]. In the city of oakland and --  issue and concerns -- to identify were not [Inaudible] MISS Phillips it is hard to hear
like parts of words are dropping off.
So I don't know if this is your microponent we are not hearing
everything you are saying."
2023-04-07,"I don't know.
Let me -- approximate is it better? Speaking too quickly should I [Inaudible] Or it is choppy?"
2023-04-07,"I think it is choppy.
I don't know [Inaudible].
Sfgovtv says she turns off her camera it might help.
Why okay, I will do that. [Inaudible]. We do appreciate you going out
of your way and taking time from
your schedule to be here with us so, thank you."
2023-04-07,"no worries. Thank you.
Is this a bit better."
2023-04-07,"fabulous.
Thank you. Deliverables that was asked during the press we were asked to provide an organizational
chart that we thought would be feasible.
To help the office of inspector
general move forward."
2023-04-07,"now MISS Phillips you said
there was I first deliverable I
did not hear good had that first deliverable was.
A one page sum row but I'm not
sure what can you reiterate that, please."
2023-04-07,"yes, ma'am.
So the one page deliverable was
specific to the state of policing.
This video opened and everyone
negotiated the settlement
agreement for 20 years our first
was I one page sum row regarding
what we thought were the challenges regarding the
[Inaudible] In the city of
oakland and [Inaudible] In
police [Inaudible] You have 100%
compliance with [Inaudible].
The second deliverable was organizational chart accompanied boy a plan.
When our vision was, what our
mission will potential low be
regarding account at and
transparency in the office
inspector yes or no and how we
are implementing that [Inaudible].
We wanted to provide to the commission with this
[Inaudible].
Mystery feedback that I have given to the police commission
during that process and love to give [Inaudible] Intentional
about the questions if you elect a public firm.
In of the questions had to do
broadly [Inaudible] And would
have been more important not
only [Inaudible] In your
[Inaudible] As to how we would
implement and stand up in office
in san francisco which for my
position was not a let of the questions were broad about
general [Inaudible]. So.
That's [Inaudible] A lot of the members of the public could not
understands when you would bring
to our jurisdiction here in oak
[Inaudible] [Choppy] Approximate
community [Inaudible].
I would [Inaudible] Transport knowledge and vision.
What policy is important in the
inspector general position is
[Inaudible] It is amaze thering
is already a model in san
francisco the department of
police accountability.
Already came [Inaudible] You have the several [Inaudible]
That gives leadership you don't have to start everything from the grounds up.
There has to be a level of awe ton mow and independence regarding your mission and
vision and making sure it is in
line with the sheriff's
oversight board and establishing
a good working rep with the
sheriff as well as the city
stake holders went sheriff's department and the city.
Confidence and oversight, knowledge is also extremely important.
What this means is for the
residents of san francisco,
[Inaudible] Being the sheriff's
department is very [Inaudible]
For the deputies working in
[Inaudible] Understanding the challenges in the interactions with the residents on the
outside as well as the
individuals inoccurserated on the inside. Relationships and transparency.
In showing the community is a
part of the process, the board
the commission, utilizing the
community input as well as now I
think a great platform in
allowing the community to have a
safe zone as this particular
organization [Inaudible] What --
sheriff oversight should
electric like if [Inaudible].
And I think upon 39 not only the
sheriff but and individuals this
are dealing with an interactive
[Inaudible] Approach and
listening [Inaudible] For a well
rounded [Inaudible].
I also think it is extremely important to have these
conversations early on with I candidate.
What investigative and audit stoorngd would they like to
adopt in their office of the inspector general.
It is important to provide
credibility to the work.
So there are things of course,
everyone knows [Inaudible] The
association of inspector's
general the initial association
of [Inaudible]. Investigations and auditing and then as I said to recruitment [Inaudible]. Was there a question? You dropped off toward the end it is heard to hear the last 3 words."
2023-04-07,"the association of inspector general [Inaudible]. as well which provides --  auditing and investigations roach and inspection and options
with the sheriff's department and [Inaudible].
Have knowledge of the standards
I think in -- but -- oversight
looks like and accountability.
I would also ask if they are
understanding the -- authority for the establishment -- of the
office of inspector general for
sheriff's department in san francisco. Understanding what governs your
authority and how you work that
is home work for anyone who is look to do this job.
The first thing you need to do is read.
What know governs are create
exclude how can be dismanualed.
That is our guiding principal
and your jurisdiction will meet
moving forward and appropriate direction. A question I thought was
[Inaudible] After the d. Police accountability accountability independent, are they sharing staff.
These are the questions I would have.
As a candidate I don't know if
they are questions that have been asked of the commission as of yet.
I think that is something
interesting because you have a [Inaudible] And oversight [Inaudible] And as it stands now
where will the office of inspector general have
[Inaudible] Becoming [Inaudible].
Have the same [Inaudible] As the
dpa and how will they work --
that suspect the role in the --
in the organizational --  organizational structure.
[Inaudible] There is
administrative work, a lot of
community work and a lot of
information such as expertise
should also be and -- the
inspector -- [Inaudible].
The reason I bring this up this
is one [Inaudible] I said they
gave me [Inaudible] [Cannot
understand speaker] I had no
funds for training, software or
hardware I'm [Inaudible] Helped
to put a robust [Inaudible] With
just be mindsful as you recruit
the plan is [Inaudible] Are
you -- colleges to recruit are
you using internal auditors.
There are several oversight
entities the counsel for inspector general.
There are places what is your
recruitment plans the
appropriate skill set. And professional development
plan is important as you are
building an [Inaudible].
I will make it quick.
Access to the [Inaudible] Or
will the sheriff -- upon request.
And if that -- there need to be
a policy established what that
looks like for formal requests.
From the office of inspector general to the sheriff's d.
Under the charter the office of
inspector general shall not be
[Inaudible].
I want to know if the commission
thought about conceptualizing exactly what law enforcement is
and are there positions talking about, sworn only or corrections.
Are we talking about investigators for the da's office as well."
2023-04-07,"and how can the inspector general be from their to suspicion.
with cause, without cause?
If it is with cause, hajustifies cause?
And how does the oig interact with the commission.
-- able to provide facts as
members of the community.
I just want to be a policy on
what that would look like or toed for thought how the
interaction would be I think you
are in great shape and have the
director there so you all have already thought about this.
I'm here for questions and I'm
sorry for the technical difficulty."
2023-04-07,"thank you, so much MS. Phillips.
Does the board have questions"
2023-04-07,"00 do.
Thank you MISS Phillips for being here this is member soo.
Grit to hear from you and you
object have a lot of depth with your experience.
So I think one thing that is
concerning for me is of excluding candidate who is had been employed by law enforcement
temperature is I broad category.
What do you see in terms of
impedaments from excluding those
types of possible candidates and explain what you think having
your experience as a department sheriff or probation officer brought to your understanding of
the job that you have today?"
2023-04-07,"great, questions, commissioner soo.
Thank you for the opportunity.
I do think it would limit the candidate pool.
I think that we could definitely
[Inaudible] That [Inaudible]. Individuals that sworn law enforcement or [Inaudible] Officers could potential low in
the state of california or
jurisdiction around an area, I
think that MAY help to widen your span.
I honestly I'm passionate about corrections work.
Behind the wall it helps mow to understand.
As well and understanding the
plight of what a sheriff will
[Inaudible] [Inaudible] That
techical assistance and seeing
the up side of how individuals
[Inaudible] Viewed that authority.
And being a void for individuals incarcerated. [Inaudible].
I think having the understanding
and this will give [Inaudible]
Working with [Inaudible] Is very
difficult [Choppy] It is heard when you have not heard
[Inaudible] And you have to let the experience not the only
experience there are amazing
practitioners this have no law enforcement experience.
That has to you have to invest in training. And professional development to
ensure there is understanding in
the comprehension.
And so finally could you make
your presentation available
through our secretary?"
2023-04-07,absolutely.
2023-04-07,"thank you, I appreciate it."
2023-04-07,"yes, ma'am."
2023-04-07,"other board members have
questions?
You were talking about how you
set upper your office and I sent
you materials including the
budget for the oig.
When areas do you feel inspector
general needs to as well
autonomy in terms of setting up is this new office.
Based on your experience
establishing your agency in oakland?"
2023-04-07,"I think important [Inaudible]
Understand the vision this you
have you all select candidates
and you have [Inaudible] Enough support and believe enough in this individual and when they
can bring to this position they
should have [Inaudible].
The office how they see fit with
and staffing of the office this
they -- [Inaudible] I think it
was a great start and then I
said I had I think [Inaudible]. Bringing that commitment and why
than I set up the office they way they want it mix them to
feel there is ownership of their
vision and structure and taught
me independence and important
they are being handcuffed for
electric of I word doing
something they don't have
interests [Inaudible]. Was?
The end of your last of the answer.
I think it is really [Inaudible]
Isn't the inspector general
should have a vision in the best interest of the city and county
of san francisco as well as ensure effective and efficient
civilian over site of the sheriff's department. So having the independence."
2023-04-07,"and can I ask you when you
were w nothing balmore how did
you learn about the job open nothing oakland?
The association of inspector's
general, posted openings.
So I don't know if you know much
about it there is a western state chapter of the association
of inspector's general in california.
In positions regarding
inspector's general they post
there the [Inaudible] Go to or
for certified inspector's
general, investigators, auditors
and a national organization of
similar of the broad are jurisdiction as [Inaudible].
That's where I heard about the position."
2023-04-07,"and how long did it take you
to decide to apply and submit
the application?
I was -- upward mobilitied in my
career I was ready to apply but
the actual process took 8 to 9 months.
They decided not to use
[Inaudible] And they did the
national search themselves.
So as you all know volunteer
your time is limited we
understood it a bit [Inaudible]
It took about 8-9 months from submitting my application to
actually getting an offer of employment.
I know you talked about the oakland police department being
under a federal consent decree and settlement agreement I assume you did research regarding that, which informed
you about a lot of the issues facing the oakland police department. Thankfully our sheriff's department is in the under consent decree. What information would a potential candidate want to know
about our sheriff's department?
So they could have I sense of

2023-04-07,"hi, michael patrellis fwen it was very difficult to understand when was being said
and trying to follow the closed
captioning was not better it was saying [Inaudible].
I want to suggest this um the
next time you have a
presentation of remote low that
before the meeting you do a
rehearsal with the presenter and
iron out the tech differences. Excuse meet tech problems.
You know I'm proudly low tech.
And um -- I have learned that
before getting on family zoom
calls that it is irrelevant to
my advantage to practice to
rehearse with my sister and it
irrelevant keeps things smooth.
So, please, in the future, do a rehearsal before the meeting. Thank you."
2023-04-07,"thank you. Why oh, by the way you are
going to make michelle philip's presentation visible on the web
so we can look at the slides
that she made, right?
Yo yes, that's correct."
2023-04-07,"and MS. Phillips thank you
for crediting the slides and your presentation and look forward to following them on the
web later tonight. Thank you."
2023-04-07,thank you.
2023-04-07,my apologies.
2023-04-07,there are no callers in the queue.
2023-04-07,"regarding MISS Philipe' comment about the section h in
the charter, this says, no sd ob
or oig staff shall have been
employed previously by a law enforcement agency or labor organization representing law enforcement employees.
I think we MAY need an opinion from the city attorney's office
on how we are defining employee
previously by a law enforcement agency.
And does this mean only sworn
personnel or a civilian employee of a law enforcement agency?
Because dhr revows it would be
useful for them to know which applicants that could not consider because of the charter.
I will say that when this was
drafted, barbara and I remove third degree from it and somehow
between the time we saw and on
the ballot it was reinserted.
We thought it was not useful to
have this prohibition I have
known many skilled former law enforcement individual who is
work in over site and contribute greatly to it. Simple this something we could
get from the city attorney's office in"
2023-04-07,"certainly.
I think it goes to the
legislative history of the intent of original authors.
I don't know if it is captured.
I'm one who worked on it."
2023-04-07,better we don't have to guess.
2023-04-07,"thank you.
I mean it does not distinguish
between looking at it quickly
between worn and nonsworn."
2023-04-07,"right. I believe we have a presentation
from dhr, is this correct?"
2023-04-07,"yes, MR. Green. How are we doing"
2023-04-07,good.

2023-04-07,the paddle furiously under the water.
2023-04-07,"other questions for MR. Green.
I wanted to note that myself I think also commissioner soo I'm
not sure if other members did, there was specific organizations
that were focussed on historically disadvantaged communities.
Judges and past prosecutors of
bipoc, black, latino and people of color and lbgtq+ judges.
There is an effort to make sure
that those minorities were being targeted throughout specific
organizations and list.
25-30 plus organizations not including the minority council
here in san francisco that has APRIL 15 plus minority local organizations.
I want to make sure the public knew that.
Those efforts in addition to the
efforts of sending sxoel other
industry specific --
associations have also been out reached to."
2023-04-07,"so I have the list you sent

are -- california lawyer's association. American bar association.
American society of criminology
and national bar association.
Idealist. Org.
The bar association of san francisco.

2023-04-07,"I had a question on the
national bar association the american bar association?
I thank you is listed here as national bar association."
2023-04-07,I'm not sure.

Public comment?"
2023-04-07,is there further discussion on the matters? Related dhr's presentation.
2023-04-07,"no, I think we should have discussion about future community meetings."
2023-04-07,"all right. I mean hold public comment until
after that. Sure."
2023-04-07,brief?
2023-04-07,"thank you for doing a great
job in getting the meetings we had the board thought we would
do 4 now we are how many in? Scheduled?
We have 4 more scheduled.
Right we have now a total of 6.
Which is wonder and will they are representative of the
different districts and in place accessible to community all of san francisco communities so we are on board worry when we had
initial low as the board decide
to make sure that all different san franciscans of different communities had access and we
went to them versus them coming to us. Thank you for this work and the other commissioners.
I know each us played a role in some ways.
I think this we are on board to what we had initially said that was one of our values and
missions -- so it is grit to see that the community members are
coming to the meeting and giving comment."
2023-04-07,"we had 2 community meeting
and each one had one member of
the public added. They have not been well attended.
I like to suggest we broaden the
scope of the meetings.
I can't recall the woman from
league of women voters asked about the duties and
responsibilities of sheriff's department. We felt someone from the sheriff's department could
better explain that. I suggest we from the future meetings have someone from the sheriff's department describe what they do.
Ask for public comment about any
concerns or questions or issues they have regarding the sheriff's department. this will settle way to our role
and the role of office of inspector general so people put
it in better context.
And perhaps provide more comment. Might draw more people if we
have I general meeting with the sheriff's department it is clear
many people are not aware of the things they do.
And this will be a good opportunity tolet them know about that.
Joy think we could have a hand
out as I was planning for the
meetings on the west side in speaking with a supervisor
staff, he had mentioned it would
be helpful to have the duties lined out and we are city and
county we are unique as well. In the designation of the
sheriff's role versus the upon police department's role.
Also we want to make sure we
have interpreters if we have on
our website if well is a need we are it there.
The staff at the with the supervisor's office are capable
of providing language
interpretation and also have the
d. Civic engagement who can
after interpreters as well."
2023-04-07,"our next community meeting
is scheduled for next tuesday
APRIL lefrn the crocker amazon
club house 7999 moscow street 6

change the agenda to make it broader?"
2023-04-07,"you have to post 42 hours

2023-04-07,"chief is it possible from someone from the sheriff's department to come to that meeting to talk the duties and
responsibilities of the sheriff's department?"

2023-04-07,"I reached out to supervisor robe sxen supervisor safai's
office the next are in their district.
And asked them to try to
publicize the meetings through
constituent and news letter if
anyone knows of a community
organizations that we can inform about this, we would love to
have that information get it to
dan so he can send that out."
2023-04-07,"final low we do need to have
a community meeting that meeting
encompasses china town, nerth beach.
Tenderloin and soma.
That's a good idea"
2023-04-07,"that would be PRESIDENT
Peskin and supervisor dorsey's districts."
2023-04-07,"I think you mentioned
something about publicly a meeting at glide church?"
2023-04-07,yes. I have a meeting with them on monday.

meet nothing china town. Joy recommend a separate meeting."
2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,"look for a meeting location
in the china town neighborhood."
2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,you think this glide would be sufficient for south of mission.
2023-04-07,uh-huh.
2023-04-07,"yes this is pretty close.
Dan the schein chinese benevolent association the
chinese 6 companies can offer up
victor memorial hall on stockton

2023-04-07,"calling line item 4 sheriff'sy choov report
informational item. Presentation by sheriff's office
on data on complaint and internal investigation cases
including types of complaints,
numbers and dispositions."
2023-04-07,"hello, members.
Good to see you again"
2023-04-07,"related cases we have and
coming from the years of 2019-22.
22 is not the full year it is up until about AUGUST or SEPTEMBER.
we are working on other data now
as far as to update later on down the line.
Upon advises the investigations
are reenlisted here are combined
with the dpa investigations.
It is our end of the dpa.
The specifics I can not get into
related results under the
details to cases due to this is
a public forum and usually it
has to be a request related to
the specific deputies.
To go over the rules of the
disclosure and retention of
representing covered by the
penal code 832.7 and 832.5 of the penal code and evidence code
of 1043, the evidence code and
sb16, helps modify some of these
codes here which is protection
for the officers and the
deputies related to this the
peace bill of rights."
2023-04-07,"next slide.
We sum rised everything related this.
Going to the next now. In 2019 we had total investigations of 68 investigations on which related to citizen complaints.
And administrative complaints.
You see there are 68.
On the right sustained were 21.
Not sustained was 26. Exonerated 6.
Unfounded was 47 and at that
time one open case under investigation.
On the bottom we broke it up on use of force. 16 investigations.
One sustained.
10 were not, 3 exonerated, one
unfound exclude one open
investigation.
Moving on to 2020."
2023-04-07,"I had I question so the use of force investigations is that
part of the number above or in addition.
Why this is part of the numbers above and broke it down so you
see the use of force the
difference from the other cases."
2023-04-07,"do you break down complaints by category?
At dpa we have a warranted
action or neglect of duty.
It broken down to misconduct and
use of force not you know policy
and procedures and not following
policies or procedures.
Or related to insubordination.
Again our technology is not the best.
We have to dot machineual per of it.
So -- it it is difficult now to retrieve each information per case on that.
Why these include cases handled
by d. Police accountability."
2023-04-07,"this is all combined the
police department the dp ado
their investigations but don't make the final decision than I make the recommendation that is up to the sheriff to decide on that.
Or to agree with dpa in that respect.
But in addition to it that's all
related to our data because the sheriff is make thanksgiving decision. Dpa recordkeeping did than I
brick down allegations by category the types you described."
2023-04-07,"you have to talk to them I'm
sure they do I'm not with them so you will have to discuss this
with dpa representatives.
I know you den want to look at total number of complaints you
want to see what they are about, some being be minor."
2023-04-07,"that's correct.
so -- again the report handed it
me I'm not one of the investigators I'm here to report the numbers to you.
Is there a break down of what
types of cases go with the
different findings and what
allegations were sustained oh or exonerated.
They do have that that is more
for the discussion off closed
session."
2023-04-07,why?
2023-04-07,"so -- .
There were cases like I say when
we talk about it goes out these
case are really deputies and
so -- they goes to pr and other things.
So that's in respect to that."
2023-04-07,okay.
2023-04-07,"and does the sheriffy department make this information
public low accessible?"
2023-04-07,"the data is on our website. Sfsheriff. Gov.
You have number of cases
resulted in fine or -- I have
not a second time familiar with it y. On many law enforcement
agency in california do publish
this data.
And in a format.
I'm not familiar I have to talk
to thome get more specifics:public from my aid in the next meeting.
I'm trying we will try to get machine to be more specific
related to your question.
It is MS. Phillips someone doing
research would want to look at know everything they can about the sheriff's department including the rink of complaints
the number and type of complaints to know what the office would be doing.
I think more information to
provide the better."
2023-04-07,we'll of bring one of the investigators on the next round
2023-04-07,thank you.
2023-04-07,"please, continue y. Move to
2020, the total investigations 49. Sworn. 12 sustained.
18 were not sustained.
9 were exonerated and 9 unfound
exclude there was one open case.
The first cases 13. One sustained.
4 not sustained.
5 exonerated and 3 unfounded. So.
Move on to the next slide.
2021 there were 51 total investigations.
Complaints for 37. Administratively 14. 47 were sustained.
13 not sustained.
15 exonerated and 8 unfounded.
18, 2 sustained. They went in I hearing.
It is actually the deputy's entitleed a hearing. 2 not sustained.
12 exonerated and 2 unfounded.
That covers 21 and 20 it woo is
in the the full numbers yet.
We have 36 total investigations.
22 came from the citizen's, 47 from administrative. One sustained.
6 not sustained.
3 exonerated one unfoundd and 25 open cases.
14 of those were use of force.
Right now one was not sustained.
2 exonerated and the rest were
open cases being investigated."
2023-04-07,"on my final slide it add to
when we had asked for number of assaults on deputies this covers 5 years.
If you look at the total here
and year 2018, 58 assaults.
2019 there was 64 assaults.
and 2020 was 63.
2021 was 52 and 2022 was 50.
These assaults consistent with
spitting, gassing, than I have
been urinate.
Feces, that includes this.
Unwanted physical touching and
other acts of violence on
deputies this covers from 2018
to 2022.
For 2022, how many officers were active?
In 2022?
We have a total of 735, I believe."
2023-04-07,okay.
2023-04-07,"do do you have a break down of type of assault like they
range level of severity."
2023-04-07,"it ranges in different levels
they are reports they do make reports they should be broken down this way. This covers everything the
deputies had encountered so far.
Why could we get this more
detailed break down to see if any trends and types of assaults increases or decreases?"
2023-04-07,"I can try.
I will have to talk to the
division and see if they have those numbers.
And I am this is had I was begin to me."
2023-04-07,"how long did it take to acquire and compile this information.
How many resources were used to
sheriff resources or d ph
resources internal affairs to compile.
One thing we are focussing on is
making sure we are looking at
issues and we are prioritizing them.
So I want to make approximate sure is that the resource and it
is time of the history is being used in I manner that you
know -- these reports result in something. Right.
I would rather not have a report
for reporting we are looking at an issue and there is going to be work on that.
So it would be helpful to get an understanding of when is I level
of work that it takes to dot
presentations and requests for information. .
And -- secondly, that goes in a future agenda items I would like
to discuss and I will give you prevow of setting priorities that we discussed. So this way, those priorities
can be alined with when reporting we are asking the sheriff to do. We can have more structure on
the requests and getting this information.
It is time consuming we are not tech savvy.
We get the data down.
I go to at least 2 units or 3.
To put sources to get on there
and related the dpa we call them
to see what they have and
related to getting this data it is time consuming and takes them away from investigations?"
2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,"we are not a big unit
compared to sfpd than I have 1800 personnel.
We are there is one-two people
in the unit doing multitasking. It does not come up with the
push of I button. ""multiple information related.
We have to go and scramble and call the people who have the knowledge and resources."
2023-04-07,"and then I think I wanted to add.
It is no surprise you said that
i wanted to make sure the
sheriff's office it appropriate technology. I think this the police
department is up on their second
or third up grid of their technology and so much with the
sheriff is done boy hand and you
said chief, having to use other deputies and different deputies
to compile the reports.
I wanted to this guess into the
well being of the deputies and
those who work in the sheriff's
office because I then and there
they are taxing without having
automation with technology that
is first a prior that goes to
budgeting as well and the number
of investigators also right now coinsides with the number of
deputies.
Based on staffing.
MAY be tap in to see the numbers of actual sheriff's
investigation versus the other dp ainvestigations.
But I want to make sure there is budget not just for the office
of inspector yes or no but for
the sheriff's office so they have the technology and personnel and deputy nguyen
shared before what we have the training.
The staffing within the jails a
lot of those charts are done boy hand.
We want to make sure we free up
more personnel to do the w that
is a prior for our citizens as
vice PRESIDENT Carrion said."
2023-04-07,"besides worn we typeset in professional staff, too. That is another thing we tap
into when our sheriffs are overwhelmed."
2023-04-07,"of course once the oig is established you will prosecute void this information on a
regular basis, too, because that will be an essential per of their work. To look at this."
2023-04-07,we need all the help we can get.
2023-04-07,"is there by the way to bring
up our policy is going to be
live we have updated the policy
effective APRIL 15th tell be on our website.
And it is our policies now.
So all that will be be available
for the public to review."
2023-04-07,"I wanted acknowledge on a separate note that the sheriff
just had this incredible event of women in law enforcement breaking barriers.
It was an exceptional event this brought law enforcement leaders
initial low to talk about the
experiences of women, very diverse. I was per of a panel of women in the law. And I wanted to acknowledge this and say that was an exceptional sxevent it was wonderful to see the sheriff taking the initiative of the 30 by 30 to get 30% of the employees in to be women of combh further diversify our diverse agency. I want to acknowledge had and thank you and the team for doing the work and the participates"
2023-04-07,"thank you.
Why thank you for participating."
2023-04-07,"it was empowering.
I want to mention with board member palmer, he has been support I of the sheriff's office related to our visiting
center we had opening cj2 he
participated in designing the center.
Want to thank the board member palmer. Why before I forget in the
chronicle I will pass it down to member palmer.
Because people don't go on the hard copies.
I'm one of the rare people who subscribed electric at that a paper newspaper.
Gi was looking for tht second
page you will find your picture
and -- the bee.
No further questions I gotta go to another event."
2023-04-07,"thank you.
Public comment y. If there is public comment.
And then questions from the public."
2023-04-07,"for members of public when would like to make public
comment for item 4 line up at
the podium or call 415-655-0001. MR. Patrellis."
2023-04-07,"michael patrellis.
This is in the my first time at
law enforcement accountability rodeo. This gentlemen did more dodge nothing a few minutes I have
seen in a long time.
He dodged too many of your
questions about why is there no
specific break down of what was
sustained, exonerated?
So much of when he presented was pretty useless. You know.
Without the specifics, of what
um -- deputies charged with or
what the complaints were about?
I'm not buying it.
I am not buying it.
Now, will there is a real problem where law enforcement is
put in a special category.
Special privileges.
They get personnel protections
this we members of the public never get. I have been accused of crimes and through the system and had
in choice in the matter of my
name, mug shot, getting out there.
I don't get protection.
Law enforcement though is
accused of doing something wrong
we never learn their names.
This gentlemen, this deputy from
the sheriff's office, said that you have to go in closed session.
If you wanted to discuss specifics.
Of what was sustained, what who
the deputies were.
That does not build trust with
the public.
How many this oversight board is
going to address this really important matter of they have
personnel protections and we are
supposed to just trust them? You have to delve into temperature and it suspect not
going to be easy. And the police commission does
the same thing when they are
dealing with complaints against
cops they go in closed session it is never rekosovoed to us and
we are supposed to trust them?
Does in the happen.
Does not happen.
We need full transparency.
And I don't want to come to another meeting and have this
kind of report where the deputy
is dodging pretty basic
questions of what were the break downs.
That cannot be acceptable.
Look, I waited a long time for a
small degree of accountability. Over the sheriff's department.
And I don't want to hear anything about they don't have enough staff.
They don't have the technology. They got it.
They just use it as an excuse to
protect themselves and finally,
I think it always has to be explained that the sheriff's
department investigated the deputies.
That calls in question the independence of the investigation.
Thank you for listening."
2023-04-07,"there are a couple of corrections for the purpose of
meching sure the public is, wear the sheriff is in the responsible for investigating
deputy there is is a mem right-handum of understanding
between the department of police accountability. It does not guilty go directly
through the sheriff it goes you
in through the public process.
There also is a public record's
request the public are visible
to access information.
There is a very you are correct there are different protection
and there is, legality of lus
that govern what are the employment rights and
confidentiality rights of peace officers. The sheriff is in the responsible for dictating what the laws are. I recommend this if you want the
laws to be change today is your legislators that will change
those lus, for now, they are
required to abide by particular
confidentiality and personnel
laws."
2023-04-07,"the memorandum of understanding stated the
department of police
accountability would issue
annual report this is list
cases, findings and the sfo's response I don't know this we
got that and I believe the sheriff's department said that
they have dpa said that this information is sheriff's
department to release.
So that's why I asked the cho ief for that.
Other public upon comment? Thank you cho we know have you another meeting. No other public comment.
Why could we tick a 5 minute
break before the next item"
2023-04-07,"adjourn for 5 minute its is
3:31 P.M.
It is is 3:40 P.M. We are back from recess.
Next item on the agenda y. Line
item 5 media policy discussion and possible action item. Discuss the general mode why policy for upon communicate
width mead why, using social
media and acting in social media
policies to work public meetings
and other information y.
Discussion on this item. I think this policy has gone
through the city attorney and it it is in line with other
agencies, commissions and boards.
So I would recommend this we
have a discussion and adopt this policy so that -- the members
who wanted to dot out reach
member afuhaamango and member palmer and I don't know if today
we need to designate nit noise
to designate nit a spokes person
we don't need to today but manage important.
It hen delayed since left year. So.
I move to adopt the media policy
that has been provided. I would second."
2023-04-07,"I have a question.
Member brookter, did the police
commission have a mode why policy."
2023-04-07,not they was issue wear of
2023-04-07,"when you served on the
commission of status of women
did than I yovment yes we designate nitted certain people
to peek hafs the wording of the policy.
It was that we would make sure
that if someone were speaking on
behalf of the commission it was clear it was on behalf of the commission and the commission
would vet upon if know
individual, then the person had to make clear it was an individual.
There is, let of blurring now
buzz there is social mode why,
so and unfortunately, once misinformation information
getses out well it has a life of
its own.
With yours that involve legal questions.
I'm hoping that board members would refer questions to the city attorney's office.
Why otherwise, there is no
attempt to infringe on money first amendment rights.
I was I reporter for 12 yers and
know attorney I gone through constitutional lu.
It was I question on the borrow exam.
Very well first amendment rights.
When would constitute a legal question?"
2023-04-07,"if you want to know about
um -- certain interpretation of set policy or something. I can give an example.
How we asked the city attorney
to define what is law enforcement. Right. So this would be something that as a commissioner we should look
to our city attorney for this
type of advice rather than us
having a layperson or as an attorney, I can have my own
opinion and analysis of what I
think it it is but it had in the
seem as it is coming from the
board when I speak about it. The voip had than I speak have
to indicate they are speaking
for themming only not for the board unless they have I authority of the board. And currently the only one
pesting on social media is dan. Posts informational material. Which I'm fine with.
I'm fine with dan being the
person pesting on our official accounts.
If anyonements to post on their personal, counts obviously hi
are fro to do so. I don't see the need for this. I think we have been working
fine with dan posting on the social mode why accounts and
posting things to the website.
And -- I don't see this as being necessary.
Police commission does in the have it and other tha I'm not,
wear of other this is have this.
I say, the restriction applies
to mow and to vice PRESIDENT
Care yen as well.
MRS. Charge and does cover vice PRESIDENT I think it does.
I know it does not PRESIDENT.
Yet good government guide peeks
about officers the same applies to everyone on the board. When you speak about the business of the board make clear
whether you are peeking in your personal capacity or behalf of the board if you are speaking on behalf of the board you should have the board's authority.
Why I was going it sill if we
are asking for a member of the board to be that representative
then this goes to play for sure.
I think to your point and even with the police commission, we
had a designate no in the
department this handled the mead why.
Social media and talking to members of the public. So I think it depens when weapon
want to do if we have represents
from the membership.
If not we want dan or someone in the history's department on handle this and take care of that I don't feel like it is needed.
I think this you know I believe that it would be good for you to have designate nitted.
When we have here is we have an opportunity. Right.
We have commissioner palmer and
commissioner and we they
specialize and do this work and
have a lot more expertise than I would.
And you know a lead attorney for
my in house counsel I see it
utilizing the skill sets to
designate one or bother as liaisons.
I help cofound the mode why team
for the initial asian american bar.
I believe in careful low crafted statements so there is in the anything misleading.
I don't believe in using the
media to push policy without full discussion on the board or
naming board members if you disagree.
So and we are community orientd
and have constituencies this we
do work with.
So I believe this isseen more present because depending on an issue ownership community we
want to address we MAY want to
designate nit a spokes person.
With00 autopacific islander
community I look to member afuhaamango and when we do more community meetings with people
who are inoccurserated or those
who go in reent row are look to
member palmer and if it come to
labor issues with the deputies I
would look to member nguyen.
I think we all bring different areas of expertise I continuing
is important to have the broader policy."
2023-04-07,"the pedestrian police
commission serve as the conticket person.
Why that's correct."
2023-04-07,is this standard practice for commissions and boards
2023-04-07,"if my understanding.
Joy don't see why you would not
want me as PRESIDENT It play
that role I sent out press releases that were pure low informational.
I cent them out about community meeting and send them to the
board of supervisors.
So00 eye would not send anything
in the pure low informingal I
have no interested to posting on
social med why I don't post on
my personal, count I don't seat
need to circumvent the normal."
2023-04-07,"this is not just social mode why a yes or no media
policy it is speaking with reporters.
I think we should have a right
to peek to the press I'm a
proponent for a free and transparent press."
2023-04-07,"I think that is -- the media
policy is not encouraging that.
I think it it is very clear as
that we have certain judiciary
duties as members of the board
this we need to ensure we are following. I also thank you it is important
this we are active in social media. The world is changing technology is changing.
I have my phone with mow all the time.
It is important to mack myself
we have commissioner afuhaamango who does this work professional
low for sephora.
We have a commissioner palmer have voiced interests and already enengaged in community live in community.
Work in community.
So I think that to avoid in --
to avoid the idea there is an infringement is inaccurate. I think this portriis in the when we are trying to do.
What we are trying to do is get
more people at the community meetings."
2023-04-07,"right. We talked about one person here and there. We have got e mail comments the
best way to do this is to use
expertise we have. And thank you for acknowledging
you are not the social media person. Then let somebody else who is
and I think that's where we are.
We need to be in community however community needs us to be
and social media is reality."
2023-04-07,"I also think this e lays that concerns that I or someone else
is try to infringe on first amendment rights somebody poke
to the media and said the sheriff's oversight board is
trying to curtail the first
amendment this. Is a general policy consistent with good government guide and it health
care reviewed boy our city
attorney and so this puts fear
this is we are trying to
infringe or suppress freedom of
speech and we have a solid policy.
I hope that we will move forward and adopt this policy."
2023-04-07,"I like to make an amendment
if fine with commissioner palmer. You would upon agree to be on the liaison. I would say afuhaamango but
currently he is in the here I feel awkward."
2023-04-07,"I would make a friend low
amendment to in coming naz to adopting the policy to
identifying yourself as the
liaison for media if there are
media questions they go to you first example that would be also
:   with the board.
I don't think we should prit in scyllos.
We should be pritting fully n in our commission meeting like we are doing now it is helpful to
have this you have been --  discussion. Irrelevant about the issues and
different perspectives.
Why agreed. I absolutely concur I don't know
if we need a policy to do that.
From what I hear.
I'm okay with us nominating and
putting forth a liaison but I don't think we need a policy on top of that.
It is my own personal.
Why I don't see how anything
preventing any member from
pubicizing our activities."
2023-04-07,"this policy guess fourth and important now begin there was
negative press we were trying to
stifle open interaction with the media.
So I'm in favor of having in media policy.
And -- what negative press.
Why I would second.
Hoping we do it separately."
2023-04-07,"what negative press are you
referring tochlt articles
mentioning my name in particular. So.
Just for clarification, this
policy basically saying that
each member speak for themselves
not for the entire board and
also anybody can post like events that we have like if we go to the richmond we can post
that this is saying that our
personal views are not spoken for the entire board just our own."
2023-04-07,"correct y. So we can post event s
events that we are going to participate in.
But this here is saying that any
personal vows of ours aside from
the events is our personal vows not on behalf of the board."
2023-04-07,right.
2023-04-07,you make clear it is in the on behalf
2023-04-07,"that's specified in the good government guide which already
requires we specify we are speaking on our behalf and not of the board.
I think it is redundant we have that requirement in the good
government guide which we should
be familiar with.
Again I think any of us can
publicize or promote our activities.
I see this is an attempt to
under mine my authority making
someone else the point person.
As opposed the police commission. And that's unfortunate.
I don't think this is necessary.
anything I have sent out has been informational.
I don't think we are questioning
your sincerity or capables of speak on behalf of the board.
I think we say we live in a
different age social media is a
skill and technique. Point
raised we only had one person at
each our first 2 meetings
directly impacts our ability to
use social media to get more people.
And as we said, 2 of the board
member this is is on this board, have experienced and do this for
a living I'm a former editor of a newspaper.
I'm an editor of another
newspaper and getting red to be a pod casteder. Knowing the importance of media
it is not a matter of should our PRESIDENT Or vice PRESIDENT Or somebody else not be able to
poke it is being able to credit
a unified message shows we are a
body with a unified message and that ability to attract the
community to come and hear this message.
When ever deemed necessary. Right. Again. Just because other commissioner or board had it another way I
think for us we should try a different way.
Or this way.
In order to achieve our goals.
Well is nothing stopping you or
another member posting about our events do this already we encourage to you. You can all send information to
dan to post on our social mode
why accounts.
I assume where we want the primary source of information we
want to use y. This is extending
to speaking to the press I know
dan does in the speak to the press. And so if the press wants to have know official
account of that the board thinks, should be a unified
message and if this is a unified
message one person says that. I'm not saying it has to be me
I'm not saying it should not be
you I sill we should have a spokes person and this person should be lected by the b.Ed
because that means the body says I than this personal deliver
this message the way we inteldz
not to sayy anybody is not doing
that that is the way it is for any agency.
Gi was the person elected by
this body as PRESIDENT I have
not made statements where I
imployed I was speaking on behalf of the board.
I followed government guide.
I think you know my position should not be personal.
I don't think this act should be a slight to you and your presidency. I think this I believe in wing
in a brain trust. I am not smarter than anyone else here. Everyone here has intelligence
and access it resources and
skill this is can only comp
preliminary my skills I bring.
We are fortunate enough to have
commissioner palmer and
commissioner afuhaamango I keep saying her anymore.
We are so fortunate on have this resource why would we not capitolize on it.
Why would we not we have someone an editor of newspaper when is
why would we not have him.
Just like if there was something related to experience this came
up we have member when work in d. Insurance.
We have skill sets I think that
to do our work, it is fwrt have a team mentality and say, you know when?
You are great at 3 pointers you
shoot the 3 pointers.
Member palm areness I'm old
school print media and have the
access to chinese media.
I and craft statements so I'm
always help to work as a team and review statements. It is important especially because negative information went out temperature is more important to gift public confidence we are a team and
have this media policy.
Do you feel anyone on the board imployed they were speak on
behalf of the board to the media."
2023-04-07,yes
2023-04-07,"but I'm not going to bringum bad laundry. I think moving forward should be
things that are positive and
that's why I look to remedial action and having policies so
there is no misunderstanding."
2023-04-07,"as I said, all of the member consist do what you are suggesting.
Than I can pest on social media.
They can talk to the media. They are not prohibits.
Than I can work to strengths all. Us can."
2023-04-07,"you want circumvent the
process this board went through
in having an election and -- do
what the board or commission
does having a PRESIDENT And voip
who will serve as the spokes people for that board when necessary and within the bounds of good government guide."
2023-04-07,"PRESIDENT I'm not sure
let's be frank I'm not sure why
you are making everything so personnel but from observation
in the public than I see
bickering and lot electric of cooperation with setting an agenda with our vice PRESIDENT.
That does in the give the public confidence.
I think if we have policies and
have them out lined for the
public it see I hope that brings more confidence and sxapgz that
is why I think it is important
to have the guide lines, code of conduct. Everyone should act with respect
and do things but why are more and more organizations coming up
with a code of conduct?
Members of public it apores the
members are trying to under motorbike my authority as PRESIDENT.
In terments of code of conduct I tried get the board to vote on
one and we could not vote on
that that is manage that
michelle fipips referenced is helpful.
For me I'm happy to nominate
liaisons for social media.
Especially for social mead why
to work with dan for social media purposes.
But I don't feel an additional
policy is needed to do that.
Any other questions from board
members?
We should take public comment."
2023-04-07,"members of public when
would lect to make comment for
item 5 line up at the podium or
call 415-655-0001, enter the
access code then star 3 to enter
the queue."
2023-04-07,"makal patrellis again.
First of all, I believe that the
police commission did develop a
social mode why policy in the
first year of the pandemic and
matt dorsey was responsible for
crediting temperature I men wrong I'm asking to you verify
what is going on with the police commission and their media policy if than I have one or don't.
If they do look at it but don't
um -- step as something you should copy.
Regarding social media, I am
looking at the twitter, count
for this body.
It is @sf sd ob.
And there have been 36 tweets.
And than I have been very informative including when your meeting is.
And now, this morning they did post information.
About misconduct complaints
investigated by the dpa. And it
lists 5 reasons for misconduct complaints.
By listing 5, member of the
public will say, well, I was
this is in the involved sexual misconduct but I would like to
file a complaint.
What I'm trying to articulate limiting the number of reasons
why a complaint can be investigated you should say regardless of that, condition
tact us if you would like to
file a complaint.
Now, there when you look at
the -- other accounts that are
being followed by your twitter, count.
Your twitter, count should ask
who is maintaining it. Okay.
But -- who is min they are
following the warriors.
The 49ers the sf giants the vice PRESIDENT.
the PRESIDENT. Okay.
I can understand following can
medicala harris and joe biden I
don't upon understand why your twitter, count is following port's teams.
I'm not into sports and request that.
When you electric at the number
of followers of your twitter, count there is one follower.
And you are looking at him.
I would like for to you have more followers.
On your twitter, count and I think that who ever has star
third degree, count is dog a pretty good job of just giving
the facts about meetings and
come plains and what have you. Popped up here. There have been 32 tweets since
they opened this account.
You know, sometimes spend too much time on twitter.
There is a let of us on twitter
buzz it it is live and fast.
Of course we got problems with e
lon musk but you need to engage with us on social media.
And I think you can easy low
find a liaison from the board to
guide the person who is creating
and maintaining your social media.
Thank you.
There are no other callers.
There was a motion I made I had a second.
Adopt media policy and if accepted by commissioner palm
are identify him as the liaison.
For the media in connection with this policy.
I believe that commissioner soo
second and at it time call the vote."
2023-04-07,"all right.
We will take the vote for line
item 5 am member brookter. Why no."
2023-04-07,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,member nguyen
2023-04-07,no.
2023-04-07,member palmer.
2023-04-07,yes.
2023-04-07,member soo.
2023-04-07,"yes.
PRESIDENT Wechter."
2023-04-07,no.
2023-04-07,"tie.
Does in the pass you need 4 to pass.
Iot motion does not pass.
Why another motion. To identify commissioner palm
are as the liaison will for the media."
2023-04-07,second.
2023-04-07,a discussion on this motion?
2023-04-07,"what would this mean in terms
of his role as liaison to the media?
The media has questions they he
would be our spokes person."
2023-04-07,"so if the media have questions they go to him rather
than the PRESIDENT Of the board."
2023-04-07,"you would talk to him if they went to you.
You would talk to him and
develop a crafted board message.
Why do you think member palmer
should play that role rather than the PRESIDENT.
He has the professional experience you do not.
Specific low with mead why. He established right mou and you
have acknowledged you are not involved in social mode why
which is important and as the community has spoken and asked
for us to be more involved we should listen to the community and do this."
2023-04-07,"I said I don't post on social
mode why accounts.
I workeds a free lance
journalist before an investigator.
Operated business this puts on yearly public comment I have
done press prosecute motion I'm experienced in sending press
release and liaisons with the press and sent out press
releases about our meetings I do have expert ease.
We are talking about who the
media would contact if they want a statement from the board that
would be member palm are rather than me."
2023-04-07,"that's correct.
And that's the vote that is seconded. Is there"
2023-04-07,"this is also I had a few
questions media keen to commissioner palmer?
And asked them a political issue
and where the board standos this
issue come become to us to get our."
2023-04-07,that's correct.
2023-04-07,okay
2023-04-07,"if they had an informational question about a meeting would not come to me as PRESIDENT They
would go to member palmer."
2023-04-07,"they could did to dan go to the website.
They can look at the xr
recordings of you will of this. Ultmitt low withhold come become to the board and all have a say in it."
2023-04-07,that's correct.
2023-04-07,okay.
2023-04-07,"for example after our last
community meeting a reporter from mission local asked mow
what had been done I told her I
sent out press releases and all the members of the board of supervisors asking them to sends
it out to constituent this is was informational."
2023-04-07,"this it is my point that is an example because that only said what you did.
This does in the say what the other things that dan and the
board did this. It is had we
want we want a unified board the
media gets a full understanding of things that were spoken about or done. I said this is when I did."
2023-04-07,"I understands that this is
when we are trying to avoid work as a team. Make sure that everyone's work is acknowledged.
Palm are has done incredible work. Commissioner soo done all the
substantive w it is impressive and 10 that on. It is in the but.
It is simple low not about you."
2023-04-07,"why take this authority responsibility from mow to give it to another board member I don't understand y. It is not
giving or taking away this is in the a power grb we are let's keep it role.
We are a commission of recommendation. We are not the police commission we don't have the authority that police commission does.
We have our goal is to look at
what first of all inspector general. This is min. Establish a good system and bring the voice of the community through us as members of this
board to ensure the policies and procedures of the sheriff are dog when they should be doing. Right. Television is in the about you temperature is in the about each and everyone of us it is how are
we going to access and how are we going to reach community.
And until we have a very
talented black man that knows
his stuff and media that can do that. That live in community.
That works in community."
2023-04-07,"I want to add member palmer
has a following he is so e
mersed in the community it is so important to have a confident
from the community and have an
out reach and as we are able to
get we have the job posting.
But down the road we'll look at policies and look at what happens with families who are
affected by incarceration and
look at reentry and support we
can't get there until we dot basic. I don't understand PRESIDENT If you are PRESIDENT And said we
wanted to time lines and mcgonigles that never help
exclude they had to do it I wanted move process because frank low I would be very embarrassed to sit on a board
where we did not get things done. Our time is have you been and I
can't sit on a board where we
don't get things done I'm thankful for the partners we have and getting things doneful
you seem insistent on doing things your way and as vice PRESIDENT Carrion tuesday is in
the about you it is about our board.
Building confidence.
Amongst our communities and conscientist wenss.
I think it it is important top
have member palmer be liaison to
the media."
2023-04-07,"when he speaks I feel confidence in when he say and
how he presents and I think this
his tone and approach is really beautiful for our board. You know it is.
Why it is lived experience."
2023-04-07,"lived experience.
Why would we not want to use
this incredible resource we have available to snus"
2023-04-07,"MR. Palmer, member palm are
can do all those things now as a member of the board and I
encourage him to the do this. I will say community members
told mow who watched the meeting
its appear other members of the
board are trying to u summer my
authority they are unhelp how
the election went this is feedback. I would like to say something we
all voted for you the election was unanimous. Right?"
2023-04-07,no. MAY be one person.
2023-04-07,"but we voted for you, right.
And in the process after, you
seemed to like not get that the board as a group is trying to move in a direction.
And so it is in the a backlash
toward you it is more of a nudge
asking to you move with the group.
It is in the when you say is
invalid or not valuable but
sometimes I have said actual
personal low and public low.
Delegate.
Does not all have to fall on your shoulders.
It is good to use other members to do those things.
You are the PRESIDENT.
You still shine. You are the lead.
And we got it done. I think when people seat mead
meet being push become by a
central person it does look divicive. So why not a second time be that way."
2023-04-07,uh-huh.
2023-04-07,"I agree with him I think we
all think you are dog a great
job and dog a lot of the work.
Like commissioner moore said MAY
be off load some of this to
other commissioners who are more
specific or shine in this your and del gift that to them.
We think you are dog a great job. Thank you [Inaudible].
You are a member.
You I see that you're connection in this field could be really
beneficial in getting this job posting out on doing that kind of work.
I mean that is a strength this I see you PRESIDENT Wechter have you have the connections this you established.
After decades of work. Right.
So why not focus your energy on getting us the best inspector general we can.
Let him dot media.
There is so much w to be done on this board -- which I'm will
grateful for to are a part of
because I want to see our -- our
residents be able to get the
best service the best civic service it is sheriff department can give. Right?
And the way that we can do that
is by really brain storming,
using the board as a brain trust
and maximizing and capitolizing
and incentivize people to bring resources to the table to move
us forward in meeting our vision, mcgonigle and of
transparency and accountability
and taking the sheriff's
department to tech lbgt cal era.
Now we want to provide the public as much information and did thea as possible.
We need to be able to do this ground work.
So it would be wonderful if you
could use your skill set to be
able to be that person rather
to -- access your network and
nut job posting out let someone
else do something else they are gooda. I'm happy to let palm are about
the social mead why person.
In charge of that.
He is the official spokes person for anything relating to the board if you have a limit heel
be the person who puts out social media. Scombht prisz I will be help with this.
I love for him to do this. But that's not the motion."
2023-04-07,if you want to resunrise the motion. Joy don't.
2023-04-07,"what was the motion. The motion is to have commissioner palm are serve as
the media liaison for this board.
And I think he would do a great job I know commissioner afuhaamango is not present so
I'm not sure he has an interest
and julie would be a great person. I have been working with hr, thank you for the vote of confidence.
I have great confidence in member palmer.
But again you know PRESIDENT Wechter I don't know why
everything seems to be an uphill
battle and fight with you we
have great support from dpa and it seems like a fight.
We had assistance for the budget
and still in budget season.
You should be focussed on those
thing and it seems like we are
quibbling onness mineute or your
personnel arn mosity it is strategy but every time I see
someone from dp aoffering assistance and offering help you
are so resistant to it and we
want the I fwshgs to,
successful.
I think the transification I made it clear. I will say the transification
period is likely to be a year to
get full staffing with
investigators it is important
this we all focus what our areas
of expertise are in getting
things going to support a new ig
and as well a successful office
and something we can be proud of
as san franciscans and constituents that's the reason notoriety community meetings not
we are taking time out and
having something to tick off a become.
I believe inspect community out put and bringing stele hall to
the community.
Ive don't need I title to get
the work din would be embarrassed for the entire board."
2023-04-07,"thank you for saying my your
of expertise mean was civil yen oversight. And based on established
practices I don't want the
inspector yes or no to walk in an office that had staff hired
we someone else I want them to choose their own staff."
2023-04-07,can we you mentioned should be fully staffed.
2023-04-07,"I'm say telling take a year
to transition when an ig is set
in accomplice the ig has to staff the office.
I'm talking about a long are trans sxigz don't want the public to be believe this
suddenly the office will be up
and running on its own this is a recipe for failure to expect
them to turn on a dime and get
everything up and run willing is a transition period.
An mou I know you.
Ed to cut mou when an ig is hire
third degree is in the within our jurisdiction or authority.
We can make recommendations to the sheriff's office.
But I don't believe the
sheriff's office would cut contract.
We are getting far afield.
What is on the agenda in terms
of the public open meeting requirements."
2023-04-07,"thank you.
I think I want to go become to
the motion and it has been
seconded so men call the
question y. We need public
comment on the second motion.
I think tell be I good idea it
is different than"
2023-04-07,"members who will like to

minor thing appointing a liaison.
Get to temperature you need it.
It will really, really enhance

Michelle phillips need to bes

We have waited a language time

We do not dmchlt take that back
I don't want you put nothing

Member palmer you other media
liaison."
2023-04-07,calling item 6 future items discussion item.
2023-04-07,"one things we mentioned
benefit was talking about the priors.
So I think MAY be we MAY want to
discuss what our top 3 things we want the sheriff to focus in bring happening upon information
on that way we don't have all of these requests for them, yea.
I want to have I meaningful reporting why are we asking for the things.
Is it buzz tell help with the hiring of the ig?
Because we think this someone a potential candidate would be interested in having this information in making an assessment of whether they want
to apply and how they would affect the job.
It was helpful to have MS. Phillips they did the page sum row of their vision. Did a department chart. There are certain information
that the sheriff MAY hold now.
That would be a benefit for potential applicants of the inspector general.
I think we should talk about what that would look like
approximate this way we are not
taxing the sheriff to use all the personnel to get information
this we are not going to do anything watch I want the
information to be provided to be useful"
2023-04-07,"can I add.
Can we ask for to speak to have more organization here rather then and there everyone speaking.
I was going to capitolize on when vice PRESIDENT Carrion said
I would like to bring back time
line I brought in terms of goals.
This is related to were the ig i
come up with know entire for the
year our goal and bench americas
would be making sure we have quarter low and annual reports
in coping with the presentation
that MS. Phillips med it
important we have an inventory
of when we have in terms of
resources, it, reporting for our
sheriff's office that MAY an inspector general can have an idea whf they are up against. Than I will be the within who is
are going to have to get the
data to make the reports to us.
And then we sing sthiez and have
a report to the board and report back with recommendations to the sheriff as well.
I think if we take time to actually dlin I didn't priorities and who is
responsible for certain poses of information and tie it together
and I think also with
recommendations from dhr how we
craft our questions from phase
one when we categorize the
candidate and those who make it through another phase the
written question.
When we go through the oral questions.
I think that would be helpful to
mote with the time line that is
finalized here for the ig.
That's in DECEMBER I asked whether or not it was within
upon the realm of publicity to
have an ig on bordz by OCTOBER
it was realistic given had
michelle said I think we are on
target if we but we need to be prepared with question and the
inventory of what we have at the sheriff's office.
I think member nguyen you modify
input in terms of when you talk
about staffing.
We should motor dhr set the time
line and follow their add voice
on the best practice for make thanksgiving time selection. Joy believe commissioner soo is
the liaison working with dhr on this that is where this is coming from. This is the time line and they
have flushed it out with the 2
additional months of AUGUST and assessment. I thank you we approximate chose
a liaison regarding submission of the draft drop description in
the the entire process.
They are the liaison and check
nothing with mows they do
different phases y. That was not
my understanding you will play that role throughout the process. We had a vote."
2023-04-07,"we had a row for to be the
liaison regarding submission of the job description and on going as they went through the process."
2023-04-07,"that's not something I would have agreed to.
Will work is getting done now. Before it was not.
So let's keep it role. Okay. I get the work done."
2023-04-07,"I'm I apologize for inter- jecting I think you are supposed to talk about future
agenda items it is fine to
identify issues and they can be agendaized but I wanted if
caution you against having a discussion about something not on the agenda."
2023-04-07,"regarding priorities the
charter says one of the duties
is come pile, eflths and recommend law enforcement and
best practices and I think we 92
ed have the sheriff give us
presentations on the practice so
we can full nil role.
The san francisco police commission has the police
department give presentations on operations.
The same is true in the oakland police department. And their
spleept the same size as our sheriff's department is important to educate xourz prosecute void this information to the public. Why request to speak."
2023-04-07,"yes.
Why they also have an inspector general. We are in the there yet.
We need to hire the person reviewing the policies and procedures.
I think this we should be getting information from the sheriff.
I am no way I want to make this
very clear I am no way advocating the sheriff stop
giving reports I'm advocating they give reports theory specific and useful to the board
and the public upon begin we are focusing now which our priority
should be hiring the best ig we can rather then and there a than have a slew of different
reporting we credit a time line.
That the state. You not office
would electric like what visible resources and be able to
identify gaps that will be an
important question had gaps you
see in our budget in the
infrastructure and tech untiling remediated.
Those other things would be
helpful and like to see that as
part of the next report for the
inventory of those issues from
the sheriff as agenda item.
Next time they report.
we had information from the yale house.
Iot baptist of public health.
This is down the line but we are
looking at the job of the ig.
If it is not redly available and
you have to go through 2 department it is, multiple deputies to get this information is not efficient but something
we can address and make recommendations. This is something that the candidates for inspector general need to been.
Than I can out line the plan
their vision.
And if it needs to supplements
we should welcoming because they handle complaints."
2023-04-07,"I will be help to talk to
other oversight practitioners
other heads of oversight
agencies what they think the ig would need ton"
2023-04-07,great.
2023-04-07,"I was going to say I'm
talking about we need the person modes to know what happens in an front when you tuck about
sheriff office report I want to
know about what is looking. What is working.
We need to be able to during an
interview process layout things
for candidates that is why again.
The word priorities let's have
priorities here and not go
outside or L.A. The bay your is
grit I know we work regional.
But we are city and county.
There are mou's that happen. Yell does the sheriff in the patrol the airport or police department. There are agreements in the city.
You in we are looking at data,
looking at complaints how many investigators should the person hire.
And based on the number of sworn officers but we want to know what is happen and can we know
the technology is not there for
the sheriff's office.
Something basic you want the focus"
2023-04-07,"that's I didn't asked for
report on complaints and more detailed break down so inspect
are yes or no applicants have I sense when is the scope of the
number of complaints and we
asked MS. Clark to give a report
on lawsuits that is also jermaine to ig responsibilities
than iville that understanding.
I believe the chooif chu's presentation was irrelevant
voluntary to inspector general applicant and like thoim go
deeper I know the questions applicants ask about the complaint numbers.
Why I think men in the future if you would have a better conversation with the people you come to ask to speak so that if
they don't have the data you
know who else needs to be there.
Irrelevant someone from d ph. Human is in the necessary low
relevant for the frame now.
Do we need it know every different type of assault.
Not irrelevant we need to know
how many complaints and the duration of the investigations.
And so we have an idea on the
personnel needs.
If I mi.
Too far off member carrion what do we want on the agenda."
2023-04-07,inventory.
2023-04-07,make sure it is clear for dan.
2023-04-07,"inventory.
We have a next report from the sheriff inventoryeld be I part
of that.
If the sheriff we can identify speak with the sheriff and find out if they have that the information and they than I
don't it is dpa and ask them to
give us an inventory."
2023-04-07,okay
2023-04-07,"we can give the chief more details pesifiy what you money
by inventory what information
you would like them to report.
The things we just talked about. Technology.
Reports and if they investigate
something they could comment on how regular low available
information is and the process.
And so if data is hard to get. We know where the delays might be and improvements.
I think that right now at least
the tech mology is there for our interactive where the complaint
is in the press and how many complaints. Am like something in the
sheriff's office of inspector general.
But we irrelevant need ton if
they gotta go call archives to get box pulled.
I know that than I can't say,
let me just get the data and come up with the report.
This would be in an ideal situation."
2023-04-07,"I think we can all end e mills to dan and the agenda
should be reviewed by member
carrion and week
chter I can ask
people what types of materials
are oig is likely to need given they will do complaint
investigation and audits.
Why I'm sure they will be able
to provide that information to
include this on the inventory y. grit that would be helpful.
I believe if others have pacific questions they have for the sheriffy department they should
pose them I know member palmer had I concern he express body
the criteria they use in
screening out candidates. You mentioned that something you
would like to know y. For sure there were so men people that
were screened out.
I thought all this time before becoming a board member of this
board that -- you know people
were not putting in applications
and could in the find people. After listen to him speak I
thought there is a lot of people that could become sheriffs if than I went through a program to get them red.
Or the in criteria was less strict, you know. We need people from our
community to represent us in the sheriff's department and people that look like this board and
need says to be diverse and upon
the press noteds to be made open
andiel I would be -- not only
interested in knowing more
detail in what this qualifies
rather than what qualifies
people employed you like that on for I future report.
All the points of disquestions of law sxifkz who decides than I meet that. Why request to speak"
2023-04-07,"now commissioner palmer do
you think that should be like a
7 roll presentation or could
this wait until we focus on
getting the inventory of
information that an ig would need. The sheriff can only report so much. Right.
they have to e mass all of this
information we heard takes
personnel resources and when not. Do you think that screening
process you are indicating is
should be a prior in our next meeting?
Or can it wait until 2 meetings.
Or 3 that's all."
2023-04-07,"I mean it is not necessary
low have a next month.
But red for the ig and review it and hand it you have to him had
we agree and not agree that can
wait closer to the inspector general."
2023-04-07,"this is the goal my goal that's bh we say priorities make
the list of had we want and if
these 3 top once are the once we
need to hear about for next
meeting not meaning weingly not
heart others prioritize for the given stage this is burden is in.
This will change we are going to
be changing."
2023-04-07,"I like to see on the agenda
in the next meeting but the 40
on record, presentation from d ph I'm thinking about the meeting we had with the family came out and talking about when was going on in custody.
The public should know in lieu
of us going after the ig.
How the part that d ph plays in the system.
And having them present so this folks know."
2023-04-07,"the cent recommend person in charge of the jail that's why
given news reports I wanted to
make sure that there was
attention paid to jail house and
the protocols when I was on a
hospital burden for 9 years when the patient come in and screened. society public knows that is
down the road, too.
But I wanted to get focus priors
I'm looking at member upon
nguyen you rep labor.
Wield want to know what are
prescriptional things you see as
improvements with technology.
Right now you get drafts for
over time. Noinvoluntary.
What -- if you had a wish list. What could be improve exclude
get to the other things now there has been pol revisions.
We will look at this down the road.
Now just looking at the basics
what would an ig walk into and
the vision for an ig to improve? When would you like this presentation the next meeting"
2023-04-07,"can be 2-3 from now I wanted
to get on the record."
2023-04-07,"can you tell them we would
like a report and members who
have issues community this to
dan so they can have time to get
had red and agendaize that for a meeting that appropriate."
2023-04-07,"other future agenda items
in why okay.
Thank you for those.
Public men on this merit."
2023-04-07,"did you have the future
policy presentation at the revision.
So that will come down. Too."
2023-04-07,future policy.
2023-04-07,the policy revisions by history we should have the presentation on the updated policies.
2023-04-07,okay.
2023-04-07,"it was in the clear whether
than I had updated all the
policies or specific ones."
2023-04-07,"I'm not sure either buff I
do recall the live date of april 15th.
We know when than I will be out to see that."
2023-04-07,might have.
2023-04-07,"[Inaudible].
We have pol procedure machineual, custody machineual
and now lexy [Inaudible] It is a
change nou how they are done. Should be consistent.
For when they cover in the same
way but it is you can't you
can't draw a link one policy and
the next and it hen a 3 year
process in meet and conifer ferring conferring.
Why I think a 600 plus page document.
Men we can specify which
policies we like to on more specific information on how they have been updated."
2023-04-07,"you will see tell be posted on the website you will see the new policies.
The olds once taken down.
And new once put up APRIL 15th.
MAY be we would get highlights and an over vow.
You look and say this is the new one.
There is in the really not a highlight.
This is the new structure.
But if you are asking questions
the sheriff can respond.
I have a recommendation after
APRIL felonyo should look and then identify theories
priorities we want to understand
and then decide, we will not
have the sheriff's try to break
down a 600 page document in a meading.
When we can do is look at the
policies that are relevant to
issues brought up by community members and in the future we
like this to be explained how
this is a new structure.
Why I think mirror our training
get in custody de- esque ligz.
High risk and to incars rit
exclude how they are.
We have to have a broad over
view and highlights would be
instructive. For the mimeeting. If its in. Otherwise.
You recommend this we put this
on the agenda to have a
discussion amongst the board of
what -- policy wield be --  having.
And then we can prioritize that
list approximate begin the time we in the agenda.
Why could we sends things to dan
and we have a frame w we are not
brain storming and have a list
and prioritize the list.
Later meeting."
2023-04-07,okay.
2023-04-07,"okay.
You have a hard stop in 9
minutes I want to you have time

2023-03-03,"before we hear from dhr, I
want to thank dhr for their arduous work in such a short period of time. As the public
will recall, we began a drafting process for the description and turned it over
to dhr to refine. In the meantime, dhr staff interviewed
each board member independently to gather thoughts and so they refined I think what looks to
be a very good comprehensive inspector general solicitation
and we and as PRESIDENT Wechter mentioned we are having the beginning of community meetings. We expect to have possibly close to 5.
We are culminating things into districts. So bayview is the first and fillmore, mission and
then the west side of town including china town, soma, richmond and sunset. Thank you members of the public for your input and looking for notices so you can participate. With that, I like to invite dhr to give us a report. Thank you."
2023-03-03,"thank you member soo. My name is palm green, department
of human resources and here with colleague ben richie. Pleshing with meeting with most of the commissioners over the past couple weeks to get insights and thoughts on what are the ideal qualities that make the selection for the inspector general
position. We gathdered input from all you and combine under to the draft announcement previously created by the committee of this board, and that job announcement was i believe included in the agenda and publicly posted to here to address any questions you MAY have about it. I would like to make a comment about the announcement you received.
There was a clerical
change to compensational section. 0961 classification has a different
salary range. Range a and b. The announcement you received
only stated range a
:
It is amended to show the range b salary now included into the
tops at out $224.484. Please
note that the board has discretion to appoint the the candidate among everywhere in
the range a but range b requires special approval process with dhr."
2023-03-03,"I want to thank you for the time you devoted to this and particularly for reviewing the multiple job descriptions job announcements for similar positions that I provided. I
think you did a excellent job synthesizes. There are elements to many different descriptions. F"
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,discussion?
2023-03-03,"we also drafted a brochure that would be used to give more color and flash. Happy to show
it now. It contains all the same information, just
a little flashier. Dan."
2023-03-03,"my only concern, which I expressed in an e-mail exchange and you explained the ezrooen why, it has the 5 years of management experience, and I
said I fear that could -- 5 years opposes to maybe 2 years of management experiences could potentially screen out many potentially qualified applicants. For example, katherine lee former berkeley police commissioner officer who
will be speaking to us did not have 5 years of experience and did a excellent job in her role so you explained that is something the city required for department head positions and you said that is something the board could potentially adjust."
2023-03-03,"that is correct. Those are just guidelines. Our
guidelines for that classification requires 4-6 years of manager experience. This was created after review
of the department head classifications and decided the appropriate number of years to manage the department because it involves administration, the budget, dealing with the mayor office. It is more then just the core task so quhie that was established but that was just
guide 37 lined. If the board wishes to amend the qualifications they
are free to do so."
2023-03-03,"I like to mike a
motion to adopt with 5 years experience,
2 years in management.
Under the experience listing."
2023-03-03,"I have one thing before you
take a vote. 5 years
with 3 years of supervisor experience, I want to make sure how you want the supervisor experience
to show up or not at all. I
could be wrong. One
second.
All the 5 years must be including supervisor experience so 2 years of management which must be supervisor experience."
2023-03-03,"yes. Is there a
second for the motion?"
2023-03-03,I second it.
2023-03-03,is there discussion before we take public comment?
2023-03-03,"I have a comment. I think I
am concerned with adding the nacole certification requirement and I would request
it be removed. We currently have a member of large PRESIDENT Wechter you have a board of director of nacole, I believe it MAY be conflict of interest to require somebody, anyone to apply
through a
specific board organization and certification. That would require that person to spend any funds to get training-"
2023-03-03,"it isn't a require, it is desirable qualification. They are not required to get the certification at any
point."
2023-03-03,"great. I do want to pose though that it does seem there is some kind of conflict if we have a board of director that we are saying we prioritize this particular organization. There are different organizations such as the audit police auditor association, there is also the police inspector association, and there is a lot of different other entities that do this
type of work that are not nacole so I want to highlight that also because I think it is important we always insure that
there seems to be no direct
conflicktd with any board
commissioners here as well as partner and community agencies."
2023-03-03,"I will say in response to that that has been listed in other job announcements. That's where it is taken from. I can think of at least one job announcement that required either possession of the credential or attainment of it
within a set period of time. Again, as he explained
it is a desirable qualification, not required. If you like to add
under those listed desirable qualifications certification for many of the other
organizations I ink that would be fine but as a member of the nacole board of directors I serve without pay, it is a volunteer endeavor, so don't stand to gain monetarily in any way from someone obtaining the credential."
2023-03-03,"I understand that. I think
the ishee issue it is a requirement any potential
applicant to a leadership organization in which you serve in a leadership role in a board at large, so whether that is steering people towards membership or using any of the
training or require to
go to a conference which there is a conference
requirement. Seems nacole
:   I'm concerned-the issue is not
that it is listed in other job descriptions or that it is or
is not a desirable qualification, it is that there
is a board member at large of nacole on this commission and we should make sure that there does not seem to be any kind of preference whether it is desirable or not to something where we have a leader
in a different organization."
2023-03-03,"other discussion on the
motion?"
2023-03-03,"personally, I don't see a conflict of interest, only because it is desirable qualification. Just
like having community experience is
another desirable qualification. And, to just to wechters point, if we wanted to
add other community orgs
or -- national associations to
that list after no nacole, I
feel I'm open to that as well."
2023-03-03,"discussion from
other board
members?"
2023-03-03,you are good.
2023-03-03,"I would concur with vice PRESIDENT Carrion. We could keep adding things, but it just
seems to add a particular bent and the charter already states
that we will at least the board members will follow best practices and I think that also includes the inspector general and inspector general office. So nacole is mentioned in the charter so don't think we need
to go beyond that in the job solicitation. I also feel very
firm about the 5 years of
management. We have
a-all most
a with all the layers having to navigate city administration,
it takes a lot of leadership and dan thank you to you for wearing 3 hats. Also looking that we have been covid for 3 years and there are people who had a job for several years who have not been the office. I have no colleagues that are attorneys and sure
they are very competent but only see some virtually and
there was a big diferance with someone having the experience having
worked in person working with colleagues navigating different departments, so I feel strongly
about the 5 year management experience. I dont think it would be prohibitive and we are screening in people rather then screening out people because our education our required education is merely about a bachelor degree, so much will be balanced by work experience
and life experience."
2023-03-03,"members have
discussion or
questions? Can you take public comment, please?"
2023-03-03,did you want to see the presentation?
2023-03-03,"okay. Yes. Sorry. I
thought that was it."
2023-03-03,"we are showing the brochure we drafted up. If you like a
copy we can send it out later."
2023-03-03,"I was going to add, I
discussed the writing samples and written questions. i think this make a applicant
life easier and I-surmise a lot of the really great candidates are
very busy people so I think this is easy enough process to screen in a large pool and we can go through another phase with written questions and dhr will advice how tew
conduct the in-person interviews including permissible question. There is training video training and
also the certification
of-"
2023-03-03,"thank you for that context. I do think now that I'm thinking about it, probably a
good mix of having education and work experience to balance
out. Just want ed to
agree."
2023-03-03,"if no further discussion, dan can you call for public
comment, please? [Providing
instructions for
public comment]"
2023-03-03,there are no callers.
2023-03-03,"okay. Do you want to call
the roll on the question dan?
On the motion."
2023-03-03,I believe your-can restate the motion to make sure-
2023-03-03,"under the paragraph labeled experience, it be changed only
to require 5 years of experience, 2 years of
that in management. Leaving the rest
as it is."
2023-03-03,member afuhaamango had seconded. We'll take the vote for line item 3- [Roll call]
2023-03-03,"I will say now and okay to
keep as is to 5 years."
2023-03-03,is the second withdrawn?
2023-03-03,yeah.
2023-03-03,is there another second? If not then I would move to make another motion.
2023-03-03,don't we have to finish calling the roll on this one?
2023-03-03,second would withdrawl. I just withdrew my second.
2023-03-03,"okay. Alright. Is anyone
else willing to second the
motion? Okay."
2023-03-03,"now that is done, i would
move to adopt the job description as provided here
with exclusion of the nacole provision given we do have best practices and there is
reference in there."
2023-03-03,I second it.
2023-03-03,is the discussion on the motion?
2023-03-03,"I want to state,
I'm okay with the nacole piece. It is in the desirable section. Member soo bringz up a good point with dan. For me and being executive director and putting together all the countless job descriptions folkerize doing so much more then what is in the description and think the minimal barriers we have people applying gives a
much larger pool so I wanted to state. I'm fine with it as is, however if we want to remove, I understand as well too."
2023-03-03,"I personally feel strongly as a member of the state bar, I just try to avoid even the-this is our legal standard appearance of bias. It isn't direct bias, but appearance, so I wanted to assure the members
of the public that we are transparent and we don't favor
one organization over
another adding other organizations doesn't make it better and you notice desirable as having a
law degree but not specifying
how many years of practice. It is bachelor degree and career
and life experiences."
2023-03-03,"I will say that nacole is
the the only organization exclusively devoted to oversight of law enforcement. They have been in existence
over 20 years. They provide
invaluable training. Member
soo, attended the conference last year and think she gained
quite a bit from it, and as mentioned before, we are likely to draw many
applicants from the nacole community. These are people involved in oversight or supportive of
oversight so I think having-this is desirable qualification, this signals to
them that we recognize professionalism. Their commitment to professionalism. Their education, and their involvement in the oversight field. It is not required, it is merely desirable and I don't see there a conflict. I'm not a paid member of the
board, it is strictly voluntary. This is well established organization. We heard from several of the presidents and I would anticipate that many people involved in nacole would form the pool of people applying for this and think if you were to
ask other heads of other site
agencies MRS. Lee or michele films inspector general of oakland I think they would be supportive of recognizing the importance of someone having this credential. Again, it is
only desirable, it is not required."
2023-03-03,"going to comment. Again, I
want to just reiterate nacole does amazing work, no one is saying that. They due mazing trainings, do the symposium and conference. I see
them as a ally and partner doing this type of work. The
issue is, any iota, any smell to anything that potentially could look at bias and that's the issue. It is not-because other people MAY have different opinions of what
that MAY look like, I
understand, I think also as a attorney that has and past prosecutor with some of the most ethical obligations I take ethical obligations and transparency and accountability to the community very serious
and I want to insure that there
is absolutely not even a thought that there is any potential bias. Now, we will and I believe that one of the
lists is that we would pay nacole for a job listing, and
are we would want and I hope nacole members that hear this interested in this position do
apply. That doesn't
take away the potential perception of bias and that is the concern.
It is not a attack on nacole, it is not to say that they are
not deserving of recognitionism hopefully we will be partnering
with them in this job listing since we will be paying for the job listing and sending that to them and I think I want to make
sure that that's the issue. A job description is not
a way to commemorate somebody's good work in community. That to me
is of concern. I recognize that-actually maybe deputy nguyen probably has very high
ethical obligations as a deputy
under oath but I think for myself, this is the rational
and I want to make sure that everyone understands that that
does not mean there is something against nacole at all."
2023-03-03,is there other discussion from other members of the board?
2023-03-03,"I just have a question. For
a point of clarity. Are we
audible to soften the language instead of possession of credential maybe speak to knowledge and
experience as being a potential plus?"
2023-03-03,that works. To me it is a naming of a organization. A board member-that is all it is.
2023-03-03,"I see your point and also just-I know wechter was saying
there is probably a lot of nacole applicants, which is great. If we take that line away, doesn't bar them from
applying. But I do like having it in there in the sense of like having knowledge or
experience in the guidelines
that nacole has worked on."
2023-03-03,"if I MAY the job
description there is links to the charter, so I would assume the applicants would look at the
charter and it talks to best practices, so I don't think it
needs to be mentioned. PRESIDENT Wechter, I
rather
talk about myself. My experience with nacole and never discussed my experience
with you. I did benefit from
the organization and the conference. I noted there was a little bit of strong handedness I would say and some of the members who
have been there longer and hoping that there will be a increase of diversity, particularly our board here that there is
greater diversity and representation with nacole. I
think that comes eventually but I believe there are other organizations that have not join ed nacole and they are functioning well and
they are growing. Nacole just hired the executive director after 20 some odd years, so in a sense
it is still sort of a nascent organization. I look at my own asian american bar association association and national asian american bar and took a good number of years to build the
organization from a few hundred people and now 50 thousand and
that is the last 25 years. I want to keep it as broad as possible and I am troubled when we mention particular organizations and I think the
charter speaks for
itself."
2023-03-03,"as I said before, this does
appear in at least one other job description, job announcement for is a lar similar position and there is one that requires attainment of
this credential and I can assure I'm without bias. I
know will likely have applicants who MAY be involved in organizations or professions that are many of us are involved in and MAY
have
connection to. It does not necessarily disqualify us so I don't see it as bias. I think it is valuable to keep it in. It isn't a requirement, but it is a desirable qualification and I think it is consensus on that in the oversight community
if you were to ask oversight practitioners."
2023-03-03,"again, not to point, but the point is, if I were-I'll give you a example. If I wanted a
job and they said what desirable qualifications were, I would try to get the qualifications before I applied, right? I would go to the website, look what the certificate program is and say if this increases my chance to get the job, I will get it. The board of directors also on the one making the
decision, I am definitely going-it
can be
perceived that way. That's the
realty and I think that if someone doesn't do that then I would be a bit surprised they wouldn't just look into it because we have now steered him
into that direction."
2023-03-03,"attaining the credential requires at least 2 years. Attendance of two
conferences so it is impossible for anyone to attain the credential before the board makes a decision which I understand is likely by OCTOBER. If someone already
has it, they can mark that, but no one is able to go out and
take steps to get this."
2023-03-03,:
2023-03-03,"it takes two years, so it
will not influence any action someone can take in response to the job announcement."
2023-03-03,"but if there is appearance of bias we should avoid it, so
if you are saying it takes 2 years this isn't relevant to have it in there. I will support and did second vice
PRESIDENT Carrion's motion."
2023-03-03,"any other board members wish
to comment on this matter?
Since we have a new motion, dan can you request public
comment
on this?"
2023-03-03,"[Providing
instructions for
public comment]"
2023-03-03,there are no callers.
2023-03-03,do you want to call the vote?
2023-03-03,"on the motion to adopt the job description as provided and remove the nacole reference
from the desired
qualifications --  [Roll call]"
2023-03-03,"I would like to
keep as is."
2023-03-03,"afuhaamango, no. Member brookster."
2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.
2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,member nguyen.
2023-03-03,no.
2023-03-03,"member nguyen is
no. Member
palmer just stepped out."
2023-03-03,"member palmer just stepped
out. He's back."
2023-03-03,"member palmer we are taking
a vote on the job description
as provided and removing the nacole. Your vote, member palmer."
2023-03-03,to remove it?
2023-03-03,yes.
2023-03-03,"yes, I support it."
2023-03-03,member soo.
2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,PRESIDENT Wechter.
2023-03-03,no.
2023-03-03,"we have a majority vote.
The motion passes."
2023-03-03,"I know you heard, but great job. Thank you for all the work and the interviews I found
were very thoughtful and they
were really helpful in kind of getting myself to articulate what are the qualifications I want to see and that are very important and I thought it was very well done, so thank you
very much to all yourself and your team."
2023-03-03,thank you. We appreciate that.
2023-03-03,"I provided you with a list of a number of places where it could be posted. Do other board members have suggestions
for professional others, publications, other places it could be posted?"
2023-03-03,there was an e-mail sent out to all the members.
2023-03-03,okay.
2023-03-03,I'll respond to thee-mail directly.
2023-03-03,can you out line the next steps and time table?
2023-03-03,"to time table is what was previously presented by member soo so that is probably ahead
of schedule getting it posted. One issue is the posting to the organizations you want. Dhr does not have a mechanism to pay the organizations independently. Normally if you
do that outreach executive recruiting firm will be handling that. I don't believe
this department has a mechanism to pay either so one possible
solution is for one or multiple new members to pay individually and get reimbursed by the
department."
2023-03-03,for bord members to pay individually?
2023-03-03,"correct, but it is reimbursed but exploring other options to see if we can find a better solution."
2023-03-03,"I would be waying to pay
individual and seek reimbursement because I think is important to disseminate as
widely as possible to as broad a audience as possible."
2023-03-03,"the posting will ask for 4 weeks we decided and following that we will screen the applications dependenting how many applications we receive.
We hope to do that following the announcement and those will be into most qualified, qualified and
:   Forwarded to the board for discussion and possible interviews in the future and
what other selection criteria
we wish."
2023-03-03,"just-what will be the
process to seek reimbursement? I'm familiar."
2023-03-03,that I have to get back to you on. I don't know the criteria off the top of my head.
2023-03-03,"I appreciate it is posted for 4 weeks, because we are posting this to a nation wide audience, a nation wide search and someone living out of state or across the country cannot make a snap decision to apply for a job in california and MAY need to weigh that before they decides to submit an application so thank you again
for your work. This is incredibly helpful and appreciate it. F"
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,thank you MR. Richie.
2023-03-03,would you please call the next item?
2023-03-03,"line item 4, nacole national association for civilian oversight law
enforcement code
of ethics. Discussion and possible action. Review the
code of ethics for possible adoption."
2023-03-03,I make a motion we adopt the nacole code of ethics.
2023-03-03,there is a point of order question.
2023-03-03,yes.
2023-03-03,"this as I indicated by e-mail, this particular item was tabled by my motion. It was voted by majority of the board to be tabled. In order
to be added to the agenda pursuant to robert rules of order article 5 section 25 I
believe that deals with tabling, this is an
item that should have been added to the
agenda to be taken off the table. I had brought this to
the attention of PRESIDENT Wechter as I always do
with any agenda. Yet again another of
my agenda requests has been
disregarded. None of the agenda requests I made as vice PRESIDENT And even though it is in our rules of order that the vice PRESIDENT Would in consultation with the PRESIDENT Set the agenda. None of my
suggestions had been taken into consideration. To have this on
the agenda after the entire board has voted to table it without following the proper
procedures shows complete disrespect of the board members
that voted to have this tabled. Our rules of order state that the PRESIDENT In consultation
with the vp set the agend item. That does not mean that the PRESIDENT MAY disregard motions
of the board. Doesn't give the PRESIDENT Veto power. Doesn't
give the PRESIDENT Additional power, so I do think there is a point of order and I would move
to remove this and post pone indefinitely. This line item given the current posture."
2023-03-03,"I like to respond. As I
said before rfx I dont think personal attacks are helpful for the board. I dont think they advance our mission and
the tasks before us, but I do want to respond your claim I disregarded after our SEPTEMBER meeting member afuhaamango requested a presentation by brian williams of the los angeles county sheriff department oversight
commission, and I placed it on the agenda. You called me and requested it be taken off. I spoke to member afuhaamango, she agreed to that and response to your request I took it off the agenda. I believe our JANUARY meeting you requested
to hear presentation from someone from a number of board
of commissions that had recruitment without using a firm and in response I spent a great deal of time talking to people around the
country est posting on the nacole list serve who had done
that type of recruitment and find
:   Can't remember her last name from madison wisconsin who had done a recent recruitment and
had a great deal of information and arranged for her to give a presentation and to provide to
me the job description announcement they used which I shared with the fellow members. So, those are two occasions when you did make
request that
I fallowed. I believe that was tabled for one meeting. Can you help me understand why you are opposed for the bord to vote on adoption of the nacole board of ethics?"
2023-03-03,"the public agenda was still included that. I informed you there was going to be
for the
previous incident. So, personal attacks are different then stating facts. What I'm stating are facts of
what has happened. Whether you see them
as facts maybe you don't and that's fine. But what is
happening here is that the PRESIDENT Continues to disregard the majority of the board. It is happening in so
many different ways. At this time my concern with having
this here, which is reiterated several times it keeps being pushed over, nacole, it isn't part of our immediate goals. Why are we talking about this now? Can we talk about what the 6 things to do are? I don't understand why it takes so much time off our agenda when it is not primary to what we need to do. You are waisting my time. You are wasting commission time and community time by looking at
all these issues attacking our partners, attacking the sheriff, doing all shady things
outside of the public, it needs
to stop. Just stop. It just needs to stop. We need to
focus on what we need to do. Considering nacole to me is not
part of our immediate mission. Let's not move forward. Let's stop. Let's talk about what we
need to do. If we want to do more on nacole, great, but
every board meeting we are getting nacole shoved down our throats, and they are saying there is no implicit bias but there seems to be bias if it just keeps being put on and on and on when folks are saying can we focus on what we are
here to do. Can we focus on hiring inspector general? Can we focus on that?"
2023-03-03,"quick question. Just for context, when was this tabled? Was this the last meeting?
Okay. Got it."
2023-03-03,"I didn't want to point, it is incorrect. The statement
for nacole is incorrect. It
just has errors in it. For example, it says that it is the office of citizens complaints for san francisco.
that office
no-that is predecessor of dpa.
I don't know if dpa adopted this or not. It is incorrect
and poorly written and I-the
way things have been going outside of the
meetings, it is shady. I just want it to stop."
2023-03-03,"for my perspective, I don't mind that line item. I wish I was here for the last meeting,
however I do agree we have more pressing things we
need to focus on. Specifically with the hiring of the ig
and then also just the media policy that is very very important
to me, and then -- I wanted to add that in."
2023-03-03,I like just really quick I was going to say it is something we talked about and for me I think there was a motion put on the floor I will second to have it removed and then I think maybe further down the line as we get through some things that are more pressing then we can bring it back up.
2023-03-03,I have no issue bringing that up at the appropriate time.
2023-03-03,"I want to make a clarification. A continuance means it roles to the next set of agendas. I think vice PRESIDENT Carrion, you might have put in post ponement which requires a time certain, and so the motion that was made was there was a table and a table requires a motion to bring it
back off the table, so it really should not be on the agenda especially when vice PRESIDENT Carrion brought it to your attention."
2023-03-03,"to give context why I put this on the agenda last
meeting, when we drafted mission statements, I created a draft that referenced adherence
to the nacole code of ethics. Member soo and member palmer
collaborated on alternatives mission statements, and I in
the spirit of compromise and collaboration said I would take my mission statement off the table out of consideration, but I had the understanding we will
be able to vote on the nacole
code of ethics separately. It did not seem to me something
that is controversial. If there is something in the code of-"
2023-03-03,PRESIDENT Wechter-
2023-03-03,"I have the floor, please. If there is something in the code of ethics itself that you
object to, we can disscuss that. That is several years old and adopt ed when it was the office of citizen complaints, but the code of ethics itself I are think is a
good document and I just-I'm unclear-it isn't clear why you would not want us to have the opportunity to vote on this. This is relevant."
2023-03-03,"you are discussing the merits and we are discussing whether or not it should be on the agenda and there is a
motion, so unless you discuss
the motion I think-we should take public comment and then-"
2023-03-03,"I'm discuss the motion because I will address points that vice PRESIDENT Carrion made. You reference recruitment. One of the first things potential applicants will do is look at our website. If they see we adopted the nacole code of ethics that will be a positive signal to them.
However, if they watch these meetings and see on two occasions we refuse to take a vote that is also going to send a strong signal and think deter qualifies applicants. I'm not
the only who things this. I have spoken to several in the oversight community and said
the same thing. If you refuse
to adopt this it sends a powerful mesen 250 applicants
and maybe that is intentional. I don't think why you don't want to give a
opportunity to take a vote. It would take 5 minutes. We could have accomplished it already."
2023-03-03,"PRESIDENT Wechter, the
reason why is because I am requiring that you do things properly. I am requiring that you follow procedure. That's what we need to do here. We
are a commission of transparency accountability and we need to make sure that when we do something we do it the right way. So, when there has been a motion to table that
should be respected procedurally. Again, this is not against nacole, this is about doing things the right thing. That means not calling board members and saying can you be on my side or vote with me or doing shady things. Stop it. Just show up and do your job. That's it. Okay? I would really appreciate it if we could go and hear the vote of the motion and we just do what we are supposed to be
doing. Do what we were
appointed here to do. It is
not much to ask. I will
continue to hold our members including you-you are the only retired person, the only person that can look up the stuff probably more then we can, so if you want to use
your time I would suggest you learn how to follow the rules of the meeting. There is robert rules
of order. We have our own rules. I'm going to require especially as a attorney as someone who has my ethical obligations to do
things by the book and procedurally this is not by the book. That's what I'm pointing out. You can make as many arguments regarding
merits as you want, that is not
the point and you keep missing
the point because you decided what you want to do for some reason it doesn't matter if there is majority vote of other people. Of the people on this board. You will do what you want to do. That's a problem
and it needs to stop."
2023-03-03,we did not have the full board present at the last meeting and we do now and like the full board to weigh in.
2023-03-03,can I be recognized?
2023-03-03,yes.
2023-03-03,"I want to clarify with there city attorney, if we had a
motion to table the nacole code of ethics, can we bring it back?"
2023-03-03,"yes, it is just a vote required."
2023-03-03,yes. Absolutely. That's it.
2023-03-03,"so I want to clarification, because-for the last one we tabled it, right? Now we are
bringing it back?"
2023-03-03,we vote on it to bring it back and that's my point. I pointed that out for the agenda you can't just add things that the other board members says we are not going to deal with this now. That is all we said. It is a tabled. It doesn't-
2023-03-03,what are the rules for the tabling? How long is the timeframe to bring it back?
2023-03-03,"it is when ever-it could be
a motion to put on the other agenda."
2023-03-03,got it.
2023-03-03,"that's it. My justification for this motion and taking the time on something that MAY be
:
Is to make a statement that we
will all follow the rules, procedural and substantive and that's what we need to do regardless if we disagree. We
need to all follow the rules.
Regardless of our titles and anything. When we make mistakes if we make mistakes
and hopefully we will not, then we'll correct them. I'm trying
to insure we correct them immediately so we do
not have a culture of disregarding the process, the proper process."
2023-03-03,"so, in that case, we can't even have a motion to adopt it because we have to have a
motion to bring it back."
2023-03-03,correct.
2023-03-03,now we can't consider it.
2023-03-03,correct.
2023-03-03,will you allow us to vote on a motion to bring it back?
2023-03-03,"there is currently a motion
on the table."
2023-03-03,would you allow a motion to bring it back?
2023-03-03,there is a current motion on the table to take it off the agenda.
2023-03-03,it isn't-just to take it off.
2023-03-03,which means it will not have a opportunity to vote up and down on it.
2023-03-03,"that's correct. I think next time if you want to avoid this, do it right."
2023-03-03,"I think we could take it off and talk about it later on after we get whether the other pressing issues out of the way
rchlt I don't think it hurts to revisit at a later time."
2023-03-03,"member wechter and don't know if you had time to look at the last meeting, I thought it was crucial we need to follow
what the public want said and hire the inspector general.
Thank you for vice mayor carrion. I soo full time job but have taken man y hours to
do this and moves thing fl frward and dhr was
able to help us along and I hope you benefited from the individual interview by them, but also what is pressing is we
need to hear from cathy lee and also
have a sheriff report, and member afuhaamango has been asking for a media policy since day one and as we come upon these community meetings I think it is so important that she being a expert in social media and are member palmer who is very involved in the media, I was a former reporter that we get there word out so most community members will participate in what we are going to do, and this is about transparency and not
about making phone calls that violate the brone act and sunshine ordinance trying to solicit votes. It makes it so much harder-it is nice to say we have volunteers and if we didn't have a quorum we could have done things, but because vice PRESIDENT Carrion had to make a motion to have a committee we had to have a special meeting and are that
taxes support staff but mainly
diane wearing 3 or 4 hats and it staff so glad you recognize that really we do have more pressing issues member nguyen."
2023-03-03,"dan, can we have a vote for the pending motion?"
2023-03-03,"I will take public comment first. [Providing
instructions for
public comment] There appears to be no public comment. We'll take a vote on
the motion to table
this item indefinitely pending motion to
bring it back. Member afuhaamango."
2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,member brookster.
2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,vice PRESIDENT Carrion.

2023-03-03,aye.
2023-03-03,PRESIDENT Wechter.
2023-03-03,no.
2023-03-03,"majority votes the motion is tabled indefinitely pending
motion to bring it
back."
2023-03-03,"I want to add just as a-I want to say thank you wechter because I know you have a lot
of experience and I I
appreciate your additional context. Right now we just to the other board members point, we have more pressing issues we need to get to, but I'm open to talking about that at a later time."
2023-03-03,"likewise, thank you, and I do like the nacoleode of ethics but I think it is good idea to table it for right now."
2023-03-03,"just to clarify, to bring it
back we have to agendize an item to bring it back, is that it?"
2023-03-03,I think there has to be a motion at a meeting to bring it back to the next meeting so it gets agendized. That is probably future agendized item is where it would have to be-
2023-03-03,"can you clarify how that has
to be agendized?"
2023-03-03,"I think the motion you adopted it was off the agenda and there is a motion to bring it back. I suppose you can do both. Where I sit what is important, whatever you do at a
meeting is agendized so as long as both items are on the agenda both can be addressed. From the perspective I sit which is brown act and sunshine act open meeting law, just so I was
going to jump in, but the conversation continued so didn't want to
interrupt but to member nguyen's question, our office doesn't advise on things
like robert rule of order. That is how you all conduct your meetings, as long as consistent with the open meeting laws I just mentioned it is entirely up to the board."
2023-03-03,"thank you. Call the next
item on the agenda. Is MRS. Lee ready?"
2023-03-03,"she is online. Presentation
by katherine lee. Discussion. Former director of police accountability and berkeley police commission officer. Appearing remotely to give a presentation on her time as
director of police accountability and berkeley police commission officer and
answer questions from the
board."
2023-03-03,can you hear me now?
2023-03-03,yes.
2023-03-03,"okay. I'm seeing
two of me which is disconcerting-we are
seeing one of me or
:
Thank you very much for having me PRESIDENT Wechter and
members of the board. As
mentioned my name is katherine lee, the former director of police accountability and
actually the former interim director of police accountability for berkeley and
had the position from JUNE 2021 until my retirement at the end
of JULY 2022. Before that my title was police review commission officer was a title
but I was the head of the police review commission staff for city berkeley and I had
held that position from JANUARY 2013. I oversaw the transition from the old police review commission to the office of
director of police accountability and new police accountability board. They came into being through a charter amendment
passed in NOVEMBER 2020 to strengthen the police oversight authority in berkeley. While berkeley police review
commission was established in 1973, making it
one of the oldest civilian oversight agencies over law
enforcement in the country, over time that model
became somewhat outdated. The police review commission officer was appointed by and part of the city manager office and I
reported to a deputy city manager. We had very
limited
access to records. We were an
investigatory bodies our
findings were advisory only.
:   I do credit the two city managers for whom I worked for being fairly hands off, but
there was a inherent
tension being supervisor working under the city manager who was also
the supervisor of the chief of
police and the police department. As there director of police
accountability, I was appointed by the city council
and the office is independent
of city manager. We are able to present our own budget and have greater access to records and I'll talk more
about that later. Our findings have a little more teeth in that must formally be considered
by the
chief of police. So, the basic model remain said the same.
That is, we receive and
investigate complaints
and the police accountability board
with the support of my office reviews police department
policies practice and procedures. Just to give you a
idea of the magnitude of our job, the city berkeley is
currently budgeted for 151 sworn officers. I was asked specifically to
address a couple items in comparing my office with the office of the inspector general that
you will be overseeing. In terms of resources, in the first year of the office of director of police accountability we were budgeted for 4 staff and that was the director, an
investigator, a policy analyst, and administrative support staff. The police review commission staff was three
people and we served as interim staff for the new
director of police accountability office and one was myself, director, a investigator and support
person. I was originally appointed for a 6
month term
interim term and so I
:   It would be better for the permanent director to hire that person. As it turned
out, the
process of recruiting my
permanent replacement took longer then inspected so I
stayed a year and a
month and limped along
:
During that time. I did
successfully advocate
for a 5th
position for the current
budget so the budget years JULY
1 to JUNE 30. Currently there
are staff in the office and I
think the new director is figuring out what he wants that
5th position to be. In terms
of resources I would say
staffing wise, one investigator
was adequate. I think the thinking was, if there
was a
need for more resources in terms of investigations that it would be the city wanted to be
more flexible in say,
hiring a contract basis and additional investigator or investigators
rather then committing to
another fte to be an investigator. I would say that
side of it was adequate. I think in terms of supporting the board's policy work that really did take up a lot of my time, and I really would have benefited by having some help
with that, and I think what
:   I was kind of sad not to be
able to do more of that and really let the community know what this new body was and what
our expanded powers were.
That's where we were there. I noticed in the description of
the oig that the investigator staffing level is tied to the
number of sworn deputies and
think that great. Obviously it is built in that you have a
certain number of amount of resources, which I
think is great. In terms of access to records, according to the charter amendment, my office and police accountability board are supposed to have fairly
broad access to records.
:
Aspect of our new structure
that really was not completely hammered out during my time
there. It was really a change for the police
department to be handing over more records, providing more access. One police officer described it to
me as a paradigm shift in thinking about what they did to release to us and I do not believe that we were getting everything that we should have
been and that's an ongoing
issue I would imagine. Enabling legislation looks similar in terms of access to records and think the devil will be in the details. I dont
know to what extent the sheriff department was cooperated with
the director of police accountability. Your director of police accountability who I understand has broad
access as well. I think a lot of the issue for the city berkeley was
the way it was before
versus the change. This should-eyeage
maen I imagine a less a problem if your dpa has a lot
of access and has the level of cooperation from the sheriff department that he needs. In
terms of access to facilities, that is not addressed in our charter and it is really for the berkeley police department a small department and we are
not a sheriff office, not as
big a issue mpt we have a small jail but for very short time
holds, so that really is not
mentioned in the charter. I
think that I have
addressed the things chair wechter and board
member soo had specifically
asked me to address, and happy to answer any questions you might have."
2023-03-03,"thank you so cathy. I think before I have my colleagues ask you questions, I also wanted you to talk about your qualifications a little bit more and you look so young but you have several decades with berkeley and you are also an attorney so I want you to talk about just your increasing role with the city of berkeley and role as a attorney."
2023-03-03,"thank you. I actually have
what I call 3 chapters with city berkeley. I started out in the city attorney office. I was a deputy city attorney, and then I was there for about 8
years and then went to the rent
stabilization board where I
was a hearing officer for 16
years and I think both
of these experiences really
:
The legal side is really helpful, having the breath and I did not represent the police department when I was in the
city attorney 's office. I did public works matters and reviewed contracts and leases.
As far as being a
hearing officer, I developed those listening skills and listening
to both sides. In holding hearings I would write decisions but also try to get parties to settle and I had
training in mediation
as well.
So, being able or having that background and all that experience in
listening to both sides and hearing out the facts and judging credibility, I
think those were really helpful
skills that I brought over to
the police review commission
when I was appointed by the
city manager for that position."
2023-03-03,"thank you. I should we open
to questions from
colleagues."
2023-03-03,"I have a question. I understand you are there for 6 months on interim
basis. Sor
ry, this is vp, chief carrion. Thank you MRS. Lee for taking time out of your busy schedule to join today. I understand
you were there 6 months in interim basis and then you were there and have been there in
full time capacity."
2023-03-03,"excuse me-if I MAY interrupt, retired
last year. It original 6 month temporary appointment and another 7
months while the city went through the recruitment process for permanent person, because I
knew I didn't-I want ed to
retire and thank you julie-I am
of retirement age and so I
stayed to oversee the position and to be there to make sure there was a director there. That was important to have somebody in there until a permanent person came on."
2023-03-03,thank you for the clarification.
2023-03-03,sure.
2023-03-03,"my first question, the first question is, of the qualifications that you have
from your personal and educational experience, what
have you found the most useful
in your capacity as inspector general, and second, knowing that hindsight 2020, what would have been some things you would have done differently within the first 3 months of you being either in your interim position
or then in the full
capacity?"
2023-03-03,"okay. I can go back to what I already mentioned, which is first of all, being a lawyer,
trained as a lawyer, actually
practicing as one was very helpful. Basic analytical skills that lawyers are trained
for and use all the
time. And
then as a rent board hearing officer, not just-I guess let
me add to what I had talked about earlier. Not just
hearing the cases, but
having-just a wide
diverse segment of the population appeared before me. There were
of course some corporate
landlords and mom and pop landlords and tenants came from
all walks of life as you could imagine were not very well off
and what I learned was there
was no-just because tenant wasn't always right and landlord not always wrong, of
course there were pred
:
So, that taught me not to pre-judge. The second question was?"
2023-03-03,"the first three months hindsight 2020, what are key things that you would have
changed from what you actually
did looking back to improve the performance of the
duties you have?"
2023-03-03,"maybe I would have-I'll take
2 it back to the beginning as a police commission officer because that experience really helped me with beginning of
being the director of police accountability. I have no criminal law experience, very
little, so in hindsite rkts maybe it would have deviled
into that a little more deeply
earlier and got an better understanding of how the criminal justice system worked
and police work in particular.
I came to and I had to understand that the system process and
investigative police, investigative procedures
, I had to learn and pick them up, but hindsight, maybe more a
crash course in all
that in
police procedures. In terms of
my first three months-first few
months of director of police accountability,
figuring out a
way maybe to do publicity.
Maybe I could have asked board members to have dealt with that because I feel that was important. I was under-staffed
and so I had to pick and choose and I really
:   Because that was important.
The board needed to develop interim regulations for handling complaints and the whole year actually it took more then a year. They were
not done by the time I left.
That was something that just
:
And policy matters."
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,"other questions for MRS.
Lee?"
2023-03-03,"I wanted to touch cathy on
kind of oversight experience
you had. I think it was characterized you were not necessarily a manager
but be
ing a attorney and having a paralegal there is management and starting a office from scratch. With your overall
experience, can you describe what benefited you the most in
terms of learning how
to run a
office?"
2023-03-03,"probably just life experience by that point. You
are right, I did -- I oversaw and supervised the legal secretary in the attorney office
and oversaw administrative person
or two at the rent board. I think it helped for me in particular, it helped having work at the city berkeley so
many years, so that
was a big
plus because I knew administratively and bureaucratically how thingz got
done, so I had a leg up there.
It is true as PRESIDENT Wechter said, that I did not have 5
years of strict manager experience or I had other experience that was
helpful in
that regard, so I think that's
listening to your discussion on
that issue, I think I understand the pros
and cons of that and wanting that
5 year of
manager, but at the same time, sometimes similar
experience
can be gained in other ways. Did I answer your question?"
2023-03-03,"you did. We really looked at the desired qualifications
and lot of it was not strictly educational or but also life experiences and I think there
is a broad interpretation of managerial experience. I would say you're a mom of grown daughters so I think when I
look at moms managing a household is probably one of the most experiences and budgeting that lends itself to a good workplace situation. Any of my other colleagues have questions?"
2023-03-03,"cathy, could you say about
the role nacole played in your work in oversight and work of the members of your office?"
2023-03-03,"I say nacole played a very
important role, because there are-well, there are as you
know, there are agencies
oversight agencies in the bay area, but there is nobody in the city who is doing my work. I was that person, and so it was really important
to have
the support of other people doing this work and
you couldn't find them in berkeley or the bay area because we are
fortunate to have several agencies here who have over
sight agencies so I was really reliant on them whenever I needed any sort of advice from sticky situations and didn't have anybody to turn to
internally at least in the city. Attending the nacole
conferences was really helpful,
because there was just so much information that was made
available that was immediately useful and applicable
and
practical and then on a larger theoretical level, even besides
the day to day being able to gather information, helpful information to operate on a day
to day basis thinking of a larger view, the role of
oversight and how that is achieved. I guess another aspect is simply being with other people with who are doing
what you do and was really invigorating every time I went to a nacole conference and I
went every year that beginning
in 2013 to be with people who were doing this work and of
course, it is a lot different
now then 2013. We have seen
how the landscape changed since 2020, and 10 years ago it was a little bit different, a little
more of a niche area so I did
find it very helpful."
2023-03-03,any other questions?
2023-03-03,"I think I just want to thank cathy lee so much and I think
we are starting to grow the collaborative approach not just within the bay area but
nationally, so it has been beneficial to make contact jz be able to share information for best practices. I think we can all agree the bay area is very unique. It is quite diverse, so it is important that we really work together in the bay area because we do take
a regional approach. I think we will give you back your afternoon. Thank you so much cathy."
2023-03-03,thank you cathy. Appreciate it.
2023-03-03,"okay. Thank you so much for
having me. It was a
honor."
2023-03-03,"can I call for
public comment?"
2023-03-03,"[Providing
instructions for

2023-03-03,"there is one caller on the

2023-03-03,hello. Hello.
2023-03-03,"yes, caller, you are on the
line. You have two minutes."
2023-03-03,"so, commissioners,
my name

attended several of your
meetings, and I understand that
you are looking
forward to hire
an inspector general. The
other city and county of san francisco-we are not just the
city of san francisco. We are
the city and county of san
francisco and I see enough
comments and I MAY be wrong, but I feel it is very important
to read our charter.
so far,
:   More then san

department has failed

2023-03-03,"line item 6, sheriff chief report. Informational item. Presentation by the san francisco sheriff office on the
vision going forward."
2023-03-03,"hi, good afternoon everyone.
Thank you for the
opportunity
to present our vision and presentation covers three different items and think we have a powerpoint to go along with this. Hopefully we can
get that put up. Thank you. Appreciate it. I know you have a lot of work and know we tried
to get here to give you this information with everything
going on. Just just-"
2023-03-03,"sorry to interrupt, those on the phone line I like to let the public know we
have sheriff miomoto."
2023-03-03,"thank you. I apologize. I thought by now you know who I am, but I do recognize other people are listening
and on the phone. So, I am here to
actually go over some of our strategic plan. Some of the budget items that we've submitted, and also give you a
idea I believe I was-it was
communicated there were question regarding recruitment and strategy. That is concern, the previous caller mentioned concerns with the state of police and sheriff office. We
do share a lot of the same challenges as public safety entities recruiting and getting more people on board and short staffed at this time so I'll go over that. We do have in the presentation three different items we'll go over and this is
a broad overview. I offer up before presenting this information if there are any questions follow-up anything else you like to see in more detail or depth, please let us
know so we can provide that
information to you. With that being said, next slide, please. What we are going to cover this afternoon in the short presentation will be overview
of the strategic plan and goals. Overview of the proposed upcoming budget. The mission we just made to the mayor office in regards to
fiscal year 23-24,
24-25 and
thirdly the recruit ment summary and strategy. What we have done so far this fiscal and plan doing the for remainder of this fiscal year.
Next slide, please. I believe when I spoke to most individually as the board was developed and we had our
orientation given to you, I presented my vision for the sheriff office. I shared that
with you and the strategic plan
we have is the realivation of the vision. The plan provides the following structure. Six organizational goals we are trying to achieve as a sheriff office in san francisco. The plan itself lists out initiatives to support and realize each of these goals. It also list key activities in
order to complete these
initiatives. General timeframe with the-thought i
was off the hook there. Milestone timeline to achieve
the goals and identify leads for each goals. We have identified that will be following up and acting on
these goals and
initiatives. Our first one-next slide, please. Sorry. The six goals identified are listed here. I believe there was a handout provided to you and this is a
overview of that handout, the next few slides but don't intend to go through each item. Feel free to read through and review and available for
questions or follow-up at subsequent meetings. Our six
goals listed in our strategic plan are protect san francisco,
engage san francisco, improve organizational accountability, modernize technology, maximize workforce potential, and enrich training. You will see how all these are interconnected as we go. Next slide, please.
General overview of protecting san francisco is improving on public safety as mentioned by the caller. Working with our criminal justice partners with community organizations and with members in our department and outside our department to improve the quality of life in san francisco. In our budget
you'll see a little more regard
expansion of field training service, having people out there with training officers
outside of just the hospital campus, and expanded warrant
service unit which is plain clothe unit which offers up ability to support the police department in the efforts out for the operational
level of public safety. Recently over
the past year we partnered in
past legislation with the board regarding 10b work and 10a work, which is similar to 10b work the police department does, so our deputies are
allowed to sign up for overtime for commercial and retail establishments off duty to
provide security and police services in our efforts to
reduce retail theft. We also have specific line items regarding victim crime service and I mentioned
:   This was part of the budget presentation but one of many different things we are funding or asking for funding for in the coming year. One
thing I want to highlight, in relation
to some of the budgeted requests, these are things we
have done as a agency before. Big pause button for our entire community with covid. A lot of things that we let go to the way-side as we were concerned
adhere ring to health orders
and making sure everyone was safe but as we come out of
covid and believe a few days ago the health order was amended and majority of restrictive things were listed. We still have challenges in
the jails and custody
operations division to meet some things still in place that are meant to keep people safe
rfx especially in a congregate living center especially with the population that we sometimes work with. We still
have some of those concerns for everyone's health and we
operate still under covid
condition. That being said our budget reflects interest and intent moving on and open up
and revisit, redo and continue
on with the work paused during covid pandemic. Some of these next slides will reflect some of those thingz we are talking about. Next slide, please. As I mentioned, we are looking to improve in custody outcomes as part of protect san francisco goal. Providing more robust dist charge planning services for the people who are
in our system that repeatedly come
through the system. Implementing new program to addressope yd addiction. Enhance communication with providers with use of tablets.
I think I mentioned our intention to put a device in every person in custody hand so they have connectivity to the community, education and program services and as a way
for communication in the system similar to what we all have out
here out of custody using our devices and access to services. It is mentioned here too, free phone calls, this is continuation of request to make sure we have that funding because we don't take it out of our inmate welfare fund, it is something we constantly have to ask for from the city so we want to make sure we maintain and continue that. Next slide,
please. This is
actually a video of our narcan program which we started without
funding. I want to highlight a example of what we are trying to do to keep people safer and
this is about narcan, naloxone, the dispenser we all carry right now and that our deputies and staff carry in the event of a medical crisis involving
somebody who is on fentanyl.
We actually are putting those
in the housing-air areas in the bed areas and we have a program to teach everyone in custody how to use that. I know a lot of people are familiar with t but we want to make sure not that I want any drugs in jail or anyone using drugs while in jail, but we want to make sure we are realistic about expectations
and in the event somebody does
come under the influence of fentanyl or some sort of narcotic and go into some sort
of medical crisis we have tools available that can lead to immediate care from your we call bunkies but your room mate
or somebody in close
proximity. This video reflects that intention. If you can play
that, please. [Difficulty understanding
speaker on video]
Signs and symptoms include,
unresponsiveness or
sleepyness
:
What to do. First try to wake up the person. Say their name loudly. Shake them. If they are still unresponsive
call for
a deputy. Naloxone is
effective for opiate overdose
:   Until a deputy arrives there are easy quick steps to help save a life. First, lay the
person on their back. Tilt their chin up making sure the air way is clear.
Grab a pouch
containing narcan nasal spray.
Open the package.
:   One of the persons nostrils until your fingers touch the
bottom of his or her nose.
:   Naloxone works in seconds to minutes. If the person doesn't respond in 2 to 3 minutes give them a second dose. Once a deputy arrives let them know how many doses you administered and stand out of the way and the deputy will radio for the medical staff. The deputy MAY need to administer more doses. Once the victim is breathing, role them on their side. They
MAY be confused or upset. The deputy will stay with the
person until medics arrive.
Naloxone isn't replacement for medical care. It help said keep someone alive while you wait for help. If you or someone close has a opiate addiction you can talk about
the medical team
:
If approved a deputy will provide with a kit when you retrieve your belongings. On behalf of the sheriff of san francisco, thank you for being
willing to save a life. Jail
safety is all our responsibility."
2023-03-03,"thank you for showing that.
I wanted to make sure, the added benefit of showing the
video is you are training dispensing of narcan so at the next meeting make sure you have a narcan packet. That is a part of what we continue to do in the jails with our population with our staff.
This is just one of many plans videos we have and thouit
was a time to share that with you hoping to improve safety in
the jails. Despite the staffing shortfall. Next slide
is out of custody outcome. Peer advocacy and meeting at time of release. We push and
advocate for. It had been destaffed during covid pandemic timeframe and we are asking for more funding for that to
continue now. Safe passage
transport and harbor bed, coordinated entry, that is all a part of what we continue to do and something we are emphasizing in our budget asks, and also improving the number
of case managers for a certification management at pree-trial. It is something asked for. We
continue to part ner with pre-trial and support in these areas so we have more opportunity for people out of custody under case management.
Next slide, please. Our second goal is engage san francisco.
I mentioned all of you how to expand the youth program. Partner with junior foundation
which helps to create
opportunities to interact with youth and kids. The biggest challenge is staffing level and able to take advantage of the opportunities but we have interest in engaging with the youth. We have a interest in also addressing our staffing needs directly related to that engage san francisco and that
is the creation of our community engagement team. W unof the pillars of what I hope to accomplish in our vision, something I'll touch on later with you. Improving organizational accountability is our next goal.
Next slide,
please. The organizational accountability doesn't just apply to us as a agency or
myself as the sheriff. You all
obviously are part of that organizational accountability structure because you are part of the oversight board, which is something we did not have at the beginning of my tenure and something we have now which we are grateful for. Listed on the left are a number of items
that we mentioned in the budget ask. Interested increasing the out of
cell time for incustody.
:   Partnership we are developing and instituteing in our jails.
It is a holistic safety approach. We just sent our director of programs, chief of
custody division, new meanted both went to chicago and worked with the chicago beyond organization and they are coming back out here to help us in training our staff. We have a number staff who were hired on and became deputies and
worked in the jails during covid, and because of the
separation, because we had people working through glass is
and through partitions there wasn't a lot of interaction during covid pandemic. We recognize this so as we open
more cell time and more interaction with people face to face we want to make sure it is safe and people are prepared and make sure they have the right philosophy moving forward. This is a part of a larger program. I highlight this now because we want to
make sure that we are responsible in any situation we place anybody in whether our staff or whether people under our custody and care, so the
outcomes will be positive. Also mentioned on the bullet point is expansion of what we
have as our officer involved shooting board in the policy to
include use of force review. Up to this point the policy only covers in the event of a shooting and formal review board. We informally have in the past reviewed uses of force through our administrative division, through officer safety committee, through the safety committee and through division review. Now we like
to formalize that more by including use of force review
as part of policy regardless
what type of use of force. That is something we will be
doing moving forward. Sb2 reporting, sb2 has a new iteration but in reference to
the post reporting and the mark 43 type of reporting
we have to
do subsequent to documentation
for our records as peace officers. And again, I mentioned you have the oversight board being part of improvement on organizational accountability, hopefully our interactions and the fact I
come here on a regular basis and we have an ability to provide you with information
and share with you as much as we can, is a important part of making sure you hold us accountable in what we do and
how we do things. And lastly,
not lastly but employee wellness. Implementing a employee wellness program a continuation of things we planted in our training
curriculum last year. Our partnership with path finder
resilience and our navigating advrsry training we did 2 years ago is a part of what the continuation will be. The mental wellbeing of our staff, of the people in custody and
care are very important, and
the challenges we face being short-staffed, the challenges
coming out of pandemic and going back into working with each other and are larger group settings is something we want
to make shur sure we are responsible are for in preparing our people and preparing everybody to deal
with it effectively. Improving the physical environment is another component of what we are working on improving and there is another slide later in workforce potential where I highlight more what we are doing to improve physical plan
and environment for our staff and everyone else in the
system. Next slide, please. The next goal we have listed is modernizing technology and as you emerse yourselves in the workings of the sheriff office, you'll see that we experience the same challenges a lot of other city departments do in regards to being up to date with technology, up to date
with communication and
data and capacity. I'm a direct product of a organization where if a outside entity or third party asked us for information, I in my career have been the person at the other end of the phone that pull the paper and boxes out and count through the documents to get the information that was asked for.
We are slowly improving these processes and I know there will
be times when you have questions or request data or information and it MAY take us a while otoo get to you and that is a direct result of the fact we haven't modernized to the extent we should. That is a part of the goal and a
highlighted 6 goals to
modernize the data support, to modernize our data to share the
information with outside
entities. This also encompass just from the budget the additional personnel we are asking for in the budget ask to help us with that.
Next slide,
please. Improvements on the workplace environment. That
information there on the emerging products is from the capital plan budget upwards of $267 million over 10 years. Those items listed are the different projects that are ongoing projects and some new ones that we hope to fund through capital planning. Structural strengthening and improvements on the builds ings are very important but I want
to highlight two specific areas which are very special interest to the capital
planning group.
One is women resource expansion
related to a plan on
pilot for transitional housing regarding tiny home work, partnering with community based
organizations and groups familiar with tiny home production. We are hoping to build transitional housing
for some of our population in
either the women resource
center or at san bruno so that is ongoing thing. I don't want to go into it too much now but want to make you aware this is
something we are doing outside the general fund budget. Maximizing workforce potential,
it isn't just about the physical plant but also about
our staff and the next slide
reflects the core values of our department and expectations to carry out the values. Most of you got coins and the coins
actually show the core values. Service, professionalism and pride. All things we emphasize at every level of training, everything we emphasize in terms of our actions and this is something that will be ongoing in regards to what we
expect from people to help maximize the workforce
potential. Next slide, please.
Lastly, number 6 goal is enrich training, and i spent 5 years as a training manager here in this department. I'm very happy to share because training is one of the most important components of making sure that we are accountable in our actions and in how we do things and how we document things and what the follow-up
is on things. Every day is a ongoing training day for us. Sometimes people rely on what training we had. I still believe that we also have to rely on the training we will be getting in and experiences we have,ic and I think it is very important to emphasize this
because training is the one item we constantly have challenges with getting funded when we go up for the board or before the mayor office, so I
want to make sure I reassure
all you, because training is something that comes when something not good happens or behaviors that come into question or misconduct, training is always a part of the questions asked. I have a absolute commitment to training. Our
department has
absolute commitment to training. Inspite of staffing challenges I have given direction to our chain of command not to circumvent training in interest of getting staffing done. It is ongoing thing and want to bring to your attention and part of the goal to continue to train our people and something that I know will
come up in the discussions in future meetings. The final
slide will cover both budget request in general and also the recruiting questions that have come up in regards to our strategy. I should only be oo few more minutes. Number one,
on the budget request this slide reflects what our
highlight s are. I'm sure you
are aware of the tragedy when kristen hollins passed away. We were fortunate and want to take the opportunity to make
sure all you know, our unker sheriff cathy johnson had prior experience with our budget in
year's past acted as our temporary cfo so we were able to pick up the ball and keep moving forward despite kristen's passing and so I
didpt want to highlight she was a integral part of that and the reason why we have a budget that reflects these highlights,
which is expanding alternatives
to incarceration. The phone calls were emphasized getting
the funding, and most importantly filling
funding of sworn vacancy. I glossed over the numbers but those
are the numbers reflected in the budget for next two cycles. We had been asked by the mayor office to cut 5 percent. We cut 2.5 percent and in the process now talking with the mayor office about our budget before it is finally submitted to the board. This is still a work in progress. You see here
in the slide what we were able
to reduce in our current budget to help meet the goal of 2.5. It equals $5.4 million total
and as I said, this is a ongoing process but something we are all monitoring because of the next slide,
which is our biggest concern-sorry that was the next slide I just
referenced next slide after
that. Biggest concern is hiring
not keeping pace with separations. As a large entity we have attrition and people coming and going and more people going and not enough coming. We are challenged by that mentioned at the beginning. This chart reflects some of those challenges over
the past few years. I know that your body had questions
about our recruitment and strategies. We are trying our best to maximize the amount of people who we can get
to apply
for our department. We increased our presence in the community. We
increased our engagement. We've developed
some plans, which utilize current staffing. We have one deputy on our budget who is
listed as a recruitment deputy.
The heavy lift is from every
component of our administrative division our personnel training
unit and background unit, my captain and chief, the assistant sheriff just recently
went to a hbcu conference career conference as one of the
people who acted as a recruiter
because we don't have recruiters budgeted. We partner with other agencies to get out there and to get people interested in coming in. We
brought in a temporary recruiter, somebody specific to recruiting on a part-time basis and we have a ask in the budget now to make sure the person is full time. His strategy was very interesting not leveraged before which is go out to all of the california state universities and educational institutions and all their sports programs and try to engage student athletes in looking at a career in public
safety or law enforcement instead of considering moving
on in the sports field, which doesn't have a high level of
people moving on to professional sports from the collegiate level so we thought there was a opening there. We partnered also with the military last year. I think I mentioned to some of you in the pays program where we partner with the military, have the opportunity to recruit people as they transition out of the military before they leave and before they are discharged, we
start the background and testing process ahead of time while still active. Also, within of the larger things we have done which is different from our department actions in
the past is larger social media presence and so at the end of the presentation I'm going to
share one last video our recruitment video, which is meant to leave on a high note
because even though the numbers you will see don't reflect high numbers, we still have hope to meet some of our goals for this year. This year we were trying
to hire on 75 more people. If
you go to the next slide,
please. You can see right now since JUNE since the all most end of last fiscal
year, we had over 1900 applicants. We currently have 115 background investigations listed there in the chart and just to give you a idea of how hard it is to hire somebody from start to finish, so far this year we
hired 44 people out of those 1915 people. It is a challenge to get people in. Not so much a challenge to get people to apply, but as you all know, to become a peace officer there is a long process and vetting process and so we are at 44
right now. A little under half
way little over way through fiscal year. We are confident we'll get to the goal of 75 by
the end of the year.
Is this recorded? I'm kidding. We are trying to do that.
Next slide, please. I did want to
highlight a item here that I mentioned. The community engagement team concept and something we want to get our people out there. We are getting them out there now. We are pulling people from the
staff we have. We want to develop if to a full time team which help with community
outreach and being out there making sure people are reassured and being able to
tell people what we do to encourage them to consider coming in. That is the collateral benefit of having our people out in the community to have people familiar with who we are and what we do and really realize the
good work we do because we want to get good
people in. We have a underlying interest getting out there because we want to make sure our people are
out there to reassure the community and
make sure people are comfortable with us. You could
see more listed out on the next
slide details on our-one more.
Details on how our strategies. I think you already have a copy of the slide presentation, but I would emphasize and encourage you in the strategic plan briefing sheet you have, all this information is in there as well and you can take a look at
that at your leasure and get more a idea what we plan on doing. That being said, I mentioned we had one more thing to share with you, and that is the recruitment video. This is about 4 minutes, so just bear with us and take a
look what we have done and we have already gotten this out to encourage people to apply so
take a look."

videos and if you have any questions or anything you like to ask as follow-up, I'm available either now
or in the future."
2023-03-03,"turn it over to board members. Is the handout you
gave us and powerpoint accessible online?"
2023-03-03,the videos are on our website. I believe. The information that is contained we put the budget information up as well for the submission so that should be there as well.
2023-03-03,the handout is publicly accessible?
2023-03-03,I believe we can make it accessible.
2023-03-03,I think that MAY be a requirement.
2023-03-03,"any attachments that are presented to the board should be presented to the public.

2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,sure.
2023-03-03,questions from board members?
2023-03-03,"I had a question. Obviously
we live in a very expensive city, I like seeing there are reentry programs. I am looking at also not just recruiting but
stemming attrition and knowing
and deputy nguyen knows this, a
lot of the deputies have involuntary overtime and so want to know the accommodations
if they need to stay thin in
the city because they live far away?"
2023-03-03,"great question. A few years ago we instituted a standdown
room program so we have identified areas at work locations where deputies can stay over night. We converted
a few spaces administrative and areas actually administrative areas inside the jails too that
are accessible and are someplace a deputy can rest, sleep, take time in outside of
working a double instead of commute home."
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,other questions?
2023-03-03,"thank you for being here.
My question is on the front end. Just given the history and where law enforcement is, what is your thought process
when we look at 1900 folks
apply to get 75. Why do you
think it has been so difficult
for us in terms of
getting more
deputies on-board? Do you think it is the process? Where are we losing folks?"
2023-03-03,"that is a good question too. I think the initial challenge
is to get over the
perception, the profession itself reflected in the media, there is a lot of
bad things that happen which are highlighted and happening in other jurisdictions are reflective on the profession as a whole. We have that
negative to overcome. I think the more that we let people know who we are and what we do, including the work you are doing in making sure that we are doing things and making sure we are
accountable when we don't do things right I think it is important people know what is going on and know what we are doing right here right now. Part of it is just putting the word out about who we are. In terms of why is it reflective
of a challenge to get in, I think traditionally in the past it has been a challenge to get
in to agencies and departments.
I think board member soo mentioned also, attrition because of cost of living or-so it is a challenge there. We are also competing with every other law enforcement agency in
the bay area who are all
offering differing levels of incentives, the police department right now is in contract negotiations and we anticipate that there will be challenges for us to try to
recruit people if they see any increases reflective of the salary or benefits or anything else, so we are challenged by those things as well. I think
what is most important though
is we are try ing to do things
here differently. I recently signed off on had background process for incoming
applicants. We had a policy
which reflected not being able to use marijuana within the last 12 months of the application process. I just
signed off on making that 6
months and we have a second chance review right now in our background files for people who
MAY fall under that and MAY actually be qualified now opposed to before under that administrative limitation. We are working on trying to improve our processes as ourselves. I can't speak to the rest of the profession, but
we are looking at those kind of things to help get interested
people in without any road-blocks. Hope that
answered your question. Okay."
2023-03-03,"I had a similar question, but nice to see you again. First, I want to say in our
last meeting we had our community come in with great concern about a death that
happened in the jail wanting to have questions answered and just being updated. I hope that's moved forward or that you guys been able to contact the family and-"
2023-03-03,"I appreciate that you brought that up. Actually gives me the opportunity to share with you that we did have
our assistant sheriff is in continuous communication with members of the family. She did reach out and made sure that they were aware of what next steps would be in process. We can't speak to the investigation itself, but we have made sure that
she has a ongoing continuous communication with them, so it is not just a one off or call but there will be check ins
with the family. I believe she reached out to 5 members of the family too so not just one contact person, but tried to reach more then one member and believe she did speak to a
number of them. I believe also the under sheriff is working on following up with them on other
things next week. We try-try not to interfere with the process itself but also try to
make sure people are at least
contacted. There were some-I
don't believe the follow-up was done in a timely manner though and that was a main concern brought up but subsequent to
that they had open and positive communications."
2023-03-03,"one concern about that is, having them come into the room and ask the questions and us
not having any idea it happened, what can we do to
make sure that we are informed of serious situations in the jail that takes place before the community comes in and ask us about it?"
2023-03-03,"we actually have a streamline notification process right now, and if you are not a part of that-I make assumptions people are notified, so if you
were not notified in a timely manner we can make sure that at minimum you are included in the notification process whether something like that does occur.
We don't notify each other on everything that
happens but on a significant critical incident
or event I believe we can work making sure the notification process."
2023-03-03,"to dj's question, what are the major sticking points on people being disqualified and one of my question is, what age does a person have to be to
start being a deputy?"
2023-03-03,"happy to hand out application forms to
all of you. Kidding. There is no age limit. Upper age limit for anybody who apply said. We
have minimum age limit of 21 or 20 years 6 months.
Some-I have a lot of discretion in certain areas in terms of the hiring process. As the agency head I'm the person that decides who is hired and who is
not. However, there are some prohibitive and restrictive requirements mandated by post to be a peace officer. We still have challenges too. We have a number of people who do apply from other agencies as well and we know there have been changes in regards to what we look at and how we look at things and that is part of the sb2 process now with information going to post on things. There is interest in decertification of people, which will be helpful in
covering some of those
-air bus areas but we have people disqualified which stops people
moving forward. We have also mandated by post some requirements in regards to things like convictions or residency or citizenship,
things like that. I
know that
I could probably work on getting a presentation for you
on the background process itself in a future meeting because it is in and of itself a larger issue and process, which I wouldn't be able to do justice by answering questions here."
2023-03-03,"I ask that question because if you are in high school and
already getting into situations that disqualify you, trying to recruit people who
live in san francisco to supervise their own communities, it
would be great to have a way for them to
know if I do this-what path can
I get on early before I mess-get off the path. What path can I get on."
2023-03-03,"glad you used that as a
example because we have a informal way of doing.
We have a cadet program
similar to a public safety psa. I don't
know what the a stands for. Public safety advocate or officer. They are non-sworn.
They are uniform but a part of
our public safety activities.
We bring people in who have questionable or challenging backgrounds who MAY
not make it through the background as a officer or deputy first, but we
give them a chance to show
through action and through
behavior that those behaviors are not something we can anticipate if they are a peace officer. That is something we have done with our cadet program and that gives people the opportunity to reflect something other then what is on paper. One thing we do do."
2023-03-03,"I got two more questions. I know I'm drilling you, but you can handle it. Are the court room said fully open and giving people constitutional right to
a speedy trial and if not why?"
2023-03-03,"not all the court rooms are open. I do know we are working on opening 2 additionals ones. We have partnership with the justice system and
judges. It is challenging because we are short staffed today. I believe
friday we are minus 19 in field operation. 15 of the 19 were baylifes and people in the
courts so we had 15 people coming off shift from the jails detailed out to the hall of justice court on overtime had help cover the shortages. One
thing I can say as the sheriff, I never said no to the courts when they asked us to open a court room so there are others who make those decisions, but any time a decision made is we are there to support regardless
of the staffing level and make sure we have the staff to support it. I believe we are
going to continue our partnership. We put on pause some of the meetings we with the justice partners so I'm in
the meeting with the courts, da office, public defender, probation. I believe we are getting on track with those meetings to insure we get back on track with the entire system."
2023-03-03,"good. My last question is, I with know-I think san francisco health department is
a harm reduction policy. The question is about
that. Do you guys-are you in line with harm
reduction or are you promoting recovery and recovery with incentives like time off or whatever for someone addicted to drugs to really address their drug issue so we don't have the problem on our streets
that we see?"
2023-03-03,"I can say that in regards to
harm reduction, we are partnered with department of public health and the
harm reduction strategies are what
we carry out the jail. We had a program called roads to recovery, our drug program in the jails. That is one of the
programs that we identified to
refund to spin up and get
going. We want to be prepared to help with any challenges we MAY see in the near future with changes in outside community strategies, with the police department or da office. If our population increases to any extent, we want to make sure we
have that built into everything
instead of scram bling to get it done, our roads to recovery program is our drug program in
the jails. We used to focus just on users but over the years it morphed to dealing with dealers and people with drug charges regardless. That's something that while it has been in operation, it is very small in the population and something we want to make sure we are prepared-if we see expansion based on what is happening on the outside we want to be prepared for that. And we are partnered with the department of public health in that."
2023-03-03,"not sure on the last one, but I'll raise it now. To be
able to have at least-we can't have more then 3 but have 3 members being able to come into
the jails and talk to the residents, what chance do we have to be able to do
that and
have a confidential interaction with them?"
2023-03-03,no one will get in trouble for speaking to you.
2023-03-03,they MAY have that fear.
2023-03-03,"absolutely, I acknowledge they might have that feeling but we-like I mentioned as transparent as possible and anything we do. I would think
we want a more formalized coordinated approach
to that. Either like a-I'm partial to town hall meetings to begin to open the door so people feel comfortable talking to people
and having follow-up with more individualized communication after that. That is something I would be interested in supporting but want it structured and something we
have the opportunity to prepare for. When I say that I dont mean just letting you come in but I want to make sure our staff are aware what it is for because there is stigma
attached to what we do when something happens. Same can applied when we do good things
there might be stigma attached or suspension of staff something is going on when there isn't anything going on.
I like to make sure it is coordinated and have the opportunity to communicate that to everybody before we did something."
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,I also mention I have a feeling defense counsel MAY have a opinion on that as well.
2023-03-03,"absolutely. Absolutely. I will say though that we support philosophys like that reflected in proposed legislation about
being very open in terms of accessibility to
custodial settings. I think somebody put forth that legislation
at the state level. Skinner-I think skinner did. Something that we are supportive of in terms of accessibility."
2023-03-03,I think it is also in our charter unless there is a lawful reason why we are not allowed to go to facilities we can make request to the sheriff office.
2023-03-03,yes. Thank you for that.
2023-03-03,"I wanted to say in terms of
recruitment I was thinking as member palmer said at the high
school level, those
who are
student mediators or safety ambassadors-I mentioned in biographies of particular deputies and command staff, I
think schools make a difference because someone might have a greater comfort level contacting cold if through a alumni association so that
would be one of my suggestions."
2023-03-03,"absolutely. As you see reflected in the presentation we have interest in getting out there. A interest in the
partnerships with the schools
to have that ability. I think
captain sanford was out at a school today. I think a elementary school."
2023-03-03,"I want everyone to think about their biographies because
when I look at sfpd command staff it is like biography pending and by that time they move to the next thing, you never see their biography. I think biographies make a
difference and your recreational activities, your family, people like to join an
organization where they feel affinity so I think the sheriff
office and sfpd are diverse
enough community people feel-I'm ready to run down from
my street and run around glen
canyon but-I think heard if I'm
correct from chief jue, there are more candidates successfully getting through the academy. While we have
fewer the success rate is higher, is that correct?"
2023-03-03,"in regards to numbers, yes. We do have a very good success rate when it comes to getting people through. We have a pre-academy two weeks we spend with our hires prior to them going to the academy. We try our best to prep once they come in and we do get that
a lot in regards to successes. They are better prepared and what we try to do. We are
currently in the process of updating some of our recruitment strategies and hiring strategies to make it even stronger in terms of supporting people through the process. Something that make
speak to member palmer or member brookster concern about the outreach to community and getting people in. We are
looking at not just supporting pre-acadsomy but during the process itself a few years ago
we had practice tests, practice physical. Had the ability a few years ago with staffing to hold days where people could come in and literally lay everything out for them to practice prior to taking any part of the test. We want to continue that in the next step of the process once somebody
gets a application in, teach them or show how to fill out the form, what information we need to get from there and where to get it and help them
in the process itself."
2023-03-03,"along the lines of
biography, I assume deputy chief
:   Which I read every
week would be valuable. Just so humanize him and his family and shows someone out of uniform and the connection with the communities
and I think he is a wonderful writer and shows-it goes back
to how this sheriff department
has actively recruited under-represented communities going back decades which is why you have such a diverse department. I hope this column is useful in recruiting."
2023-03-03,"absolute recruitment tool for us, yes."
2023-03-03,"I also think his latest column about proper language
and grammar was instructive."
2023-03-03,"we might show that to the staff how they write incident reports. He is absolutely a valued member of the command staff. I just recently just brought him up to city hall again so here in the building
with us as the administrative chief."
2023-03-03,I hope a have a opportunity to meet him. I grew up 4 miles west where he did.
2023-03-03,wonderful. That's good. I'll let him know. If he is still here I'll tell him to come out the meeting. Any other questions?
2023-03-03,"I have a few
questions about recruitment. I know people
interested in law enforcement simultaneous apply to multiple agencies. Are we losing candidates applicants or sitting deputies to other agencies and a sense of why and how do the salaries compare
with those of neighboring
communities?"
2023-03-03,"we have comparable salaries to the 9 bay area counties. One of the measuring sticks is
9 bay area county. It is challenging to measure against all police agencies because there are so many so focus on sheriff office. Very competitive, however recently within the last few years a number of entities
have been
able to incentivize people to apply with signing bonus and cash incentives on retention, which is challenging for us because we don't have that ability here right now and when
we asked for it, it becomes a contract negotiation issue for the city, so it is something
that has to come up in negotiations and get memorialized in a cba.
The police department contract is up this summer. We are offset from the police department so from a practical sense very challenging for us to stay competitive because we are playing catch up all the time
with each either. As one grows the other catches up the next time. That is practical realty of the question you are asking. I do want to say though that
what we try to
emphasize, the sheriff office in san francisco
is our city is very reflective
being supportive so benefits and incidentals are enticingism it doesn't reflect in the cash
salary but in the total package. We reflect the total
package. The second piece is,
we are a family. I recently had about 13 deputies
go to alameda county on duty. We had others go too, but they were a
different pool of employees?
Seven came back after leaving and specifically articulated
that we do things differently here and it was more like a family here and that our policies and the way we do things the majority of had experience in custody division but the way we do things here is very different from the way
things are done in other places
so that was helpful from a staffing standpoint to have people come back based on their experiences and also helpful
for me as the sheriff to know that we get the sense we are
doing things right here in direct comparison from experiences in other counties. Something that motivates me to
keep going with the agenda and plans we have. Hoping and encouraged we continue those
stories to continue to get people interested in signing up for us opposed to other agencies."
2023-03-03,"I know several months ago
there were press articles about mandatory overtime. Want to get a sense where you are with that. Has that improved? What
are the levels of mandatory overtime deputies have to work to staff the jails?"
2023-03-03,"I can say based on my getting the information every shift how many people have to be drafted next shift, the numbers have changed significantly over the
last 3 months. 23 of the 44 new hires have come in the last 3 months
so that has been reflected in how many people get drafted but that being said, as mentioned earlier we are 19 down
in the field operations division. That is about 17 percent of the staffing that is not there and
we are already at about 70 percent staffing across the divisions. 63 percent in the custody division. That is on top of who calls in sick, so we still have challenges, but I also know that the
amount of people drafted, involuntary drafterize not as high as they used to be, which is also reflective of people doing overtime still, but volunteering and signing up for the overtime to fill the spots."
2023-03-03,"glad to hear that. I also thought I heard something about
the possibility of hiring retired law enforcement officer on part time basis to fill gaps?"
2023-03-03,"that is what we call the prop f program known
as 960 program. That comes into play is we have retired deputies who come back to us that can work for maximum of 960 hours for the city. They don't get
benefits but get the deputy top
salary. I identified areas. Community engagement. Records is another. We recently with new hires able to bring on 17 prop f employees and we placed them in areas that we haven't placed people in the past. A
few are working in the property room at county jail 1. We have as mentioned people working at records. We have one working at backgrounds as a investigator, which was the prior job. I actually
have a retiree working in san bruno at county jail 3 is what we call the worker supervisor and so he is actually doing what used to
be a deputy job but hasn't been
filled for years so have him helping keeping the place clean
which is extremely important.
We do have prop f, we do have retirees coming back and also have forgot to mention, MR. PRESIDENT, but we have them working in the courts. The
courts are really short-staffed, but be just put two retirees into our courts to
help as baylifes and that was
the prior jobs. We leverage people with prior experience come back. It is part time, it
still does help with our staffing levels."
2023-03-03,"we recruit inspector general. A first question a potential applicant will ask is
what is the volume of cases that would be investigating? You menshzed you are
creating online electronic version of
the investigation report. Are statistics on the complaints against sheriff personnel available anywhere?"
2023-03-03,"we receive complaints in
different areas, and obviously we get-we have a system right
now where dpa accepts complaints that we MAY not be aware of initially so wouldn't
be able to give a definitive number any given time. We have the ia cases we track. There is eeo cases tracked by dhr and
the dpa cases that are initialed. MAY be initiated. There is number of things. In addition when we talk about
complaints, we have entire
grievance system in our in custody process so the grievances if counted as complaints would be the one area that we definitively have the numbers. Other then that,
there are 4 different areas
complaints can come from."
2023-03-03,"the agreement with the dpa
AUGUST 2020 specified
dpa would publish monthly reports but statistics and data that includes the total number of complaints received
from the
public. Types of allegation.
Number of open investigations
:   Demographic information such as
age, gender ethnicity or
occupation of
:   Dpa said they don't have right
to release that information. How-it is never been-those reports have been never been published so how can we get them out in the public per the letter of agreement?"
2023-03-03,"at our ia unit which works
with dpa we are working on implementing our blue team
software as well as leveraging
what we use, which is ia pro, making sure the data collection there is comprehensive and this is a part of what I mentioned
earlier in one of the goals which is modernized technology.
This is related to your question whether we can do that now. I can tell you we can't do that now in a proper fashion but it is a goal to get to that opponent point to share the information."
2023-03-03,"that was discussion during
the training that ip was
:   Unlike the sheriff.
Sorry, the police department. PRESIDENT Wechter I look at the clock and think we should move on given
that we have our community meeting coming up and if can cover the media policy i think we are-I don't want to cut you
off sheriff. You have been very entertaining and given so much information and glad we have a solid partnership and I hope that the city and county
of san francisco residents appreciate that you're open to transparency and oversight from us."
2023-03-03,"I do have a couple more questions I want to ask. If
you don't have a data base capability dpa does would you release them to release that information to the public?"
2023-03-03,"I want to look into that
more before I commit to release of information. I want to make a statement now, in the interest of sharing as much information as possible I don't want to make a statement construed as over-sharing information."
2023-03-03,just trying to get implementation of the letter of agreement that was signed 2 and a half years ago.
2023-03-03,"I would also mention, I
assume this is something you
want to confer with your counsel, your attorney."
2023-03-03,absolutely.
2023-03-03,before making these kinds of statements.
2023-03-03,yes.
2023-03-03,"the other question I have I know there are several incidents members of the press interviewed individuals facing charges and their attorneys were not notified. What is a policy if the member of the press ams to the jail and wants
to seek a interview?"
2023-03-03,"the current policy right now is that our communication director is notified because
there is a protocol involving information and interaction with the press. We have it baked into the current policy if a person falls under one of our subgoals which is site code
so in a psychological libing unior psych unit or specialized housing which involves mental health or if they have a code on the chard which involves mental health then we don't authorize that until there is the ability for the person to consult with their attorney, so we notify defense counsel when we can in a reasonable amount of time. Most of the time that means the public defender office, but are there are other individuals who have private counsel so that can lead to challenges. If it is somebody else in general population that doesn't have the site designation on the card,
psychological challenge or issue on their identifying card, then that person once notified we tell the attorney but still let that interview go forward."
2023-03-03,does the attorney have to give consent?
2023-03-03,"no, we don't consider
consent in regards to general population, however want to give the opportunity to talk to the person prior to them talking to the media if they have that code on their card."
2023-03-03,is that policy in place last year when there were the incident?
2023-03-03,"if you are referring to the
specific incident that happened recently-"
2023-03-03,8 months someone charged with murder.
2023-03-03,I think you are referencing where the person called the press member and so we can't stop a individual from calling out on the phone.
2023-03-03,"this is someone where the tv
crew came to the jail."
2023-03-03,the one that public defender gonzalez-
2023-03-03,I believe the public defender was not aware of it.
2023-03-03,"if you can give me the name of the person I will be able to better answer the question, but we had a number of people who have interviewed with the press so I want to make sure I speak
to the right one. Or right incident."
2023-03-03,thank you very much.
2023-03-03,okay.
2023-03-03,can we-any other questions?
2023-03-03,"no, I just was going to say looking at the time and think
this is a perfect segue to media policy."
2023-03-03,"we have to take public
comment on this item."
2023-03-03,"thank you sheriff. [Providing
instructions for
public comment]"
2023-03-03,good afternoon callerism you have two minutes.
2023-03-03,"I have been
listening to all
of you and wondering how are
you all going to have the sheriff? If you have the
ability to do a
:
For example, we were supposed to demolish 850 bryant. That
is not a jail that meets any standards. In the slides nothing was shown about san bruno jail. Nothing was shown about the general hospital.
Nothing much about our courts. Our sheriff also work for the
public utility
commission. So, you commissioners, what experience do you all
have to
have the sheriff? He is under-staffed with
very little resources. How are we go toog have the sheriff? I have been monitoring the
situation for 40 years. I all a very good
relationship with michael hennessey, he was a very good man, very good relationship
with
:   . I haven't met him personally. I think he knows
me, but I haven't met him
personally. Very
honored
:   Very caring. But my
question to you commissioners, how are you all individually
going to
help the sheriff department?
Because anybody with ask questions as you work for the public defender office, but how are you going to uplift the sheriff? I like to
know that. I'm listening to your comments and I have a blog. I will
mention that in my blog and finally, we had a
PRESIDENT Of the board to challenge a cadet. Called him the n
word. How does that impress young man and
women to join the sheriff
department? My name is francisco decosta."
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,"the director of environmental justice advocacy. I also represent the first
people of the san francisco. The oholone. Thank
you very
much."
2023-03-03,"I don't think we will have time for the media policy. We
have to end in 9 minutes."
2023-03-03,any advice regarding this?
2023-03-03,"my understanding is that
there is a hard stop on the technical side, so I think you
are going to have the meeting. You might be able to finish in 9 minutes but also
have to have
public comment."
2023-03-03,"is there a motion to
continue the item? I'm not hearing a motion. We can start
on it, but will have to stop in 8 minutes."
2023-03-03,we have to stop sooner then that because we have to take public comment.
2023-03-03,"I think we could initiate
and are have discussion for 4 minutes and then open to public comment and continue the item or if the city attorney determines we should just stop the meeting now and take general public comment and continue this item to it next month."
2023-03-03,"I think you are
probably go
ing to continue both items, but -- I don't exactly know with
what to suggest."
2023-03-03,"I was hoping to get to it because we have community meetings coming up and I don't know if we could do some kind
of stop gap measure and just
say we are going to designate in particular members palmer and afuhaamango to publicize our community meetings on their social media."
2023-03-03,"you just to be clear don't
have to adopt a media policy to do that. The most important facts in terms of communicating with the media are that when you are speaking about the
business of the body that you make clear you are speaking in your individual capacity, unless you are authorized by the body to speak for the body. Those are the main points. Within those parameters there is nothing to prevent anyone on
the body from posting about meeting announcements and things. If it gets
away from simple announcements then our advice is make clear you are
speaking in your individual-you can identify yourself but make sure you are speaking in your individual capacity. You don't have to adopt the policy in
order to post things on your individual social media accounts. I guess that is what you are talking about doing."
2023-03-03,right. Yeah.
2023-03-03,dan are you posting information about the community meetings on the official sheriff department oversight board social media?
2023-03-03,I am.
2023-03-03,"okay. I think you are the only with access to those, correct?"
2023-03-03,everyone has access.
2023-03-03,we do?
2023-03-03,I think I would --
2023-03-03,access to-I'm the only one.
2023-03-03,"I would also make request that my fellow colleague s also contact their supervisor or make sure the board of supervisors know as well as these community meetings
because some staff have asked
and some of are more active in particular communities so that
would help. Identifying any additional sites, we tried to be as central as possible and starting with the bayview and
thank you member palmer and then member afuhaamango to make sure we have
visitation valley and pacific ilander participation and will have fillmore in the mission so want
to have our especially communities most
effected by the criminal justice system know about the earlier meetings and that is why we chose particular sites first."
2023-03-03,can you see the meeting notice is sent to the police and human rights commission because they both had community meetings?
2023-03-03,"yes, each member is free to do that too."
2023-03-03,thank you.
2023-03-03,"just so you know, I did contact each
supervisors and asked them to help us advertise
each of the community meetings."
2023-03-03,"I recommend and then you don't have to continue the meeting for general public comment so you can continue
this item for a vote but then-you MAY have time
to just do the-close general public
comment if you open it now. And move-you don't have to move to move it, just you can close
it now and move to another-continue the last two items. That's what I recommend."
2023-03-03,"can we-I like to make a
motion if both commissioner afuhaamango and also palmer to be the point persons because since we do have those pending and then we can continue talking about the
policy at the next meeting."
2023-03-03,"the media policy was on the
agenda but appointment of point people fell under the media policy but uncomfortable with
you taking that action. Because it wasn't properly agendized. I have to run because I have to catch a flight."
2023-03-03,okay.
2023-03-03,we will move-okay.
2023-03-03,continue line item 7.
2023-03-03,"yes, and move to public
comment."
2023-03-03,"[Providing

2023-02-03,"collaborated on one.
I will take mine out of
consideration. Thank you member nguyen I
appreciate the work.
Word smithing is challenging it
is not quick and easy as I
knowledge people assume of I
believe it sounds like it is manage if a law enforcement
agency, which we are not. I do believe the spirit everybodying that is in there I
public in the spirit.
I knowledge for the purposes of
this commission, this board, I
would defer become to what was
worked on by member palmer and member soo.
But I want to stress no way does
that mean that what is presented was a problem or have issues
with I think it is more the
viewpoint seems to be more as if
from a law enforcement agency.
Why and I think we live in a different house at this time.
Why I appreciate your investigation.
Thank you. Mentioned positive and
meaningful things but apply more to the sheriff's department then and there this board itself."
2023-02-03,okay.
2023-02-03,thank you. I appreciate it.
2023-02-03,"I want to thank member soo

of our estimated 80 hours of training.
So -- that figure looks low to
me and I know and I was in the
same training session at deputy nguyen and PRESIDENT Wechter and
the dedicated staff of the sheriff's department exit think
the her leave cost if to
accommodate schedules after
hours, it is low approximate we
have city attorney and sheriff's
council who have offered training.
I want to be mindful of this and
have you review that number."
2023-02-03,okay.
2023-02-03,"I will take that in consideration.
Why I appreciate so much your hard work.
The city attorney's work.
Sheriff council but dpa and the support than I have been begin
we do hire inspector zrnl we
want that person to be successful.
I expect the transition period
mitake a year depending because
the staffing would be civil service.
We than at in point in time silv
service hires take a longer time.
But I'm thankful for director
henderson attorney here and nicole armstrong on budget
special facilities to gives ape

will get become to you on that.
Why I think if I'm not misestablish they are supposed
to wee be zee not had it
processd and difficult sewe are named different entities on the
budget than when we are on the
charter that made it doyle draft documents. I don't know secretary, if you

2023-02-03,"we are still looking we started to explore that.
Could this be added in at a later date?"
2023-02-03,"this is in the final yet this
is still a draft when we get numbers together we will put those in there."
2023-02-03,okay.
2023-02-03,"and I know this indicates
adding 7 positions and that
would saul row savings cover the
budget cuts for this fiscal year
but what about the fiscal year
next JULY assuming the upon 7 people are in place in"
2023-02-03,"right when we estimate the
budget for the positions we
estimate the highest level. We don't anticipate having to
hire all of them at the top step.
And also -- we will not bring
all this positions in at the same time.
So we will have salary savings that way.
I don't anticipate given the hiring of the ig is take long are than expected.
I don't expect we would be
hiring any staff that soovenl
probably not until the second or third quarter.
Member soo mentioned 80 hours of
training from the sheriff's departmentful men there men information about the status of this.
My understanding was this it was going to be 20 hours.
I have not heard anything else
about receiving additional mandatory training."
2023-02-03,"I don't have knowledge of the
training proposals.
[No microphone]."
2023-02-03,"okay. And this initiative is
7 added positions how many does
the budget cover?"
2023-02-03,"I'm sorry.
How many I know this list 7 additional positions how many existing are in this budget is this I believe well is 13."
2023-02-03,"okay. Can you give us a break down had
they are?"
2023-02-03,"it will be I did not fwring ha.
I know there is -- 11 -- 11
investigators dp a senior attorney.
And a chief position."
2023-02-03,"and a cho position.
And I believe there is --
support, too.
There is -- admin position and a budget person.
Which was -- we need now."
2023-02-03,I'm sorry when you say cho position what is that?
2023-02-03,"chief attorney position to
over see the -- assist the oig."
2023-02-03,would be 3 attorney positions?
2023-02-03,"no.
It is the oig chief attorney
position and the 7 investigators.
And this additional naern in budget?"
2023-02-03,right.
2023-02-03,"I'm not aware of agencies that small having a chief
attorney usually they supervisor other attorneys.
I don't know about the need for
both a media person can communities out reach personful
seems like that could be the same position? I'm going to move we approve
this -- removing those 2
position the chief attorney
position and the media officer."
2023-02-03,"okay I'm sorry -- you know
with budget I think it is better to ask for more can let the
mayor take the positions away. i believe what the budget cuts
she will take a lot, way and
will not approve the 7 but it is more prudent to ask for more.
But -- I will -- we will consider your comments."
2023-02-03,"I don't think those positions are necessary because given budget situation the city
findses itself in and the need to miles per hour miles an hour
mraum officers for the upon plea come should have been's department. Emergency dispatchers.
I don't see these having that level of priority. Correct but we are trying to build a department it is better
to ask for more to have
successful full department.
And we can change the positions around if needed."
2023-02-03,just my thinking is.
2023-02-03,thank you for your comment.
2023-02-03,"PRESIDENT Wechter a request to speak.
As an attorney, and as machine
this worked with different
chiefs, in the san francisco da's office, when I was I
practice cuter I think that a
chief is an essential leader in
an organization especially a new organization where it has so much staff.
A chief not only deals with the
attorney work and the daily they
go in the daily fungsz of what that department does.
Here we have a slew of investigators. Which I, soup the chief would
work with as well.
I think to have the -- want
to -- make sure we dispel
misconception a chief assistant
attorney position would just be limited to prierzing one
attorney's work temperature is a
lot more complex and a lot more involved.
And I think we as members soo indicated we want to do
everything in our power to
ensure that our ig succeeds in performing the amounts of work
that will be required of this department.
I hear you and response I will
change my motion to approve this changing the chief attorney
position to staff attorney position give the ig2.
I worked at 2 oversight entities
either of them did not have a chief attorney position.
Staff attorneys were capable. Revowing the investigations and handling public record's
requests and we did not need a chief position. So. I'm amending my motion."
2023-02-03,"and MAY I speak.
I am a staff attorney and senior staff council for a state agency.
Well is a difference with a bureau chief. General council and staff attorney.
I think we learned that well from attorney kinds.
Well is a position where someone
can approve things, make budget and a line staff attorney you don't have that authority.
I think it is important to have
attorney at a chief level.
Of am I mode why receive and
community liaison would be rep did you understandant.
I think member palmer would know
we discussed about community out
retch we need bhon is strategy in the community with life experiences. Also knowledgeable about the community.
the modia person handles modia for the department MAY handle
crossover mead why as limp I believe that is important.
I do have a follow up question
and I know we have been hamper in the this.
And member palmer added,
secretary leung could we have to aleave I didn't the hats you
wear and dpa assisting us in
having a staff person start to build up the infrastructure of the office?
So I said, we don't want an ig coming in here and being overwhelmd and there will be a learning press a transition process.
Is there a possibility that dpa
assist us in hiring another upon
person at this point?
I don't know if nicole armstrong
could other thans that or attorney kind?
Thank you.
I don't have an answer to that
question. With is all throughout mayor's budget office and hr.
We have submitted requests for I budget person to able to help
you all this is in the press now.
But that is out of our hands we
want to make surety process is correct.
We would love to hire additional support.
I want to make a correction. Approximate dan's the only position we're asking for now with the attorney it is a new attorney position the chief
attorney it is already on the
fwhj is in the something we are it is an additional attorney to
help with casework to manage the load and ground w we need in research needed. that is the approximate
suspicion on the budget at this time."
2023-02-03,"other questions and we do
have on the ids report we kept in the approximate sheriff's
durpt see there is 40 grand there.
We dhept if the sheriff does have training we can make sure you have training.
Not just the 1300 there is additional 40,000.
Than I know you need your train
and there will be change overs.
Whatever helps we want to make sure you are trained and ready to g."
2023-02-03,"I understood from the beginning of training we were receiving 25% television and
that's why I estimateed be 80 hours we had 20 hours.
Joy was not part of the training I don't know the hours I want to
make sure what you need you have
funds and dan has it to do it.
And dan is correct they are working on your appointments.
There are things I will follow up.
So you will be receiving e mill from dan approximate asking for more information to make sure
things are done so you receive stifle ends."
2023-02-03,"there are oftentimes
additional cut its better to ask
for sxhr I would expect them members make themselves visible
to appear before the board of supervisors to ask for add backs if there are cuts.
And oftentimes the budget is
made whole by supervisors.
I suspect the experience of this
charter would walton would advocate to have a whole budget and when we need to do."
2023-02-03,thank you.
2023-02-03,"thank you.
Being an executive director of
nonprofit positions fihad a
dhoons ask the mir for a binge
would ask for as many positions and accomplices to be filled.
I think it it is in line with
our office to ask for more and then take when we get and we
will be asking for more after.
I would like to see this ride through."
2023-02-03,"in response.
I will with dru my motion."
2023-02-03,"I want to add is that the
number of investigators goes with the staffing and the number
of deputies and so hopeful low
we can attract more deputies
that requires investigators as well."
2023-02-03,"I do have a follow up question in terms of process. For the purposes of moving
forward what are the next steps?
The next step is we are going to

rung the numbers for this fiscal year.
Final numbers the end of fiscal. We have an estimate q within
expect 2 and we can the mayor's

you need an approval of the

My understanding is this only
the oig can hire and when you
ask for new positions I feel
like the new oig should ask for
the positions they should need
and so like for this to be taken into account.
My understands is the training
you keep talking about is in
ordinance of the city attorney can find it and put what is required to your budget. Defer to her on that. I think that -- you are required to do a formal public hearing on
the budget I think this was
noticed but not a community forum.
And um -- all of our city departments now do that.
I would ask that you do that as well.
Um, I know that um -- we are
very interested get oig position

2023-02-03,"next on the agenda recruitment of inspector general.
I understand committee presentation and further discussion and understand some
from dhr will be visible to
answer questions is this correct?"
2023-02-03,"MR. Sean is here remotely.
I believe the camera is on the
comments page."
2023-02-03,"discussion and questions
regarding this item."
2023-02-03,"I believe there is a
presentation, right?"
2023-02-03,"about what has occurred.
I guess if I MAY vice PRESIDENT
Carrion if I can set the background.
The left meeting vice PRESIDENT
Carrion had a motion to have a
committee to draft the inspector general qualifications for the job posting. We did do so.
We had a special meeting and that was noticed. I don't know if we need a
special motion to disban the
committee our task was to come up with the job description.
Now it is out with the entire
board and over to the city
attorney and -- human resources our J.W. Is finished rather than
having I committee and notice
further work it is of the board in a regular low meeting.
I don't know if we need to disban the committee?"
2023-02-03,"I don't think you need to but
you could."
2023-02-03,"this is a first draft and we
really wanted to also thank the
presentation florez from the
wisconsin inspector general's office for their police department. Some of that was taken from the
questions and I know this there might have been occurrence there
were questions out in the
penalty written questions will
review someone's thoughtfulness
and the ability to community
clear in writing.
I say that newer attorneys and
MAY be it is generational are
not as solid writers we hoped.
That offers an opportunity.
And a question I will ask of hr
and been to training I went through the interview process
for the department on status of
women, is that we as board members receive training in
terms of per missable question and signing the confidentiality
and how we handle interviews in
closed session.
There will be official.
I believe we will ask in I
fashion to all candidates.
Not like we let the cat out.
There will be questions and not
out in public.
I would like to thank member soo.
For all of the work in creating
a thoughtful job description.
That incorporated you know a lot of information.
That was not morely a cut
approximate paste but a very
thoughtful job description which
I think incorporates the issues we have discussed.
It is unfortunate we delayed so
long in being able to move forward.
And I'm happy to address that
further later."
2023-02-03,"good afternoon.
Sean with the d. Human resources.
I want to thank the PRESIDENT
And voip for inviting me to join you today.
And thank you for being amenable
for having mow join virtually.
I would like to acknowledge the
w the board has taken in puts
forward a draft. Job description. At this point.
Dhr to take on a greater
irrelevant we want to [Inaudible] Get it done right
the first time.
Export to put our best not forward.
So what I'm looking to the board
for in term it is of direction
is wield like the ability to
take this draft job description.
Go back with my team, working
with each one of you as members
to get an nltdzing of what the
job in your mind entail and what
an I deal candidate profile
would be and redraft the announcement.
Bring it become to the full board.
And move forward. That would be our recommendation
not sure if you have questions
or things I can comment on.
But that is how we irrelevant
want to approach this and move
it forward so we can finds the
best oig for the sheriff's
department board.
When you meet individually with
each member to solicit our input
on the qualifications of the
inspector general you will ask
us for suggested accomplices to
post and publicize the announce and want professional or other organizations or job boards to
get the widest number of places
to disseminate when it is done. Correct.
Il take any inmutt now during
our individual meetings and as
we move ffrmd I need you all to
source out where the candidates will be.
Gi want to thank you and I hope they offered at least a
foundation and taken a lot of burden, I know that department
of human resources is short staffed.
And I created a time line tasks
and bench marks.
It is meant to be a dynamic list
not of the ig butt tasks necessary with quarter low reports and the like.
I have included the possibility
of 4 community meetings.
Input on qualifications of
inspector general and that in
tandem as your team as well as
the consultation and labor team
worked finalize the inspector general's job posting.
I wanted to let you know that
florez indicateed me she would
send me the list of
organizations and trade
associations she at the madison,
wisconsin office of police oversight sent out.
We do have additional resources.
And I like you to review that
time line and let us know if
they are realistic deadlines. Thank you y. Thank you.
I like to mention that I
gathered 12 J.W. Descriptions
for somewhere director positions
around the united states.
I had done a revision I will
forward to you incorporates
elements.
Again, thank you member soo for
even without a title doing the
person w. Numerous members of the board have been asking for time table
and asking for the work to get done. I mroesht you stepping up in that leadership role.
Even though this is not your task and thank you for create
and taking time above and beyond
what I think is expects of a
regular board member to permit
work. Will I. Welcome input from other members
and looking pardon to working with the upon community and
having community input.
I already it members of the
community I do think we --
should have 4 community meetings.
if necessary language interpreters.
In the draft job posting I do
include that we as a city and
county subskroib to --  culturally rope delivery of
services from what was called
the equal access of service now the san francisco language ordinance.
I want to make sure we are
inclues exist get input.
Ip support commune meetings and think these are our first meetings in the community they
should have a focus on the charter.
Biholding public meetings and
soliciting input from importance
incarcerated in the city.
And receive operations and jail
conditions. .
PRESIDENT Wechter I want to be
focused and so we will have
those meetings but I want to
issue sensitive we are focused
on qualifications of the inspector general and the extent
we -- go to a facility and
solicit comments and family
members of those inparseerated
we should guff but focused of
getting I job posting out there.
I don't want to get distracted
by having more than one topic.
I am make a motion we ask dhr to move forward with the process.
Meeting with each us to solicit our opinion.
On hashould go in the job description and gather information about places to post it."
2023-02-03,I have a follow up question.
2023-02-03,"for sean do you believe a
draft can be presented by next
meeting?
Thank you. That is my hope. there are factors. I think that leads to another question that I would hope you
can provide me, which is is
there a point person I can work
with on the board to have
discussions and ask questions.
And what manner if I am not able
to get a hold of member or
questions somebody I can have
that discussion with?
Would be helpful and informative.
Why I'm happy to serve in that capacity.
I would recommend that member soo and myself since we were
part of the committee and
specific low -- member soo did the work.
And drafting this and have been doing this work.
I think that -- if want to have a point person given the amount
of work of creating a work product.
I would believe that -- member
soo would be the best
individual.
Have a first community meeting
this month but this MR. Shellborn you indicated you
prebl have an hr version of the ig job description and pair 3
that we would have -- a second and third community meeting.
So -- and I welcome anything other questions or anything you
need -- to make sure we are on
the time line for the process.
I think the board should vote on
we have a motion before us."
2023-02-03,"could you restate that motion?
That we move forward authorizing
dhr to move forward on encrewment of the ig middle
easting with each of us to
solicit our thought
qualifications and suggests to post thing job description."
2023-02-03,second
2023-02-03,"public comment.
We have no callers. Thank you for being presents to answer questions and lend assistance."
2023-02-03,"we will take the vote on the
motion for dhr to move forward. Vice PRESIDENT Carrion."
2023-02-03,aye.
2023-02-03,member nguyen.
2023-02-03,aye.
2023-02-03,"member palmer. Why aye.
Why member soo. Why aye."
2023-02-03,"PRESIDENT Wechter.
Why aye."
2023-02-03,"motion passes.
I like to make a motion I serves
a point person to coordinate.
And incorporate input from all
board members.
You and member so to work
together as the point person.
Can we do that?"
2023-02-03,the city attorney?
2023-02-03,"it is 2 of you were to work
together this would be a committee.
So that would trig are public meeting notice requirements."
2023-02-03,"I would like to request to speak.
At this point I do believe that
the appropriate person should be member soo.
Since AUGUST the members had
been requesting PRESIDENT Week
her create priorities.
Work on citying community member meetings.
These have been battles that
have been fought to the downfall
of what we are supposed to do.
Now after, after able to fight
toward getting w done.
Having member soo doing the work.
i don't think tell be
appropriate for PRESIDENT Wechter to come in.
My perception hoe is an
obstructionist in this regard in
allowing us to wanting us to move forward with the actual
work we are supposed to be doing.
It is unfortunately.
My interactions have been negative.
And bills respectful.
I believe I'm not the only woman
of color who had this experience.
At this point, I don't have the confidence in PRESIDENT Wechter
to move us forward in the
direction to hire an ig I don't
think it has been demonstrated
the past 6 machinings of failed
leadership since AUGUST and ask
our board members rescue noise
where the work is getting done.
It is common women of color
attorneys doing the w and someone swooping in.
We have an experienced attorney
who has experience draft and I
reporter.
Part of recruitment for
executive director position in a commission for status of women
this is when we want to mack
myself the skill set we have
which is personal.
I understand the argument MAY be that PRESIDENT Wechter had experience in oversight boards
for a time but here we near a
new oversight board and post
floyd era we have thankfully
more diversity, more diverse
perspectives being shown. Things are changing because the
things the way things were done
before in the past 10-20 years
have been a problem.
So I scholarship the members to
recognize the work and the skill
set and the specific knowledge
base that member soo has. We have been waiting since AUGUST and asks for things.
I can give a list but rather
focus like I keep sigh saying on
getting the work done that the
votersment us to get.
Member soo demonstrated a
commitment to doing so and for
that reason I would reject that vote."
2023-02-03,"I don't want to get in a
personal dispute I'm sorry you foal had way about me.
I will state they have spent significant conditional amount
of time doing research off this issue. Gathering the 12 job descriptions of similar
positions I sent to all board
members several months ago and
at your request finding someone
who can speak had not used the recruitment firm and I did
thought I made it clear that I wanted to participate and would
be happy to work on deteriorating the job
description but was not does not
have an opportunity to.
I don't believe I have not put
in effort on this I don't think
I become and forth is useful. I think that if other members
have comments I would like to
hear that and then. No audio chlt
. At this time.
It took months get to this point.
We don't need any of this we
need to move forward with the
work.
Also at no time during the last
meeting recording will demonstrate for those interested in learning exactly what happened.
Review the recording and not
take it from bheem were not
involved or -- who especially
not present for the entirety of
the meeting.
It is obvious and clear that no
time PRESIDENT Wechter asked to join.
I mentioned you would be great
on it.
There has been and in fact he did participate as an bencher.
I like to have those 2 factual
situations clear. The record speaks which is the
recording of these proceedings.
Dooring members have comments on
this issue?
Gi understands board member soo
and PRESIDENT Wechter both doing
good work and trying to get the
oig job description out and hired.
So -- I understand -- board member soo wants to participate
as the point person and also
PRESIDENT Wechterments to as well.
I would recommend we talk about that subcommittee again so
everybody can have a voice in it."
2023-02-03,the subcommittee.
2023-02-03,"so.
Since you want to participate
point person and board member
soo has an interest we should recontract subcommittee. I believe the issue raise
exclude had issues with and the
city attorney mention if we have
2 people we need have one person
only if we have 2 people we have
all the notice requirements.
Sthal stop us from being able to dot work individual low that point person will do because every time thereupon is a
meeting every time there is an e mail anything drafted needs to
be specially noticed for a meeting.
We need to select one in order
to move forward.
And not have any issues with
sending one e mail or -- to sean.
If there is 2 members on that is
a meeting that is an unlawful act.
We can't do this."
2023-02-03,"I think -- board member
approximate afuhaamango volunteered be a part of that.
That woulding bring it to 3. Right?"
2023-02-03,"that's community meeting this
is is only from my
understanding, this is only to
be the point person.
This with sean and hr.
This is in the to say each
individual member will not have
an opportunity top meet with dhr regarding their comment specials statements.
So each us will have independent process.
I believe that the rolled be to
ensure it is a lodgist cal
tracking moving and pushing it forward. Forward. Substantively the board has to make a collective decision.
We have to have an approval and motion.
And that would be I think a way
where we could support member
soo in the work that she has.
Approximatements to continue to do.
That each person opinion and especially going become to the
constate wents and getting them.
My thoughts on this is
leadership has to also galvanize
the group example delegate as well.
These are 2 important factors in
being a good leader. PRESIDENT Is diligent in his
focus on making sure we get the
right inig but I think this is
an opportunity for to you trust your colleague and board member
and allow her to proceed with
the work she has developd and developed in a timely fashion
and would allow her to move this
part of our collective responsibility forward.
And then could be other agenda
items and issues you and the
rest us could w on as limp that
will give you an opportunity to
delegate just different issues
and topics and -- and -- other
members.
We show up as a team and move this forward. We have been waiting for a
language time to get this ig right?
And so whatever we can do to
stream line the process and move
it faster in our interest and
those we serve.
Gi appreciate the sincerity of
your thoughts and the manner, I
will follow your add vice.
Member palmer."
2023-02-03,"I would like to say thank you
to my fellow board members, I
don't need a title to dot work
I'm a very busy public attorney
and schedule 4 hearing in this
first quarter and issued pleadings my interest is being
efficient and having as few meeting and getting enough
public input this is my interest.
We waited for a time line.
That's why I say drafted a time

Of but approximate in her other
appointee in member brook upper and killer concern approximate she has been supportive of the
budget and offered members of
her budget office to give us guidance.
I will offer up moiz to continue
to do the work I fully continued
is easier to have one point
person had it come to finalize
language and does in the mean
that any board member comment
and thoughts are ignored but
PRESIDENT, this is had I tell
junior upon attorneys or
lustudents you can't kept on pulling more information without
solidify and documenting.
You could get yourself in an a cycle looking over documents. I rescue noise other jurisdictions have documents but
that is why I have been electric
to other jurisdictions who have someone established.
Because we were turning back and forth for the documents and
carrying over agenda items.
I notice we have not hit 2 hours
yet and got all the items I
wanted get on the agenda done when I sought draft of the agenda and the budget was last
that did not make sense that is a prior we need push forward. I'm happy we got everything.
Next is business cards id and
photos we have not didn't basics.
I'm willing to volunteer and
like to we don't need to do this
as a committee but also have the
community meetings set in parallel with deteriorating and

2023-02-03,"next item social modia policy.
Discuss using social media and a
social media policy to
publicicize the work and public meetings.
I believe the city attorney has
an opinion regarding had we can
consider under this agenda item."
2023-02-03,"so the agenda item describes
a discussion on possible action
on social media policy and I
believe member soo proposed a
draft social media policy and
draft broader mode why communication policy.
So, my recommendation is that
the broader media policy is a
bit outside the described scope
should be sdefred a later meeting. But the socialing mode why
policy you provided the draft
could be discuss in the this item. Does that make sense. Thank you.
I think at this time I would
like to continue the social
modia policy discussion and put
it in a broader media policy.
and I say this because I was
quite taken aback by the things
articles that were forwarded to
me about our board and alining
vice PRESIDENT Carrion and myself.
That to me brings dishumanor
toor board.
And I'm not and the quotes I
don't need to say their name its is in the article.
That's why I had spoken up early
on when I think it was probably in SEPTEMBER or OCTOBER had
social media policy when they were brought up I thought it was
person to have a media policy. I don't know if we reference in
the rowels of order or amend the
rowels of order I leave that to another meeting.
I would move to continue this
item to next month's item for
the purpose of discuss being
social media policy in I broader media policy."

so much confusion over our name and the sheriffy department is
the office we are the oversight board and the sheriff's
department of accountability on
e mails and on not get

be in simple black? I think it would be consistent

one it have the code in black. Approximate I thinkien if it
make its easy I have an old
black berry reading these code
system challenging for my little
black berry.
[Cannot hear speaker]"

the gold seal like the other
cities and a raised gold."
2023-02-03,"secretary, I had a gold
emboss exclude over the years it
became flat if there is a cost that matters to people they have
the flat seals and in the the
beautiful gold I do prefer if we
were aware of cost they dot flat print now."
2023-02-03,okay.
2023-02-03,"doorings have preferences?
As an artist I was all right looking at number one myself
anyway of the back of it -- I
guess I agree, too, with the
back being mostly white in case
have you to write manage had is
project cal than the green.
In the this green is bad."
2023-02-03,"yea. I go with that. I had a concern in the cost.
I know we want to be mindsful of spending citizen's money.
Of is it significant are we
talking 10 or 20 or 50 or thousand?"
2023-02-03,no.
2023-02-03,"if we did want individual which I stillment number one I

I'm a 1a in black also."
2023-02-03,"should we have the co is it
cheaper if the seal is black rather than gold."
2023-02-03,yes it is cheaper in black.
2023-02-03,"that would be acceptable to
people number one with the seal in black.
I like the flat gold and not
upon high luxury with embossed.
I think to be consistent
worrying department theys have the gold seal with the city seal.
I like the gold, too.
I worked for the city was the
managers who had the gold staff
had black.
We are managing.
To be cost effectiveness.
I don't think it makes a difference.
We are talking dollars.
If we don't to embossed we have computers having cam are red.

2023-02-03,PRESIDENT Wechter.
2023-02-03,"aye.
Why the motion passes. I would need all the information
you would like on your cards e
mailed me.
Next item. Thank you member soo for future meeting I appreciate this and I
would like other members to also make suggestions for either
specific topics or generalized
goals and like to see us move toward.
Obviously things MAY mum that will be priorities that will
want to put on the agenda.
But I feel we are limited
meeting witness I among. I'd like to move considering
apointing committee and like you
exalt also member brookter and afuhaamango to community with
dan since can't with mow on suggestions for potential
committees you might want to
serve on.
So I think we are a small board
and having committees requires
you to have notice.
And -- I then and there early on you talked about having
additional meeting I was that premature unless we knew when he
had to do and how time was spentful feare efficient like today.
We don't need committee and if
we do take that at a timer.
It behoofs us to be well verseod jail operations and site visits
I don't think we need to consider committees.
Our focus is on the ig job posting I don't want to get
ahead and I like to follow step
by step until we get to the tasks.
I will talk about that and if we
are finished like to suggest
other future item theorys for MR. Leung's plate.
I didn't will say we can have committees if nobody is
interested in serving if members are interested in serving. Let me know.
I can, point something to form committees.
I will let you all speak with
your feet."
2023-02-03,"I will say I do value have
the per spektdive of my
community or board members.
I think that it brings I bit more texture and more perspective we would not have. I thank you is personal.
Had it come to the issues I
think that we are discussing incarceration and all of the press being issues.
I think it is important for us to work together I'm happy to
work with each one of you.
and moving forward you know I
hope that this is a moment in this board where we are moving
forward and getting things done it seems we are. It took a minute. We are here I'm looking forward
it working with everyone of you.
And this moment I grief agree,
prein tour given when our tasks
are priorities are. . And this we. I don't see community members
should meetings should be stopping. We should have regular community
members on all of these issues
and manage this we continue
going of I don't find right now,
this time, the need of committees can be valuable at certain points."
2023-02-03,"yea.
Joof when the time come I would
love to be proactive in jail condition and able to roach out
to the people residing in those
place and upon getting their
feedback for social mode why
approximate out reach. Commencements being made we
should have a point person to make comment to the media so far
weave agree on our voice.
I think theuneified voice makes
a unified team temperature makes
us better and more efficient and builds trust with the
communities to stay on message
that is important we are --  solid."
2023-02-03,"would you like to be that point person?
On the social combleefd and stuff?"
2023-02-03,"that is something we discuss a bit further.
But you have a certain expertise.
that would be valuable in that role.
I than we will consider that --
at a different agenda item.
But I agree with member soo for
the sake of time, it a benefit
for us to focus that before the committees.
Men later but I agree with her
now at the present moment we
focus had we have before us we
have a lot on our plate.
[Cannot hear speaker].
Less I think we need to do that
and a discussion of id badges.
If we have plastic if we have a
badge that looks like the worn
officer although we are not or a baby star.
But down the road had we do facility visits.
It is important we have photo
id's ready.
The hr person asked them on put
it in.
I of course you said you were looking bo it.
He said he would ask thoim if
you in I will check with him again."
2023-02-03,"I think there is we use air
model with the other boards that
have in place and go with what they have.
We stream line the process. In terms of credentials."
2023-02-03,"I agree with you.
Member leung we were not able to
take our photo and the
sensitivity of doing the
facility we modify to have
additional identification.
Thank you.
We had an agenda item postponed report if the historyy department we need to put back
on the agenda I had community
members talk to mow about issues they are concerned about regarding the jails. like to get the sheriff's department and making regular
reports to us on the sheriff's
department activities. Staffing and -- programs. And issues."
2023-02-03,"and so -- PRESIDENT Wechter
that's had I had on the time line.
Recognition of reports from the history's office as we gear toward the quarter low report
and buffer continue welbe back
to another annual report.
I understand there were
complaints and other things and
disciplinary actions that might
have been sustained.
Secretary leung we MAY want to
incorporate the things from the
history's office intt report so
we are not ignoring what d ph
and the sheriff's office has
done.
Next among member palmer
afuhaamango and care yen their
terms xroir and hope you reapplied again.
I value all of your inmutt and think we have only beguvenl I hope that will make this public
now I hope you are all
reappointed so we can continue.
And I would be help to speak on
your behalf if we need to have
that.
Because we took offlet and the
hiccups it would serve the city
that we stay together. And
until at least our term allows
the inspector to take office.
Upon then we can cook and then
but you know, I'm -- selected in
pointed sf in our -- so by the
people if they feel there is
somebody else better than me, I
can concede to that."
2023-02-03,"I think you if you remember
when I came up with mules.
I said if they were making the
choice.
I'm happy you are here.
Irregularities head of jail I
believe it is fortunate have
michelle phillips open to come
before us.
In her first year she gotten
riff revows how she handled the office.
And that's a hard seat.
Oakland had a lot of difficult ies.
I'm sure she is busy now.
With the issues with another police chief. On the approximate in the hot seat 10 police chiefs in the
last 10 years is not good.
I feel strong low we have
michelle phillips speak at the next meeting.
I will consider there are other practical tigzers with the similar level experience involving investigative model
agencies the oig will be who
could speak to how they established offices. Gee understand that I think this
come with staffing the office down the road.
I want to keep the folk xus be fortunate.
In the past if we had a meeting
like tonight we could
accommodate 2 speakers.
I want time exactly have more
community feed become.
Soip want time for community and
public meant.
And include kathy lee if berkley
has 33 years experience the last
7 years was with accountability
and the director of
accountability and spent time as innerim or police rerowel officer and time as the director of the police accountability.
They are priorities there.
And I think that in APRIL tell
be a complimentary to have a report on jail healing.
Down the road you notice once we
have the inspector general's
posting out there I want to
begin a cycle of community
engage and want have assist annual chief carter because she
does a lot of community out roach.
And so I would expect this we can participate in cal dpars because they are social we would
not have to notice if there are
more than -- a quorum."

I will go.
Um I was the vice chair, um
prior to the um -- interim chair
for 2 years as well as I sat on
the executive subcommittee and I
was um -- chair of our um [Inaudible].
So um -- it hen a wild ride the
best way to describe the experience maeb has been
induction by fire.
It has taken us what we I think
myself, anyways, I can speak for myself here.
I thought it would take six months to hire an inspect police monitor.
We have a board of 13 members
um -- 11 are voting and we have
2 um -- alternates.
Our board consists of we are --
voted um -- our community voted
um in our ordinance, we have
9 -- different community organizations. That each nominate 3 people to
sit on the board and then of
those nominees our city council
leadership um appoints one from
each of the nonprofits so that 9
nonprofits there are 2 seats one
is appointed by the council and
one by the mayor and for the alternates one appointed by
common council and one by the mayor.
That is the make up of our board.
Um, I was nominated by the community response team?
That is how I became appointed to the board.
I have included our position description.
Um, and -- I don't know if I
sent ordinance but that's all
available on madison um on our registrar page.
We are in the process of um --
updating and creating um --
updating our page our city page
and then also creating um --
more of a handbook but in a way
so it can be um -- used um -- online. So.
We are doing lots of things
[Laughter] Um, we are working
with [Inaudible] Gave us training.
They have been giving us
guidance um, it has been
wonderful working with them
because of covid we have been
meeting only online um, we got together in DECEMBER. That was the first time we had a
meeting in person.
So, all this work um -- let's
see -- I think I was nominate in
the JULY, appointed in AUGUST of 2020.
Um, and then we started our first recruit am process for the
im the beginning of 2021.
Um -- we were not successful in
our first um -- hiring.
Um -- for numerous reasons.
It is um -- we -- it was a huge learning curve.
Um -- and so we revamped our
hiring process and I'm glad to announce that we -- effective
DECEMBER fifth we now have our inspect police monitor in place.
Um -- what we have here in
madison is called the office of
the inspect monitor.
Where that consists of the board
um -- and we have the inspect monitor and inspect monitor will
be able to hire his own data
analyst to work in the office as
well as an administrative
assistant dedicated to the um,
police civilian oversight board
and um inspect police monitor.
He if a lot of um -- scheduling obviously trying to schedule
over a dozen people of um, and
very hard work um automatic00 get everybody on the same page
and also um training.
So we have have been in a holding pattern because
ofmenting to um, have the board
along with our im um training
together at the same sometime so
everyone um on the same page um
in terms of how our board was
developed we um -- had a police shooting in 2015.
19 year old um -- young black
man um by a police officer.
And it really after michael
brown it catapulted our
community to realizing um00
autoneed for um -- police
civilian over site and how it
can benefit um our community as a whole.
Everyone including our um police officers.
And so -- the management um --
[Inaudible] We had an ad hoc committee.
That um -- looked at the madison police department policies and procedures.
So we are municipal. We only have jurisdiction over
the madison police. Which can get complicate in the
a city like madison it is complicate in the san francisco
because of having all the different jurisdictions.
Having campuses.
Having um like here we other
capitol of the state and um --
you have the county as well as federal.
Of the ad hoc committee determined what needed to be
done is we needed to have an audit of the department policies and procedures.
So we hired the oar group to
come in and audit the police department.
We, being the city of madison. To do an audit.
What became of that audit was
177 recommendations.
Recommendations the civilian oversight board and 2 the
inspect monitor and um, so far I believe.
sorry but we have a full
agenda we want to focus primarily on the issue we are
considering is how to recruit.
our inspector general if you could speak about. Your recruitment process.
so our recruitment process um
included we put out an rfp.
We did not the first time of or
and then we did not get any
nobody replied to our rfp we put
it out for 4 weeks we felt a time crunch.
It was our city hr along with board members um myself included. We did the recruitment ourselves.
I highly recommend um if you are
able to, find a dedicated
[Laughter] Um head hunter, do that.
The recruitment is difficult
and -- the um -- first time both times we had around um 30 applicants um -- and I think
both times we had about half of those applicants qualifyd and so -- um. In developing our -- um -- the -- losing my road. When we were making the um -- job um -- we wanted to put out the proposal and make sure that it was equal. And you know the musn't mum qualifications, we had hr do that first.
Um -- you know just making sure that people qualifyd and you
know, we went on to having an
oral supplemental essay part and oral board.
We had a town hall where we upon
presented the finalists to the
community and took a survey the
community was able to give
feedback and from there the
board decide um -- on we ranked
our finalists.
Um -- and our first hiring one
and two we had two finalists
this time we knew we need 4
finalists to choose from.
Those are process and how we
went about it? Um.
In am terms of list of recruit
am places um -- we wanted to
look both um -- locally because
we figured locally we would have people familiar with the
community needs but then it was also important to look nationally as well.
Um -- our first um -- first
round finalists was local from madison and our second round
when we finally hired both
gentlemen were outside of madison.
So -- um -- let me --
recruitment form.
Um -- we MAY call and we also
organized um -- you know we
figured out who, who did we need
to um -- be working with.
Um -- you know what who could
delegate is very important, you know. What role and responsibility hr
has versus what role and responsibilities the board had.
Um -- our board was responsible
for more of the um -- um -- development this time of the time line.
Last time that was on h r this
time we decided it out to be
um -- more the pc ob that um,
was implemented in to that um,
same thing with the um -- um -- recruitment. So. That's all for now.
If you have questions, um, feel free.
dot board members have questions. yes. I do. Good afternoon. Um. mrs. Flores thank you for spending time with us this friday afternoon. It is grateful we are grateful
for your time and your thoughts. I think that one of the things
we are looking at is looking at
pro's and con's of um -- whether
a using a recruit am firm for our jurisdiction would be the
best use of our limited resources.
So, understanding um -- from
your perspective, what the pro's
and con's you saw?
Would be helpful. Could you list some of those?
well, so -- I would say some
of the con's is -- I think --
having the you know the
responsibility on hr -- we wanted somebody who hady dedicated time.
Um -- a lot of our all of our
board members are volunteers. That would part of why we thought it would be helpful to
feel have a recruitment firm?
I have a hard time balancing you
know, which would be the way to go because we did t. I don't
know the pro's honestly of
having the luxury of recruit am firm. We didn't set absolutely was not
the way we went.
So -- I couldn't say having our
current im the way that he found
out about the position was
because um I had posted a solidarity list serve for um
people who are incarcerated and
happened to belanguage to that,
um, and he was employed by the milwaukee police department.
And so -- it one of the things
you never know where you might
stumble across perfect person or
people for the positions.
Um, our number one finalist had
miles an hour community engage
and want our seconded finalist had much more um an attorney
with more of a willing back know grounds.
You know, it really helps to
have that input, too from the community.
Um -- so in terms of recruitment
um -- it was difficult, we um
left our position open that was the word.
The um -- position was open for 6 weeks.
Um I think the first time 10
week and it is second time 6.
We thought MAY be it would be easier to recruit the second
time and that we would not need
as much time um -- upon so.
I can answer that better no worried.
I want to clarify it seems
your comment was go for it.
Of positive for a head hunter recruiting firm.
The cons were the recruiting firm having the dedicated time
did I misunderstand that. The proyou have someone who has
the dedicated time.
If you hired a head hunter the
conis havings volunteers or
people -- city level with hr.
City hr departments tends to be inunidated with work.
So that to me the proof having
the head hunter would be the
assistance um -- that would be the pro.
based on the materials we
have it seems both hr worked in
collaboration with a recruiting firm; is that correct?
Or did they slowly contract out
to a recruiting firm? no. We put out.
Wes a city put out an rfp for recruitment firm and no one answered.
upon we did not have anyone
and the excuse was that or the
reason rather was that -- people
in this you know recruitment
firms are inunidated now.
So, if you can find one great. If you find [Inaudible] Wonderful.
Otherwise, I will give you the
whole list of you know where and how we recruited.
that would be greatly appreciated. I have another follow up question regarding your budget.
We don't need to go in the
details I would like top find out compares to your budget
because we have a limited amount.
I don't know what your source of funding is and what it was and
the impact of it.
For us issue what MAY be 60,000
might not be a lot of money but
given that our budget noted was
is less than the cost of 2
public toilets, for a lot of
work that need to get done by
this person oversight position.
I wanted to get an idea of.
Where you all concerned about
the xoft given or any issues with the cost? From your head? From your hr department?
for looking for a head hunter. Which budget.
Budget for toward what?
The budget toward your hr.
What was nawhat did it cost you?
Using the city hr did in the cost anything.
Because we used people who
already worked in the hr department.
It was added their work load. I see.
it did not ends upcoming out
of the pc ob budget.
It was just an added
responsibility of the city hr
department of the there was no
um they did in the get paid for
the work they did in the recruitment. I see.
Thank you. uh-huh. other questions. if I could.
Thank you again for being here today and I appreciate those
questions I wanted to follow up on the questions.
So you guys did not use a firm? Right? Correct.
can you talk a bit about the involvement in the make up as shared about your board and
council as new oversight board that were has been aaccept belled, how important is it for
us in terms of what you guys do
around collaboration as a group
and working with the city human resource department.
Can you talk about haand that process ensure what you guys
were able to do as the make up of your board and how important for you to work fort worth to
find what you called an all star.
um, it was essential.
Um, we -- um -- we had a 3
person task force bh we were
redeveloping our hiring time line.
Um, and we have the um --
dedicated staff person.
Um, and admin and so that was
the helpful that we had the
dedicated admin um -- there were
only, an lte and they were only
approved for up to max of 20
hours a week at the time.
Because we did not yet have our
inspect monitor hired um and so
hr um, how they were instrumental was helped us use
their equity tool when we were
working on you know the language.
For that um -- that position description.
And then hr was helpful um in
terms of you know, going down
the list of you know, who do we
e mail and give this position to
so the recruitment part, they
were key and then that the
initial screening and then
useless keeping track of we used
um, that a way for voting for
tabulating scores how we
tabulated our um -- supplemental essays in the application.
They had to have earned half of
those point.S supplement we did
bench mark and half points to move on to the oral interview round.
And so hr was very, very helpful and essential. And that part and also at the
end when their needed to be a
contract signed like -- when it
come down to it, the inspect monitor is a city employee.
They have to go through the contract process.
So we as a board -- was the
process was worked on.
The chair -- had approved that.
And the city council had to
approve the hiring as well.
So, all we did as a board was
make a recommendation like here
our finalist this is who we
recommend and then had to be approved by the council.
So hr did all the contract negotiation.
And closing of the position. So, um, absolutely. Thank you for that. You answer federal spot on and
the words I heard essential.
And one followum question.
To talk a bit more about that 3 person task force.
We passed air resolution today
for our oversight board to hold
meetings remote and outside of here.
A bit on the 3 person task force and their task. Upon what they were responsible for.
I involve to say I deponent rmdz 3 person task force because
of quorum. I recommend 5 person because
then people can speak one on one
and having questions you want to
make sure you are abiding by open records and you know walking quorum. You know I don't know if that is a thing in san francisco. But I imagine it is.
absolutely it is.
So, I recommend 5 people
committees of 5 person task force.
So you are not break quorum that
was the major issue with having
a 3 person task force is quorum. absolutely. thank you and yea.
You are spot on for us 5 would
be a quorum.
Any sort of 3 person task force
you MAY have to look in community members. Thank you. You answered the questions. you are welcome. I have a question. yes.
one second if I can add to
that also, you can't have 4
people committees e sfchl like a
task force where you are tasked.
not a lot of vote being that has
to happen where it is something
that MAY be the full group or
board votes o. So you don't
always have to have a task force
or a committee that is even
people unless your ordinance says so. appreciate it. hi.
I have a question regarding the
applicants that were submitted. Was the task force responsible
for sifting through or did hr
take a first stab and then push throughout recommendations to
the tasks force or board yoochlt hr did the initial screen to
make surety applicants met the
basic qualifications. So that was helpful they cysted
through all of that to make sure
that the people that were then
who essays like you don't want
want to go through and score
supplemental essays for people
who don't qualify.
Having hr to give put those
people who qualify was very helpful.
And then it was 4 -- 4 board
members who -- scored the
supplemental essay question
thank you. This is julie soo.
Good to see you remotely this time.
hi. Julie! thank you so much for being here.
As you tell we are trying to
still get our feet on the grounds oir our first meeting was AUGUST of 2020 part television was determining the cost benefit analysis. We are a member our board is just 7 people.
So if we had a task force, it
would be 3 and we would make ape presentation because any time thereupon is a quorum we notice
of the public and it is a public meeting.
If we do back grounds work it makes stones not.
Have kwoer and up have to publicly notice.
My question is, in terms of the
cost benefit analysis, does a firm actually add more?
I notice you got 2 more
candidates if we were to amor
types 60 thounz that it is a lot of money.
And if we were to able to have
like dedicated people within our own body and MAY be someone with
hr to vet. I think our major consideration
of of having a recruitment firm
was to develop a description.
As well as noticing the
candidates f. We went through
trade associations, do you thajd
be adequate as a first stab to
see how many we get rather than
jumping to a recruitment firm?
I mean, especially if you have
very -- you know -- strict
budget conupon strains.
We did not have a surplus but
you know madison allocated a
decent budget and since we had
not hired our inspect monitor,
you know we had that salary not used.
It is like -- we are in the
going to have the person hired until DECEMBER. Use our money.
Because there was money
allocated to our civilian
oversight board.
For us if we have the money and
spends it then let's do that. Your situation is different.
I think you know, I personal
lead recommend to trying the
methods you have and the list
that if [Inaudible] Jason those,
we put together a really good
list of places to recruit from.
So -- um00ue MAY not need that
but having someone who is
dedicated staff to -- that if hiring does make a big
difference in that time line. Right? Something who can set up the
interviews and the interview panels.
Somebody who can collect the scores.
That was why um automatic00hr
was helpful um -- because -- hay
knew how essential this how --
greatly needed the position had been.
Like -- here we are 2 years it
is we did not have -- office of
the inspect monitor we did not have an inspect monitor.
We also did not have a full time administrative assistant and
don't have our data analyst yet.
We have been lucky.
if you could share the list
of places that where you recruitd that the be helpful and the essays you post. That would be helpful.
It sounds likes hr did a lot and
the way we operate we have to
allocate part of our fwoj hr if we use them.
I don'ting we'll get around not
using hr if we use a firm we
rely on hr it is a budget consideration.
I think it is getting candidates.
I noted in the description and makes sense that a candidate
could not have worked for the madison police department there
had to be a 10 year gap.
You don'tment, you want someone who is inspectful our university
of candidate system more narrow. Under the charter. This is unfortunately, we senate
have inspector general or staff whop had law enforcement
background thap cuts off a lot
of really great candidates. For no reason.
And so I'm hoping that changes
in the future but I think for
the time being our universe is small. So, having a list of the organizations and the out reach
you did and using [Inaudible]
Would make sense to solicit candidates.
Once we have candidates we do have. Equity standards in place in
terms of contract with human right's commission and hr.
We are well verseod that and I
guess secondly in terms of the
type of candidates and the
infrastructure now we are
fortunate top have the established police department of accountability.
They handled the sheriff's complaints it is well established.
What we are looking at is having
the infrastructure be within our sheriff's department.
Our it is antiquated. Unlike the police department
they could automate things --
throughi t we don't have that.
Very much things are on sxarp we
have our deputy here who is on a
board member and atufts that. Scheduling it done by hand.
So -- I'm wondering if after you
hired the ig in terms of the
time line in getting the infrastructure and someone to organizing and starting an
office, did you have to allocate
a budget to actually get
additional system in place?
Well network xr my first meeting
with -- leadership with our
inspect monitor and ig.
And so -- we had a budget set up
for you know for office materials.
Um needed.
Um, we have as a board, um, you
know we had community conversation.
So, we compensated community
members for in their retirement
the so, we allocated different
thing in our budget.
Weed have um police oversight
board in madison 250 thousand
dollars budget. And that -- .
Gives us a lot of room how many
we can allocate toward the
different positions and how much
for other stuff like luckily we
can use the web developer of the city.
We don't to allocate our budget
for hr or the web people or you
know for that time assistance. The bottom line we're the
beginning stages we need it have
a solid plan and time line and
bench marks to move forward. Yes.
Absolutely and also having solid
upon bench marks in terms of
your interview questions, too. Exactly what is it you are looking for in the essays and
what are you looking for for the
people fop say.
On your oral board the people
who scored from your board or outside community members?
we had a combination of both.
We had um -- 2 board members.
2 community members and then 2
we were tried very hard to get
you know, oversight bheem had
oversight experience.
Looked for an im, we wanted to
have -- people who had higher
oversight.
The first screening where we
then that's how we chose our top
4 finalists. They were presented to the committee.
you triggered a final
question a real final question. There was a suggestion from
another conversation atendee and
she suggested we MAY consider a
retired inspector general
football we were lagging behind in hiring somebody to have staff. exactly.
and hire that person on
contract to help get things going before we considered someone permanent.
is that something your board considered.
Gi would highly recommend that.
I witch we would have done that.
It would have upon given us a
lot more insight.
We -- quite often felt like I have been floundering. okay. thank you for your time.
I hope that we have future collaborations as we both
jurisdictions work toward a
better oversight community. Absolutely.
I'm excite body you know this partner collaboration and
getting to know one another and sharing information.
Because I would really like to
see am you know, the county, we
have no jurisdiction over our sheriff's department.
Over our county jails and so --
I was sharing supervisor county
board because I want to start
implementing and you know doing that. We are an odd animal in san
francisco we are a city and county to ourselves we have police and sheriff within our
city and county. yea.
I'm fascinated by that. Eager to learn more from you as well.
others have questions? I thank you again.
I want to offer a couple things what was the time upon pliant it
is you did 2 recruitments. What was the time line for the
first from the time you started
until the time you said you had
2 finalists and what was that time line?
so -- the -- first time line
around no I don'ts.
And then the second time line --
the first time line include the position description and the task force.
So the second time was obviously
shorter because they had been done.
But we started um -- we opened the position.
I want typeset say MAY.
It was opened want if MAY, JUNE,
close in the JULY and then we
um -- final decision made in OCTOBER the contract negotiation
took us awhile because the first
choice declined.
And -- so we had given that
person I felt a lot of time before starting.
Like we offered the position. Like early OCTOBER.
And a week I can't start until DECEMBER.
I don't recommend allowing for
1s to take 2 months to decide if
they want your position.
You refer to a task force was that from your commission? Members of your commission? correct. can you estimate how much time member of your commission
had to put in to the effort to
the recruitment effort?
Um -- well.
I'm not sure what how much time
the other people put in I can
speak for myself I put in at
least a good 10 hours.
I also was having conversations with people.
So we used obviously our city website.
We used our affirmative action list serve.
Used philanthrophy news letter
and municipalities for the state.
Um -- the neighborhood centers. The urban league.
Um, we -- um, law schools we and
as well as um -- you know some
of the um community newspapers.
Um -- the um association of the inspector's general.
Um -- I think that is 3 huh human dollars.
Advertise with them the national
association of black law
enforcement officers that 3 our
state bar association. National are organization on black law enforcement executive.
That was 300 dollars.
And so -- again. Then.
We had used that the way our
group and so we sent stuff out to them as well.
Um linked in.
We had our community partner
limps um -- and so any like nonprofit organizations that
have to do with social justice
or has to do with um --
incarcerated or prisoner rights was that was 10 hours total
that you put this personally.
personal low. Yes.
over the entire process.
no that was jut just the recruitment process.
how much hours you put in.
Creating the time line, hiring time and will each those. .
Individual task says I sat on
that oral board then I you know facilitated our communication
conversations and then so I
personal lie have nut close it 200 hours.
Um -- as a volunteer I just --
it is essential and honestly, at times feel I should be paid I
should be paid for what I'm
doing and will be paid once I'm able.
I don't want a conflict of
interest doing consulting I
would rather gain the experience and networking.
I should be compensate today is
not easy work if I was a voter in your community I would vote
for to you are compensated. Upon upon howune about the task force meet and how long.
our task force was meeting
every week for 2 hours a week. Okay. And will my last question if you
could do it over would you hire
a recruitment firm? we tried.
We would have if we could have.
Bum since we couldn't I just
have been bound to make it work.
I felt like well, we had allocated 25 to 40 thousand dollars and I would gladly collect that if I could. So.
if you had to do this over
again, would you want to do it
yourself or hire a firm?
You know -- now they had the
experience I would do it myself.
But I would have felt i
recommend hiring a recruitment
firm if it is you can.
If you can allocate if you have
the scombj if you and finds that
recruitment firm, so we have
budget but could not find the firm.
If anything in a perfect world.
Yes, hire a recruitment firm when you don't have those things happen nothing your favor you
gotta do what you do. okay. Thank you again for your time.
You have a follow up.
what do you think recruit am first degree murder have added
that you daul not have?
um -- more about time?
I felt possibly more connections.
Um -- but come to find out we
did not need that connection in the end.
I gus know -- people talk about
theed impostor syndrome.
I thought who am I.
Am I qualified do this recruitment.
Come to find out I am.
So -- I think sometimes we lack
that confidence to do the work
ourselves and so for me I now
feel like if I could do it
again, I probably would have felt comfortable letting a dpoirm it so there was a sense
of discomfort I did not feel I
knew what I was doing. But. It worked.
I guess this leads to a followum question. Vice PRESIDENT.
So -- with the recruitment firm
did you actually interview the firm?
So I than a lot.
we did not get applicants not one. okay.
we wanted a recruit am firm.
I think for me when I been a recruitment firm there has to be
an added upon bonus and my
concern is sometimes recruitment
firms base on the staffing of
the recruitment firm they don't have the diversity we are looking for.
Our city is diverse.
As well as our community.
And we don't have really diverse terms even though they are reapproved by the city that is a
requirement of using a firm,
they are on a prior approved
list based on criteria including diversity. I don't know in terms of staffing.
I went through a process with an upon dprnt commission before
sdpi was not so can have the the
recruiting firm were able to bring more to what if people
were to set aside time to dedicate doing it ourselves.
And it is also to me a learning curve it is important for people
who serve on our bodies to
veterans and get educate second
degree along the process. So. In doing this work.
I'm starting to find my niche.
I might become that person.
To start helping ecstasy recruit
their people of you think I said
it was induction by fire now figure out you guys might be able to be do that way better
you know what you are looking for.
Um, you -- a firm MAY not grab
exactly what civilian oversight means. They MAY not really and truly be
able to find wham it is you are looking for.
so I think you know considering
you have constraints, go for
doing it yourself first and see
if you are able to put open the
position up and see if you have
enough people apply. And then if you don't vice PRESIDENT Enough people apply absolutely,
you know see if you can get
someone to when that recruitment
but -- I feel like we did an
okay job recruiting on our own.
I think I just myself laughed
the confident or thinking that I
knew what I was doing or but --
like I said, it happens and I
did think you know, of it was -- no audio.
I think you will do great.
You will find someone. [Laughter]. we benefit from your experience. Thank you very much you are welcome. Thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.
no other questions. Thank you very much. Have a good afternoon and evening.
thank you.
You as well.
I think our agenda was quite full.
There was -- I think I would like to use this time rather than wait. Why don't you contact our scheduled presenter I think as a
commission we should discuss this. And get like our feet I want to
hear others perspectives I think
we don't get an opportunity to
speak about this because of the
rules you than are -- there to
ensure that the public has information. I will be frank.
i don't believe that it is about one side or another side choosing a firm.
I believe it is about us making the most informed decision.
I believe we should focus on
getting different perspectives
one thing we are now doing.
I'm concerned we have been
aboard since AUGUST and now we
have not established time lines, priorities or deadlines for community meetings.
And I think I feel an urgency in
the beginning of JANUARY to uphold what the citizens have
asked us to do which is those 6
things primarily to hire an ig.
My position is I like the idea
of having a task force we work with hr. I myself would volunteer to be
on that task force and happy to chair it given my past experience of being on the recruiting firm for the recrewing committee and chair of
that for know 7 and a half years
at my law firm and interviewing
nationally for my current corporate job.
And -- during this process I'm
not completely new.
Let's say.
In 2 weeks we work and develop this task force.
Identify who the task force is
and identify what we want and upon when. And move forward.
I think it suspect important for us.
We obviously have a wonderful alli.
That can -- guide us and w with us.
But we also have resources here. Board members. Folks that have been here
oakland had 20 applicants we can
ask them to sends to folks
that -- because our twin city
sister city is beautiful, I love me some oak land. We are different. MAY be because it was not a good
fit for oakland it MAY be for us.
We can have that dmaendz out.
That is my thouchlt I'm not
opposed to having a recruiting firm.
What I'm opposed to is how this transpired. I don't believe it was property
for an inspect person to solicit somebody. I don't believe it was
especially in a board floor of transparency I don't believe it was present top have this become
this one sided this group likes a firm this one.
I'm leaning toward hr I'm budget savvy.
And you know, I look at our
scombj what we have to do and someone done investigations and
done work on prosecution investigations, on this, the
work that is being done here is so important.
It is so important of the and we
need to focus what our roll is
rather that try to step in the
shoes of an inspector general
our role is to hire.
That the way thanks happened left a bad taste. I don't like that.
I don't think it serves the community.
But I also believe in our if we
are transparent of the our goal
is to get the best person
everyone can say that.
Huwe do that is important I suggest and recommend that we
establish a task force and find out if combnld be interested in serving. If we don't have people that are
interested I'm letting you know I am. Then but if no one elsement this is we daunte it.
That's the reality.
That's my position I'm not aposed to either.
I think we should try doing it ourselves.
See what we get and get it out there.
We also had people who are not part of our jurisdiction this
are not san francisco voters not residents tells us what to do
and what their opinion is.
I not we awfuls had residents
who is call in the that said post it. Post it.
I'm for and we and make it very clear this MAY be updated and why would it be updated?
What we needed to do and I recommend that as part of this
we establish the dates of
FEBRUARY and MARCH for community
meetings because whatever we
post we should update to include any input community given if yous.
And I think that it is valuable.
So -- what I hope to express to
each you is my dedication to being action driven.
That unites us together and
really maximizes to use the
skill sets we all have.
I'm happy to use mine in the task force and ask to you join me to do that.
That we bring in the community that so rightly should have a
voice in this process.
Y upon vice PRESIDENT And PRESIDENT Wechter we actually
have a time line with bench
measure and -- the board member
palmer you bring an insight with the communities we absolutely
necessary we have not touched
upon that community and if we
are asking for a report it has
to be jermaine to hiring an inspector general and having a budget for the infrastructure of the office.
We are coming upon the budget
season I'm thankful will for
etch pda marshall is here and
you know staff from pda got us
the budget and to maintain our
budget if we don't use the money
we lose it and we are coming
upon a time we need to be
reporting and having a formal
report to the board of
supervisors, I look to the board
members and I'm hoping that you
know those who term out soon be able to be approximate continue in their role.
We barely scratched the surface.
I'm a bhorn looks to time lines
and bench marks if we don't have
deadlines we will not get things
done we have to hold our feet to the fire. Of
nais why when I ask questions
here it is not so I want to be I
want to be accountable to the
public and I'm asking guess you
were a member of the public as well to be accountsable and will
had they want to see with us. I heard clearly from one call
are last week who is from san francisco and said stop wasting
the taxpayer dollars.
What are you doing and
accomplishing we need a set plan
and also -- to make sure that
what who we do hire and whether
it be 6 monthses from now that
we have the support system so we
don't lose an inspector general
or set that inspector up for
failure.
It does not look good to the
public one person solicited one sdpirm had that one firm.
Because it makes the process electric like it was not
transparent and open and there might be conflicts.
Will so -- I am -- still open we should move forward with that
first sxf if we need to and I
know hr surrounds constraints.
If we have a task force and work
with hree have a seasoned commissioner who served on the police commission.
We have support from pda still
and pda still has to handle the
sheriff complaints we have legal time lines to handle them
temperature is not like we can
cut off and not have pda to
support our work.
Are we getting mc partland?
Why don't we go to a small are agenda item the issue with the business cards? I think we can address quickly.
we are having a discussion I
think that is an issue already. Especially as vice PRESIDENT, am
that happened several times
where my input all folks of
color here and folks who are engage in the community get brushed aside.
I think this needs to stop I
appreciate an opportunity to let others the discussion continue. Rather than shepherding us through the agenda.
The next item was hearing from MR. Mc partland.
We were not able to do that.
does anyone have a comment. Maker I motion put it out and
make a motion we start a task force to get people behind it.
It is done.
You know.
we got stop the discussions and input and instead start take action.
So that is part of where we got
stuck in stuff was -- not putting forth enough motion to make action.
That is the upon one really key
element I learned now you know
is less talk and more action is
how you develop your office faster.
can I just know one thing regarding a task force most
likely that will be subject to public meeting requirement.
Someone said we don'ts to have a public can move quicker that
will not I think have you to
also if you have any this body
has a committee tell be that
committee will have to meet publicly. okay.
I wanted add I think my
original position listen, I
don't mind going throughout hr route or recruitment agency.
I think who does it needs to dot work.
My concern is that the amount of
work that come with the hiring process.
And I don't think I can spends 200 hours.
I don't think tell be 200 hours
because MRS. Flores talked about
the work they did and copy
not copy but lift from the
process, which is great.
I appreciate her experience and point view.
I do think that it is important
thap we make a decision versus
waiting for the next meeting to
the task force is needed. So.
I move to create a task force
while I doment to hear from the
comments of folks but I will put that motion on the table. I will second that motion. thank you.
I will comment on that. I'm in will fuel agreement.
The end of the day the reason we
signed up for this oversight commission.
On the police commission and a
part of several commissions and bodies.
I was happy to hear I'm about
action and is was waiting for
say, let's make a motion.
I think again we need to be
about action the fact we only had a certain select amount of
meeting its will not take us 200
hours but the cost benefit analysis could take someone 200 hours have you to pay for
temperature we are now meeting
monthly and we do have the time,
as committee members and this is
so important, to put forth effort to try.
Photocopy we can't find someone
or needs to be difficult we can hire someone. That is my stance.
to clarify your motion to
establish a task force to work
with hr and not hire a recruitment firm.
My motion is to create a task
force to create a post with dhr
in a limited scope to find out
how much return of applicants we have.
And then make the determination based on that because the thing
is hr is a person who the entity
that knows most has misflores
mentioned people will get weeded
out they the city requirements. Right?
If we have a sufficient pool to the task force to consider. I think we can present that to
the board and be like you know what?
There is suffer pools a recruiting firm. This does not look whatever they
go and weed through the first phase this does not look like
the best pool we MAY want more and did our effort in reaching
out to the community and will do
that in tandem to the FEBRUARY meeting we discuss the dates now and set the location today and
we can start working with the marketing team from the sheriff
and d ph from our own network to
get it out there and hear community that is going to
impact the task force and impact how we go about the process.
That was a long way of saying
motion is to credit a task force
to work with dhr to solicit re sume s and after the accident
everassess and present a recommendation weather we need additional from the people that
dot work.
Whether we need support.
Item not if I say I'm able to
commissioner soo is able.
Other folks say they are available.
Not that I'm looking at upon anyoneful
anyoneful let's get something out there. By next month this commission
this task force can say, hey.
We post, took us 2 weeks to draft something and we drafted the first draft.
We have already tons of information just from madison, right. Get it out there. Make a commitment. Post something in 2 weeks and see when we get. we might not get anything but let's see why not. I don't think that is a long
time of an among I'm not say
being that the recruiting firm I don't know them.
I just think this we need to
cleanse the palette and do this differently and really focus on
the time lines and bench marks. MR. Mc partland?
Yes.
We did not have sufficient
members last week last month to
vote on to determine whether at
this point to use a firm or work
with hr since we do have all 7 here I think we should have a vote on that whether at this
point we want to work with dhr
or this point we want to contract with a firm. Take a vote and resolve.
we have a motion on the floor
and so I think that your
suggestion PRESIDENT, is out of order.
And I wanted hear comments from board member nguyen.
Why don't we hear from MR.
Sureburn first. Waiting for MR. Mc part land.
I would like to hear from fellow board members.
Now we have a motion we should
discuss the motion. I have a comment.
I represent a portion of the
community that would be put mow in the play-offs responsibility
to make sure that -- fulfill
thanksgiving position in this law enforcement position that --
we pick a candidate we know does
not bring the baggage we worked
hard not to have in office. Right?
That was one of my concerns
outside agency.
In I assume my colleagues know i
know I can spot someone. This should be not include.
Right and of course -- I'm also
has a level of integ lity I would not do that to somebody
that don't deserve it.
I think going through hr
would do that. Seconded.
are we I think we need to take public comment before
action and this agenda item.
all of us are here. I understand.
We cannot take a vote at this point.
until we have public comment.
initial low I was split on
the inspect recruitment firm and
dhr but after more -- research
notice third degree dhr they
have a better -- wider range of resource. They have employee data base.
They can recruit from. Every so often in my department
we will get an e mail for a job
not related my department of
so -- that's positive for them.
They have the it applicant
tracking stream lines the process.
And they have experts that do
become grounds checks and
reference checks.
10,000 cheaper than bob murray. That is still 10 thousand dollars cheaper. So.
The more transparent um -- the reports public low if anything
were to go wrong, in the hiring
process, they will be held
accountable.
So -- my friends, he hired a
contractor to do his front yard.
And unlicensed contractor.
And -- he -- the contractor ran
off with the money did not do the job.
i think it was like john's
landscaping one day and the next
like steve's lands scaping.
So with that said I'm not saying
bob murray will be like that
basesed on research hr would be
the best route.
Can't get MR. Mc for land. good afternoon.
Sean with the d. Human resource.
I intended being in the chamber
and stopping our operation
center this week.
So I appreciate your wellingness
to join remote.
Some of the comments in the
considerations so dhr was likely
less cost than upon than bob
murray.
Is is that the sheriff's
department board and the oig
does not have staff.
If we break piece off individually.
How long and what the cost would be.
Um -- those are challenges and in particular because we still
have to find a resource to take
on that work.
The way it ws now departments
have their own h r team or contract with dhr.
Someone on my team you are familiar with d. Police accountability they have a
contract with dhr they pay us
100 thousand dollars a year.
To provide. Their department in the amount
of work they need.
Inform this instance -- we have to find a resource now.
I'm aveiling myself of that resource.
But I highlighted earlier I'm
stepping away from the departmental emergency operation center.
And I'm getting ready to start
the budgeting process and
partnership with the mayor.
those are all things the commission of that could be a
couple weeks to a couple months
I have a follow up question.
Are you not available to meet
with myself next week to look at a draft?
If a draft is created for you? Of initial first draft do you not have the capacity or schedule prefer to your
departure to review and ensure
it meets the requirements . I stands ready to support the commission in which way I can.
So to answer your question,
whether it is me our somebody else, I always have been willing
to work with you all and and dan
and scheduling whatever this commission needs. That's why I'm here today. If this is what is needed we will figure that out. thank you. and I will say I'm making a
commitment I will assist in
drafting so there will be
minimal or lessning burden on hr now.
Knowing there is hr that has been dedicated to pda in the pedestrian we are not starting from scratch.
I foal we are a bit ahead of the curve even with wisconsin. Wisconsin given us a wealth of
information we can use as a model. I don't feel tell be difficult
to come up with a draft.
I would think any position description that will be sent
doubt deshould be approved by the entire board. without question but when we
are working with hr we need a
draft before we can present it
to the board and have it for posting but without bench mark
and time line we are not going anywhere.
I feel we have been asking people to speak and someone with
an inspector generalor running
an agency that was premature the cart before the horse when we
have notteen come up with a time
line and floon get job bulletin out.
I feel this is a start and -- violent carrion made a commitment that she is willing
to get a draft done in a week. And I am willing to work with
here we are trying to capitolize
on the limited time hr has we
will not sit and wait and debate this anymore.
I think dh r given us a break down and time line in response
to my e mail I asked for time
frame for each compoenlts of the process.
we have that public low but again you have personal low
asked but not presented to the
board and we are transparent
here saying to san francisco and our taxpayers that the people
who voted for this charter we sfand ready to get moving and
move forward with when you want
and so that's why will will I
vol teared to be on the task force andville tear my hours to get this ball rolling. I think with that we have heard from hr.
We have a motion now we have to take public comment I think we
are ready to move on because we
have a set time limit of 3 hours
we need to make a decision.
MR. Shirrbourn if we get you a position description what
would be the time frame for
pubicizing that and beginning a recruitment? chatting off line.
I think a lot of it the challenge here we need to finds
a resource to support what this commission is asking.
I my consent sill will be a
limited resource in this.
So we will work with my
colleagues to figure out how to
find nhr fortunate support this commission's efforts.
Now everyone is dedicated I said
a person dedicated to dpa.
We would not be able to assign
that person without taking
resources away and the
challenges I can w with my team
to figure out what is needed and rework the work order with
the -- with -- your department. .
I think in all fairness, I dpo appreciate my colleagues and
want to make sure as we talk about the task force who are part of the task force. And should sit down and make sure we take the time.
I don't think we need to rush t.
If we design and bltdz task force.
Hr gets it become at this time task force then present its to the body that statute process I'm hearing.
I think it needs to be realistic
as well in terms of the time.
But not a burden on the 2 of you. We welcome a third person. absolutely.
Will I'm happy top do it I know
the month of JANUARY for me is bananais, FEBRUARY I'm all in. I'm looking for accountability and as we look if a report I
want to be account okay to the
voters and we have moved forward or made steps and indicate that
we are being realistic and
highlight a place like wisconsin
that in 13 members of their
board or oversight board and it
took them 2 years to hire somebody. Another alternative with the job bulletin to look in the
possibility of hiring a retired
inspector general on a contract
base theys is another thoing get
things going and making sure the
infrastructure for an office and
possible skeleton staff might be
hireed get the office going. It should be open top any members who want to serve. absolutely. I have opinions on this issue
but I will save them until after
we take public comment.
Unless we can get MR. Mc partland on? No.
Why don't we take public comment on this issue? members of the public when
would like to comment for line
item 3, lineup at the podium or
call 415-655-0001, access code:
2497 440 7820 ##.
Press 3 to be added to the
queue.
We have 2 callers on the line. hi. Good evening, commissioners. Thank you for your work.
Thank you for your service it is
important, I work for the sheriff's department in the mid
70s and I'm so excite thered is oversight happening.
I'm barbara qatared I workad occ for many years.
I worked for the berkeley review
commission and san jose police
auditor a former PRESIDENT Of
[Inaudible] And so I know this process.
i than it is difficult.
I dp do were an e mail version
of comments but now I want to
say a different thing after hearing the discussion.
Upon I think that you have a lot
ahead of you.
I think that how you go about
hiring inspector general is difficult.
I think it is urgent. I think we need get someone in that position. I think it is important person
who is hired as the inspector general is the person to set up the office. I think that the idea of bring nothing a retired person to get
it set up is not the best practice.
I think that you really realliment the best person in the job.
What I heard other presentations
by dhr, they seem to be slammed.
I know that the city is trying
to hire all over the place.
I urge to you bring in a recruitment firm.
That is experienced in hiring at
this level.
Dhr I heard him say they would
be scrambling to find someone to assist you.
I don't think -- it does in the make sense you try to learn how to be recruiters.
I do agree the woman who spoke
earlier would be an asset who is recruiting.
But you know you have all shared over see.
There are a lot of asspekts of oversight that are not happening
because you don't have an ig, there are things you can be doing.
Going out and meeting with the
communities hearing their occurrence about the sheriff's department.
I don't think as a san francisco native and a second generation
of san francisco native not
forth generation but -- I don't
think as a san francisco residents that if I done know
about this field it would merit
at tomb me whether you used dhr
or hired a recruiter butt funds are not much more than it would
be it pay dh r&d hr is solemned. Let them dot other hiring they need.
They don't need to take on this job. Bab mur and he associates if
that the only person that is the
only agency that is applied they
are experienced in doing these hirings. Use that expertise.
And you said move on with it.
Goat with it but -- to go about trying to do some advertising
now and see what you come up
with and then -- coming back
that is going through the work twice.
Get someone started to do the
job and -- do it once and do it right. Thank you very much.
I have copies of my e mail
version but you MAY have that.
Thank you.
good evening have you 2
minutes.
No audio.
Good afternoon I'm carolyn I'm calling on behalf of the san
francisco public defender's office who was involved in the
creation of the oversight board
from the beginning. Legislation working with
supervisor walton this is an important board for us.
The ig role is important for us.
and a client and folk in jails
and thank you for your volunteer work on this body.
We are spicht of hiring a professional recruit am firm that has expertise in recruiting for this position.
It is an important role.
A first for san francisco we
want to make surety best possible most inspect most
expert person is hired.
Using approximate nationwide
recruitment to attract the most
qualified inspect candidates. You discussed.
The dhr does not do recruitments
for department head and upon often they hire outside recruit am firms.
And as we know and hear in the
press our city has massive
vacancies dhr is over workd and
so I can't see that our internal
sea department would dot type of really in depth nationwide
search that is needed to have the best possible director for the position.
And we want to make surety upon inspector general is filled with
the best and experienced individual with strong commitment to oversight and experience in this area.
We urge you all to vote in favor
of using an outside firm and doing a nationwide search.
And ensuring we have the best candidate.
Thank you. thank you. Good evening. Caller.
You have 2 minutes.
I'm gloria ber of district 10.
Looks like at this point we are
between a rock and a hard place.
Dhr suck with hiring practices especially following through
with their racial equity plan.
Using a conch tractor could be a
risk of wasting money issue
friends hiring friends not field
yeeldzing a qualified candidate.
You can't hire me I don't have credentials my solution to find
a city that hire in ig that made
bold changes to get rid of abuse
of deputies and see how they
found that external limit their procedures. Once a candidate or candidate is
up for hiring to conduct bold intentional out roach to the
harm communities to give the
final stamp of approval.
Thank you.
thank you, caller.
Othering public comment? No. PRESIDENT. Okay.
Before we take a vote I think we
should have a discussion.
I said before, I think it is the best practice the oversight
field to use a recruitment firm.
The twhoon did provide a bid
conducted similar recruitments
for similar oversight agencies
for bart, for the ig in orange county. So they are familiar with the procedure. They are familiar with the recruitment press and how to find candidates.
They are familiar with drafting
a position description.
They can do this 15 weeks from start to finish from sign of contract.
If we were to vote tonight for bob murray we could meet with
them when the contract is signed
begin this process we discussed. I think they could probably devote more time and more resources than dhr is able to.
If we are concerned about moving quickly.
They can do everything that dhr
can do and faster and with more familiarity with the field.
And a greater level of expertise.
The dmfrns cost is about 10 thousand dollars.
Weave have 300 thousand dollars
upon in our budget for fiscal 22-23 for professional and specialized service the money is there.
The money would be spent regardless.
If we go hired the outside firm
or dhr that money will go out of
the budget to their's.
I think they can respond more quickly.
They can reach a greater initial plaintiff's exhibit its is in
the easy finding qualified
individuals I agree with member soo unfortunate former law enforcement officers are
prevented from holding the position. .
We could not change that. Until the twenty 24 election.
But given that, we have a
smaller field of potential applicants. And outside firm will know how to look for them.
A firm contacted me this week to
ask my help in recruiting for a supervisor investigator in san diego and sends that job out to anyone who might be interested. I don't think that is a task that dhr can do. I don't think they will know where to sends. Who to contact and I don't think
we have the resources to do it ourselves.
i think having a committee would be excellent.
But are we prepared to put in 10
to 20 hours a week? yes. okay. I think we have 2 people who said that. okay.
okay that is those are my thoughts.
Take a vote.
I will make a motion regarding a recruitment firm.
I don't want to go and rehash
things I want to move forward
and PRESIDENT Wechter you knead either or it is is not. I think vice PRESIDENT Carrion
made it clear what we will do in
the next week or 2 with hr
support and acknowledging it is a limited support but we don't have a time line we are talking
that is part of the task force to establish a time line and
bench mark we want to hear from communities. And so as vice PRESIDENT Carrion said, we have an announce am out
there it could be updated. Based on feedback.
Particular to our city and county and the communities.
I would like to note I finds
it a problem that the ideas like
dhr is too busy.
This department is important.
We should not play second fiddle to other diameters.
These, this is our city and county hr.
We get to make a decision that
we are going to use your
expertise and resources.
I don't think that while there
is concerns about finding
resources it is not our job to
minimize our resources or
funding or staff and ability to access what is available to every other department. I hear the concernful I recognize that. And I am still grateful for
everything this they have done here.
I would rather not have MR. Sherman talking about this over
and over and reviewing the draft.
That's what keeps happening
every month we have him here inside of having him work here.
I want to start on the working.
Just a comment I was I think hiring an outside agency I said
this in the last meeting I'm okay with spending monwhen he it
is done efficient low and only a 10 circumstance difference with
dhr and bob murray.
However, I when had MRS. Flores
note they'd worked with hr one
staff member and did in the charge that is like surprising
to me they were able to not that I'm saying that people should
not be paid for labor but I'm
shockd that were able not to get
charged and that is why I am
okay with at least starting the
leg work of having a task force.
And posting -- a guideline and
time line that we want.
So -- that's my comment.
Gi think for dhr to post a job
announcement they have to have a position description approved with a salary scale.
And if we are talking about posting that and accepting
applications we have to have a process for evaluating the application and who will evaluate them.
One other advantage I see having
an outside firm it removes that
from the city process.
There is no real or --
appearance of biebs or favorite
taoism because someone knows someone. Bob mur and he associates no one
from this board or dp awill be working with them. To screen the applicants and rit
them they do it based on their knowledge, skills and qualifications.
So we have to consider who will do that task? yea.
And how we ensure terror is done
without teerns of fate taoism. I know from the first meet thering is discussion why dent
we look at the candidates paul hendz son proposed.
Why do a recruitment at all.
I said before I'm a strong proponent of open and expectancyive recruitment for government position no one should be hired because of who they know. right. absolutely and buk lucky for
us paul does not get to make that decision. We as a board do. .
That is why I think it is okay to go to hr.
And luck low for us we have MRS.
Flores the team that did their
work we lift.
We don't need to reinvent the wheel.
And -- yea.
so I'm clear settingum this committee, the committee report become and at that point we would make a decision on whether
to move forward with dhroir to
bring in an outside ricruelty am firm? yea.
Familiar it seems necessary. Absolutely. yea.
no one is kuth off the issue
it is let's get the worried out.
Get the community involved and let's get time tables.
We have to do that anyway.
I don't want to be here next
week talking about the same without dpoog any work.
Next month make sure the work is doning.
it is in the excluding.
I'm saying it is process and transparency. And PRESIDENT Wechter at each
meeting you said I did this and this.
We are being told what you did. But it was not brought forth
with the board and having a discussion. You and not you went out you
decide we need a recruiting firm.
It was not discussed and we
don't finish that process was transparent.
One firm came back with a proposal.
But we had no idea how broadly
that request for proposal was.
It locked insiderish to me and I
had no idea until we had
discussion with hr that in the beginning was a problem that's why I'm bringum and vice
PRESIDENT Care yen is bringing up the process to the full board so the public know when is we
are doing and if we are talking about transparency we need tow have time lines and open discussion.
And now we have a motion on the
floor and I think that if there
are no further comments vote on
it we can get through other items.
just to clarify sdpt motion I'm not sure you specified. there would issue a task force
and -- I don't remember.
Can you restate it with the task
force part of the motion it include the 2 members who said they are available. I want to make sure it is clear
what you are voting it. The motion for the creation of
what we now called a committee
instead of a task force.
I have volunteered myself of the
chair of that and luck low commissioner soo hopefully anyone else.
The purpose of that committee
would be to work closely with
dhr to establish a job
description and to publicly and
evaluate can the city sees who
come n. Who meets the min
schmuhl we can report the committee next month about what has been accomplished.
Who was out reach to and do an
update to the board next month. you would be the at this
point it is the 2 of you would
be -- commissioner soo.
anyone else.
that's correct.
I question the time line being
able to create a job announce am within an among.
I think it needs to be careful process.
We need on define the knowledge, skills and abilities.
You are saying go out and see who the immediate applicants are and come back.
That's not a best practice of doing a nationwide recruitment
it is posted for a month. PRESIDENT Wechter.
I'm an experienced attorney.
So is commissioner soo.
I think it behooves you to not make assumptions when our skill
sets are and ability to draft a job description.
We are talented and capable
attorneys women of colors that
are leaders here.
I'm speaking to what I know about the time line other
agencies have taken to do a recruitment. Stole do that wide lead to identify all the places where
you need to -- promote it.
I are experience with that.
And does not -- takes more than
a month.
I want to make sure getting back
to what we were saying, though. I don't know if that's what I'm hearing talk pregnant w with dhr. yes deteriorate a job sdroipgz
come back to the board?
the full board decides to be posted then it gets posted yes. How will we determine where it is posted.
we can cross this bridge this is the beginning of the process
the task force will bring to the body. yes.
can I ask for the pacific
force other members able to join
leader like I know you 2 are like great.
I think should be completely
open and get as much input from
the people here committed to the issue. No one including PRESIDENT Wechter you are welcome to be part of this committee wonderful if you would be
that's why we want a plan and
time line we want to intgreat
the -- that's I think the community has been waiting patiently we have a report to
the board of supervisor and
looks at the time line when the
board members hopefully will be reappointed again but we are
looking at a deadline.
That is why we do need to get
something done and we will have continuity.
I found a file that would be
very helpful for you guys we cameum.
We had like a hiring proposal.
And so like that included we
would work with hr and initial screening. How long the position would be open for.
Who would were going to sends it
to and in the same document is
the supplemental essay, bench marks whochltful evaluators would be the oral board
questions would be. I'm theme share those. They are public record. And then auchls in looking at
our time line in terms of board
approving the hiring process. Posting the job. The initial screening.
That I have all of those to be
able to share with you and
really I think tell help you put
down a lot of the work and
novelty feel overwhelmed as you
when we were able to ghaet smaller grouch people we were
able to accomplish more quicker.
Why we did do a huge national search.
The most qualified people happened be chose people from our community. And again.
We wanted a recruitment firm. No one was available.
So -- you know if you have a firm who is upon said they are willing to work with you that is
one thing we put out our feelers
for 4 week there is was no one
available to help us. About what we vote on. say it again.
a motion to create a
committee that will work with
dhr to prepare a job description
which will be presented and updated to first to the board
and then we can proceed from the
next step, which would be and making the list.
Is this clear? Yes.
great. Call the question.
take the vote taking the vote yes, please, thank you.
we'll take the vote for
itemly the task force. Or committee.
Member afuhaamango. aye.
member brookter. aye.
vice PRESIDENT Carrion. aye.
member nguyen. aye. member palmer. aye. member soo. aye.
PRESIDENT Wechter. aye.
the motion passed.
okay.
Can you call the next item on
the agenda and before we get to
that, MRS. Clark's I want to
provide claire ifkdz for the public.
At the last meeting use of the term sheriff's d. Accountability
well is no sheriff's office of a
count abltd the charter cities
the sheriff's oversight board
this bodies and office of inspector general.
use those terms only not to create confusion in the minds of the public.
Those other 2 entities nawere
created and for some reason the mayor's office is suzing sheriff's office of
accountability for budgeting that is not a separate department.
It does not exist. Joof presentation by the
department of police accounts
abltd dpa discussion and possible action.
Questions and comments from the
dpa presentation on DECEMBER 22
ndz regarding role in stake the
office inspector general.
Proposed staffing minimums and budget requirements and the
hiring of 8181 assistant chief
attorney using funds from the
[Inaudible] Budget
good afternoon.
Happy now years I'm represents
the department of police accountability to answer questions from my presentation last month.
I will not take up time, dpa is
red to support the board and
support realization the board's vision.
Any way that is appropriate for setting up the new departments
office of inspector general. I'm ready to answer questions
you MAY have for dpa and its role.
the memorandum of understanding 22-23 services to
be provided. Positions assistant chaefr
attorney required assist in developing, coordinating and intercepting policies and procedures of the sheriff
department accountability making
conduct of law enforcement agencies, city officials and outside organizations regarding
a variety of legal matters.
Surprising and preparing complex legal documents. Can you give us specific busy
what that is going to involve?
I with give you highlights
from the work in DECEMBER that
address trs some of those work responsibilities. You will know. We are already in budget season.
We have to upon have 2 hearings
that will be conducted 15 days
apart before the formal budget
for the sheriff's department for
budgeting purposes office of
inspector general under the charter presented on FEBRUARY 21.
We have to have 2 picture had
beenss oui be , we are in need
of a budget analyst.
And we had proposed that we hire
were a job code 1823 and analyst
to shepherd throughout process,
which the mayor issued 113 page
instruction for the budget of it
is a complex press andment to
ensure this new departments has
resource s to
resources to be successful we are identifying the resource
needs looking through all of
planning and work that dha doing for scombreers applying that on
a scaled down version for the
aim of work presented for
sheriff's accountability.
We are hopeful that with a presentation on what the
projected needs will be, we'll be success and will having all
of the resources this board
willment and need to stands up a proper department. The other issue that is
presented with us now is that
because we don't have an
employee of the sheriff's office accountability heel be the person to present at the hearings. We are doing what is necessary
on hopefully put him in the best
position to advocate for the new department. you said sheriff's department
you mean inspector general I'm sorry.
The mayor's department or
mayor's budget office has assigned the 3 letter are code
of sheriff's department of accountability.
Apologize.
Many operate on local serve and
ares some less sophisticated
system ensure the new department
has the most modern capabilities possible. This is possible in the city system.
We identified a cloud base
system that will be able to be integrated with the case management system we are working
on building with sales force now.
I'm mystic we the create an intgrated case management system
to provide upon services from
online generation all the way
through the completion of the case report.
And work flow back to the
sheriff's department. This will system will be built
so it is expandability to the needs of the new office will need. We have already started building
dash boards so we will be able
to look at statistics in virtual
real time and some point fill
them for the board to look at the statistics generate friday
the new department in real time
we are also in the process of
retrofitting space within dpa to
house the new employee desk
witness there is an ig appointed
there will be a very will staff process for hiring. And he was without facility and
work stations set up.
That will cause delays.
We hope that with the planning
and retrofitting of spaces we'll
have furniture and work stations with the technology set up.
Folks as they are on board can hit the grounds running.
In terms of the other work we
are doing partnerships with agencies. With the sheriff's department we
have been drafting and
negotiating a new letter of
agreement with the dpa and the sheriff's department.
To provide inspect oversight as
required by bill 481, something
that within in lulast year
provides supervision for use of
military equipment t. Is complex
legislation that has oversight component.
And we are now working out the details with the sheriff's legal
that is a sum row and example of
what is has occurred the past
month and the holiday.
is that you are locate the
office of ig in or in the building.
at least temporarily we
have the space and site for that.
Tell take time once you install
an ig to to work the department of real estate and identify office space.
I have over the past 10 years
worked on 2 major relocation projects and expansion projects
for were da office one where we
moved a division of the office
on a separate floor vacant at
the hall of justice and after
that, moving the entire office,
was a massive under taking and
project from 850 bryant and the home da office for over 30 years. Longer than that. .
To the new office space at 3 am
50 rhode island.
So it is a tremendous lodgist
cal challenge to set up a new office with d. Real estate.
Identifying the needs and getting that space.
At least temporarily it would
make sense when the ig is appointed they have a plan to
get started able to hire employees that will have the
space and resources to get started on the work rather than
wait 6 months or a year torhave
facility to operate from.
Under that bullet point, it says
draft procedures what would you
be drafting?
Now we have established
procedures for processing the
sheriff oversight responsibilities. Pursuant to the letter of green light in 2020.
We are reevaluating this press.
El be add being new responsibilities for the
oversight under a new letter of agreement that we'll establish for 8481.
You know so those will will need
to be updated. And scaled up as the work increases as well.
We have very will limited staff working on the sheriff's work
now you think from our last
presentation the d. Police took on the work without additional resource and performing that
work for 2 years before there
was ability to start obtaining resource.
so the procedures here would
those apply to the oig?
At this point we are
establishing it for dpa.
The idea is this if some of the procedures work, through the
operating agreements with the sheriff's department, the ia
division of the sheriff's department; that will be trans
8able and the new ig will be
able to build off of rather than
have to build new agreements and
procedures from scratch.
Dhr bullet point approved hiring
but existing department head.
What does this refer it on.
I'm having difficult.
under the bullet point in
your power point dhr, approved
hiring but only under an
existing department head? yes.
So the position that dhr has
they can only approve the hiring of employees under for a
department under that department head. That will being the
responsibility of the new ig to
hire employees for the office of ig.
this seems to be discussing
that the d. Police accountability responsibilities. That's how this power point is headed
department of police accountsability has not hired
anybody for the office of inspector general.
The department of police accountability will provide the support the new inspector general MAY need.
I have a point of clarification. president wechter this is related from questions repeat in the information that is presented. We heard this information before. At the last hearing. It was per of the presentation. Given the time schedule and
things we have to push over.
I would hope we would ask
relevant know pointed questions rather than the entire presentation again
I have specific questions we
did not get to ask left time
after sd ob and ig hire staff whom is that referring to hierlg the staff inspector general that portion is after the hiring of
the inspector general.
Those responsibilities are the inspector general.
The actions you sake is?
Money from the oig budget is
this there sell a work order now.
Where the oig or sd a, budget is
w ordered for the work dpa
performing to assist theef
support building of the new d.
Obviously.
Any of the expenditures the
manpower and facility expense,
that will be billed work order
to sd a. I mentioned last time, most of
the funds will not be extended
this fiscal year anyway.
The next 6 monthsen it alus the new department office of
inspector general to acquire the resources without extend it
against an any knowledge year
there will be competing salary
well is one in the office of
inspector staffing budget requirements.
70 thousand dollars for bathroom renovation?
that was originally the
bathroom -- was allocated for
the use of new departments.
It has been renovated under other funds.
So that is going to be a cost
savings you can cross off for
this year. okays that bathroom in the news in san francisco.
So -- I asked about that. So for all the actions you are taking would you be willing to
come to the board and get our
approval for them?
whatever this board as a board decides for whatever work
that we are assisting the board
work I see is a role we are here committed to support this board's work and vision. Yes. Obviously. Yes.
I'm asking now is -- will you
come to this board to seek our approval for the actions here you are plash to take?
I would like to -- oig
object to that.
Before you answer because I
don't believe chief assistant
klein has the authority to grant
us more power to call another
executive from a department to
require approval rights.
There are am the dpa is working
as a collaborative partner but
the charter does not state that
we are can require them to am do something.
What they need to do is follow
the terms of the contract and
the agreement that has is in
play with the -- sheriff's office.
So -- whether in all your good intention, and in your efforts
and generosity of time, I think
that question is inappropriate
and exceeds our jurisdiction. And is requesting something that is creating the precedent that we don't have that is not what the voters asked of under the circumstances.
We are not the inspector general.
We do not play that role.
What we need focus on is on
hiring somebody that does.
Well, the charter makes no
mention of the dpa playing any
role in stake of the office of
inspector general that's correct temperature
does state the sheriff's
department, office of inspector general shall be a department
under the sd ob.
I think that if the oig is a
department under the authority
of this board and money from the
budget for the oig is used for
purposes this board should have
a right to guest approximate
approval for the use of the funds. that's why I'm asking. Could you answer are you at this point willing.
I request that not be answered. What I can say is that I'm
probably not in a position to
answer that because I'm not the executive director for the department.
I would have to pose that question to the executive director fr. In order to get back to the burden.
And that would only be through some agreement.
I employed ask the city attorney on resthaefrp issue. And come back you to.
To the board MAY be -- next session.
to confirm what are our
limitations and what are our obligations.
Under the law?
I invaded director hendz son
here to answer those sorts of questions.
You mentioned the mou at the sheriff's department that was
signed in late 2020.
That states dpa make monthly
reports on the complaints. I can't finds those on your
website have they been issued. they have not. Since that agreement was established without funding component there is a limited
resource applied to the ability to complete that work.
The resources have been applied to the investigation and
completion in the 270 days that were agreed upon in the letter
of agreement in 2020. We are thank you for pointing that out.
We are in the process of starting to put together these reports as well.
Hope to have a report that will
be included in dpa's report in the next couple months.
I know you mentioned and
listed here in the mou.
The new software.
Sales force related case tracking software. yes.
Jol does that track the complaints against sheriff department personnel.
We are applying it to the cases
that we are able to follow the
same process dpa investigates
and processes every complaint. Although there are differences
in terms of -- how the set up
needs to be create today is
customized for the sheriffs.
but now there is a portion of the case system where the
information is inputted.
Hopeful low once we build it out for sheriff oversight work we
will have the data already
inputd that can get migrated in the places.
do you intends to apply for the position of inspector general.
I had a conversation some
time this summer with director
hendz son and invited to the position.
I did not formally fill out an application for it. so. You say that I couldn't hear the last part.
I had a conversation with
director henderson to the work
of assisting over seeing the work done.
This hen over the sheriff's oversight and coming in to
assist with the efforts of
building the resources necessary
for the new department that
position was vacated earlier.
Through -- when the previous the
previous chief sharon wu left
down in list.
So -- which there was a change the director and I had a
conversation did it and invited
me to consider the position at
which point we discussed the
terms of me transferring from the director attorney to the department of police accountability are you asking. you misunderstand my request
do you intends to apply for the
position of inspeckedor general. No.
do you intends to apply.
This is inappropriate question thanksgiving is a fishing expedition your role as
PRESIDENT Of the board not an investigator.
If you have qualms with the
department of accountability
regarding misconduct or
misappropriation or any issue fwlang to this board rather than
what is happening now of asking
personal questions not
discussing what is the agenda items of MR. Klein. We had this conversation before.
Of if there is a personal reason
you MAY have against dpa it needs to put aside. Okay I really appreciate it if
you would not attack our guest
and put them in uncomfortable situation you are asking questions that are
unprofessional, not at issue and that exceed our jurisdiction. I don't understand how many times zee to have this conversation. that is a question asked of
the several people who offered comments about the sxroesz if
MR. Klein intendses to apply for a position. he answered that.
Why PRESIDENT Wechter I want to
do a time check it is 4:30 we
have other items we are rehashing what was in the past I
have questions of MR. Klein that
are very urgent we are in the budget process now.
So -- we had a presentation last
week by nicole and I forget her
last name. Armstrong.
So I think the immediate
question now is -- peculiared
you keep us informed of the
budget process and hearings in
case the board members would
like to attends and then the presentations before the board of supervisors.
And knowing this I believe the
mayor asked each department to
cut the budget by 10% how that
would impact in the future with
you know what dpa's role in helping us establish a separate
office of inspector general.
And again deputy city attorney clark, just to clarify.
Also to reiterate I believe our jurisdiction is to make recommendations of the sheriff
and because he is inspect low elected. We don't have the authority to intrefr with existing contract.
And so there are mou's in place
and so I don't think we can intrefr with the contract or
sever one that is not our authority.
But I think it would behoove our
board members to kept apprised of the budget process and finish we have short falls.
And also it is -- crucial that I think every board member familiar with the budgeting process.
That is a huge under takes and I'm thankful they are willing to
do that work for us and make
sure we preserve the majority of our budget thank you.
And that was dpa's intention was
to keep this board aprized of
the budgeting process with now
and the end of the fiscal year.
In fact, there will be have to
be a public hearing that will
occur next week that is the very
preliminary hearing to the
public feedback.
The next step is to ask MR. Leung to present an agenda item
so the budget can have a public
hearing on FEBRUARY third.
Where the board will have access to the information there before
a budget proposal is finalizeed be presented to the budget
office on FEBRUARY 21st. thank you. If there is nothing I'd like to
make a motion and move away from this item.
We have to take public comment.
We were not able to take
admissible comment last week.
We should -- this is not related to when is on the action item.
Not duly noticed and it is not in connection with what we are asking.
I think it is on the agenda.
The agenda references they are hiring of the 8181.
So eye would like to you answer
that unless MRS. Clark feels you should not.
it statute question has been properly I'm sorry.
Is the question -- covered by agenda.
I think it is fairly covered.
I don't finds it on the public not sxifkz don't apply through a public notification.
If it was public low noticed this was not how I identified
the position. thank you. Member, you wish to make ail motion.
I want to make a motion we
conclude this item and move on
to the other items pending.
if we are concluded here that motion is unnecessary.
I would like to make a motion regarding this item.
I would like to make a motion
that we void the mou that --
signod SEPTEMBER 16th and ask
dpa to come back with detailed
mou specifying tasks for our approval.
make thanksgiving motion because
I feel that we as the agency
that -- over cease oig we should
play a flow how the money allocated oig is spent.
I think we should -- dpa should
have come to this board to seek consent. They did no.
They had MR. Leung sign on our
behalf it is a matter of
maintaining the integrity of the board and in terments of
oversight of the oig.
so MAY I interject.
I had said if this is concluded
I would not mic make my motion I'm making nile motion we
conclude I believe we have adequate information from MR.
Klein and reiterated again and
again we have adequate and more
than adequate presentation last
time from mim him and nicole
armstrong I will make a motion
we conclude this item and move forward with the remaining
agenda because now we have know
half an hour to workorth items that have been pushed for
several meetings now.
I second. I think this board should go on
record approving or disapproving
this mou. pending motion.
can we take a vote, please.
on the motion to include this
line item.
Agenda line item for member afuhaamango. aye.
member brookter. aye.
vice PRESIDENT Carrion. aye.
member nguyen aye.
member palmer. aye.
member soo. aye.
PRESIDENT Wechter.
aye. I'm sorry. No.
the majority quorum 6-1 the motion passes.
call the next item, please.
item 5 rules of order review
and final comments of the rose
water for adoption at a later
meeting.
Any discussion on this item?
I wanted say that I submitted minimal change specials thank you MR. Leung having in a do you
mean I could cut and paste and I
noticed that when shows up on my
computer is a light acwas when
print today is dark I will chose
a light are material next time
if we happened have a quick sdpugz conclude at the next
meeting we can adopt these rules
of order.
A made more -- comments and it
was -- really -- the header for
the quorum I thought it was
awkward right of board members.
Less than quorum and I just
figure should we use few in a quorum. .
Just to leave it as a quorum.
And then -- see.
Under the alternative meeting
place whether or not we need to
specify the alternative location
ad a compliant.
And then there is additional
minimal changes.
I added rule 2.5 it is a, b, c
or d and I just kinds of cleaned
up the ending of rule 2.6
because I saw some other
floating pronouns and noun. Pronoun reference agreement issues.
I reworded that.
if I need to read it out.
That is the light aqua was dark
and obsecures the text. Looks like we'll not take action
until the next meeting if members have I think have
immediate questions now I can
answer my comments or -- edits
were and then -- I have a
question for rule the last rule on written communication. Does this cover like social media policies.
I was thinking about fiwant. yes. That was separate and had
guidelines from dpa I thought
about -- consolidating that I
did not present a draft but
thought about a general media policy I think it is upon
appropriate that we -- not be in
the media to solicit media unless it was something that was approved by the board we took action. And then I think it is
appropriate that when we. To do
community out reach that it combh in an official capacity
rather than individuals because
as you know, the media not
social media but in general and
for the record I was a reporter
for a year and a free lance
writer for 12 years and appeared
on tv and radio and print journalists don't distinguish
which an individual comment and
make it as backed by the entire
board it is important we specify
who is speaking for our board and make references and if
anything touches possibly on something of a legal nature we
refer it to the city attorney or the sheriff's department or office council.
We don't want to make opinions
on anything that touchod a legal issue.
I think where my head is like
if I was to do a social media
post like sindzing out to the community.
These days we'll talk about x, y
and z do I need approval before
or is it case by case.
I think if republishing
something we said we were doing
I don't see anything wrong. Next y. Please.
take public comment. sorry.
members of the public when
would like to make comment for item 5.
Lineup or dial 415-655-0001,
:   2497 440 7820 ##,
then story 3 to enter the queue. Item 6 mission statement discussion and public objection item. Review and discussion the mission of the sheriff's
department board and possible adoption.
I'm fine with accept
thanksgiving if simultaneously we adopt code of ethics which we can't do tonight.
I would move that we continue
this to the next meeting we
include the code of ethics.
I want to say I purpose low left out reference to the code of ethics.
We -- have taken our oaths and
we do have under our city and
county code of ethics. And everything else.
We can take best practices but I
think it is in the a good idea
to have mission statements the kitchen sink and refer the
public it something where they look up something else.
We are following the best practice and codes.
For me less is more and I would
prefer to keep it very short. I'm in favor of that if simultaneousee the board adopts
the code of ethics many over
site boards have adopted.
It would be separate not be in the mission statement.
I'm fwien that I think that
we have something -- right here
before us and I don't know if we
necessarily and MAY be we have
that under guidelines.
We have our rules of order out
there that MAY be we intgreat
that part of the ethical portion. I'm fine with that. Motion we condition this to next month so that we will simultaneous -- first adopt to apply to the board and then member soo's version. I don't understand how the
code of ethics would influence
or have part of our mission statement? my question.
Could we not do that in the future.
We then and there so that we I'm willing to which 2 I don't want
to condition I think we can vote
and consider the code at another
time.
Everthink we left out positive
words are important to be in the
mission.
Remove inclutziveness and transparency.
.
I recommend we keep this this
the mission it will be clear what it is for.
I wanted it to be -- um --
short and sweet I feel we can't be exhaustive when we list
things if we have a lot of listings we necessarily leave something out.
I hope wheny we are responsive to all of the communities we
serve that includes what we are
obligated to under the city
meaning being impartial.
Y that's the rational.
There are people in the
communities this need to see understands the mission when
than I see the words that are
comparable to actions not done
it is more clear what should be
done.
I suggest we put the words back in.
Are you out of the top part we
have inspect and partial.
Where do you want to add -- I
think taking out the line and
having it electric like the
first version is.
We are looking at the first kohn
with you remove the code and established by that information
you did in the want in there. Having it say.
what is left is good enough. Not just the bottom part it is in our duties and the stuff we
list the more we list the less comprehensive we are.
I'm going to request you look at
the second part that -- under
and then see if we need to add words.
I made it clear the words I
wanted to keep.
from the first I took out
ensuring we can't ensure and
that we don't dictate we don't
dictate the office of inspector general.
That's why I left it -- I'm
refer to the words transparency
and imperative up. Including staff resources to conduct investigations and
audits to why can't we keep
that?
We will do that and more. I don't know familiar we need
list the mission is a general
value statement of and so it is
not list the job duties. That's why.
If you look at all the other
departments we are not the other departments.
Our citizen are not all college or university graduateds.
In barely know how to read and
wliet when they do they like
words to cam pair to actions
words are powerful. Why?
I don't think it is a matter of
shortning or not being clear. It is important for people to
see again to compare to actions.
would you like to try rewrite thanksgiving to a version you
feel comfortable special have us
review and vote on that.
why don't we do that.
we can compare my version and
the second version mine the third version. Upon
thank you for your comments.
thank you. Looks like it is put over to the
next meeting. right. yes. if we have public comment
on this and we can add.
Members of the public like to comment for line item 6 if you are (Lineup. Otherwise call 415-655-0001,

press star 3 to enter the queue.
next item.
Please.
yien item 7 statement of
incompatible activity.
Review and discuss the
incompatible activities required by ethics. I asked city attorney office for
an opinion on part of this which
not able to get to me because of the holidays.
So I'd like to continue that
pending -- input from the city attorney.
I can find the part that
is -- under -- roman numeral 3. Cap a1 last paragraph.
No officer or employee serve on the board of directors or
employee of a nonproffer that is
a contract or grant agreement
with the office of inspector general.
Joy think we need to have clarification because there is
like the templet and we have
what -- secretary leung provided.
I think I had submitted something with changes I don't
know that if this got made it there.
I'm not sure what version we
are looking at.
you have the we have the templet.
And the other swon does this include okay.
It is not highlights with what I
did the last time?
okay.
So -- so, I have that referenced I don't know if we get to --
have a comparison lateror
because -- MAY be we don't need
to the city attorney said
everything was okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Pengdz opinion from the city attorney regarding that
paragraph whether stay in or removed.
The only change I would like. Repeat that again.
it is -- page 2, roman numeral 3.
Cap letter, a.
1 and the last paragraph on the page.
No officer or employee. thank you.
the only other change is in
roman 1 the bullet points strike.
can we go back so what is the change you want to make or question no officer or employee employed by.
waiting for the city attorney to have an opinion whether we
are required to keep it in there.
My concern is that I'm a member
of the board of director for civilian over sight law enforcement.
Could potentially be a situation
where the inspector generalmented to contract with
them to provide training that is
something we valid no say in.
The inspector general is the department head.
I wanted finds out if we need it
keep them in or take that out.
there is disclosure re e ure requirements as well.
The only other concern is roman
newell ral 1 the bullet points for the left one. Rules and regulations. We are not employees of the office of inspector general I
don't see why we are subject to
the rules designed for those employees.
MAY be specific rules pertaining to the information they are handling.
Internal procedures the inspector general will establish
I'm not aware of rules of other departments apply to the boards or commissions.
We have our own rules.
I'm sorry could you point that out.
very the first page.
okay.
Yea. I didn't add that.
I MAY have addd that it is not necessary.
I was following the looking at
other examples and in other
examples other city boards had. You know whatever their department rule and revving
ligzs they addd that it is not required.
So -- this dovetails to the
question on our -- rules of order.
I think we were waiting the
rules of order waiting for the
mission statement for oig, do we need in there? You need the mission statement in the statement. I'm sorry.
Dhoen we need the oig one?
No, I don't think that is
required.
On page 2 roman numeral 2, sorry.
There was a place holder insert oig mission. Yea. I have to look. We have it here seems base on the fact we
have a mission statement I like to continue this until the next
meeting I like to make a motion
to continue the social media
policy as well as the business
cards to move to line item 10. Given the time.
Specifically I will be asking
the board to pick 2 dates for
community meeting we can work on
scheduling.
i second that motion.
Is there public comment from the
statement activities my notion
close to continue it. And as
well as line items 8 and 9.
So we can use the last continue
minutes to pick a date for the community meetings.
And there was a second by
PRESIDENT Wechter.
Sdwroo what are the logistics
involved in us holding a community meeting?
I think there is a motion
still we have to close that up. okay. Sorry admissible comment.
Members who would like to
comment for line item 8 dial
:   2497
440 7820 ## then star 3 to enter
the speaker's queue.
There are no callers.
okay.
Can we move to take a vote on the motion. yea. okay. The motion to condition line
item 7, 8 and 9, member afuhaamango. aye.
member brookter. aye.
vice PRESIDENT Carrion. aye.
of member nguyen. aye.
member palmer. aye.
member soo. aye.
PRESIDENT Wechter. aye.
the motion passes.
Moving on line item 10 future
agenda item and discussion
items.
politic wechter had a question. yes.
What are the logistics of us holding an upon community mote
to set a date on what parameters
do we follow the brown act?
I assume in terms of public access. yes. Does it have to be televised. no.
Recorded but not televised.
okay.
So can we pick a what dates would work in FEBRUARY and MARCH?
MAY be try to go for later in
FEBRUARY so we give more notice
to the public and letter in MARCH? And then the second question is
other then and there pick the
dates, is -- I would request MAY
be as part of the committee we
created that we you00 autoboard
authorizes us a creation of --
flyer or something to put out in the public.
saying we are having a
community meeting regarding the recruitment of inspector general. This is the date and the time
you are all welcomed not issues of speak but the community meeting to are heard where we could be there present. I like to include that we
pick tw locations if we talk one
in the southeast corridor and
MAY be one on the west side of
town or central part so that it is more convenient for the
public to convene.
And public transportation.
I guess first figuring out
when works with our schedules or
the other option can be is if we
city attorney can we make this lodgist cal decision online in
terms of looking at cal defers and figure out what day works
for us for a meeting or do we need to do that now.
As we are on the record.
2 things first what you are agenda item is future agenda
upon items you are talking about
what would be on future agenda items.
So -- coming up with a one of
the things00 automatics so you
can will have propose having --
a discussion about community
meetings in the future.
The second question you can have
usually works best if you are working with the secretary.
Your secretary but you can
have -- back and forth about
scheduling without triggering
the meeting requirement.
So those are 2 separate things. 83.
so you don't need right now
you would not need to decide as a body now to then later
schedule a meeting out in the community.
have to make sure it is
noticed you will require notice
you will meet somewhere other than the usual meeting place."
2023-01-06,"I PROPOSE GIVEN THE TIME WE WORK WITH THEM TO MAY BE WITHIN
THE NEXT WEEK TO IDENTIFY A LATER DATE IN FEBRUARY AND LATER
DATE IN MARCH AND DISCUSS THE LOCATION AND THE TIME THAT WOULD
WORK."
2023-01-06,"I GUESS IF IT MAKES SENSE

THE TIME THAT WE WORK WITH DAN TO PROPERLY, MAYBE WITH THE NEXT

THE WEEK AND WHAT TIME AND MAYBE , MR LEON, YOU COULD HAVE IT
LIKE ON DOODLE OR SOMETHING, AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY SOLIDIFIED THE
DATES. BUT IS THERE A PARTICULAR DAY THAT MAKES MORE SENSE? OR TO
AVOID REALLY TO AVOID, YEAH. ACTUALLY ON MARCH. I'M GOING ON
VACATION, SO OKAY, LET'S NOT DO THAT. NO, JUST NOT MEANING THE
VACATION. WHAT WEEK? ARE YOU? IF YOU DON'T IT'S GOING TO BE
MARCH. WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO DO AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT ONLINE. WE HAVE ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES. BUT
WEDNESDAY, SAID THE DAY OF THE POLICE COMMISSION MEETING AND
SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING THAT
MAY WANT TO COME TO THIS. UH ONE OF WE DO HAVE MONEY IN OUR
BUDGET. DO WE HAVE FUNDS WHERE WE COULD TAKE ADD AN ADMIN
COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER? ANNOUNCING THIS I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT
BECAUSE I THINK WE WANT TO TRY AND REACH AS BROAD AN AUDIENCE
AS POSSIBLE. AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA. I
KNOW WE HAVEN'T REALLY SORT IFIED THAT YET. UM I AM REALLY
INTERESTED IN PUBLICIZING THIS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. DO I DON'T
KNOW IF WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A SUBCOMMITTEE TO FIGURE OUT THE
LIKE HOW WE PUBLICIZE THAT, LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, DO WE NEED
TO DECIDE NOW? UM. LIKE WHAT CAN GO ON THAT SOCIAL MEDIA POST OR
CAN I CREATE IT ON MY OWN AND THEN GET THE BOARD'S APPROVAL. I
THINK DAN WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO PUT THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT
THE MEETING LOCATION, AND THEN THEY JUST MEDIA SHOULDN'T BE AN
ISSUE SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE. OKAY I ALSO NOTICED ON ALL THOSE
SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES AND ON OUR WEBSITE. IT SAYS THAT WE
INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, WHICH
IS AN ACCURATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE. SO
THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT MEMBERS OF THE
PUBLIC. THANK YOU. MAKING COMMENTS, COMPLAINTS. THEY NEED
TO KNOW THAT CURRENTLY THEY NEED TO GO TO D P A WITH COMPLAINTS.
AND THEN IF I CAN FOR FUTURE AGENDA ITEM CAN I MAKE SURE THAT
AT THE NEXT MEETING WE HAVE THE RULES OF ORDER UP FOR ADOPTION.
WITH THE CHANGES TO 1.7, ADDING , UH, THE INFORMATION ABOUT A D
A SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT GETS VOTED ON. GREAT. AND THEN IF IT
HELPS, I WILL ACTUALLY USE A DIFFERENT COLOR. AND THEN IF MR
LING YOU WANTED TO DISSEMINATE THE OTHER PART, AND THEN THAT
WAY WHEN WE HAVE THE HARD COPY AT THE NEXT MEETING, IT'S EASIER
FOR PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THINGS AND VOTE ON. SO I GUESS I'LL
MAKE A MOTION THAT WE AGREE TO EXCUSE ME. IT'S NOT A AGENDAS IS
AN ACTION ITEMS MORE LIKE, THANK YOU FOR ALL PROPOSING AGENDA
ITEMS, AND THEN WHAT? HOW IT USUALLY WORKS IS THE SECRETARY.
TYPICALLY WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT, THEN WORKS TO SEE
AVAILABILITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND DOES THE SCHEDULING.
THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT GOES. SO I'M HOPING THAT, UM WE GET
THROUGH THE THOSE ALL THOSE OTHER IDENTITY AGENDA ITEMS THAT
WERE CONTINUED, INCLUDING BUSINESS CARDS, AND NOW THAT
WE'RE KIND OF PAST THE HOLIDAYS, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET ALL OF
OUR RULES OF ORDER AND EVERYTHING DONE AS I MENTIONED
AT THE LAST MEETING BECAUSE, UM , THE HEAD OF JAIL HEALTH WITH
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UM, IS OUT. AND THERE WERE SOME
IRREGULARITIES. I ACTUALLY WANT TO JUST GET AN UPDATE, AND
THAT'S A FUTURE. AGENDA ITEM ON, UM IN JAIL HEALTH. AND THEN, UM
, HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE A GREATER RESURGENCE OF COVID WITH
YET ANOTHER VARIANT, AND THIS IS LIKE THE WINTER SEASON, SO, UM,
BUT IT'S CONCERNING THAT THE PERSON WHO WAS HEADING JAIL
HEALTH UM HAD THE IRREGULARITIES AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY WATCHING OUT. FAILED HEALTH. AND MISS
CLARK A QUESTION DO WE HAVE TO APPROVE IN PUBLIC THE DESIGN OF
THE BUSINESS CARDS SINCE THAT'S SO MINOR? UM SO WHAT IS YOUR
QUESTION? DO WE HAVE THE DESIGN OF THE BUSINESS CARDS? DOES THAT
HAVE TO BE APPROVED AT A MEETING? GIVEN THAT IT IS SO
MINOR? I MEAN IT. ANY ACTION THE BOARD TAKES HAS TO BE APPROVED
AT A PUBLIC MEETING, OKAY? AND I GUESS I WANT TO ASKED. DO WE
NEED TO HAVE THE SAME DESIGN FOR EVERYBODY? UM, I KNOW FOR MY
GOVERNMENT TODAY WORK FOR THERE'S DIFFERENT DESIGNS AND
PEOPLE CHOOSE THE DESIGN OF THAT THEY PREFER, BUT I KNOW THAT WE
HAD GONE THROUGH PRIOR ITERATIONS ONLINE OF PREFERRED
LOGOS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I AM JUST CONTENT. I'M JUST GONNA SAY
FOR THE RECORD. I LIKE YOU CAN TELL. I LIKE SIMPLE CLEAN AND I
PREFER OUR CITY LOGO AS CLASSIC BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE TO CITE. UM
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. BUT SO WHAT
? I'M HEARING THOSE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT BUSINESS
CARDS. I'LL TRY TO LOOK INTO THAT WORKING WITH YOUR SECRETARY

item on the agenda, please?"
2022-12-02,"calling line item 4. Presentation by
department of human resources dhr.
Discussion and
possible action. Further discussion on the recruitment of inspector general and possible action item to select a recruitment firm. Questions regarding the office of the inspector general
:  , including the change from 8177 attorney position to an 8181 assistant chief attorney
position. There shawn
:   Is joining us remotely."
2022-12-02,"thank you dan. Would the board like me to introduce myself? Maybeileler I'll start there.
:   Assistant director of employment service with
department of human resources. My colleague kate howard
joined last meeting on
NOVEMBER 4 I believe and shared the one proposal that the board received for the executive search firm.
That was from bob murray and associates. There was a couple members that were out
last meeting and so dan worked with kate
and I to make sure we
would have representation here if there were questions
and then also happy to
answer questions. I understand from dan there were questions around the positions at the sheriff department oversight
board in particular the 8181 position. So, happy to answer any questions or outline anything for the commissioners that were not present at
the last meeting."
2022-12-02,do any of the members have questions?
2022-12-02,"I do. I think-number 1, we haven't agreed as a board whether or not we were going to use a search firm so concerned about the
budget as it pertains to the search firm and also given there is one search firm and PRESIDENT Wechter you unilaterally reached out to that particular search firm, so I'm now more concerned
that it looks like the
process is not a fair
process and it is just an appearance so not
saying there is direct conflict but there was
:   I'm not sure I want to go down the route of a national search firm one. Number two, given there is only one search firm you reached out to earlier
before it was a formal process, I am
concerned about that."
2022-12-02,"could you describe
the process by which dhr solicited
proposals from search firms?"
2022-12-02,"certainly. We actually couple years ago went out and are
did a full rfp for executive search firms. We have a number of them that are now approved city vendors, so when a department such as
yours has a need for an executive search,
we can reach out to
that group of approved vendors. In this case we received one proposal and that was
from bob murray.
:   Concern about why we only received one, I'm doing four other-working with four other boards and commissioners now for
executive works, public works, environment, potentially department of elections which sure you all have seen recently and the department of ethics commission. Several of those departments
also only received one proposal. A lot has
to do tremendous amount of comp titian in the space now. There is a lot of entities not just san francisco with the 5 I just spoke to including this board, but also a number throughout the bay
area and state. I am grateful when we get
one proposal and I had a similar conversation with a commission PRESIDENT Earlier this week and they also shared-I would have
thought we would have received more proposal and shared the same sentiment I'm sharing
with this board, there
is tremendous amount
of competition. The good news is bob
murray is a firm I worked with before. They are quite reputable and I do stand by the work they performed. To answer the otherer part of the question, which
is, why the board MAY
opt to engage a executive search firm, a lot has to do with there is not staff infrastructure right now to really support all the efforts that
need to happen to do a nation wide search. We would need regular engagement not just with this board, but
with any stakeholder groups, constituent groups you feel is necessary and that is a really important piece and a extremely important piece for a
new board standing up there that there be intention and engagement you get from a executive search firm. Those
are a couple things I hope address some of the concerns and happy to answer or address
any other concerns."
2022-12-02,"any other members
have questions?"
2022-12-02,"yes. My
understanding of this
particular kind of profession specifically oversight boards, inspector general, that there is
a pretty tight nit group because it is
the profession is a boutique profession let's say, and that individuals kind of know who all the
individuals are that
would potentially have access to the requirements and the training necessary to
be an inspector
general. Would-simply posting this sufficiently give notice to those individuals? For example, we are lucky enough to have the PRESIDENT Of the national organization of oversight-"
2022-12-02,"I'm not the president. You
elevated me."
2022-12-02,"thank you-but you are a board member, right?"
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"so this information could be distributed
widely to the people that would have the expertise we need. I
bring this up because
I am concerned with spending $60 thousand in a national firm if we just would already
be able to access the
exact same pool giving
the connections within
that specific industry. You know, that might be
something that I would
like clarification. If any commissioner
knows or also you
yourself MR. Shepherd."
2022-12-02,"should I jump in? I can't see the room. If there is any other
comments from fellow board members."
2022-12-02,if you want to respond MR. Shepherd then I can respond.
2022-12-02,"I can take the
bigger piece of it.
So, what we
:   That we
would post the job and pray people apply for
it and I feel at a level with department head and executive search is necessary to
make sure that we are as a city you as a
board are reaching out
and engaging as many of the folks in this realm that would
qualify. I don't have a rolidex of those names. You all MAY and that MAY be a response you get from fellow members here on that front. I can
tell you that when the
department of police accountability was put up, this was not a discussion when it
went from office of citizen complaints to becoming their own department. They have somebody in mind
already and they appointed that person,
so this is a new task
for all of us. I'm not aware of the commission having
necessarily somebody in mind, so you are
always going to hear
from your hr teams and eventually the department will have a
hr team as well. You will hear we will encourage robust engagement and
outreach, not just to
solicit candidates but talking individually to each of you as
board members to yoif the ideal candidate, profile, how and where to recruit, potentially other stakeholders, any constituents groups, the public. Normally we have engagement
with employees within the department, but we are not there right now. Those are the other considerations that I would put forth
for there board to consider."
2022-12-02,"so, I think-"
2022-12-02,can we just-to be organized could all the members ask to be recognized to speak?
2022-12-02,"yes, I like to be recognized."
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"I had raised this at a prior meeting and
did attend the national association
of oversight of law enforcement, and one member from the madison inspector general office mentioned to me that
they went with a recruitment national recruitment firm ended with fewer then a dozen candidates and when the city madison hr went through they were left with just 5 candidates so I don't know that expending that kind of money to get 5 candidates if we
could get 5 candidates
would be justified. I
think I would be more comfortable if I had a better handle if we
were to get things in a larger universe and
across the bay we have
a inspector general, michelle phillips the inspector general for the police commission and she-that was a new position so think she
has a lot of insight. The difference is she brings forths a law enforcement background which in the charter limits the number of candidates because our
candidates cant have law enforcement and
think that is a unfortunate limitation."
2022-12-02,"any other questions
from members? To address your point, heads of oversight agencies come from a wide variety of backgrounds so there is no one organization that you can contact. Some have come from
the U.S. Department of justice. I think one has come from academia. So, there really isn't just one
place where this can be advertised. New people are coming into the field all the
time. DR. Roseenthol
in his presentation last month mentioned
the head of the newly established washington state oversight will vej all officer
involved shootings and
in custody deaths. DR. Roseenthol contacted himself so
there are a lot of varied areas for which potential applicants can be drawn. I do
know that the oakland is recruiting for a new executive director for their community police review agency which is more similar to what our inspector general will be doing and they have over 20
applicants, so I think we would be able to
get a fair number of
applicants. Any other questions?"
2022-12-02,follow up question.
2022-12-02,are yes.
2022-12-02,"if we already have-I guess it seems
to me like your statements seem to
support the idea that
we are connected to the people that would have access to these
applicants such as DR. Rosenthol and network of people and are it doesn't seem based on the representation that there is already 20 applicants for this other job that it is not a situation where
we will likely find a
dirth of applicants if
we as MR. Shepherd indicated post and pray. If that were the case though, if
the scope was to insure that they would
be posting to the judge's association to the U.S. General, to
the california generals, to the basic
indeed and all the different general work employment kinds of
postings to the national organization,
those are just 6,
right? Do you think that a national search would yield more
results then those?"
2022-12-02,"I do, yes."
2022-12-02,why?
2022-12-02,"because a professional search firm is more familiar
with the places to publicize this because they would have done
similar recruitments for other-similar positions. So, they are familiar with the
sources for the areas
to advertise, whereas dhr is starting from
scratch without that
knowledge, and --"
2022-12-02,"I guess my perspective-it is starting from scratch
if we know as we as a board member already
know and your amazing expertise-?"
2022-12-02,"I would not pretend
to know all the places where we could advertise the position for inspector general because I have-my understanding in the
field but it is not as expansive and sure the professional search
firm MAY be aware of other areas where a position like this would be advertised.
I'm familiar with
positions on the naco website but the outside search firm is not here tonight to provide us with
information where they would advertise it. But, at this point we
are trying to deal with questions to MR. Shepherd so other questions?"
2022-12-02,"I do have a
question. What is the
cost for dhr to do a search versus what we
know the national searches $60 thousand,
but what is the cost associated with putting a posting out
for this position on
dhr level?"
2022-12-02,"I had my hand raised because I was going to add that
piece. It is really
two components to that. I would need to
go back to my team for
a rough estimate. It
would probably be
maybe half to 2/3 the
cost for staff time. The difference and the PRESIDENT Spoke to
this a second ago, we really building things from scratch in a lot
of respects. The job announcement, the coordinating the meetings, all of the things that would be necessary to get this going and then conducting all of the
work that would be necessary around interviews, bringing people in and supporting those
efforts and engagement with candidates.
There is a cost that
dhr would work with the department. Normally we would get help from the hr team at a department. That is not yet stood up for this department,
so I can speak to a recruitment that I helped with prior to
the pandemic with the planning commission.
That was probably about
40 to $50 thousand. Some was because of the time and effort that was needed not
only to engage the commission, but also two commissions, the planning commission and the historic preservation commission and there
was a hand-off to the mayor's office. The cost that is not
necessarily associated
with that is it took us a lot longer because we don't have the built in resources of a executive search firm to coordinate all
of these efforts and we rely tremendously on the planning commission and historic preservation commission. They have to do a tremendous
amount of work as a
committee. They appointed a committee so that group was doing things like recruitment and contacting people and helping set up
interviews and helping do a lot of the work in partnership with
dhr. So, those are
important considerations. Yes, there is a cost that would be work ordered
with dhr and the trade-off being they are very likely
wouldn't be the same level and scope you get from a executive sunch firm. You highlighted one issue
which is we don't have a rolidex of names and
resources to find the names."
2022-12-02,thank you.
2022-12-02,"so, on the second
part of the agenda item, the original
budget for the office
of inspector general
included an 8177 attorney civil/criminal. My understanding that has
been changed to a 8181 assistant chief attorney position which has a salary of about $260 thousand
and the attorney civil criminal is significantly lower. Can you give us information how that change came about?"
2022-12-02,"I have a little background from talking to the hr person who supports the department of police accountability.
Because there is no staff you need to appoint the director and appoint staff. There were things tied
into the budget, tied
into standing up the department including standing up the commission, making sure there was positions and appointments, so because there were no authority, because
there is no oig, no
inspector general to
do this work, dhr, the mayor's office,
department of police accountability looked
at this and decided we need somebody at the department. We were asking the department of police accountability to take ownership for a number
of things that they necessarily couldn't
do. The position is
:   Because the person selected within that position at the district attorney's office so they wanted to keep
them whole. It is at
will as needed appointment, so when the department does select a director, that inspector general will have the ability to make the staffing decisions they need to make and like I said as well, that position is actually at the
department of police accountability. The position was purely to keep the individual
that came from the district attorney office whole."
2022-12-02,"my understanding is
that individual is marshal kind? Y I believe that is correct, yes."
2022-12-02,"am I correct this position is paid for from the office of
inspector general budget?"
2022-12-02,I pleev believe that is true. I believe it is work-ordered and not paid for by the police accountability department.
2022-12-02,"okay. Was the change other then
upgrading it so that MR. Kind could move from the same
classification he had at the district attorney's office, was there any stated need for this position
itself to be an assistants chief attorney position?"
2022-12-02,"I believe that was the only reason I'm
aware of."
2022-12-02,"okay. Any board
members have questions about this element of
the agenda item?"
2022-12-02,"yes. So, this position you indicated
is being paid by the budget, correct?"
2022-12-02,"uh-huh. Out of department of police accountability and
then the sheriff department oversight board oig is paying for the work order."
2022-12-02,"okay. And all the
work that is being performed underneath
this position is only
for the work of the ig, correct or the
office of the ig?"
2022-12-02,"that is my understanding. Definitive answer
needs to come from a individual or the
department of police accountability."
2022-12-02,"in other words,
what I would like to confirm is that the
funds that are being
taken from this budget, allocated budget are used solely for the work of this
particular body and agency? And you're indicating we should ask somebody else at
this time?"
2022-12-02,"I think -- I wouldn't be in a position to answer that question.
I think because the individual is an employee of the
department of police accountability I think
we would need to ask them. I'm happy to work with your
secretary with dan to determine whether the
department of police
accountability can
provide a written statement, probably dan-I suggest we ask somebody from that
department attend a
upcoming meeting. My understanding is yes, that work is solely to the benefit of the
sheriff department oversight board."
2022-12-02,"we do have somebody from dpa here. Thank you so much. Greatly appreciate all the
work you and hr. It seems you have a lot on your plate now in taking and really looking at these
issues and also coming twice to this board so that we make sure there is full transparency and all board members have opportunities to ask questions as well as the public so thank you so much for your time."
2022-12-02,thank you. My pleasure.
2022-12-02,"we have any other questions from any
board members on this agenda item? Okay. I
think now we can take
public comment."
2022-12-02,"members of the
public who would like to comment line up at
the podium otherwise call 415-655-0001 and
enter access code 24974407820, press 3 to raise your hand to
be added to the queue.
It appears we have no
public comment. Shall
I call line item 5?"
2022-12-02,"no. This listed
also as a possible
action item."
2022-12-02,motion for an action item.
2022-12-02,"yes, I would make a motion that we contract with the outside recruitment firm to conduct the recruitment for the inspector general of
the office of inspector general."
2022-12-02,is there a second?
2022-12-02,"PRESIDENT Wechter can you please repeat the action item again
or what you are proposing?"
2022-12-02,"yes, I'm proposing
we ask dhr to contract with the outside recruitment firm to conduct the recruitment for the inspector general position of the office of inspector general and I received a text from someone saying their hand is raised
and they want to make
public comment."
2022-12-02,okay.
2022-12-02,"good evening call
er, you have two
minutes. Caller, you are still muted. If
you can unmute
yourself."
2022-12-02,hello? Can you hear me?
2022-12-02,you have two minutes. Yes.
2022-12-02,"thank you. Good evening members of the sheriff department oversight board. My name is barbara atard. I have been involved in civilian oversight of law enforcement for all most 40 years. I worked for the sheriff
department and county parole many years ago.
I was one of the original staff of office of citizen department now department of police accountability and
worked there 15 years.
Also worked as the executive to berkeley police commission and inspector general for
the city of san jose. These two items before you through the
department of human
resources are really important items. I
urge you to go with
the recruiter to hire the inspector general. In my experience
recruiters will bring
in candidates beyond what advertising will bring in. As a former resident I know the importance of advertising through that organization, but advertising should not
be the extent of the search. As PRESIDENT Wechter mentioned,
there are several professions that can
:   Such as inspector general. Hiring for this position is one of the most important decisions you will be making. You want to have experts bring in top candidates for your review. Also important for public image of the oversight board that you are doing the maximum to
hire a top notch inspector general."
2022-12-02,"thank you, 30 seconds."
2022-12-02,"I also have concerns that a attorney was hired for the oversight board who is paying at a higher level who is
paid at a higher level then budgeted for the
ig, and I think you should look carefully at that. Thank you very much."
2022-12-02,"thank you caller. We have one more caller on the line. Good evening caller,
you have two minutes."
2022-12-02,"hi. My name is
john alden. I was
calling to comment. Can you hear me? I was calling to echo comments barbara atard just made. I would
add another factor I think important here. I have had opportunities to be an apicate for positions like the one you are
describing and also to be on the hiring end for the position you are looking to fill here and in both of those two experiences or sets of experiences I had opportunity to deal with both
recruiters and try to
:   For commissions like yours
having a recruiter is far superior and much easier for you to process through those applicants. Recruiters are really good finding applicants that may not have heard about the opening and persuading them to apply which is essential. I have met
a number of people in the field who say they wont apply if there are not recruiters
involved because it signals the agency isn't serious about the search and not serious about oversight and don't
think you want to signal that to candidates out there. I will say it is a lot of work to include the public in these kinds of recruitments and you will want help on board for that given you don't have staff
in dhr has pretty clearly indicated they
:   The additional cost that I'm hearing MAY be 20
to $30 thousand from my perspective is
totally worth it to have quality candidates and think you will get them faster then dhr so strongly recommend you
go with recruiter. It is my experience when you don't have a recruiter you might get applicants but often times they are poorly qualified or not qualified. In the example we were talking about earlier, no one knows who the 20 applicants are and whether they are particularly good. In my experience-"
2022-12-02,"thank you caller.
Your time is up."
2022-12-02,"MAY we ask questions of the commenters? The
public commenters?"
2022-12-02,MS. Clark.
2022-12-02,"you can. I guess
so, yeah."
2022-12-02,"MR. Alden do you
plan on applying for
this position? No, okay. I just want to make sure that we know for the record that whether it is a non
response or there is a tech issue."
2022-12-02,"are you still on
the line? It does not appear MR. Alden is still on the line."
2022-12-02,hello?
2022-12-02,hello. MR. Alden?
2022-12-02,"I had a question, yes."
2022-12-02,"yes, MR. Alden."
2022-12-02,"I was curious why
we are as a taxpayer in san francisco looking to respond thousands of dollars in tax money to have a private search instead of posting this
through dhr? How many meetings will happen
before the hiring an ig?"
2022-12-02,"I'm sorry, is this MR. Alden because I think that isn't
answering the question?"
2022-12-02,"this is a new caller, yes."
2022-12-02,"can you identify yourself, please?"
2022-12-02,"my name is
:   San francisco taxpayer and residents and was watch ing the meeting online."
2022-12-02,thank you. Go ahead.
2022-12-02,"I was wondering how many meetings we are going to have and why we are spending money
to post on a private search. How many meetings have to take place about hiring for a ig? How soon is this supposed to happen? Are we
getting one by 2028?
This is like trying to
sell a monorail.
Curious why this isn't
done through dhr."
2022-12-02,thank you.
2022-12-02,thank you caller. It does not appear MR. Alden is still on the line.
2022-12-02,you say it does not appear?
2022-12-02,it does not appear he is still on the line.
2022-12-02,"can tell from my own knowledge MR. Alden has taken a position as the head
of the sonoma county independent office of law enforcement and outreach, so I strongly doubt he
would apply for this position."
2022-12-02,but you have no knowledge of any interest from MR. Alden?
2022-12-02,that is correct.
2022-12-02,okay.
2022-12-02,"is there any other
public comment? So, I agree with MR. Alden's comments. I can say from my many years of experience in the oversight field that the recognized best practice is to do a
nation wide search. It appears that dhr is not prepared to do that type of search in a timely manner. This is a new position for a new department so they not have dealt with before and I think we can achieve
our goal of hiring a
competent and fair inspector general by going with a outside search firm that knows
the territory, that
knows how to contact candidates, solicit candidates and get the best possible candidates and at the previous meeting they said they expect they can complete the
entire process in 16 weeks and dhr said it will take longer and
sounds dhr is quite overwhelmed filling many other vacant city positions so this is the path city berkeley went down when they filled head of their new department of accountability. It is the process sonoma
county went through. Bay area rapid transit
used a outside search firm when they brought
in their independent police auditor, so I think we should follow
the leads of those entities and move
forward and contract with the sole bidder
on this process."
2022-12-02,"PRESIDENT Wechter the appears there is still one more
comment."
2022-12-02,okay.
2022-12-02,"good evening
caller. You have two
minutes."
2022-12-02,"hi. This is john alden. I left the meeting and heard you wanted me back, is that right?"
2022-12-02,"this is
commissioner carrion. I had a question whether you intend to apply to the ig position in san francisco?"
2022-12-02,"I wouldn't, but I
also say for a lot of people like myself who consider applying whether you have
recruiter is a significant factor figuring out whether the recruitment
process is a job
:   If you like I can tell why that it is or what it
is like to be a
applicant but from applicant perspective
it is far more persuasive and
compelling to have a recruiter talking to you about what the intention entails and
what it is like and practical details opposed to applying to
a solicitation online cold when someone doesn't have a sense what is going on and does tend to signal the agency isn't serious about recruitment,er which I don't think is what you want to signal.
Happy to answer
:"
2022-12-02,"to make sure I understood that at
this time you do not intened to apply?"
2022-12-02,"no, I'm not intending to apply."
2022-12-02,thank you.
2022-12-02,"is there any other
public comment to add?"
2022-12-02,no.
2022-12-02,"okay. I believe I
made a motion. Do
we-would you take up where you left off? You were asking if there is a second?"
2022-12-02,is there a second on PRESIDENT Wechter's motion?
2022-12-02,second that motion. Afuhaamang speaking.
2022-12-02,thank you.
2022-12-02,"is there any other member want to discuss
the matter before a
vote? Would you call-"
2022-12-02,"sorry, I just
wanted to add for context. The reasons stated. The difference between the outside agency and the dhr doing it, it is not that much far different in terms of cost and then the outside agency would
be able to do it. I
think in the last presentation bob murray and associates was the vendor they
were looking at and their experience
working with bart,
city fresno, sonoma county, sacramento,
and even orange county with similar positions makes me confident that they know what they are doing and in
terms of hiring a recruitment agency, it
has a cost to it, but I think just making sure we are accessing the best candidates
and also just helps us
save time and money in terms of checking the
backgrounds and making sure that they are vetting them and interviewing them, it just makes it much easier for us and I
don't think the cost-I think the benefit of hiring the right
person will far outweigh the cost of doing it right the
first time. That is
my spiel."
2022-12-02,"dan, can you call
the vote, please?"
2022-12-02,"yes. We'll take
the vote for line item 4. Recruitment-I mean
the hearing of the
recruitment firm. member afuhaamang."
2022-12-02,aye.
2022-12-02,"member afuhaamang
is aye. Vice PRESIDENT Carrion."
2022-12-02,abstain.
2022-12-02,vice carrion abstain.
2022-12-02,"you have to vote, sorry. You can't abstain. Unless you
have a conflict of interest."
2022-12-02,"no, I currently do
not have a conflict of interest. I actually
would like to a little
more information about other oversight
commissions that have just posted because we
are hearing from my perspective we are
hearing from people
who used this-a national executive search firm but haven't heard from people who have not
used it. It seems to me has there-given the funds and the lack of budget and the very small budget we have
to do an immense amount of work I'm very critical of using that budget in a way that will result in
the same people being selected that potentially MAY be selective. Given what
I learned from the industry and given the fact the bord made it very clear that we
will be asking for community input and asking the community the voters the people
who have put this to
our charge of what
they want in a ig."
2022-12-02,"circumstances under which you cannot vote.
One is you have a
conflict and two is if
the body excuse you from voting. Besides that you have to vote yes or no."
2022-12-02,"I do not have a conflict at this time
for the reason stated, no."
2022-12-02,thank you. Vice PRESIDENT Carrion is no. MR. Nguyen.
2022-12-02,no.
2022-12-02,nguyen is no. MR. Soo.
2022-12-02,no.
2022-12-02,member soo is no. PRESIDENT Wechter.
2022-12-02,"yes. PRESIDENT
Wecktser wechter is yes. The motion does not pass."
2022-12-02,am I correct we need 4 votes to pass?
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,okay.
2022-12-02,shall we move to line item 5?
2022-12-02,"could we take a 5 minute break before we
move to that because I know that MAY be a
more lengthy presentation? Anyone have objection?"
2022-12-02,"no, so long I believe as long as
thet mayor matter is closed and will not be reopened after the
break. This item is closed?"
2022-12-02,"unless MR. Palmer
were to arrive."
2022-12-02,I see. If that's the purpose of the break-
2022-12-02,"no, the purpose is a bio break."
2022-12-02,okay. I have no issue with that.
2022-12-02,"okay. Thank you. We will take a 5
minute break. It is
509 P.M.

[Unable to hear

2022-12-02,"department of police accountability performing the
department for the
fiscal year 2022-2023. 8181 assistant chief attorney from SEPTEMBER 15, 2022
through SEPTEMBER 14,
2023 with a budget of
362 some odd dollars including $359 thousand salary and benefits. So, that is
one reason why I asked dph to make a presentation tonight. And asked director henderson to make the presentation, sorry he is not here because I think he would be in a position to answer some of the questions
that are most significant. If you can go ahead, we appreciate it."
2022-12-02,"my name is nicole armstrong-I am helping out as a clerk tonight
but I'm the chief operating officer/cfo/tech person at the dpa
office and so I'm here
to explain what dpa
role is and the background behind the process and what you
find is chicken before the egg which came first and the steps we
had to do. Let me start by saying thank you for having me. I appreciate it. I appreciate you got to see a lot of work I put into doing this program and the different processes we suggested. I'm excited to talk to you today and answer any
questions you have. I'll keep it short because there is a lot of questions and want to give you the nitty-gritty, the details to give a overhead and you can ask the fine details as we go. I want to talk about the operational staffing
minimum budget requirements. This document was created during the budget process during the
last budget cycle and really and all honesty I looked at the budget process what was being suggested for the sheriff department of accountability and I looked at and was like
you are missing all of
operations. You do
not have accountant or budget staff, tech person, you don't have money for case management, you don't have money for additional funding, things you need to
stand up the office. After seeing that I made suggestions. We wrote the document and said there is a way we can do this to save the city money and this is just a suggestion that came out where we said dpa is already doing the work and that is the most important
critical elements is dpa wants to make sure the investigations are completed. We do not
want to break the 3304 errors and also want to make sure the process continues and there is no delay. We want this investigation to keep going. So, we came with this phase plan that basically
suggested you need operations staff. Here it is and this is
the things missing.
That is the executive phase. Discoverry.
The idea you could use what dpa already built our operation staff to find the best inspector general. To find all these things while using our resources to be able to develop your own to
hire all your staff. Hire everything. That way you can do things. We made that suggestion. I think it was FEBRUARY last year sent it out and said you need to put these things in the budget even if you don't include us in it. You need to include operations and that was the key to all this. Operations. I know because I run our operations in my
office and without my accounting and budget and tech staff, you
can't run department because who does the expenses and work orders and all the
stuff nobody wants to do? So, come along
here comes the board and commission. Time goes past and we needed to get you all appointed. We got notification that the appointment needed to be done, the board needed training and we
needed steps moving forward so you can sit in your seats today so we were told a clerk
needs to be brought
in. Microphone lower? We needed a clerk to be brought in. Dan was brought in to be able to access budget
we need to pay the stipend for the commissioners and make sure you get your training by the sheriff department which cost $40 thousand. We needed to make sure all these things were met before
you were officially appointed so you are in the seats you are in today. Dan was hired, got the e-mail and stipends and mandatory-some are still waiting for e-mail appointments and still working on it and we started doing that. Then what do we have do? Now
you have employee in the department. What does that employee need? A computer. They need access to e-mail. Access to
stipends and access to expenses and access to all these things but you have somebody not necessarily trained in the role to assist you. You will not have the person to do those things that no
one ever wants to do like looking at expense reports so we
came with a work order-the work order
is the same thing the controller office do,
dpw does, dt. Work orders allow other agencies to do work for you. They get paid for the work.
One of the work orders done for the sca is
make sure you have a
accountant through the controller office so if you have to purchase things or
when you hire for your dhr for the search things can be paid and that could be worked through the system. All these things need
to be worked in the background. We made sure all that stuff was done and been working through that so when you look at the work orders you will see my teams are on there to help you. That is the same with investigators. The eghaveers have been doing this work a long
time and we wanted to get compensation back for doing the work we have done. We were not able to so the mayor budget office said this is how you do this. Approval is made. We are doing the work and making
sure the work is dedicated and hourly-marked and the time is recorded for
all the efforts we
make. So, you have the clerk. Here comes the next problem. You have a clerk at a certain level and we can grant him access
to general areas in
the systems for approvals. However, because the clerk only has access and is not a manager level position they can't approve things on a higher level, so they
cant go and do budget
access budget systems or access different areas in the system and are they need somebody to approve different work so we worked on a 8181
because we need a manager position. Somebody needed to be hired as a manager in the department to do the higher level work
and originally it was
8177 but that is not a manager level position
so it needed to be upgraded to new level. It was approved by
the mayor budget office. Dhr. That position is dedicated to helping out
:   That is all they do. Marshal kind will speak after me but I want to give
you the overview. Dpa
really wants this department and commission to succeed
but at the same time, my team is 3 people and that's a lot of
work for 3 people to do dpa and sda so we want to give that stuff to sda because we dont want to do it for a long period of
time. It is a lot of work. Writing mou and doing those things
along those lines from my department take a
lot of review. Same with tech stuff or budget drafted, those things need to be done
with higher level of approval. Dhr approved that position but the problem is
they say we cant hire
without a oig. So they were brought under dpa only for that reason so we have
a work order to pay for the position to make approvals where
we can't do it. As I said before-"
2022-12-02,"dan, I can hear your clicking so
assume that on webex people will hear that
in the background.
Thank you. Jason, sorry."
2022-12-02,"so, because of the chicken and egg we are in this position where we had hired a clerk to be able to help you get out but now we
need manager level. This was this circle process we have gotten into now. The only goal is make sure things get approved,
things go forward and moved. Nothing was
set up in a way the oig won't be able to hire or remove anybody from a position. The only goal is make sure the work gets done and make sure dan is supported and that these things can move forward for you as well. That's pretty much the bottom line what we are trying to
do with these. Check my notes. So, trust me I rather have the
position for the 8181
under sda because having with dpa
creates issues but
:   Now you have a dedicated member to work on the issues and hopefully looking at the budget in the future because you have to remember
the budget is coming out-the budget process starts soon. Right? One of the funny things about the budget and sure many work in budget in cities before, if you don't use funds the city tends to take the funds away. Some of
the good things having work orders with different cities agency it shows the funds are being used and showing processes and are some of the larger projects where you use the funding this year means you can carry over the funds for next year if you start the projects now. The budget is the key for a lot of these things. You need to make sure you set the funds and make sure you have a person in the position to do
it. One of the positions sda needs to
hire next is 1823 and
I will be advocating this. The reason is they need a budget person to start controlling and having access. Dpa does not have access to sda budget or anything along those lines so one thing we are trying to work with is get a 1823 hired to do the budget for you because you need to start itemizing. When you look the way the budget is designed and laid out the material and supplies are low. You don't have a vehicle and all these things you need to be
able to operate your department, especially once you hire the ig.
You don't want to start the ig without funds so we want to
make sure that is in place now. The 1823
is the next thing sda does to move forward
with the budget this FEBRUARY. That is coming up around the corner. Once that is close d out that is the funding for the next year. Same with
spending. The work
orders dt has or accounting they establish a baseline that allow you to identify how much money you need in the future and need to increase including the training cost you like
to have to travel to places. All that needs to be figured out and added now so the proposal could be
made in FEBRUARY. 1823. Sorry. I know. I am told I talk a lot and apparently not
in the mic so I apologize. Alright, so I will let-if you
want to ask me questions I'll let marshal kind talk unless you want to ask me questions about this process. I can answer anything related to this. I
don't want you to forget."
2022-12-02,"I do have questions and other board members MAY as well. Why didn't director henderson make the
ezprentation presentation?"
2022-12-02,"most of the information you are requesting I was part
of the mou written. I did that. Doing any of the additional things that was my processing. The other stuff really is my primarily field and my team is doing it so I'm here to talk how this happened and why
the process is."
2022-12-02,"the mou is received this week from mayor
office of the budget. One was signed SEPTEMBER 19 and the other JULY 26. Why wasn't the board notified of the existence of the mou signs by the secretary dan leung?"
2022-12-02,I don't know. I don't think we really have the processes in place to know we needed to send it to you. That is probably just it.
2022-12-02,"why wasn't this board asked for
approval of the mou
rather then having our temporary secretary sign them?"
2022-12-02,"all this stuff was through the sda funds and the instruction
what the mayor budget
office told us to do.
If it was supposed to go through you it is error and will follow up to find the correct procedure to go for mou or work order. It is work order, it isn't a mou. I will follow up on that and
get you a answer."
2022-12-02,one is a mou and one work order.
2022-12-02,mou is memorandum of understanding. Work order is coming to agreement with two agencies to doing work functions. It is only providing the funding for those items specifically.
2022-12-02,"okay. What I have
is a-labeled a mou for fiscal year 2022-23. Work order amount $620
thousand. Essentially to reimburse dpa for the work you are already doing? Correct?"
2022-12-02,"the work we are
doing now. All the mou are designed to do on a quarterly basis so we are doing the work we are doing now to recover the funds.
We did want to recover
the funds earlier. We were told we can't because there had to be a department in place to recover funds."
2022-12-02,right. Do you have those documents with you?
2022-12-02,what documents?
2022-12-02,the work order and the mou?
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"I do have a question about it.
So, on the work order, it lists hourly rates
and for example, for senior investigator
:
Hourly rate of $109.69
and I believe on a bill it lists his
hourly rate at $92.69 and want to know how those were arrived at
because according to transparent california
in 2021 he earned $80.81 an hour."
2022-12-02,"when we do these we try to include the fringe benefits and payment frz the next year. Transparent
california will only
show what was previous ly paid. You know fringe benefits and
years go you have
different amounts added. We use what we
are paying and added."
2022-12-02,those reflect the individual paid for salary and benefits?
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,nothing else?
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"okay. So, what-maybe MR. Kind
can answer this. What work is being done on behalf of the sda?"
2022-12-02,"I will let MR. Kind
talk about that after when we-he will talk about the whole thing. Three more slides. I just wanted to let you ask me questions so that I can pass it
over to him. And,"
2022-12-02,"you understand this
needed a manager level
position. Why is manager level needed?"
2022-12-02,"I'll give a low level example. Dan wants to take vacation or get something apruchbed you need twob people in the office to approve something. You have
one person receiving a document and one-dan sends it in, has nobody that approves expense for him. Say
he wants to go to naco
he has to submit to somebody. Now marshal kind is there we can send to him to approve it. Otherwise he doesn't get approval for things and has to go to somewhere else. The other person identified now is me and it needs to go to somebody in sda and
not somebody in dpa.
The whole thing being sda and dpa and him under there, I understand that but you needed somebody in
that position to
approve higher level anything. Dan is a
clerk. He's not an accountant or expense person. He is has amazing skills but he does not have the qualification to make management decisions for things like the budget or any
processing along those lines. You need somebody higher level."
2022-12-02,"why does it need to be someone who is 81 chief attorney since
we were told by dhr that is solely so MR. Kind can keep his same classification and rate of pay?"
2022-12-02,"from my understanding it was
because of management level."
2022-12-02,"could someone at a lower salary-say a
manager 1 or supervisor level?"
2022-12-02,"we have a 8177, it is easier to convert a
position to higher classification rather then creating a new position."
2022-12-02,you do have manager level 1 positions within dp a rks I believe?
2022-12-02,"no, it has to be through sda. Dpa8181
was brought in for this thing right now.
We don't have the 8181
for dpa. It was only brought in once we realized we couldn't have it as sda so they were brought to dpa. The position had to
exist in the sda position. When you look that positions sda has, you have a
1823, you have 8124,
8126, it has to be in one of the classifications and substitute it up so
they took the 8171 and
substituted up to 8181."
2022-12-02,why not leave as 8177?
2022-12-02,"it st. Not a management position. You needed somebody with the higher level experience which
marshal kind will be explaining as soon as
I can pass it to him."
2022-12-02,"I think I have a comment. I think we something with a overview and with all due respect PRESIDENT
Wechter, I feel like you're interrogating
the department of
police accountability when they have a mou with the sheriff department. They handle sheriff complaints as well
right now and until we have the infrastructure of a office we can't do a hand-off. I think director henderson made very clear that it was always his
intention to do a very warm hand-off and we don't have a it system. I think our priorities right now is to make sure the sheriff department has a it system to pull records because it doesn't matter if we have inspector general
if we can't pull data to generate reports and then I thought we agreed we were going
to have a timeline of talking about hiring
inspector general and also soliciting community input and discussed two meetings. I'm concerned you did public records request rather then bring something to the board. We are here to be transparent because we are here to serve the public and I would think that you would
want the entire board to know the questions you are asking rather
then doing public records request and director henderson was here to answer questions in the past.
:   I
feel there is a lot of extra interrogation
going on that cast a possible shadow all the great things they have been doing. I
think from the get go the charter amendment did not anticipate the
funding and was not
carefully crafted and perhaps supervisor walton might want to go back and look but I
see the problems with excluding inspector general and staff from having law enforcement background and also the budget was not anticipated and I actually spoke to one of the clerks. That is why it took so long for us to have our
first meeting or training is because one of the clerks was
the board of supervisor told supervisor walton he could not be or commission secretary because he had full obligation with committee of board of supervisors. I want to keep this at higher
level and make sure-I
am just thankful that dpa has been there and nicole you have the oversight and having been a past commissioner 12 years
I know the budget and everything, it takes staff to be on top of it and remind when there is going to be
hearings and right now with FEBRUARY around
the corner we have to really be cognisant of the budget items we put in to make sure we have enough. The mayor was involved. We might not have had the money because it want anticipated with the charter amendment and glad the mayor's office saw the need to supplement the budget
and have these work orders allowed. But,
in no way can we as a board interfere with
existing contract s
between the sheriff department and dp a. I wanted to state that for the record. I appreciate what you are doing. Thank you."
2022-12-02,no problem.
2022-12-02,"I think my question is predicated in large
part had this been a more transparent process this would not have been necessary. If director henderson our first meeting told us he was preparing the mou and had dan sign one and come to
us and brought these
to us. If I didn't have to get them from the mayor budget office. It felt dpa was not transparent about the existence of the mou's and money taken from the sda budget and the specific purpose outlined in the mou so why I'm asking a lot of questions because I discovered this and was rather surprised
that it had not been provided to the board previously."
2022-12-02,"I can tell you it is just oversight. I did know it needed to
go to you. If that is the procedure and process, I will make
sure I follow up and follow procedures I was given by the mayor budget office were fallowed to a t. The
instructions were done. More then happy
to help. As board member -- dpa's only goal here is to make sure the work gets done. I want to stress this. I love
my job at dpa. I was a investigator and senior investigator and ops manager. I love what we do and love what we do and how we can help with the sheriff cases. Our only goal is to make sure this work gets done. That is
it. We do not want to keep the work-once this whole agency is set up, we want to hand it off. It is a
lot of work for us. It is. We really do just want to do these
right things the way we can. We want you to succeed and that is the basic minimum of my entire presentation is we have done all this work and more you
don't know before the mou that happened just to make sure you can be in your seats
because we want you to succeed 110 percent.
You are all amazing people for volunteering to be on the first board willing to do this and forge the way. We want to help you.
That's the bottom line."
2022-12-02,"PRESIDENT Wechter I request to be
recognized to speak."
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"I think one thing
what I heard PRESIDENT Wechter is you have this idea dpa is required to present
things to us for approval and obviously as commissioner soo indicated we are not
in a position to compel or interfere with any contract between two private parties even if those
parties are dpa and the sheriff department. More importantly, I think we need to focus on what we are required
and tasked to do by the voters. By san
franciscans. That is
in section 4.137 of the charter
subdivision b lays out our powers and duties
and none of these they are 6 specific duties and responsibilities, none of them require an independent body or
agency to grant
approval of acts they are doing pursuant to approved and legal contract. I think
that we as a board must follow what the
voters wanted and not over-extend our jurisdiction in territory that first of all would be
illegal because it is impaurp interference with contract and we have no authority based on contract law, but also, that we
focus on the 6 tasks
at hand. Which are to appoint and remove inspector general and summarizing. Again,
that is section 4.137 subdivision b. To evaluate the work of the oig. To compile evaluate and recommend law enforcement
custodial and patrol
best practice. To conduct community
outreach and receive community input.
Prepare and submit quarterly reports which I think is something we need to speak about as well as
annual report and to monitor. In performance of our duties, we have
subsection e of the oi g powers and duties
and says what the oig needs to do and they
need to monitor sda operations. I think what is happening here, there seems to
be some kind of assumption we operate as other oversight
boards that MAY have more power. Our job is get this thing
running, get it done as ethically,
transparent to make sure all disclosures of any potential bias or any issues should be out there and in front for the public to speak. We should
be just as transparent as we require everyone else to be transparent and we move forward with doing this work.
I also have a request and don't know this is a possible action item even though I disagreed with it being a possible action item, and I expressed that multiple times as the vice PRESIDENT. I understand that
PRESIDENT Wechter you
indicated we would work collaboratively. Regretbly that didn't happen. There wasn't response of 4 request and finally request 4 minutes after the time I indicated I had a meeting. We were able to speak about that but it does concern me that there are independent acts with these public records requests. I would ask that if these are related to the board, that the board make
that decision of the information unless those are independent you have a independent
right to do public records, but to use your power as PRESIDENT And are present a potentially
as a board is-and bring it to the board where I wish I would
have had all those records you have review ed in advance to be able to understand the questions and to have the transparency of what is going on, but
you have created a silo and I'm not sure why that is. It doesn't make sense to me. But what I want to keep focusing on is what the powers and
duties is. Nothing in
this-I'm not sure what you gender identify as."
2022-12-02,she.
2022-12-02,"thank you. Nothing
in our powers and duties authorizes or requires the dpa come
to us. In fact it would behoove our
board to not micro manage. That is not
what we are here for. We are not here to
micro manage. We have certain skill sets, everyone brings something important to the table but the last thing we need to do is go outside what the voters said we should be doing and we need to prioritize what that is in in line with what is in the charter and I will ask that happening in our
agenda genda item that
we have an agenda item
10 which is future
agenda items and set hard deadlines for when this has to get done."
2022-12-02,"I like to address several things. First of all, I am not raising any issue what so ever about the dpa
contract with the sheriff department. I
am raising a issue
about the dpa mou with sheriff department of accountability and right now this board
is the sheriff
department of accountability. Dan leung signed on behalf
of this board. Dan leung is our employee. I wish we had been informed of that. I
think that any future mou or contracts should be brought to this board for approval rather then dan signing them and think that is probably consistent with how every board and
commission in the city would operate. The secretarys are not authorized to enter into contracts or
agreement on their
behalf. Regarding the records, I made my public records request because I didn't
realize what I could make request as informed me as a individual member of this board and are she can correct if I'm wrong. She said any member of the board
can make a request to a department for records and per the charter they are required to respond.
My most recent request at dpa has been made through that. I did public records request because I wasn't aware I had that authority
and didn't want to be getting any records that any other member of the public could have. As for the records you have been provided with them. Dan provided them in
the packet for last month's meeting and this month's meeting so none of the records I received have been kept from any of you.
They have been shared, so we can have this
discussion. As I
said, I had a concern because it took me
weeks to finally get
these mou's and I have been made aware of them. Had the board been made aware quite some time ago this wouldn't have been a issue. I think the board has a right to know what agreements are being entered into in its name because on
the murks ou it says
dan leung legal
assistant san
francisco shaffer sheriff department accountability. Ypt to make sure we have
all the information we should have
:   Where funds are going and how they are used and think we have a obligation to the taxpayers to insure they are used wisely and why I ask
questions about why
this position requires someone earning $360 thousand a year and whether those tasks could be done by
someone at a lower salary level."
2022-12-02,I do have a follow-up. What is the date of the mou? Were we in session?
2022-12-02,"yes, we were. The second mou involving
MR. Kind was signed by MR. Leung SEPTEMBER
18, 2022 and paul henderson SEPTEMBER
19. The work order was signed in JULY and as I say I have no problem with that work order. It is a standard work ordered.
I learned that one city department typically creates when another city department is doing work for them so think that is absolutely fine. It is for the work you have been
doing but the mou
involving MR. Kind is
something separate and it involves funding through the sda budget for a position."
2022-12-02,"I have a follow-up comment. I think thought is obvious is we are board members,
we are not authorizing body to approve contracts. That is
not our role. MR.
Leung obviously is a employee. They are very distinct legal obligations from board members versus employees and ability
to speak on behalf of organizations. I do
understand the record for transparency,
however, the tone is incredibly I think problematic. It seems
like there is a-as commissioner soo
mentioned, a cloud being cast on dpa for
doing what needed to
get done. I want this commission to succeed.
I want the oig office to succeed. I am grateful for the work that people have added
on top of their very incredibly busy schedules and that investigations have
not been stalled as a past prosecutor and
someone who has done investigations and prosecuted those
cases. I'm clearly incredibly aware of evidence getting stale and not able to prove a case because it has gotten stale or witnesses being unable or not willing to
participate as time
passes. So, it is imperative for this work, the actual work, the heart of why we are here for this to be done. I am
grateful for those things. I also want to comment that we are still not the department. We need to understand we are a oversight board. We
are not a department. We do not act in the stead of the department. We act within what the
charter says and if that's a issue and
needs to be amended
then I recommend you
lobby to the different-lobby to the supervisors to revise the charter and put it
again to the vote of the people. I think it is important for us to ask these questions. I believe
that we have gotten incredibly strong reasons as to why
there was a increase
of the change of the
position to 8181. It is very clear a managerial position was needed. I also believe people should
be paid for the work they do. If the work is being done and there is no indication
because I heard no evidence that the dpa
in any shape or form
has any misconduct, inappropriately used funds, that the investigations are not accurate or complete. There is no evidence
at all to me that indicates that dpa has
not done what they are contracted to do, so
I'm not sure why there is an attack. It seems there is a lot of personal attacks to MR. Henderson. His name keeps coming up all the time in these
meetings, which I just don't understand why that's the case.
Unless there is a
particular issue of misconduct or incompetence or anything that does-I want to hear that. I want to hear that
because right now casting shadows is not
helping. It is not moving forward. The 6
things that we are
charged to do. So, I
am thankful for the presentations. I am thankful for questions being asked, but I do not believe that in the process of collaboration and working with this agency that has more experience doing these things that has been doing the core work that is essence of what we are trying to do with the sheriff's that we treat them this way. I see no
reason for that and I
would appreciate that maybe PRESIDENT Wechter you rethink your tone."
2022-12-02,"I like to request appoint of order. We
are getting off track
here. Let MR. Kind speak."
2022-12-02,"pass it off to
marshal kind. Thank
you guys."
2022-12-02,"good evening board
members. My name is
marshal kind. I never envision attracting this attention starting the role. I wasn't involvep in a lot of conversations how the role was born but I can tell you about myself and what
I hope to bring and demonstrate to be of
value to this board in helping the board
:   In establish the office of inspector general
sheriff department of accountability. I have been with the city county of san francisco as a practicing attorney 24
years. I spent first 10 years as 8127. I know all the roles
there. I was a former trial prosecutor that tried many cases. A
lot of my trials have been highly publicized in the media and they are available for you to research and look
up. I have also spent
a lot of time on the subject matters relevant to this
particular line of work. Every single
case that comes in that involves resisting arrest is district attorney
office or assaulting a peace officer requires we carefully analyze the use of force to determine whether it is appropriate and
whether the officers acted appropriately.
I have been involve d in police
:
On the officer involved-responding to shootings in the community and conducted the investigations to determine the propriety of the work.
I worked my way over 24 years through all of the ranks and all the classifications and all the steps between from the 8177
all the way up to a
higher rank then 8181 to 8193. I served under 6 administrations all which have very vastly different philosophys and programs and policies that we have to implement and I assisted each administration with that. I also would
like to point out that through the course of
all the work I had a global view of the criminal justice system. Developed a lot of expertise in a
variety of subject matter relevant including 4th
amendment search and seizure, 8 amendment, cruel and unusual punishment all of which hopefully skills value to the administration and board. I also been involved over the past
decade in upper management. I have
been at 8181 or higher
nearly a decade now and throughout the upper management role I engaged in a lot of infrastructure building that is very similar to the role that I have been
tasked to do here. We have really modernized
the district attorney system. I spearheaded the efforts to digitize all the work. At the time I first
took over the role of division chief before becoming the chief assistant district attorney for the san francisco district attorney office, I started and completed the project of getting
all of the legacy data and files from paper
into digital. That was vastly accelerated during covid when we had to transition
quickly to a paperless environment. We also developed all kinds of
work orders as well as working agreements and operational agreement with a variety of partner agencies where we were able to
transition to a remote environment with the courts with the police department, with the sheriff department all
by developing work sharing through electronic portals which never existed before 2020 and again, that was vastly accelerated because of the pandemic and the requirements of the
city to reduce the working capacity within the office to 20 percent at the time. I also
spearheaded the effort
to on-board a new case management system for the district attorney's office. That process started in 2016. It went through a full rfp
process where we went through several rounds of figuring out the budget for it. It
required a rather complex mapping process in order to migrate all the data.
We spent a lot of time figuring out and
trying to identify the perfect system for a
very complex set of
work-I would say far more labor intensive then the work hopefully that will
take to identify an on-board the right case management system
for sheriff department of accountability. That was realized a few months ago when we started the first
phase of implementation. I can't emphasize enough how important having a solid case management system is for any
modern department.
The entire universe of work revolves around case management system. It is the central nervous system for any modern department and I think the district attorney office is served well
with the new case management system. That's just a little about myself. The abridged version. I hope that it gives you
a flavor of some of the skillsets I will
bring to this particular work. I
think it is useful to contextualize why dpa is involved with assisting this board in building the office
of inspector general.
First it makes perfect sense. Dpa is the older sibling or will
be the older sibling.
The work processes.
The staffing. The operations. All the
needs are going to be extremely similar to dpa. Dpa is in the best position to look at its operations and identify what are the
needs of this new department because
they will be sibling departments, there will be tremendous amount of similarity between the two departments and the
mission and work. Of course, hopefully this new department and all your wisdom and experience we will come up with new
invasions as well that will certainly distinguish the
sheriff department of accountability from
dpa, but again, it is extremely similar. Dpa also has been doing the work and lending support to every aspect of getting the board operational. In fact,
when our secretary for this board was unable to attend today, our chief financial officer jumped right in into play the role
of clerk from assembling and gathering all necessary to get the board up and running to having been doing
the work for the last few years, dpa has been there to support the work to carry out
the will of hopefully
what the voters want and I'm here to hopefully management the effort and insure
the work that has been done is currently being done and done
pursuant to the
letter of agreement, improved and expanded. That we identify what
the needs are appropriately, expend resources to gather
those needs in this fiscal period and echo
the importance of that
from what nicole just
described. And to hopefully craft and
negotiate a plan of
transition that will
insure that work
transfers from dpa to the sheriff department of accountability without crashing this new department before
it has the resources
to embrace all this
new work. I think it is certainly useful
also to point out the timeline for installing the inspector general
really puts the work
of dpa in a critical
spot for this board and I'll explain why.
In the last meeting we certainly heard from the experts PRESIDENT
Wechter you brought DR. Rosenthol and
:   To explain what their thoughts
are on identifying an ideal inspector general and also to explain the process in their experience. I
also read DR.
Rosenthol's paper from surveying all the inspector generals around the state and around the country and
some from canada. And
it seemed all most in every situation it has taken considerable amount of time for every jurisdiction to
identify the right inspector general and on top of that, what they described was after the inspector general started, there
was a lot of start-up challenges and start-up problems,
largely because once the inspector general gets installed that is only the beginning of a very long road to
establish a agency. There are no-in all
those scenarios there was no infrastructure to support the inspector general day 1 and that posed lots of problems and as described many occasions it took 4 to 6 months to over sometimes nearly a year to identify the inspector general and
it took maybe 2 years
from there for the inspector general or oversight director to
make the department operational. What I'm here to present today
is that we can accelerate that considerably by allowing dpa to incubate this new department and stand it up to provide all the necessary support to build the infrastructure and get
a lot of the materials ready to put the inspector general in the best place
possible for successful department.
I want to echo the
sense of urgency that board member afuhaamang expressed at the last meeting calling for this board to MARCH in a timely
manner and insure that perfect doesn't become enomy of the good. I take that she recognized that in the
time it will take for
this board to install the inspector general and establish the office through inspector general there is a lot of missed opportunities
and I think it is worthwhile to validate
the sense of urgency with very specific time sensitive reasons. First off, the work continues
every single day. Complaints don't stop just because the board needs the time to find and install a inspector general. It doesn't stop because
the inspector general doesn't have resources to perform the work.
That work is performed through dpa and has been performed and had opportunity to review a lot of the work and
it has been done in a exlempary way. The
fact all the statutory deadlines have been met on all the serious
cases, many of which
involve sometimes half dozen, dozen of sheriff deputies because the nature of the investigation every critical incident is responded
to by many different sheriff deputies. Has been done really really well. We are going to work on expanding that work because not all the
work that has been specified in the letter of agreement has been performed simply because there hasn't been the resources to do so. Dpa took on the work without the work order without the funding and had been performing the work
for a long time without any funding
what so ever. It taxed dpa resources. Conversations with the investigators it has over-extended the investigators and are
pushed the envelope on
dpa falling within the budgetary means. It is important to
realize if the funding stops dpa cannot
continue that work and there simply will not be independent oversight. That will
go back to the sheriff department. Sheriff department will
continue to do that work until the office of inspector general is established and starts performing mandates under the
charter. The second reason is that-as nicole alluded to, we are in budget season already. The 5 year financial plan was due to the mayor's budget
office on OCTOBER 28 which we submitted for
the sheriff department of accountability. I believe FEBRUARY 21 every department budget proposal needs
to be submitted to the mayor's budget office and there will be a
lot that will occur in
those couple months. Between MARCH and JUNE there will be a lot of negotiations and discussions about what the budget needs
will be to finalize the mayor position to the board of
supervisors then it gets dissected by the budget and legislative analyst and presented
for usually cuts to the board and the board budget appropriation
committee. Every year that budget appropriation committee warns if you do not spend the funds allocated you face
cuts and we are headed into the budget season
not in the position that budget season started last year. Last year there was hundred million dollar surplus. The economic forecast going into the budget season is much worse. It is
going to be more of advocacy will be needed to properly fund the sheriff department accountability and
even as you all know
with the hundred million dollar surplus
last year, there was a half million dollar budget cut from the department of accountability budget already, so headed into this budget
season, it is important to keep in mind and in the back
of mind what of the 13 principles for success
of oversight agency is
a adequate funding and resources which PRESIDENT Wechter you MAY have credit for creating as well. It is also not lost on me that it is incredibly expensive to do
business in san francisco. It is expensive to do
business in san francisco, and it certainly will be beneficial for the
board not just look
at sheriff department accountability budget last year. Hopefully
:   As a zero sum game of just the sheriff department of accountability budget. We are all aware that the san francisco operating
budget from last year $14 billion. Just to put in perspective
that is $38 million
spent every single day. The allocation
for the budget for public protection,
that pool of money which funds $700
million to the police department $500 million to the fire department, $300
million to the sheriff
department is $1.9 billion. The budget that is allocated for
the sheriff department accountability is
under $3 million a year. I think PRESIDENT Wechter you pointed out in the
very first meeting that there isn't enough to offer a salary to the
department head that
is commensurate with
other directors or similarly situated executives around the
bay area. That is because bay area salaries are much higher then anywhere
else. It certainly
would be advantageous for the board not just
to just look at it budget itself but entire budget. Even if looking at the sheriff department of accountability budget of $3 million relative to the $300 million for the sheriff that is less then 1 percent
of the over $1.9
billion allocated for public protection. It is 1/6 of 1 percent.
I point it out because there is a lot of
opportunity here to advocate to really
shepherd and steward this budget to an amount that hopefully will adequately allow the sheriff department of accountability to launch properly to be able to have the adequate funding and operational resources to do well, to be able
to attract top candidates for the
position so you all
can select from the
best. As you are aware there is contversity about the cost of installing a
single toilet in san francisco. $1.7 million. You are asked to build a entire agency from scratch for a budget
that is less then 2 public toilets. hopefully that puts
that in perspective. One quick correction
to the salary of the classification-I think the amount you are
referring to $360 thousand is including all fringe benefits for the position. When you look at it from the perspective
of the 8181 versus
8177 and I was a 8177 nearly a decade before getting promoted up, the difference really isn't that much or as large a difference as
you might have thought
because the 8177 is a deep classification with 16 steps and you progress through the steps based on the
number of years of
:   A number
of years, so all most any attorney that you
look for that is-or
has 16 or more years experience is already
going to be in the
range of $245 thousand
I think which is step
16 with longevity or a
few years longer then 15 they are pushing $250 thousand. There
is less then a $30 thousand differential between 8177 equivalent number of
year attorney versus 8181. Hopefully that reduces the amount of concern you have with regards to what a difference it is
between 8177 and 8181.
the other thing
besides budget is that I want to point out is that as we are going through this budget process, there needs
to be a demonstration that the funds
allocated to sheriff department accountability is being properly used towards the work
through the work order, properly used to build infrastructure and properly being applied
to that work. That demonstration, that exertion of the budget is what is persuasive to the powers that be
in the mayor budget office in the budget-with the budget legislative analyst
and with later on with the budget appropriations committee. Having those expenditures
against the budget shows that they are being applied to productive uses to
build this department. If and looking at the
timeline and the timeline should raise a sense of urgency for all of you because if we are looking at all
most from what DR.
Rosenthol described as miraculous amount of time to install inspector general even in three months or four months, when it
is more likely to take six months or more. That already takes us into MARCH or APRIL.
That's half the time that the budget would have been due already
to the mayor budget office on FEBRUARY 21 and there will be a lot of missed opportunities there to advocate and discuss with the mayor budget
office what else is
needed to improve the opportunity for this department to succeed. I also point out the fact that we are by the time you have inspector general it
will at least be
MARCH, APRIL if a candidate matches all the unicorn
description that DR. Rosenthol described at the last meeting. That also means there will be a salary
savings across the board of.75 fte.
Three quarters full
:   At most a.25fte salary incumbrance up to that point which means you can apply all those salary savings right
now to building the infrastructure on all the big ticket items like case management system. Maybe purchase a vehicle. Equipping all the staff before they
start. If you don't
that budget becomes unspent and as you are aware government budgets do not credit
for the money you saved in the previous year. They look how the money is spent and whether it is productively applied and what the needs are. It is useful to look from that perspective. One last
thing to say about the
budget is that as you pointed out this board
has indicated interest
in trying to elevate
the job classification for the department head, inspector general. I think that makes perspect sense. That department head position as you pointed out is unlike any other. It is
going to require that the inspector general build the department entirely from scratch and there will be challenges unique to this job none other department head has or
had. Yet, the job classifications 0961 for department head 1 versus the other
higher level classification, 962, 963, 964 for department heads 2, 3 and 4 are tied to
certain factors the city enumerated for consideration on what
the level of compensation should be for the department head. I also in my experience working through budgets and
also in management of a much larger office
have seen a huge recruitment retention
issue with top talent because san mateo, santa clara, neighboring counties all have higher and better compensation packages then san francisco so it-in
order to get the best possible candidates before you, really makes sense to work with all the powers that be, all the departments to see if
you can work up the job classifications
and three factors enumerated. There are three factors enumerated by the city that identify what the level of classification should
be. The first factor
is the size and complexity of the organization. There
are certain numbers of employees associated
with each of the classes. It is not a
:   But a factor. 1-60 for
department head 1.
60-175 for 2, 175 to 800 for department head 3. The board loses on that argument because this is
without a doubt a
small department. The next factor is the number and nature of the function and programs of this particular department
head. That is really up for inspector general to identify what are these programs that they want to-or he or she
wants to pursue. What
are the various types of functions in
addition to what is
outlined in 4.137 of charter mandate he or
she will want to
pursue. You are certainly a variety
of different ways to bolster that argument. Building out additional functions. Building out additional programming like having or creating a mediation program that is staffed by community
members that will
allow the inspector
general to supervisor a much larger group of
individuals in a more robust setting. Creating community
liaisons and are community bam basders to spread the word about the inspector general office but
that will be all up to ininspector general once installed to do.
The third factor and
here this might sound self-serving but the
third factor is what are the levels of classifications and positions the inspector general supervisors? The
higher level of classification built into that department the higher the level an argument can be
made on that factor
for inspector general salary. I point that out because you
PRESIDENT Wechter already identified
that is a pursuit to try to elevate the compensation package for inspector general to attract top class
of candidates this board I'm sure really
wants to see. The last thing that is very time sensitive that should be done
before an inspector general is established
and that is really
create negotiate and facilitate a carefully constructed transition
plan for the work and
I'll explain why when
I get to the next section. I'm not highlighting all these
time sensitive issues
for this board to rush
the decision. I heard DR. Rosenthol not set arbitrary deadlines
and rush. This is the most important decision the board will make in vetting identifying and installing the right inspector general. There are a lot of
factors that could potentially delay that
and a lot of lost
opportunities in that time. For example, if you don't have inspector general installed by MARCH 3
board members term out
and that creates potential uncertainty. Hopefully all the board members will stay on to maintain
continuity but that
potentially adds additional delays: described how there
were so many factors that caused delays in all jurisdictions. You MAY not get after a diligent search all of the candidates or the types of candidates that you want and MAY want to
go back and look again or advertise again. If you fiend a candidate from across the country, what is the timeframe for that
candidate who MAY be gainfully employed in another position to disconnect from the work obligation there and move across the country? And all that is going to be highly dependent on whether
or not you are able to create an attractive compensation package
to get the candidates
you want. What I am presenting to you and why I'm presenting to
you all these really time sensitive issues is to highlight where
dpa comes in and how dpa can mitigate a lot of these concerns to afford this board the time and space that this board needs to establish its rules of
order. Draft the comprehensive mission statement. To meet with the community. Identify what the community needs and wants are. To survey and evaluate the department and other departments and are to make recommendations about best practices
pursuant to the charter mandates that vice PRESIDENT Carrion had described and most importantly, the time
that it will take for this board to seek profession and leadership without sacrificing all the good that can be accomplished in the meantime by allowing dpa to do this work to
support this board and I emphasize full deference to what the board's mission and vision will be for the
office of inspector general. I will now go through a high
level plan. This is somewhat synthesis of the plan that the 5 year financial plan submitted to the mayor
budget office due on
OCTOBER 28 through the
next slide. What i
defined thin in the plan is front loaded in the next couple months how long it
takes to install inspector general and
this is before the inspector general is
installed. What should hopefully happen after the inspector general is installed and of course this is going
to be a iterative process every single year, 5 year plan, probably will be
updated in terms of what the goals and objectives of the department are once we have the inspector general. But I want to focus first on how important it will be
to have a good
transition plan in
place. Very simply put, we will manage
all the work that is-has been done pursuant to the sheriff department and
department of police accountability letter agreement responsibilities. That was a evolution from a earlier memorandum of
understanding with the
previous sheriff. In this particular realm, there are some very specific types of allegations that have
been carved out. The serious allegations against law enforcement, sworn law enforcement employed
by the sheriff
department in largely
5 groups and 2 other categories that are at discretion of the
sheriff department to refer. Based on the
limitation of resources from dpa, the fact dpa was not funded for the work for a number of years only the first 2 and
possibly the first 3 categories have received enough
attention. And those categories are the use
of force that causes injury or death. The
use of a weapon or controlled device
against a inmate and misconduct. The two other areas within the letter of agreement that really haven't been delved into which requires a much more
global view and lot more complex analysis,
which we hope to spend more effort with to
generate the momentum to transition better work product and more work to the new sheriff department accountability is the
area of pattern and practices of harassment, bias and
retaliation against a inmate. Those sometimes individual insdants do not inform the pattern and practice and much more global view needs to be taken which is a
much more labor
intensive project and
the last category and
that is wreckless disregard for health safety and welfare of
inmates. That has not been deeply explored,
not had the resources
to do so and probably
requires time energy and resources dpa does
not have. There are two areas that can be
referred to for dpa investigation, in-custody deaths. If
there is a aspect of
in-custody death that
needs to be investigated and officer involved shootings. There is one officer involved
shooting I'm aware currently being investigated. Largely, that is a scope of work that within the letter of agreement we can expand and improve
upon, but I point thought is a very narrow slice of the
universe of work that the inspector general will be taking on.
The mandate under
4.137 is far more
expansive. It is everything. Not just
:   Not just
occurring in a custodial situation in
the jail, it is every
complaint and every complaint against ever employee, not just sworn but employees
and contractors.
There is a tsunami of
work that hasn't been touched by independent investigation that
will fall upon the shoulders of the sheriff department accountability office
of inspector general
potentially day 1 if
it is viewed that once an inspector general
is appointed that the mandate of 4.137 now
kick in that is potentially a very dangerous position for an emerging department to be in, because we
are talking about hundreds, potentially thousands of cases
that have to be reviewed, investigated and processed by the inspector general day 1. Every single case
as nicole alluded to
has a statute of limitation under 3304 of the government code
and that has been performed without missing any deadline
up to this point. If
we don't have a carefully crafted transition plan for the work negotiated with the sheriff department with a
understanding that as the inspector general builds up the staff,
we do not pass off all
the work manitated you will flood the inspector general office before there is staff, before there is infrastructure, before there is anything to process and you will end up setting the new inspector general office for failure before it started. It will immediately start
blowing statute of limitations and do
exactly what DR. Rosenthol described as
start up failure all most viewed universally in all of the agencies that they have seen surveyed and worked at with the
exception I think DR. Rosenthol described one jurisdiction that successfully launched
and that is manitoba. Which said why manitoba succeeded is because it took a year to find their executive director or inspector general and it gave manitoba 2 years running time to create the operation necessary before
giving them all the work. Is that the amount of time this
board wants to spend before creating the platform to start the
work that the voters
wanted two years ago? That is why it is important to carefully manage the
responsibility and
create a transition transition when the staff is ready at the
sheriff department of accountability. As mentioned, from my experience and experience of dpa my
experience before and experience of dpa, dpa is in the best position to really assess what the
critical needs and operational needs and
costs for the departments are advocate for that
proper funding. Nicole has prepared really a much more practical understanding of what the budgetary needs
are from the original
much more theoretical
budget. Without any inspector general to steward this budget through the budget process, dpa is really
in the best position
to demonstrate why the budget allocated needs to be increased going
into fiscal year
23-24. We can start building policy neutral infrastructure and there is procedures that can be established that insure the work. Yes,
I heard DR.
Rosenthol's warning about necessarily creating policies or building infrastructure before
the inspector general is installed and setting a particular
course for the office that the inspector general MAY not want. I'm here to assure this board is we can
do it in a very policy neutral way, and more
importantly, these are all temporary. The inspector general is going to need an office to work in. If
we do not do the work
to find the facility
space to outfit that
facility space with
office equipment,
desks, chairs, phones, laptops, all the
things employees need before-hand. Of course they will be applied to this year's budget which will be
reset next year, this year's budget will
have a surplus for all those expenditures and you get to keep that
in the following year.
The other thing is
having these policy neutral infrastructures and
think is indisputebly things that will advance the office rather then hinder it because they are not setting the inspector general in a particular direction. They will keep the staff organized for the timebeing until the inspector general decides to proceed any procedures in place,
but insure a professional operating
staff. It will insure
that the staff has the equipment on day 1 necessary to perform the functions. And as I alluded earlier, the case management
system, which is a
huge project as indicated and experience at the district attorney office building case management system to meet all the requirements of the job requires a tremendous amount of examination of the work and building in the work processes but having the right case management system insure the success of the department for a
variety of reasons. Case management system
that we have been considering and evaluating ask built
by sales force. It is highly highly customizable and adaptable. The largest expenditure is building out the system which can be
applied to this year's-fiscal year budget and not encumber any future year budget accept for
operating cost and licensing. What the case management system will do for the
department is it will insure that we have a central hub for all information. It will
be able to build out dashboards so that this board and the public will be able to see the work all most in real time as
dashboards get issued and are publicly available. We will be
able to at some point build out inactive dashboard where you filter out the information you like to see. We want to create a case management system also flexible enough to
work with other case management systems to build in work processes not just internally but also
with all the other partner departments as board member soo pointed out. It is so
important to have the it infrastructure in place for any department. It also by having a
communicate with other departments [Coughing] Have the ability to partition to insure departments can keep
whatever information is confidential within the department and communicate through api and program interfaces with each
other so we have a seamless work process end to end. The other aspect of the case
management system, it can take in information from a
online portal so complainants have much
more accessibility to making complaints and those complaints will be tracked end to end when the complaint is first made will be
able to track every
single data point entered without redundancy reentering datsa over and over again and there is a huge benefit to that
not just in the labor
saving of not having employees enter information in various different places
multiple times, not just as aggravate the employees that have to
do it, but also reduce the amount of human error in the data. When you have to enter the same data multiple places it increases the opportunity there will be error in the data. This will make
the data much more trustworthy and accessible to the
board members and public. The other thing that having the
case management system in place already before the staff come s in in my experience over 20 years at the
district attorney office introducing existing staff to new work processes particularly new technology is a
challenge in and of itself. When you have
new staff already acclimated to a
certain work process it is quite a challenge to get them to adopt new processes
and there is a lot of rejection for the new case management system for the outset. Having the case management system and work processes established means when staff are on-boarded by the inspector general they will be trained up on the
system and this is the
only work process that they are acclimated 2 day 1. Again, there is concern that maybe the case management system might not be to
the specks of the inspector general, and
I would say that this case management system offers complete customization. You can change the data
points, change output and input features so there is a very little risk of that. More importantly, even if we expend the cost which is the heaviest cost in the first year, that will be towards the budget
that is not going to be fully expended anyway. In the
following year if the case management system isn't working out the inspector general is
free to find a new
case management system."
2022-12-02,"MR. Kind, can you wrap it up?"
2022-12-02,"yes, sorry. I will go quickly."
2022-12-02,"dan, I don't think we will have time for questions and public comment on this matter tonight so I think we have to continue it to
our next meeting."
2022-12-02,okay.
2022-12-02,"I would like to get to the last item about potential subjects for
agenda items for future meetings because board members MAY have items they
like us to bring up at future meetings."
2022-12-02,MAY I be recognized?
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"if you can finish in 5 minutes let's finish it. If not I
think we do want to-my
main-I would prefer have other items tabled and focus on
the future agenda
items to prioritize. That is my --"
2022-12-02,"I was a trial litigator so can speak
with time limit. After sheriff department oversight
:
Staff will have to be
hired as indicated all the 4.137 mandates will be triggered at
that point unless we
craft and negotiate a plan transition plan. The inspector general at that point will be
free to development his own evidence informed policy procedure and protocols. Certainly
hope there will be a more robust informational campaign that will include increasing
accessibility to the
community and include more language accessibility. One
idea would be to start
gathering funds to
create kiosks to make complaints strategically placed in certain locations so that there is more accessibility for making online complaints should a complainant not have
access to the
internet. Inspector general will have to work with department of real estate at some point because the
department of police accountsability doesn't have the square footage or enough real estate
space to host an entire staff office adequately. It is certainly envisioned by the department of accountability the inspector general is going to be fully autonomous at some point, not necessarily in this timeframe or any particular timeframe but it will take a considerable amount of time. We are here simply to support the effort, support this board's
mission and vision and
to hopefully help
build the boat to get
it to float. The inspector general will decide all the features of the boat and steer the boat in whatever direction the inspector general
wishes to take the department. Again, thank you for this board's time. I
really appreciate your
time and efforts in this cause. I'm available for questions if you have
any. I know I took up
an inordinant amount of time but this I assure is a abridged version."
2022-12-02,"I have quick question relating to it. We know the sheriff department
does a lot of data collection.
:   Still by
hand. Is there a way you could make recommendations to a it system that would be compatible with case management system because having been on the commission working with the police department I know they
are light years ahead on the it system and gone to implementing justice which helps
with the da office and data collection so would you have recommendations for that?"
2022-12-02,"I do. We are already in communications with the sheriff department on a number of
observations I have
had. We have certainly discussed technology and multiple different areas. One obviously
is in case management system and being able to process everything electronically. All is a ia prosystem I have a follow up meeting with the sheriff department next week to look whether or not we can
build out work processes and application programming interfaces
with the sales force system. The other alternative might be and this is something that is a feature of other case management systems I have seen is building out a portal from the case management system so the sheriffs can
directly inpt the information in the system so we have a integrated system until which point the sheriff system is able to interface directly with the case management system.
The other technology infrastructure piece through anecdotally for many investigations we have seen that MAY offer a
lot of benefits and
might be use ful for the board is more surveillance system within the jail. We have seen that surveillance cameras offer just like body worn cameras offer a lot of insight into the investigations
offer a lot more clarity to investigations but we are also aware there are limitations to the current system how many cameras and where the cameras are
located, so that only benefits the investigations and
also benefits all the sheriff deputies that
do great work in insuring we see
exactly what occur, but it also allows the sheriff to hopefully address a lot of the shortage and staffing that they are
suffering from because having more cameras means that a single deputy, not suggesting any way the sheriff should give more work
to a already very
taxed staff, but a single deputy can monitor a lot more
space behind a monitor with cameras that cover a lot more space within the jails as well. Those are some of the ideas that we are already discussing."
2022-12-02,"I think my question also leads into the mandate of the board. It is inspector general job to pull data but we are responsible generating the reports as a board to the quarterly reports as well as annual report. That would be quite taxing
to not only inspector general his or her
office as well as the sheriff staff to have
to really go through
the cumbersome on paper it system."
2022-12-02,"appreciate that perspective because I
took over as division chief at district
attorney office we were keeping statistics with hash
marks on yellow pads and we modernized the
system in a way that allows us to illustrate the work
with a lot more granular clarity for the public and managers to assess the
work, so having a case management system
built out before hand allow the inspector general to assess the work that has been done because all that will migrate into the case management system
and really make informed decision whether to go based on historical data."
2022-12-02,"it is now 653 and think we are required to take general public comment before we adjourn. I know I'm going to have questions for you MR. Kind so think we have to continue this to
the next meeting. Dan
can we take general
public comment?"
2022-12-02,"yes PRESIDENT
Wechter. At this time the public is welcome to address the board up to 2 minutes for items that did not
appear on tonight's agenda but within the
subject matter
jurisdiction of the

Thank you caller, you
have 2 minutes."
2022-12-02,hello.
2022-12-02,you have two minutes.
2022-12-02,"first and foremost, i have been listening
very carefully to this
meeting, and we the
people agreed by
putting this measure
on a ballot that we
have a say in the
deliberations. As you can see in this
particular meeting you
have miserably failed.
The chair should be
very careful how he
conducts himself. In san francisco as you
can see from the other
commissioners who gave their input, they are
very astute and
stellar, so we have to
go forward, but let me
warn you, this divisiveness at every
level must stop. I
think-
:"
2022-12-02,"orientation is in order so you really understand your mission of justice. You are very lucky the
department of police accountability has
gone out of its way to help you. Again, my
name is francisco decosta and I will be
addressing this meeting on my blog."
2022-12-02,"thank you caller,
your time is up."
2022-12-02,"is there any other
public comment?"
2022-12-02,no more.
2022-12-02,"okay, it is 657. MR. Kind, thank you very much for your presentation. Sorry we have to trunicate it because we have to
end at 7. Thank you MS. Armstrong. Do we have motion to adjourn?"
2022-12-02,"no, your honor, sorry, your honor. Trial experience. I like to be heard and
make a motion to
postpone all items 6,
7, 8, and 9 and for the future agenda
items I request two
items be added they are 1, that we find out information from other oversight boards
that did not use a national executive firm to find what their process was and if they had any issuess a a result of
that and number 2,
that we prioritize the appointment of ig that we prioritize the conduct community
outreach and receive input, which includes
what a previous commissioner mentioned of the social media
policy, and that we prioritize the report that are due. Quarterly report and
the MARCH 1 report
since those are 4 of
our primary directives."
2022-12-02,"okay, if you want to draft those items for the agenda."
2022-12-02,yes.
2022-12-02,"determine who would do the research
regarding the other
agencies. Regarding their recruitment."
2022-12-02,"how is the research
done for the past-the
one presentation and
information? Was it you PRESIDENT Wechter that reached out to your colleague snz"
2022-12-02,that is correct.
2022-12-02,I ask since you have a direct line to more oversight boards then I do can you please outreach to your colleagues regarding the oversight boards that have not used an executive firm?
2022-12-02,"I could put a
message on the naco list serves."
2022-12-02,I would like to be included as a contact.
2022-12-02,I will pull in contacts I met at the conference.
2022-12-02,wonderful. Great. Thank you.
2022-12-02,"I just had one other item and this
would be jur are germane to the public and need not be the very next meeting but
it fairly urgent about [Coughing] Resignation because of conflict issues so I want to make sure we are paying attention to jail health."
2022-12-02,"sorry, I couldn't hear what you said?"
2022-12-02,"I want to have the
jail health issue on a future agenda item but not necessarily the very next item, but
given the dph had-had a jail health resignation and potential conflicts with having a second job. Whether we were paying close attention as we should to jail health."
2022-12-02,"okay. We will need to have the issue of recruitment of the inspector general on the agenda I believe, because-"
2022-12-02,"yes. I agree with commissioner carrion.
I think we should have
a timeline and firm benchmarks. I think commissioner afuhaamang said that at the very first
meeting that we should have --
:"
2022-12-02,"wrap up the last issue, I like to call
the question if there
is a motion for the
chief attorney position. Assistant
chief attorney position."
2022-12-02,I have no motion.
2022-12-02,"no motions at this time. But again, MR.
Kind's presentation I think not concluded
because we haven't had a opportunity to ask questions or public comment."
2022-12-02,we did have public comment.
2022-12-02,"not on his presentation so that needs to be continued
and public comment and if someone chooses to make a motion they can."
2022-12-02,"I have one quick request that is germane. If we have an agenda item that is up for possible
action, if it be presented more then 48 hours advance. That doesn't give the board members meaningful time for input as well as the public, the most important part of our job is to serve the public and I want the public to also have more then 48 hours to review documents."
2022-12-02,I think dan posted this 72 hours before the meeting as required by law.
2022-12-02,"I understand that
but I think when it is something that important that might be possible action item that has materials I think that if at all possible we
have the items in advance."
2022-12-02,"I asked dan to post all the items as I receive them and send
them to the board members."
2022-12-02,"I understand.
Maybe it not be on the agenda if it is that late in time because I like to do reading ahead of time rather then caught off guard
with the agenda."
2022-12-02,okay. Do we have a motion to adjourn?
2022-12-02,we need public comon future agenda item.
2022-12-02,"okay. Can we take-ask for public comment if they can still reach us since
it is after 7."
2022-12-02,"member of the
public that like to make public comment, if you are present
line up at the podium otherwise call 415-655-0001 and are
enter access code 24974407820, press 3 to raise your hand to
be added to the queue.
There is no public comment."
2022-12-02,"okay, do we have a motion to adjourn?"

2022-11-04,"good afternoon, PRESIDENT Members of the commission, indicate here from the department of human resources
to report back regarding the process of recruitment of inspect or general. MAY I have my slide posted
please.
Are you able to see them? They did solicit our
prequalified list of next slide of recruitment firm.
We did have one responsive to
that proposal,"
2022-11-04,"which was from, affirm, in
the city and other public sector agencies and has more
than 30 years of experience."
2022-11-04,"thank you.
I wanted to bring back to the
commission the oversight oversight that you requested one was the explanation of
process if you worked for an outside recruitment firm.
And listed in front of you are
the steps that recruitment firm proposed to essentially working closely with you to develop the
profile of the candidate that's you're seeking, conducting out
reach and then reviewing those candidates and presenting recommended finalist to the
commission. And then supporting you through
the process.
Next slide please.
I just want to highlight the proposal from bill murray which
you can see here on the slide. they have conducted similar for
will he serve including in
orange county, in sacramento in
sonoma and press no and for the
district, also known as barge.
They have conducted 65,000 to
conduct the recruitment and up
to 50,000 for reinbursment and
the placement of specific ads.
On a reimbursable basis.
They propose 3 to 16 weeks to
respond.
-- 13 to 16 weeks.
You requested that I also
workup a basic proposal about
dhr capacity to conduct this recruitment on your behalf and
I have that on the next slide. We have recently conducted recruitment and the mayor's department of housing development.
The typical timeline for us to reconduct is about 5 to 6
months.
And the cost would be based on
the actual time and my estimate
based on the planning director
would be between 40 and 50,000
dollars. And I'm happy to answer any questions that the commission MAY have.
K you."
2022-11-04,do any members have questions?
2022-11-04,"no question for me as much
as a statement. I'm glad that dhr heard us. And the first meeting that we
had so I'm glad that they came
back and supportive of this body in termds of what we're
looking for and moving forward. Any other members wish to be recognized for discussion or question?"
2022-11-04,"I have a question, for I guess either option, are we able to recommend applicants?
or I don't know what the vetting process looks like for
bob murray."
2022-11-04,"yes, whether you work with
dhr or with for example bob murray as not executive
recruitment firm, either of us would get recommendation from
candidates.
Because you all have network and relationships in these communities that are going to be important to get the word
out."
2022-11-04,"awesome, thank you."
2022-11-04,"I have several questions. Has dhr recruited for similar
position?
Somebody involved in oversight
or investigation -- conduct, running of departments that administrative or criminal
investigations?"
2022-11-04,"the two most resent are the
two that I have noted.
If they can move, commissions have largely relied.
So not to my knowledge."
2022-11-04,"so if dhr were to do the recruitment, how would you
establish the knowledge skills
and experience for candidates
in order to scan candidates?"
2022-11-04,"I think the question is how
would dhr work with the commission to develop the
profile?"
2022-11-04,"yes, the criteria."
2022-11-04,"it would be a project with you. We would look at the practices in the industry in the terms of
recruiting in the field.
And partnership with you. Ultimately to meet the
expectations of the commission.
When I spoke last time, they typically want to use an
recruitment firm because of the expertise that those firms
bring."
2022-11-04,"has the executive firm indicated how they would do
recruitment process? And the screening for the
position?"
2022-11-04,"they did describe that in
their proposal and it included
working closely with the commission to stakeholders to
learn as much as possible about the ideal candidates that you would want.
They would also bring to the
table, examples of education,
experience and other things that they've seen in similar profiles."
2022-11-04,"all right, thank you, any other questions from other
members?
Thank you, we can move on to doctors rosenhal.
By way of introduction, you
have heard their bio, these are
two individuals that I'm familiar with both extremely
experienced in the field.
Both have started and lead milt
tibl oversight entities similar
in nature toft inspect or general office that we'll be
establishing.
And DR. Rosenthal has
transitions to the world of
academia with oversight issues."
2022-11-04,"good evening, I hope
everybody can hear me."
2022-11-04,"yes, thank you to the board
for inviting me.
I'm very happy to be here.
For purposes of this discussion evening, important discussion, you should know that two
agencies that I started off I
spent 14 years I have after starting in the police compliance in washington dc
which is similar to your department of police accountability in san francisco.
And then, started off the
office of inspect or general nypd which I lead for 7 years
until the end of last year. So during that time, I was part
of law enforcement, so I've
had, quite a bit of experience in learning how to get offices
up and running.
I'm not selected but I am very
familiar as a former chief, I
have a sense of what  -- [Indiscernible] That said, I
don't think there is a one size
fits all approach.
Seems like they've got some
good plans in place solicited.
So I see my role to --"
2022-11-04,you're somewhat fading in and out the volume of your voice.
2022-11-04,how does that sound?
2022-11-04,that's better.
2022-11-04,"so I see the purpose of this
discussion, this evening as an
opportunity to answer questions
from ordinance relling to recruitment and hiring and
others starting off the police accountability office.
San francisco I have always
admired forward looking nature
of san francisco and the area
in many oversight offices. That's the important thing to remember from my presentations. And we learn from each other in
the scale. I offer suggestions and answered questions, I'm not on
the ground in san francisco I
don't know how precisely how any particular recommendation MAY play out. But I'm here to answer questions.
Thank you."
2022-11-04,and DR. Rosenthal.
2022-11-04,"yes, good evening everyone,
as mentioned, I stood up organizations in oregon, colorado and british columbia
and for the state of washington
and california and directors in three programs, in portland, cleveland ohio and for the state of washington.
And also in my academic pursuit, I investigation agencies worldwide and I've also interviewed many heads of the oversight in the U.S. About
what it takes to create and sustain the oversight agency.
So from all of that, I really
take five take aways from you
and just obviously, as fill mentioned open to my questions that I MAY have.
The first take away, you need to avoid any arbitrary deadlines.
You've got to give the agencies
the gift of time. The necessary infrastructure or without policies and procedures in place. Second, you need to take great care in the hiring of your inspect or general. That person can make or break
the agency and will be a primary factor in the successor
failure.
Normally, I recommend phil eure
but apparently he's unavailable.
Oversight director who is most likely to succeed and the
participates dwiebd a wide away
of trades in being
collaborative and tactical and
strategic, political savvy, resilient, passion al principaled, articulate and objective.
Basically you're looking for a unicorn and you need to make
sure that your posting sends out a mythical creature that going to be looking for.
Third, you need to hire the ig
first and allow the ig to build
the company from the ground up. Or make important decisions
such as where the office will be located or information system will be used. While often no right or wrong decisions to be made in those
areas, they will be the foundation for the agencies missions values and they need
to be made by the person who is ultimately responsible for the
program success.
4, don't shy away from using experts.
In denver, the ordinance
requires the person oversight be on the hiring panel.
In your case, you MAY want to ask a panel of oversight directors to help you identify your panelist.
Or your finalist. Finally, be plexable in your
hiring process.
Finalize the process only after
you've identified, only then
will you actually know what
impact a process MAY have on
your pull of candidates.
Your ultimate goal is to find the best possible position. And really what I mean by that, there are people out there who MAY be interested in a position
but would not be interested in publicizing that fact until
they receive an offer from you.
In cleveland where we're hiring
right now for the administer office of professional
standards.
Of the three finalist none of
them objected to having a public interview there are by they're able to have more transparency. But there is always the danger
that you will either dis swayed
candidates from applying or
cause them to withdrawal if
you're trying to be transparent to your process. And then they have to answer to
your their own con sti two enlt to why they're looking for
another job. And open for any questions you
MAY have."
2022-11-04,"and DR. Rosenthal none of a gave a overview of your background. Can you please state your qualifications before you came
to the oversight field, because you were both distinguished in
your field."
2022-11-04,"before I started at the police complaints in
washington, I spent 11 years as
a trial attorney in the civil rights division justice in
washington.
And I worked in the section
that frames employment discrimination lawsuits against police department.
So I had a background of these practices before I stepped into
oversight in washington dc."
2022-11-04,"and it's actually and I phil started almost exactly at the
same time, within a month of
each other and we actually met
for the first time in
conference in denver in 2001
just after 9-11.
I for one had been a prosecutor for the district attorney
office for 15 years and the
last three years the three
defense so I was prosecuting
and as well investigating and prosecutors police officer and
public officials.
I ultimately turned a dirty
police informant resulting in the lapd rampart scanneding and
after costering the city of los angeles one billion dollars 500 million to gang members that
were framed bit lapd and
another 5 million consent
decree I decided to leave as their first director for inter
police review."
2022-11-04,"thank you. Do members of the board have
questions?
Member mangle?"
2022-11-04,"is it pronounced?
Eure?"
2022-11-04,euere.
2022-11-04,"thank you both of for your
experience and just getting on the call to share your thoughts
and recommendation.
For MR. Eure, I have questions with you.
I love that you started office
in new york, nypd is a very politically rot city.
So I want today ask you, how long did it take for you from the time that you were given,
from the time that you started to hire the ig position for the
office?
Let me reword that, how long if
you know this the answer, how long did the organization take to hire you? How long was that a year a few
months?"
2022-11-04,"so there was a new mayor, eric was just a time table
quickly.
Mayor debazio was selected in
NOVEMBER 2013.
I got a call from mayor's
office in early JANUARY of 2014."
2022-11-04,okay.
2022-11-04,"I started undergoing various
rounds of interviews in FEBRUARY 2014 and resulted ultimately an offer being started with me.
And I started at the end of MAY.
So from the time they reached
out to me, that I thought it was a period of approximately 4 months."
2022-11-04,"that's great. That's amazing.
And then I want today ask my last question actually, are we
able to tap you both to reach
out for recommended guidelines? Or experience for how we, you know, the kind of candidate
that we want?"
2022-11-04,"I'm happy and I get these calls all the time.
I think that's part of the job,
want all to succeed.
And I my colleague richard on
the panel, has does. Happy to have follow-up discussion with your board members."
2022-11-04,"okay, thank you so much."
2022-11-04,"basically, just one of the
good pieces of news is a lot of cities have been doing what you've done.
So it's really a matter of if
you can just identify two or three cities with strong programs and asking them to see
the job description to find out the processes that were used for the hiring.
And one of the things about this type of hirings, there is
a lost way to see do it.
It's really not necessarily a
best practice but a best fit.
So what is fit so you feel comfortable getting the type of person you want."
2022-11-04,"thank you, just baz I saw kate howard's presentation and gave the presentation, this is
more of a statement rather.
They are, it takes about 3 to 4
months to for them to vet and
help us find a candidate a viable candidate.
Although, I would love to be of
course thoughtful and
considerate about this, role this inspector general, we're
building it from scratch, but
it makes me happy that MR. Eure was hired at the same time.
We want to make sure that we don't let perfect the enemy of good here. That's just a statement. Thank you."
2022-11-04,"if I MAY just one other
comment on that.
Phil's hiring was fairly unique among many cities, to hire
within four to five months, that's pretty amazing frankly.
When I left denver, it took
them a year to replace me. The current in denver right
now, they're still operated
with a, a temporary monitor while they're trying to hire somebody.
It can take three to four five months, it can take longer. A lot depends on what kind of salary.
The good news is that san francisco is a place where people want to live.
The bad news is you've got a very high cost of living. There are a lost factors that
go into play and while having
hired in 3 to 4 months would be wonderful, know that that would
be considered fast."
2022-11-04,"in fairness, I'll echo what
richard said. Given in new york city, I left
in DECEMBER of last year and
they're still trying to hire my replacement.
First candidate went through. That's delayed the process a little bit.
this is not the first ig but
all of this to say that needs
hiring periods for somebody up routing themselves in another part of the country that builds
extra time. But if the effort, proper effort can be put in the
process.
Now there are imperatives in
getting somebody on board
sooner rather than later.
I agree wholeheartedly that
richard, saying that happy
ultimate hire to support in
terms of grand decisions that
they've made by the agency and hopefully, they're in the
background and experience for
the job will help pay dividends."
2022-11-04,"that makes sense, of course two to four months seems ideal and not quit. But not impossible. I really want to hone in on the point that you know, we can't
really do anything as a board until we hire this position for this role. And you know, it will take the
time that it takes if it's 6 months from now, but I just, I
want to make sure that you
know, we're marching towards a
time lehmaner, that's it."
2022-11-04,other members.
2022-11-04,"absolutely and thank you for
that, member. I absolutely completely concur with your statements.
And thank you both DR.
Rosenthal for being here and
philip eure for being here.
And DR. Rosenthal is sharing what it's okay, making sure
that we hire the ig first and
don't shia way from experts and being flexible. So one of the things that I was
thinking of and this is for
philip, what would you share
with a brand new ig, the fact
that you have been in the role
and started that position in
the lapd of looking back now to
2014, what would you share with an incoming inspect or general that you now know that you didn't know when assuming that
position? I can hear myself.
Okay."
2022-11-04,"MR. Eure, if you're talking,
we cannot hear you. DR. Roseenthal texted me that
he can't hear anything.
The feed is muted.
Dan, didn't want me to talk.
Rosen and he's texting that he
just heard the first minute of
the commissioners comments."
2022-11-04,some sort of delay sounds like?
2022-11-04,it's always the technical issues.
2022-11-04,"it is, outside of our
control.
Test, test, test, test.
Testing.
If we don't get it through the video, can we ask them to call in? Can they speak at the same time
by phone? We don't know how long this is
going to take. MR. Eure is on the east coast and I'm sure he has other
obligations.
DR. Rosenthal texted that he
got booted and cannot join but
as an attendee and not panelist. And if necessary, I can call and hold them both to a
microphone.
DR. Rosenthal says he still
can't hear anything."
2022-11-04,"this is what happens when
you ask questions."
2022-11-04,you broke the internet.
2022-11-04,it's all about time.
2022-11-04,"is that preferable, me
calling them on the phone?
Okay.
Then if we're going to call
another item which could be a
discreet that could be
interrupted with discretion. Okay we'll call item 4, sheriff
chief report until we can get DR. Rosenthal and MR. Eure back online. Thank you, chief. I want to say thank you very much for sending the materials
in advance.
It was very appreciative to see them in advance."
2022-11-04,"you're welcome.
Before we get started, I know
we have several items and I brought my expert here for a cup of them. We're going to start with the first power point related to
our programs. That's going to be about 15 minutes. I'm going to bring up the director and she will explain
the program."
2022-11-04,"I'm allie and from and I
have no problem being interrupted by the other speakers without losing a beat. So you're going to pull up my slides?"
2022-11-04,can we?
2022-11-04,"please, I hope that's what I
was told.
It's a power point.
Beautiful.
Yeah, if you can go back to the initial slide, that would be
great.
There we go, I can see it on
your computer."
2022-11-04,"alie, TELLs what you see."
2022-11-04,"I can see my first slide.
I'll start out, there we go.
ji I didn't think about the subtitles.
I know I'm here to talk about the programs and sta tuesday sips covid and our staffing challenges. I wanted to start off my comments by saying in FEBRUARY
of 2020, the san francisco
sheriff's office was a national model on in our custody programs. We're the only jurisdiction in
the country that has won the harvard kennedy school
innovations award twice, once
for our rsvp and again for our
five keys charter high school.
We recognized by national model
by urban institute for the one
family program has a program
that facilitates the contact
visits for our incarcerated
parents.
Le so when covid hit, we were the national model, and we've just been struggle to get back
to that place.
Two of our legacy programs are roads to recovery and sister
program they are both programs that focus on substance use recovery.
They were both started in the
mid-90s and created as
therapeutic communities in the jail dedicated to that programming.
When covid hit, we had 32 men
that were housed in a unit
which is the 7th floor.
When that jail closed, those
participants were scattered among all the jails.
And they required us not to do
group programming at all, we
pivoted to doing individual management and independent study packets.
It made us we think how we do this programming.
So as the vaccine became
available, and we tried to have lots of stutter, and start
stop, start stop with out breaks and issues, we started
to do groups again.
But because of our participants were scattered throughout the
two jails, what we've done is have small cohorts who are
participating in groups. So there is, no I cannot read
it. It says there, 25 participants who are doing independent study
and there are 12 that are participating in three different housing areas who are
doing groups with the staff. We valley in-person programming, we know the importance of groups but this
has been our challenge to come back up.
Can we go to the next slide.
Works with anyone with a violent charge and very
survival centered. During the pandemic, we did the
individual work as I mentioned
before with roads, but we also
had a few tablets that we had
some groups that happened via zoom on these tablets.
As we start today open up more
for groups. Now we have about half a housing unit.
And they do come out for groups. There are two groups scheduled today. With a staffing challenges, sometimes the groups later on
in the day are canceled because we don't have enough staff to
maintain that.
So we're definitely impacted. I mention the parenting
program, they have started back
up recently over last few weeks
in both county jail 2 and 3. The contact visits we've done some through over the last several months.
Right now since SEPTEMBER s the
man of county jail 3 are able to participate in contact
visits with their children.
And we're working with a jail
justice, we're collaborating
with visiting this new county jail two for the incarcerated moms.
That space should be ready in mid-DECEMBER but in the interim
we have a plan to have contact
visits in using our gym at the
top of the floor which is not bad idea but just to have the
visits open. The covered program, when we first started, we totally had
48 men in one housing unit
dedicated to veteran services. The veteran population in custody has greatly reduced
over the years.
And we even before covid, we didn't have many that was in custody. And because of the veteran justice court which really
seeks to get all of that into treatment as quickly as possible and out into the community.
So they do a great job. Right these numbers are until the end of OCTOBER so it's pretty dynamic.
At the same time, we had three we had them housed together and they were doing groups every day.
And then the vets that were not there, were seen, we were seeing them individually.
Next slide.
I want to mention. we would have education quarter of the jail and any persons who
were able to go for classification could go into that classroom from different housing units. Because of the staffing what we
have now, is we have the city college class happen in one unit. So it reduces the number that it can go.
But it is happening.
We also have a collaboration
with stanford university.
There is one currently happening at two housing units.
And I want today mention the collaboration wlt san francisco
library. They're an amazing partner, they distributed books so they go to the jails every week.
They also, one of the liberians does a trans representation in
media group that is in our tgn
housing unit."
2022-11-04,"okay, so out of respect for MR. Rosenthal and MR. Eure, I
would like to try and if that does not work, maybe tell them that we'll delay.
I will try to do a conference
call and then we'll come back."
2022-11-04,thank you.
2022-11-04,"hi I'm going to try a
conference call with you and
DR. Rosenthal.
Ob, we're going to try this by
phone, we don't want you to have you, just know that we MAY
have to continue with this some
other day.
Are you both there?"
2022-11-04,"yes, richard is here."
2022-11-04,and phil is here as well.
2022-11-04,okay. Is this loud enough for us to continue?
2022-11-04,yeah.
2022-11-04,I can hear you.
2022-11-04,that's can they hear us?
2022-11-04,can you hear us?
2022-11-04,"I can hear you, yes."
2022-11-04,"okay, I think, you were
asking a question?"
2022-11-04,"yeah, thank you both for
being with us in this era of
technology that we're still
sorting out and figuring out
our se.Z I want today thank DR. Rosenthal for sharing all the things that you shared on what
it takes to sustain and
maintain was definitely heard, taking great care and who he is
that we bring on as a ig, not
shying away from experts and
being flexible as a body was take great away. And then when I began to share with philip, what I wanted hear
was just since you were the
first ig at nypd, what are, as a self-reflection piece.
What are some things that you would share with incoming ig knowing that you were in the
role with the things you know now versus whether you came in as one. And also being able to hear
from you both, just even and DR. Rosenthal you shared some things.
But maybe a little bit more on
advise for a new oversight body
that is now charge and responsible for working through bringing on this new ig?
Maybe outside of some of the things that were recently
shared?"
2022-11-04,"yes, can you hear me okay now?"
2022-11-04,yes.
2022-11-04,"so in terms of things that I
would share, having started and things to keep in mind for the
new ig and for the board,
whoever you hire is going to
have to be nimble and we can
use a long list of adjectives that describe what you need in the ig. There is a lot of stakeholders within the police department
not just police officials and
executive staff but the police
union and other city agencies, corporation council the city attorney's office and the
mayor's office sometimes.
And of course the community which is diverse and sprawling and in the city such as san francisco and new york.
You need somebody with a people skills to manage those relationship. It's not easy, these are tough
jobs. But those relationships need minding.
And key to that is hiring a
good staff, whether it's the ig or people immediately under the
ig, I would argue in some agencies, most agency right side important and the second in command, the heads of the different units in the oversight entity.
You know, whether it be the head of the investigation and
head of policy units.
Those people need the substance
and knowledge, they're charged
with and having familiarity with engagement and police reform issues. But they need people skills too. And I would just, as board
members, even though it will be
the ig's duty to hire people
under them, the board members
will want to pay close
attention from them."
2022-11-04,absolutely.
2022-11-04,I can go on and on but those are things to focus on.
2022-11-04,"I think you hit on the
question for me."
2022-11-04,"the record should reflect
that member palmer joined the
meeting at 5:05 P.M.
We're hearing from DR. Rosenthal and phil eure and they're speaking about best
practices for recruiting and selecting an inspector general
and for establishing an entity.
So we had technical problem
with the webex feed so we're using a cell phone and they're
taking questions. So other, do other board
members have questions?
One question I have is the
issue of establishing the
knowledge skills and abilities
for recruiting the head of an
oversight entity. Here it's called an inspect or general. What do you see as the
challenges there?
And advise you have?"
2022-11-04,"so this is richard rosenthal.
I want to understand what you're asking, it seems how do
you come up with, in essence
the job description and the knowledge skills and abilities skills to do the job?
A good news a lot of agencies
have already done that. And frankly, inspect or general's office would be a
good start.
But take a look at what they've
got and among you, is a commission that has to figure out what is most important to you and make it your own.
So I would be taking, I would be asking the recruitor or
your staff to identify some
agencies and obtain the job
recruitment, they all have them.
or the inspect or lapd
inspector another good one. And frankly between those
three, I think you would find enough example that you would
be able to craft your own job announcement and description that would be really affective."
2022-11-04,"thank you. And DR. Rosenthal, when you and
I talked earlier this week or last week, you were relating about the recruitment, that you participated for the state of
washington, I think it's an independent investigation
bureau.
And the difficulty of finding
qualified applicants and needing to look in unconventional placed something to that affect?"
2022-11-04,"yeah, now the washington
office is a little unique in
the united states. They're conducting criminal
investigations that police uses a deadly force throughout the
whole state. It's the only type that sticks
to the type in the U.S. And modeled on the canadian mold.
We spent, we used a recruiter
and we also spent a lot of time shaking trees trying to find
people.
We actually found an excellent
director who was a judge but it
was by happenstance. One of the key points is often
the people who are the most qualified for these positions are not necessarily even looking for a job. They need to be reached out.
They need to know that the job
is out there and know that they are potentially, you have an
interest in them so that's where a recruiter aggressive recruiter is an interesting thing to have.
I have not aware until phil
rementioned, it sounds like the new york mayor's office reached out to him as a head of washington dc. And that's the thing that needs to be done.
We found our director because I
ended up speaking to the director in maryland and this individual called him and found out that he was interested. So it's things like that it's a
lot of networking, it's a lot
of searching, a lot of candidates."
2022-11-04,"this is phil, great
suggestion, this is phil just adding an a quick additional suggestion.
There is a conference, you're not going to wait until the next conference to network.
But I heard about the new york job also at a aco conference.
Even though they're not going to wait until next SEPTEMBER's conference to start shaking the trees for your ig. You should consider reaching
out to some of the board members of naco and others in
the organization.
As or certainly the executive recruitment firm, and perhaps they're already do this sort of
thing."
2022-11-04,"thank you, another question
I have is you were asked about the time frame could you each
if you recall give us the time frame for the other
informations?  -- positions and whether that
was handled to a recruitment
firm or through internally through a city or community's
department of human resources?"
2022-11-04,"this is going back more than
20 years and I want to say that
I'm not putting up the hiring practices used by washington or
new york as best practices
necessarily but the time frame
to answer your question, I
believe I got an offer in, I'm sorry, started off, so I'm a little hazy on the exact month.
But I want to say that it was
nine months for from me applying to when I started off
the agency, that was a three quarters of near easily maybe off a month or two.
And there was a lot of pressure
because of I'll be honest on
this, the board took their time and in getting hiring process up and running.
So a lot of time was spent as they were getting themselves together.
And once they hired me, it was, hurry up and open up this
agency.
So, short, based on the -- but,
and there is plenty for the
your board to busy themselves with in this process and doing
other things.
You should, not take a long amount of time but recognize
that this could take four or
five months or longer."
2022-11-04,"and DR. Rosenthal your
experiences?"
2022-11-04,"well very similar, again
going back to 20 years is a
little too far in portland.
Friends new about it from -- L.A.
Mine generally took 6 to 9
months on the time from the
recruitment until I joined the
office in portland and denver
and even british columbia. One really important thing to
point out is that, of the independent critical
investigation axes and that's, I studied them globally and
every one of them had huge challenges and start up. And the idea was, it was very
much this thing of they hire
somebody and they know, it was, they hire somebody and they immediately wanted that person
to start. So in british columbia, we
started within six months and we were not ready.
And the result was very bad poor start up for the first two to three years of the organization.
And so, if you have an agency like you're trying to create,
which is to be competent thorough investigations, it takes more time to start those up. You know, have to have policies and procedures in place.
You have to be of hired
qualified people.
And so frankly, the only organization that was
successful and start up was manitoba of all places because
it took them a year to hire
their director and gave the director two years to get
started.
So in washington, the director finally got hired, it took us
trying to remember, I think we started the process in OCTOBER of NOVEMBER, we did not get the
director on board until JULY.
And now he's saying the soonest
he can start is it in JANUARY.
And one big issue frankly, is finding a good candidate is salary.
You know, you get what you pay for, does apply here.
So a lot of places for example, I know boisei idaho, for years and years tried to hire somebody but they simply were
not offering a living wage or appropriate wage and that
happened in lots of cities.
You really want to make sure
that the salary is comiss rate
with the responsibilities and that will bring potentially
good candidates in."
2022-11-04,"anymore questions, hearing none, thank you for being here.
And our apologies for the technical difficulties. Good night.
Thank you. At this point, we'll take
public comment on this item?"
2022-11-04,"we're unable to take public
comment web ex is not working. And they're not answering the
phone."
2022-11-04,"does that mean that member a of public would be unable to
call in the phone.
Let's wait until the city attorney clark returns and get her advise about this issue.
Thank you, dan. ."
2022-11-04,"okay.
Sure. I was wondering whether one of
the other slots that you had indicated sf gov. Tv was open
and I think it was."
2022-11-04,"I think it was the second tuesday if you have those, that
document?"
2022-11-04,"preference, it does not have
to be on sf gov., but it does

to call in, you did but now we get to see your beautiful bright
smiling faces and now if you
would like to do introductions, you can. I'll give it over to member carrion."
2022-09-26,"it's an honor to be here and serve and be present and really
talk about the things that we can do to improve our sheriff's
department and really facilitate transparency and accountability.
I'm very excited to be able to
lend my expertise as well as to provide you know, clear woman of
color representation on this board and be active in those communities and thank you all so
much and I'm looking forward to working with each of you to do important work."
2022-09-26,"likewise, thank you so much
for being here, member carrion. Member palmer."
2022-09-26,"hello, my name is william palmer. It's good to be here and this is a surreal moment. Not
too long ago I was sitting on a bunk. [Laughter] And I could never imagine this
in a million years but I would love to give my expertise as
knowing the system from the
inside out, working closely with
the sheriff's department on the inside and the outside. And make
sure that we have an oversight
board that makes our city safe and secure and all representatives are represented fairly."
2022-09-26,"I appreciate that, member palmer and looking forward to
leaning in with you on that area
of expertise. So, with that, my
fellow colleagues, you got the opportunity to speak last month so we'll open things up for public comment before we move on to the next line item."
2022-09-26,"for members of the public,
you MAY view this meeting on web x on cable channel 26. At this time, the public is welcome to
address the board for up to two minutes online item one. Comments are opportunities to speak during the public comment period are available for members
of the public who are present by
lining up at the podium or those
not present by calling by phone,
calling 4156550001 tell and
access code, 24946776879 and

Members of the public MAY stay

back into the queue to speak on
another line item. It -- it looks like we have no public comment."
2022-09-26,"thank you, dan. Welcome again member carrion and member
palmer. Let's go to the next line item, please."
2022-09-26,"PRESIDENT, did you say you wanted to move line 7 up?"
2022-09-26,correct.
2022-09-26,"calling line item no. Two, nomination and election of officers (Discussion and possible action item) Further discussion and possible election of officers to preside over the board."
2022-09-26,"and thank you for voting me as a pro tem and it was a conversation we had last month
and we want to wait until we
have all members here in order
to officially do things the
right way so are there
nominations for the presidency?"
2022-09-26,"before we move to the nominations, is it possible to
kind of get a roll call of who
is running for each office, um, position and why? I know we did
it over e-mail but it's helpful to refresh."
2022-09-26,"is that something we can do,
noeks that want to -- folks that want to -- there's nominations made and those can give --"
2022-09-26,"yes, the way it works when
you don't have anything set out
in your rules, typically what bodies do is they first take public comment on the agenda item."
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,"this is not how you have to do it but how it's often done. Then the presiding officer request nomination from the office from the members and you
don't need a second. When no additional nominations are offered, the presiding officer closes the nomination and then the commission votes on the nominations in the order in
which they were received and the first candidate to receive a majority of the votes is elected to the office but there's nothing that prevents you from
taking a couple of minutes and expressing your interest. I
think that's what I'm hearing, people can say whether they are interested and I don't see why you can't do that."
2022-09-26,"absolutely. So, we'll take
comments from any members who
are interested in the presidency. The floor is open.
Member wetchter"
2022-09-26,"yes, thank you. I had, I had
a short blurb five weeks ago as my interest, as many of you
know, I have worked in the field for oversight for a long time
and a campaign for the creation
of san francisco's office of citizen's comment and now the
police accountability and I
worked there from 1983 to 1984 and returned and worked there for almost 19 years and I worked
for an investigator for 43 years in the criminal legal department for most of that time. Oversight is the great passion of my
professional life. It's what I dedicated a tremendous amount of
my time and energy to, not just in my paid work but through
volunteer work for the national association for civilian oversight of law enforcement. I served on their board of directors for 7 years. Been involved with the organization for 20 years and at their meeting two weeks ago, was elected again to their board, so
I'm continuing to make
contributions to that. I'm
seeking presidency for the same reason. I worked on a small crafted language of the charter
amend; campaigned for its
passage and then applied for a board of supervisors appointment because this is incredibly important work to me much it's
the main focus of my life and I
think given my experiences and knowledge in this particular
area, I can be most useful to this board in the position of PRESIDENT Particularly during
its formative first year when it
will make some critical
decisions appointing an inspector general and establishing oversight for the
sheriff's department. I'm someone who values collaboration
more than hierarchy and that's
why the draft rules of order, I
sent dan, which I think you
have, the responsibility of setting the agenda should be collaborative between the
PRESIDENT And vice-PRESIDENT And
you want to bring in many voices as possible. I think the strength of any organization, any team and I think we can look
at this as a team, I hope, is
the diversity of the experiences
and perspectives of its members
and we have tremendous diversity in that area and I'm very, very proud of that. So I want to bring that out as much as
possible, be as inclusive as
possible, share as much as
possible and that's reflected in
the fact that, I asked dan to
send you information about oversight about the opportunity to apply for the scholarship to
:   Conference
which julie did apply for and I
was happy to see her at the conference and variance your
events and oversight so I want
to bring that -- bring in sharing that collaboration in that position. So that's why I'm seeking that."
2022-09-26,"thank you for that member wetchter. My other colleagues, the floor is open."
2022-09-26,"thank you, commissioner
brookter. I too, have put my
name in as PRESIDENT. I most
recently served for 12 years as a commissioner for the san francisco commission on the
status of women. I'm a fourth generation san franciscan and because of that, I'm very
immersed in the community and I believe in community collaborations, community hearings. On the commission, on
the status of women, we did work
with the criminal justice system
and also very closely with the
sheriff's department, adult probation and I'm particularly proud of the rally family
visitation services that was
promoted through the san francis memorial hospital and I was on the bore of saint francis for
nine years but that encourages relationships with fathers who
MAY have been incarcerated
because of domestic violence and encourage relationships with their children. And we put
together a lot of reports, so
dashboards and data, my academic
training is at the mathematician under graduate from uc berkeley
and pure math statistics that
will masters and apply mathematics of -- so I bring a
lot of diverse experiences,
academic ly and I'm familiar with the ""brown act"" and sunshine ordinance so I believe
in collaboration but I want to make sure that we remember that
we act as an entire body and
that means that no individual
commissioner goes out to do
things that might mistakenly be
representative of the entire
commission without acknowledging the commission. I think it's important when we are establishing the inspector
general position that we do have some input from the community
but also it's an unbiased means
of doing so. I was glad to go to
the conference and I was glad to
see director henderson and am I
didn't expect to see there. I
served for almost that years on
the california democratic party
executive board. I'm still a
lead cochair of the pot from
committee. I'm proud of the work
we have did especially with our
criminal justice plank and doug
case who served with nackle for
a while, and he's on the san diego police commission and he's
my designee for the criminal justice plank chair so we've worked very collaboratively, the
most important thing we tried to
eliminate choke holds and I think we've always been
:   When the pot from committee because when we put something in the pot form,
that means it actually becomes
law or it goes to the ballot box. I also am active with the
asian national pacific bar and I
have been on the civil rights bar and the asian commission bar so I think it brings a lot of
areas of expertise as well as
collaboration within the community, so thank you very much for your consideration."
2022-09-26,"no, thank you. Any other colleagues? Seeing none, I want to thank both for your
commitment to the city and county of san francisco, to this oversight board and I think you both bring a wealth of knowledge
so I think with dan, we can go ahead and open it up to public comment for the two individuals
that have put their name in a hat for presidency."
2022-09-26,"thank you, PRESIDENT Brookter. For members of the public who would like to make public comment online item no. Two, if you're present, please
line up at the podium.
Otherwise, please call
415-655-0001 and enter access
code, 24946776879. Press three
to raise your hand to be added
to the queue. We have no public comment."
2022-09-26,"all right, thank you for that
dan. Seeing that, we have two names of the individuals who put
their name in the hat. Gena, how do we need to --"
2022-09-26,someone needs to make a motion.

2022-09-26,"make a motion, okay. So

2022-09-26,so then we go to your vote. is there other nominations that need to be made --
2022-09-26,"you would vote in the order
in which the nominations are
received and the first person that gets four votes
:  ."
2022-09-26,okay. Any other nominations?
2022-09-26,I like to nominate julie soo for nomination?
2022-09-26,"are we doing vice-PRESIDENT
And PRESIDENT? Oh, we were
doing PRESIDENT First and then
vice-PRESIDENT. My apologies,
colleagues on that. There's two nominations. Two motions. One for member wetchter and one for
member soo. I'm going to the vote on member wetchter."
2022-09-26,I believe there's a point of clarification. I believe the second motion was for vice-PRESIDENT For soo.
2022-09-26,is that what it was michael?
2022-09-26,I was nominating board member soo for vice-PRESIDENT.
2022-09-26,"for vice-PRESIDENT, okay. I didn't hear that."

in the six of you and I'll do my
best to live up to the expectation of this office both

2022-09-26,"oh, yes."
2022-09-26,it's okay.
2022-09-26,we call nominations for vice-PRESIDENT.
2022-09-26,"I guess we'll hear from
anybody that wants to be a
vice-PRESIDENT First, right?
So, board member palmer and I
would like to be nominated for
vice-PRESIDENT. As 17 I was incarcerated in riverside and
they decided to say I was amenable and I was ay literate dry belt and I knew education
was my key to not only freedom but rough return to the
character to which my family
raised me to be so at age 45 I
saw myself going to die in f-I
didn't get out of prison and I studied law from the great men who fought for other people's freedom. I was successful in gaining my freedom and changed
the sb260 laws for youth offenders and I released myself
and hundreds of others who followed behind me before the
board parole hearing decided to
create another regulations to end that. I came out of san
francisco to go to the
california supreme court to rule
that my constitution punishment,
22 of my 31 said that I said
that I shouldn't be on parole.
They decided that's not the answer but they could never send me back to prison on that
number. I thought that was successful. So I joined san
francisco jail justice coalition, worked closely with
sheriff moto and closing down
jails and giving out phone calls so people can keep in touch with their family and giving their care packages when they came in so they can have dignity and that's when I got into really
loving my city and the type of progress we can make when we
come together. I also was appointed to the san francisco reentry council at the cindy
commission because I wanted to
make sure no more william
palmers or they called me little
billy would be sent to prison for life or adult sent to prison
and that's a work in progress. I
started life after next
nonprofit because of my reentry
because of the patrol department
was rougher than my prison stand
and my officer put me in jail
three tiles to ruin my supreme
court hearing and I told him I
loved him and he was doing what
he was supposed to do and he
disappeared a couple of months
later no longer being a patrol
agent. I have been both sides and they are both ugly and I
have seen the bars and I have seen men and women dedicated to
making changes and I support that. I support the heating of
the disease policies that have
been in place to put black and brown people behind bars and that work is still steadily
needed to be looked at and addressed but I've also been a part of the process to remove
bad apples and to make sure that they no longer dishonor the PRESIDENT Of star which comes
from the arabic word in my
religious beliefs islam meaning
honorable. So as long as you're honoring that badge, I'm on your side. But when you dishonor that
badge, then you have to come see
me."
2022-09-26,"and is there anyone else
interested in the position of vice-PRESIDENT?"
2022-09-26,"yes. Thank you so much,
everyone. My name is xiochitl
carrion and you MAY have known
my work as a prosecutor and I'm here because I have been a
victim of crime. I'm here
because as a three-year-old
child, my mother was murdered by
my father and that pain and that
suffering really showed me very
early on the injustice in the
world. I lived through these
experiences of not only having
to work through criminal justice
systems of having to navigate
adult, basically, in all of my
life of coming from a place as a
we're latina, coming from a
place of the extreme poverty,
coming from a place of abuse and
learning that justice is around
the corner. And it's around the corner if people are able to
come together and work together
in a meaningful way. My life
experience is something of a
horror story and I come before you a completely different
person, not based solely on my
actions but on the actions of
community and on the actions of
social justice leaders of women,
of queers and people who don't
get to sit at this table. As
much I have accolades and I have gotten those now, I'm currently on the california law commission
where I assist the california legislature in changing our laws. This is my second nomination from a different
governor. I've been in over 30
plus leadership positions but it
comes from this place, it comes
from this place of recognizing
that victims need to be
considered because the rlt after
as a past prosecutor, I very
early learned on that victims
without justice become defends
and we need to address how victims are -- defendants and we
need to address how victims are treated and sometimes the victims are those in our criminal justice system as well.
As a pro cute cuter, I was in the independent investigation
bureau and I delve into thorough
detail of the policies and regulations of what the sheriff
here does here in san francisco.
I've had the opportunity to look
at misconduct and see how there were people who should not have
held that bench, that acts where
the misconduct that shouldn't have been representative of the
people that are meant to keep us
safe. I'm here as a past
litigator. I've been in tries.
I've been in transactional work
as both a civil attorney now and
now a corporate attorney where I
assist in building community
between so many folks that have
pain and there is so much pain
due to the lack of transparency and the lack of people being
able to set aside maybe their
egos and say, we are going to
work together to make this the
best possible institution that
we have. So, I'm here to you as a vice-PRESIDENT Because I care about san francisco. I live in the community. My family is
here. My wife is here, my kids,
so we live in selma. And we're in it. You're not going to see
somebody who is going to be
coming out and just completely detached from community because I want to show that it's not only all of my work in nonprofits because I have done
it all from taking out trashes
to leading organizations to whatever needs to get done but that's what it takes, it takes
someone who is able to work with
every single person and I use my personal experience and my fuel
and I buffered that with my
education with my law degree,
with study chica studies, lgbt
studies and labor in the
workplace. By being there and representing domestic violence
victims when I was a prosecutor and also by making sure that
when I was a prosecutor and
there was foul play I dismissed appropriate cases and you look
at the cases and you looked at
the facts and you saw, was there probable cause, was there an
error and you held the line for justice. And that's something
i'm very proud of. I'm eager to
serve in this capacity to share my skill sets that come from
personal experience of coming
from where I come from and you
know, making from the bottom now we're here and I'm very excited to be able to share that with you and hopefully bring a
different perspective, a perspective that many times is
not heard, so I thank you all for your time and I hope that
I'm able to use this expertise
in a meaningful and thoughtful
and pragmatic way, thank you."
2022-09-26,"anyone else interested in declaring? And I'm sorry, do we
take public comment now or after
we have nominations?"
2022-09-26,[Mic is off]
2022-09-26,technically you already had public comment on this item so you're not required to do it but it would be nice maybe to offer it.

2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"and I just like to say I
really look forward to working
with you. I want to say something personal, I have read
your biography and know about your experience in community
involvement and I'm touched by
your personal story and members
on this board have similar
compelling stories of overcoming obstacles and tragedies and I'm
proud to be serving alongside
with people who have surmounted
those obstacles and brought a
sense of compassion and caring for their communities, a sense
of public service, I think going
through those sorts of -- being wounded by life gives you a different perspective that I
think is very valuable and so again I thank you for the candor
for speaking about that and I
salute your life surrender mounting what is a horrible start of life."
2022-09-26,"should we go through roll
call just so it's on the record."

2022-09-26,"I believe the next item on
the agenda, number four, the
original agenda is [Reading item
4]"
2022-09-26,"good afternoon, good evening, PRESIDENT Wetchter, members of
the member. Kate howard, I'm the director of the department of
human resources. I'm here to to talk with you about the
important task you have in front
of you to recruit and select the
first inspector general for this department. And to offer d hr's
support and assistance along the way. I'm going to review some of
the resources that are available to you that we can offer and then ask for your direction
about how you would like to proceed. I have a brief
presentation that I would like
to go through now. So if you
know, your role is to conduct a recruitment process which will
identify candidates who could serve in this important role to conduct interviews and evaluate
the qualifications of those
candidates and then to make a determination together about who
you have identified as the best
candidate for the role and
select a new inspector general.
D hr can support you in two ways
in this recruitment. As the city
central human resources
department, we can conduct the recruitment on your behalf, so
we can provide an analyst who will work with the commission to develop a job profile and
announcement and then conduct
the recruitment or we can bring one of our pre qualified
executive recruitment firms to
work with you. Most commissions do choose to work with an
executive recruiter. I think
that's largely because of their wide public sector networks, because of their their focus on working directly with the
commission. They are not
distracted by supporting another
department and they are really expert in maintaining
confidentiality for the
candidates in the process whether it's just at the kind of initial interest phase or whether it's later on down the process so I think that's a
reason folks choose to work with
a recruiter. Typically, working
with a recruiter once a commission has selected the firm
that they wish to work with, it
takes about 16 weeks is the
timeline they typically propose. We do have five recruitment
firms in our pre qualified pool
so it's relatively quick to get one of those firms engaged to
work with you. So if you choose
to do that. Most, whether you
work with dhr or one of our firms, the process that you'll go through as the commission is
going to be similar to what is here in front of you, so you'll determine whether you wish to work with a recruiter with us.
If you wish to work with a
recruiter, you'll request
proposals from that group of firms and they have gone through
the rfp and are pre qualified and we'll go to them and say
dear pool of recruiters and we
have a great opportunity for the recruiting of inspector general and are you interested in
working with the commission in supporting them in that recruitment and they will
provide a written proposal that details timeline and their
approach and their approach to
including candidates from
diverse backgrounds and a timeline cost. You would then
have an opportunity to review
those proposals and make a selection about which of them I wish to move forward. Once we get to this next stage, that's where you'll be working more
closely directly with your recruiter. The first step is really to prepare the job description. And I have that
here listed as candidate profile
for recruitment but that's really about you all making clear what are the qualities
that you're looking for in a new
inspector general? They will
also, a recruiter can also work
with you to solicit input from stakeholders about some of the qualities or characteristics that the community or other stakeholders might be interested
in should you want them to do
that. Once the job description is finalized and they will bring that in front of you and that's
the final profile you would like
to move forward with and they'll do recruitment and outreach to
identify candidates for the
role. Typically, after about,
typically after three to four
weeks, recruitment firm will
come back to the commission or
to the PRESIDENT And let that --
let folks know how the
recruitment is going? Should we continue to advertise it or
ready to close it and bring the commission a list of candidates. They would present those candidates to you in a closed session, so you all would have
the opportunity to review the
full set of applicants as well
as additional materials that
they would have provided to the recruiter and then together you would make a decision about whom
you wished to interview. The
recruiter would support you in building out the questions for
interview and managing the
:   Ter view pro --  managing the interview process and at the end of the process, the commission would let the recruiter and dhr know which candidate you wanted to move
forward with and we would work
together to make an offer to the candidate and d hr makes all
salary offers to all department
heads. And that's pretty much
the process. As I've mentioned, we have a list of five pre
qualified recruitment firms
that's available to you. And we
can work in partnership, should you choose to work with a
recruitment firm, we'll work in partnership with them and the
commission PRESIDENT To prepare
items to bring in front of the
commission on whatever timeline
you would want to bring those.
I'm happy, so the next steps, if you wanted to move forward with
a firm, would request the proposals and we would bring
back -- bring those back to you
for review and decisions. And that is basically my presentation. I'm happy to
answer any questions you MAY
have regarding the process,
dhr's role to support you or any
other matters that I can try and answer."
2022-09-26,thank you. Do any board members have questions?
2022-09-26,"yes. I have a couple of
questions, so I'll ask the first
one. Is the timeline different between -- is there a
significant timeline difference
between using dhr and working
with one of these executive firms?"
2022-09-26,"it probably be quicker to
work with an executive recruiter. Mostly because we
have not set aside time in our own work plan to dedicate to this recruitment. Of course, if
you should want us to do it, we
will make time."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I saw that it takes 16 weeks
total, is that from start of when executive or maybe dhr starts the process so when we hire the candidate?"
2022-09-26,"typically, recruitment firms will propose between a 14 and
16-week timeline for the recruitment process from the
date that they have their first meeting with the commission
until the commission is ready to
make an offer. Of course, that
always depends on the commissions' availability to
review and evaluate candidates
and schedule interviews and any
other scheduling issues like holidays, for example, can
sometimes have an affect on candidate availability as well as commissioner availability,
but in general, four to six months for recruitment is typical."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"commission, board member soo?"
2022-09-26,"thank you. Thanks, kate. The last time we worked together was on the executive director for
the department on the status of women. I just wanted to know
current cost for using a recruiter?"
2022-09-26,"each recruiter will propose
their own pricing based on, you
know, their, whatever factors
they want to consider. What I have been seeing is between 30
and $50,000 for a recruitment."
2022-09-26,"and as a follow up to it, I believe the salary has already
been set through the civil service commission if I'm not mistaken, right this"
2022-09-26,"the salaries for department
heads are set typically through
a process where dhr and we allocate department heads to
different classifications. This
department head has been levelled at the department head
one level and the salaries do
have standard ranges associated with them. There's a base compensation rate and there are extended ranges of available for
recruitment or retention needs."
2022-09-26,"okay. And then if we were to
go beyond the base, what would be the process?"
2022-09-26,"so, typically, in those kinds
of salary negotiations, we --  dhr and I suspect you as the commission would want to nope the candidates understand the
salary range prior to applying
and so the recruiter would
provide that information to the candidate, if the commission or
if the selected candidate, like, say they would not accept an
offer unless the salary were
higher, then dhr would work with the candidate to determine
whether we can meet their salary
expectations. You know, the range for example for department
-- the o961, department head
one, the base level goes up to
$193,000 but the extended ranges
go first, in the first extended
range to $224,000 and the second
extended range is used rarely but available for unusual
circumstances up to $235,000."
2022-09-26,"and then one final question
and I don't know maybe city
attorney clarke, you might
answer this. If we are presented
with candidates who we know
personally, is there a process
where we would need to recuse ourselves?"
2022-09-26,"I'm not sure. I haven't been asked that question before but I
can look into it and let you know."
2022-09-26,"okay, thank you."
2022-09-26,"yes, member nguyen?"
2022-09-26,"regarding the rsf, what's the recruitment firm vex?"
2022-09-26,"typically and I would welcome
your input about how you would
like to evaluate those firms.
Typically, we ask them to tell
us their timeline, tell us their pricing, to tell us similar recruitments that they MAY have
done in the past, so do they
have, in this case, other experience recruiting for
oversight bodies, would be a
good comparable? And then
finally, what other recruitments
have they done for the city and county? We always ask them to
provide their approach to
recruiting a diverse talent pool, so that the commission has
the widest range of candidates
to pull from and we ask them to provide some specific examples and not just say we recruit from diverse job boards but we want
to know, okay, who are you going to outreach to? How are you going to conduct that outreach
to bring forth the most diverse
and most well qualified talent?"
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,other questions?
2022-09-26,"yes, follow up. For dhr, if
we used dhr, is there a cost needed to come out of the budget?"
2022-09-26,"we would charge you for it. I would have to just do an estimate based on the total number of hours that an analyst
would be assigned to the work."
2022-09-26,"do you have an idea and I understand that the estimate, is it 30 to 50k because I know we're going to be talking about the budget, so it would be
interesting to find out what
that would look like in comparison?"
2022-09-26,"I don't know off the top of
my head. We have not conducted a recruitment in-house for department head in a number of
years and so I would have to go
back and look at an example from
several years ago to use as a comp."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I have a couple of questions.
So, I've looked at the job description for 961 department
head one, I see this position as
being somewhat unique, maybe not
falling into the preestablished
categories. If we wanted a unique position description
established for inspector general recognizing that it
differs from all the other
department heads and this
doesn't doesn't exist, whoever
fills -- this department doesn't exist and whoever is in this department is creating it from
the ground up and wanted the
salary to match salaries of
comparable positions in the bay area and I don't know if
MR. Long gave you the table I
put together. What would be
involved in that process?"
2022-09-26,"thank you for the question,
PRESIDENT Wetchter. So, we have
very few department heads that
are not classified using the department head classification, so I just would want to say that
at the outset. The majority of those who are not elected
department heads, so it would be
unusual. The process would
involve a discussion between the
commission and dhr's
compensation and classification team, which of course I can --  and support you in that
discussion. We would need to
evaluate really why do you believe this is unique, how
would it help you in terms of recruiting or what's the
rationale for creating a
standalone job classification?
Our goal with having department
heads grouped together is to
provide some sort of a framework
that allows both in terms of compensation, in terms of scope of responsibilities, some
consistent approaches across the city and so that's the -- that's
why we have the approach we have
here. In terms of salary, I did
see the materials that you
provided to me and when I -- so,
typically -- a commission or a
department head or an hr team
can request a salary study or a
salary survey from dhr to
evaluate, is the compensation appropriate for the role so if that's something you would like for us to look at, we're happy
to do so. I would note the
majority of the comparable roles
that you have provided would be
able to be accommodated at the
department head one level based
on the materials that I saw."
2022-09-26,"that brings us up a follow up question. You talked about extending the range, the first
level to 224 and the second level to 235. Could it be advised salary because I'm thinking about drawing applicants who might be
interested in the position and
taking into account what comp positions pay and the cost of san francisco which is unique?"
2022-09-26,"we can work with you and a
recruiter if you choose to do that on kind of how we would
advertise the salary. Typically, what a department head would say, it would provide
the base range and it would say
extended range, extended ranges
are available based on
experience or for recruitment purposes and sometimes that's
made public. Other times the recrueltier has it and he or she
is able to communicate it directly with candidates but we
can certainly talk about that."
2022-09-26,"I know because I see job postings on the nakel website for positions in this field, similar positions and when you
click on the link, it will
usually show you the salary of someone who might be considering
leaving their job in one city
and moving to another comp
decision in another city and they can make a quick judgment
and whether it's a viable position."
2022-09-26,"certainly. This is all public
information. It's not intended
to be hiding anything from an applicant. It is also true that
the extended ranges are there
for very specific purposes. They
are there to address recruitment and retention recruitment that's particular to an issue. They MAY not be available to any candidate but they might be available to a specific
candidate that you wanted to pursue."
2022-09-26,"and how long, and what would
be involved in dhr doing a
salary survey?"
2022-09-26,"hmm.... I don't know the
answer to that off the top of my head. I can provide that
information to the commission's
secretary and to you."
2022-09-26,"PRESIDENT Wetchter, I had a
follow up question, if you don't mind."
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"so this was from attending
the nakel conference and because this is a unique situation and we want to get onboard as soon
as possible, is there a way
perhaps that we work with an
inspector general candidate on a contract basis and so that
person would be on boarded
sooner with the consideration of
possibly a permanent position?"
2022-09-26,hmm....
2022-09-26,"let me finish this off. This
is someone who had been an inspector general before in another jurisdiction."
2022-09-26,"we do have a way to offer a
contract for this role. The
department does have the ability
to select a candidate on a
temporary basis for example. You
could -- you could identify an interim appointment where you
would basically say to a
candidate, we would like you to
come and take this role on on a
temporary basis for the next six months and we'll see where we
are. So, that's a possibility. I don't think there's a
straightforward way to enter
into a contract for the role, though, so I don't think there's a straightforward way to do that."
2022-09-26,"okay. I was thinking if someone were retired who might
want to engage in that role and given that right now I don't
think our it system for the
sheriff's department is up to
par, so we would have to have someone who maybe had experience
considering it systems that
would facilitate the work and also consider personnel within
the inspector general's office, so that's why I was considering possible alternatives."
2022-09-26,"I'm happy to look into it a bit more. I do think the option
you do have in front of you
would be in the case of a
retiree to really collectively
ask that retiree to serve in
this role for a limited
duration. All department heads serve at the will of their
appointing officer including an interim appointee for example. But I'm happy to take that question and if I can come back
to you with a different answer, I'll let you know."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,from wetchter's statement --  thank you for coming out and presenting. You're our first presenter.
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"so I just want to share I
heard member carrion, at least
for me share information on how
much analyst would cost and when we think about budget and I'm
hear from my colleagues, just
really being able to refine and
look at that scope of work.
Within an rfp, I do it all the
time and the scope of work will
ensure we get -- really looking for that right inspector general
and make sure we have the
resources and tools to do so is what I'm hearing from my
colleagues. I just wanted to reiterate that."
2022-09-26,"there are two different firms
that recently did recruitments
in berkeley and sonoma. I don't
know whether either of them are
qualified for the city but I
think the materials I provided had the announcement for berkeley, so firms have gone
through this process recently and I assume are very familiar with the process and with the
field and presumably could move fairly quickly because they
would not have that much of a learning curve."
2022-09-26,"I can share with you the firms that are in our pool
include bob murray and
associates, cps hr, esl,
hawkins, the hawkins firm and ralph anderson."
2022-09-26,"what was the second one after
bob --"
2022-09-26,cpshr.
2022-09-26,cpshr?
2022-09-26,that's right.
2022-09-26,"we received from those five
firms any of their, I guess,
qualifications or resumes so when it comes to oversight
boards and if they've had experience?"
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"and then I think PRESIDENT Wetchter, I wanted to note and
this comes from the nakel conference and I spoke with
someone from the inspector's general office from wisconsin and it's expensive but there's a high cost-of-living and I was
told they used a recruiting firm and after the large ex pen tour
they came up with 20 candidates, however whshgs the madison hr department went through it, it
was whittled down to five, so I
don't know if we would do better
than that with hr itself, so I
just wanted to put that out
there to my colleagues."
2022-09-26,"was there any discussion on
the issue or do we take public comment first, MR. Young?"
2022-09-26,"it's up to you when you take public comment except that you have to take public comment before you take any action or
vote to take any action."
2022-09-26,"okay. Any additional
discussion about the item, about opinions of the various alternatives?"
2022-09-26,"well, I think one of my, as I
have noted, it would be interesting to do a little bit
of number crunching and figure
out from the five currently qualified firms if they are --  some of the ones you have
suggested or not, what the
experience is but we want to
identify our deadlines with our inspector general. I'm concerned
this commission has been delayed
for a significant amount of
time, that doesn't mean that we should rush the process of
course because we want to get
the pest qualified person, so I
would like us to kind of really be thoughtful about some of the
it issues and the actual, like, practical part of getting
somebody on the ground to start
doing this work."
2022-09-26,"um, question. With the approvals, could we ask them for
a timeline for each stage of the process?"
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,"maybe I can add something
else that's helpful. You could
ask me today, kate, will you
please have dhr get proposals for these firms and we want to know timeline, we want to know
about their experience of
oversight boards, we want to know cost? And then while
that's happening in the background, I think your question, commissioner carrion,
regarding what would it cost for dhr to conduct recruitment and what our timing would look like and I can bring the information back at the same time and you would have more complete information about how you wish to go forward, requesting information or requesting many
proposals from our pre qualified
pool doesn't commit the
commission to working with one
of them but it gives information
about what your choices are and which firms are willing to work
with you and what is a good fit.
The other piece I would mention,
some departments find that owe
it happen recentry but it happened in the past, they don't
wish to work with any dhr qualified firms and the challenge is you would have to
run your own solicitation for an
executive recruiter and that
seems maybe a bit challenging for the department, given its
staffing levels at the moment but of course, that's always an option."
2022-09-26,"how much detail could we expect from each of these firms
about how we go about the recruitment? And how they would
seek out applicants and how they would advertise it so we get their understanding of the field
and how large of a net they are
going to cast and how to fine that net is going to be?"
2022-09-26,"typically, the proposals
ranges from eight to ten pages
for each of them. They include a detailed description of their
approach to the work. They typically talk about their
networks and recruitment
strategies within a particular field. They will talk about timeline. They will talk about pricing and talk to you about
the team that they would have
assigned to the project. When we
request responses on your
behalf, we can ask them to be
sure to provide additional
detail about strategies that they would use or that they have
used for recruiting, for
oversight bodies, if that's helpful."
2022-09-26,"would they be looking to us
to provide details about the knowledge, skills and abilities
that would go into the job description or would they make suggestion on their prior experience in the field?"
2022-09-26,"it will probably be a combination of both. They would want to speak with you about
what you think the key, knowledge and skills are and what the priorities of the commission are over the coming
years, three years, so that a
candidate has an idea of what
the role is. They will typically
review any materials regarding the responsibilities as a department and incorporate that into a draft for you all to review and then they would bring that to you and you all would
flush it out or adjust it as appropriate. But that's really the role -- that's why you would
be hiring them to do some of
that work up front and to give
you a draft to respond to."
2022-09-26,"any other comments or
questions? We can move to public comment and perhaps entertain motions. Or do you
want to entertain motions first?"
2022-09-26,[Mic is off]
2022-09-26,why don't we go to public comment.
2022-09-26,"for members of the public who would like to make public
comment online item no. Five,
line up at the podium or call 415-655-0001 and enter access
code 24946776879. Press three to
raise your hand to be added to
the queue. There's no public comment."
2022-09-26,"speaking as a board member
and not PRESIDENT, my thought
would be we ask d  -- ask dhr to seek proposals and come back with the timeline and other
variables and in the meantime we
form a subcommittee to craft the
knowledge and skills and
abilities we want in the candidate for the recruitment or
whoever will do the recruiting
to look for. Any comments or thoughts about that"
2022-09-26,"yes, I definitely would like to see some information that you've mentioned, thank you so
much for providing some more structure and guidance for us as
we create that. That's very helpful. And if we could get
that, what would be the timeline
for receiving that? Would it be possible to turn it around for
our next meeting or is that unrealistic?"
2022-09-26,we had monthly meetings so I  --
2022-09-26,"a month depending on the
timing of your posting of
materials might be possible. I
can work with MR. Leon to make
an effort to have something back
for your OCTOBER meeting. We do like to post these opportunities
with our recruiters for at least
two weeks so they have a
significant of enough time to provide a thorough response and
then we'll need to review them,
make sure they provided a complete package and then
prepare them to bring to the
commission. So, we can work to
have something for the OCTOBER
meeting. But it is a short turnaround."
2022-09-26,when do -- you need a week for posting?
2022-09-26,yeah.
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,three days.
2022-09-26,okay. That should be fine.
2022-09-26,thank you. And for your teams work on this.
2022-09-26,does anyone want to make a motion regarding this matter?
2022-09-26,"regarding the subcommittee, I
would like to --"
2022-09-26,"no, I think -- request with requesting dhr."
2022-09-26,"I move for the requested proposals of both from the five pre qualified materials as we
have discussed here in the --
terms as we discussed in the
session and the dhr turnaround in OCTOBER."
2022-09-26,"that includes the budgeting, right is this"
2022-09-26,"yes, that's inclusive of the budgeting and past experiences
and recruiting for oversight boards."
2022-09-26,"I guess could we put a caveat in there in the consideration of
say a retiree if we wanted to have someone in the interim?
Does that complicate -- I know that adds another wrinkle."
2022-09-26,"I'm happy to bring that back
as part of my report at the next meeting if there's another option I have identified."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I'll second that motion as
amended, if that's considered an amendment."
2022-09-26,"sure. I accept the friendly
amendment. [Chuckle]"
2022-09-26,do we need a roll call vote.
2022-09-26,member afuhaamango?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member brookter?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member carrion?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member palmer?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member nguyen?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member soo?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,PRESIDENT Wetchter?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,"regarding establishing a
subcommittee, do we need a
separate motion for that?"
2022-09-26,I didn't understand it to be a part of the motion.
2022-09-26,pardon me. Does anyone want to make a motion regarding that.
2022-09-26,"I think we want to think twice about a subcommittee. I think there's a lot of
opportunities to create
different subcommittees. I think
based on, I think it would be helpful to receive the information first, to see if all
of the -- all of the board
commissioners want to be part of
that. I don't think because we
are such a small commission, it
might be beneficial for -- and
this is such a critical role, it
MAY be important for us to all
put our input in, so that that's
more my idea rather than
narrowing it down -- whether it
be preparing drafts of volunteer
volunteering to prepare a draft,
that's another thing but creating another layer, we might
not need to do that at this time."
2022-09-26,"what is the typical size of subcommittees, attorney clarke?"
2022-09-26,"it can be anywhere from -- if
you have four and your meeting
is five, so two to three, I guess."
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,"I was going to say I agree
with commissioner carrion. In
the interest of transparency for this first inaugural important hiring decision that we act as an entire body and I don't know
if having a subcommittee is necessary. I was also thinking
that in parallel, as we're doing
a search that we might actually
have some community hearings as to what the community would like
to see in an inspector general,
so that's my other input that we
could do things in parallel."
2022-09-26,"so, commissioners can make
choices about whether they have subcommittees or not, some do
and some do not. Typically, they
want to retain all the decisions regarding reviewing candidates
and interviewing together as a
whole. In terms of public input, I think what you're describing,
commissioner soo is very common,
that a commission would calendar
items requesting public input on the qualities that the
commission should be seeking in
a director or the experience or other kinds of thinks the
commission some take into
account when evaluating candidates and typically the selected recruitment firm can help you with that, depending whether you want to have it kind
of here at a typical commission
meeting or whether you want to
have it out in the community,
you have options for both of those."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I think we would need maybe some language access so it might
be instructed to have something
in the community with particular interpreters or work with the
community groups."
2022-09-26,I don't want to get too premature but there was a motion on the floor.
2022-09-26,"for discussion, if we were to meet in the community as a full
body, we're talking about our OCTOBER meeting or NOVEMBER
meeting and I believe sfgov tv
is not able to broadcast from
remote locations, so I'm -- I
have always strongly supported
community meetings and I went to
the police commission that was
held. Can we hold a community
meeting between now and our next
board meeting to solicit input from our community and report back."
2022-09-26,"I would suggest the entire commission. We're new and it's
important for all communities to
know about us, so and I don't nope that we need to have a whole month in between. I mean,
I'll willing and I know everyone's very busy but I'm willing to have additional
meetings and I don't envision
more than two different sessions on input and we could determine
a location. I know it's harder for our commission secretary to
try to deal with the logistics
but to identify two different
locations and have two different hearings."
2022-09-26,"so, we do have member
carrion's motion still on the floor."
2022-09-26,"yes, so my motion, I believe was already -- it was first and
seconded and we did the roll call."
2022-09-26,correct.
2022-09-26,and --
2022-09-26,there was a call for another motion in the subcommittee.
2022-09-26,"there was another call and my
position is to oppose such a motion."
2022-09-26,"I did make a motion about
that. It was a suggestion, so I
think the discussion really
shows the board -- where I think
:  . So no need for a motion there."
2022-09-26,should we call the question then?
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"I don't think we need to. Well, no. There was no motion
and no second. So we can go to the next line item."
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,did you make a motion about asking dhr to --
2022-09-26,yes. That got approved.
2022-09-26,so we don't have any other motions?
2022-09-26,correct.
2022-09-26,"okay. Okay. Very good. Thank
you for your presentation. So we
can move on to the next item
which on the original agenda was
number five, budget report.
Informational item. Presentation
by the mayor's budget office."
2022-09-26,"that's going to be remote, correct?"
2022-09-26,"oh, yeah."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I'm sorry, could you hear me?"
2022-09-26,"no, we couldn't."
2022-09-26,"apologies for that. Can you
see my screen?"
2022-09-26,not yet.
2022-09-26,dan? Or jaime?
2022-09-26,"no, we can't."
2022-09-26,it says it's being shared.
2022-09-26,can you see it on my end?
2022-09-26,I'm going to share it on my end.
2022-09-26,"algae s e al
-- apologies I'm not here. I just got back from travels and I
didn't want to get you sick so you're with me from my home and in the future I hope to be there
in the future. My name is
camilla and I'm one of the staff of the mayor's budget office and here to talk about your budget, so you have some understanding
going inform the next year what
that is. This in addition to
that, to give you a brief -- go
on to the next slide, a brief
background as to what the budget
cycle is, so you -- for those who haven't work with the city
and familiar with it, we're now
in SEPTEMBER which is the
beginning of what we call
department phase. There are two
things happening and one is city departments, sheriff's department and accountability
included are beginning to think about what their budget ask are
for the next fiscal year so
we're in fiscal year '23 but I'll think about what you want
for fy24 for the next few months
and what our office is doing is understanding the issues and getting a sense of where we might be going and in addition,
trying to understand what the
city's potential deficit are and
surpluses. Nine times out of ten, that's going to be a
deficit. This last year we were
fortunate and had a surplus to
start the budget season. That
deficit leads to staffing
departments reducing budgets year over year mainly because
personnel cost are so high and
they grow year over year without even touching them. And you can understand that makes sense due
to labor negotiations, cost of
benefits going up, things like
that. So, during this time from SEPTEMBER to JANUARY,
departments are developing proposals of what they think they MAY want in a budget and
the mayor's budget office along with the controller an office
are getting a sense of how much
money we might have to spend the upcoming fiscal year. The
mayor's budget office will
present what we call budget instructions in DECEMBER and
those budget instructions are
from the mayor's office to the departments, letting you know how much money we have to spend
and in addition to that, what
the mayor's priorities are and any other recommendations or
request we have for department proposals. Those proposals then
are turned around quite quickly
and sent back to us and the
controller's office in FEBRUARY and at that point we turn to
mayor's phase of the budget and the mayor's department is running closely with the
department team, primarily their finance time, budget team
determine what the needs are of that department and how we can
make sure all of the needs are met and that also all of the mayor's priorities for making
sure the city as a whole and not just department level but as a
whole is running smoothly and that leaves us through the mayor's phase when we present
our budgets to the board on JUNE 1st and then the board of supervisors reviews those
budgets and they make decisions
and changes as they did in your
budget last year to either make reductions or to add back
additional initiatives ever funding so this is the overall budget cycle. There's no need
for you to memorize this but it
gives you a sense of where we
are and when departments are expected to provide their input
and how things will move from
there. You can go to the next
slide. Thank you. So, this is a
very high level overview of your
budget. So it's broken into a way that the budget is divided
:   Division, so the sheriff's department of
accountability is a department. Within that, there are two divisions and there's the office of inspector general and there's
the oversight board. There's
definitely the opportunity for
funds to move around within
these two areas. It is not --
please do not feel that what is
:   Budget can't be shared with the
oversight board. There are
changes in there that can
happen. But primarily the -- how
we have budget setup with any oversight boards or commissions
is their budgets are kept
separately and are often much smaller because it only benefits staff who work with the
commission directly and also the
:   For the commissioners and board members
and I apologize, there's a typo
in here. It's.06, not
.05 million so $60,050,000 for  -- so 60 and 50 million. It could be the recruitment firm you would be hiring to bring on to support
the recruitment of the inspector general. They might be training
organizations, if you need to
have training done through any
sort of new state or federal
legislation that has been put into place and a variety of cost
can go to professional services and contract budget. The
oversight is smaller but within
the oyg salary, we have a chunk
of benefits and salary to pay for staffing and the predominate
amount of staffing and hiring
contracts. The reason that's relatively high is because we think there might be it could have the department might need,
whether that is software to work
with the sheriff's department
or, you know, if there's a new
system of keeping inspector --  investigators notes confidential, whatever that
might be, there's room in there
every year, $300,000 for the
office of the inspector general
to purchase professional
services and contracts and the
:   Budget is small
but this is very average for departments and it's about
$500,000 a year and the work order for other city departments are larger in the first year
because of the recruitment for the inspector general. We added
funds in there for dhr support but that could be used in the
professional services and contracts area. And lastly, in the work offices to other city
departments is the training that
you all received through the
sheriff's department. We can go
on to the next slide, thank you.
So, here you'll see staffing.
This is what was written up in
the charter. Apologies. The inspector general is in there
and 7 investigators which is the amount that's required as of
now. Two senior investigators
and one attorney position which
is a policy attorney position.
It is not a legal recommendations position to make
that distinction. And then the
board members, there's seven of you and it's stipends and
manager assistant and senior
administration analyst. That's
all for my presentation. I'm
happy to answer any questions."
2022-09-26,any questions from board members?
2022-09-26,"yeah. Just one. Just one, thank you for that presentation.
Just to get clarification, back on slide number three and I
wanted to make sure my math is
correct and I'm not a mathematician like councilmember soo.
:  ."
2022-09-26,"absolutely. But on slide three, if we can pull it up,
dan, really quick. I just want to make sure the reference was, this was dollars in the millions, correct?"
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"and so, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly because I heard and if we can pull that up real quick, dan, there was the one section, like
looking at professional services
and contracts and I got an 0.06.
It's $400,000 in terms of salaries and benefits."
2022-09-26,"$6,000,000."
2022-09-26,so that's correct?
2022-09-26,I'm sorry. It's in the second year. It should have been 0.05.
2022-09-26,"got you. Salaries and benefits is correct, that's $400,000"
2022-09-26,"yes, that's for the seven stipends."
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,and then the two full-time salary and benefits.
2022-09-26,"okay. Perfect. I wanted to make sure I was reading that correctly and doing the math
correctly and making sure it was in the millions."
2022-09-26,"who are the two full time
employee for the oversight board listed on that line?"
2022-09-26,"I can get the names for you
but it's a management assistant
and manager analyst. Is len
occupying that. There's a senior
administrative analyst separate from the general inspector's office."
2022-09-26,"the way this was structured,
we assigned the management assistant and senior analyst would work across both because
the board meets once a month and there might be e-mail work involved in that as well but
yes, it is up to your discretion how you and the inspector
general together decide to make that work."
2022-09-26,other questions?
2022-09-26,"will we be receiving and how
will we receive updates as to where we are to the budget and
cost and expenses?"
2022-09-26,"so, I had that happen but
we'll comment -- that will come into life when the inspector general is --"
2022-09-26,"you're muffled, can you repeat that?"
2022-09-26,"of course. That will be up to
the inspector general and
yourselves as you desire how you want to manage the department.
At this point in time, dan is
the only very lucky employee of
the sda and he will be working
with us to manage anything and everything within the department including the finances at the
time. And the budget proposal.
My hope is that he gets some support sooner than later
because it's a great deal of
work but that is the way it had
be set up moving forward, if
that answers your question."
2022-09-26,"yes. To follow up with that, we discussed it's going to take
several months to find our
amazing inspector general that
we will find and hire. In the
meantime, can we receive information as to what the
budget is maybe in the next two
months of what the expenditures have been? I know we've already
spent some of those funds for
staffing, obviously, as well as
for training so just to kind of
keep an eye on that since we
won't have an inspector general for a couple of more months."
2022-09-26,"certainly, one of my colleagues will be happy to provide that information to you
and we certainly will work with dan who is the next one working
with our team to get that information for you as well. At
your request, happy to do that."
2022-09-26,"other questions? I have two
questions. Can we get a breakdown of current
expenditures from both budgets,
the oversight boards budget and
inspector generals budget so far
for this fiscal year, 22-23 fiscal year?"
2022-09-26,you're requesting expenses that have already been made?
2022-09-26,"yeah. And continuing expenses so we can see where we are, how
much has been spent, how much is going to be spent per month at the current rate."
2022-09-26,"yes. I'm happy to work with dan on this if you all would
like to make that request to dan, he and I can work together to get those numbers to you, certainly."
2022-09-26,"okay, thank you. And I had,
I'm looking at the mayor's
budget is 329 where it says
total -- that's 7.7 positions
for fiscal year 21-22 and 13 for
fiscal year 22-23 with a total
personnel budget of $2,920,000.
So, that seems to be higher than
what you just showed us, so --"
2022-09-26,"the mayor's budget does not
include changes that were made by the board of supervisors and
they did make a reduction to
your budget by $500,000 from the
mayor's proposal in salaries and
benefits and that was not positioned but it was attrition
which counts as a position so
you'll see a reduction there. But you have every opportunity
to propose new and growing staff
here on out if your budget proposals."
2022-09-26,"and what responsibilities does this board have regarding
the crafting of the fiscal year
23-24 budget because the circular chart you showed us shows we're partially through
that process and planning for that?"
2022-09-26,"yeah. Attorney clarke, please free to jump in. To my understanding, there's no requirements of you. It will be
up to yourselves and the inspector general when they join
the team and decide how you would like to operate. It is
generally not the commissions or the boards who are responsible
for putting together the budget,
putting together proposals. It's a relationship between
department heads and boards or commissions, whether it's discussion back and forth and what the commission and
commissioners would like to see
in the budget and then some commissions which are -- they
have extensive charter language require budget approval before
the budget is presented to the mayor's office on the due date."
2022-09-26,okay. Just wanted to make sure there's nothing we have upcoming deadlines on.
2022-09-26,all good.
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"anything further? Thank you for the presentation. We'll get
a copy of the powerpoint for our reference?"
2022-09-26,I can send it to you.
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,thank you all very much. Have a great evening.
2022-09-26,I feel better.
2022-09-26,we need to take public comment.
2022-09-26,"for members of the public who would like to make public
comment online item 6, if you're
present please line up at the
podium. Otherwise, please call 415-655-0001 and enter access
code 24966776879, and press
three to raise your hand to be
added to the queue. There's no public comment."
2022-09-26,"I think we can move on to
item no. Five which is the sheriff's chief report. Chief, I
do apologize for you having to wait for so long. Thank you for your patience."
2022-09-26,"that's okay. I'm used to it.
[Laughter] Just for information, I'm chief
richard, chief of staff in the
sheriff's office. We met last
from the last meeting here, you
requested an update on our
:   For
five years so we started from 2017 to now. So, powerpoint
presentation we have here is going to cover the total positions our department budgeted for and the actual
staffing that we have now. In addition to the difference
between authorizing actual
staffing, so.... I'm not a tech guy. Can you help me.
[Laughter] [Laughter] Okay. We're going to start with
the 2017, what we have here. In
2017, we're authorized for 1158
or back then it was 992.5, so the change from that staffing
overall was 165.5. If you look
at the sworn, we're at
85% capacity. Professional
authorize here, we're at 123 and
we want to get 98, I guess it's
more for professional staff,
it's hard to recruit on that
note. In 2017, we had authorized
99 and we had 95.5 cadets employed with us and as we move on to the following years,
you'll see in 2018, our numbers
are a little lower. We changed
156 and our authorized then was
940. So, actual was 824.
Operated at 88%. So, same
thing with the professional who
stays at 76% and cadets are at
90. In 2019, where we authorized
for 1174, we had 995 total employees. If you look at the sworn, we operated at 87%.
Again, the professional staff
remains at 72%. And the cadets
operate, we have at 84% higher.
As we go into 2020, we're
authorized by 1175. Our actual
was 987 total. We had minus 188
employees total. We operated at
sworn at 88 -- 85% and professional at 77% and then
cadets was at 83%. Here's a
difference. This is when covid
kicked in. Authorized for 1191.
Total staff was 927. Total
change from that from the
previous years, 264. If you look
at our staff and sworn, it's
thorded for 793 and down to 744.
Same thing with the professional staff, it has gone lower at
67% and again with cadets at
75%. That's at 2020, the start of the pandemic and everything
going on. Also with the environment that was happening
back then. Our final -- it's much worse. Everything is in
red. We're authorized at 1191.
We have totaling 155. We're at
336 short total. If you look at
sworn, we have authorized 933.
We're down to 675. Again, with
the professionals, 142 authorized. We had more working
at 97. With our cadets, if you
see it's almost half. It's 116
down to 83. We have a graph here
if you need a better look at it
from there. The red -- sworn on
top, if you look at it, it goes
from top from the year 2017 down
to 2022. Same thing representing with the to pro  -- professional
staff and overall staff and we
have sworn from that point on.
That is what we have up-to-date
for now. So, our challenge is right now that we're going through with the training
portion of it, in addition to covid, that affects us and
because of the shortest of staffing and we have to go through mandatory staffing to cover the courts and jails and
everything else. So you can see they are working extra hours to
try and keep the sheriff's
office in operation. What we're
trying to do now is for recruit, we're trying to do aggressive recruitment drive. We're on billboards now. We're doing digital advertising. We're on
the buses, as you can see, if
you drive by and I know it was a billboard and oakland, it says
we're hiring, so we're really
trying to recruit very massively
and this is, you know, we're a part of the makeup of law enforcement. Everyone is having a hard time and other agencies along with ourselves but we did partner up to increase the recruitment drive. We partnered
us with the army, it's called
the pays program and that encompasses, when a military
personnel is ready to get
discharged they can go through the testing process in the last
six months in the military so by
the time hopefully when they are discharged, that we are able to
hire them, provided they pass
all the qualifications. And again, we've been attending job fairs all over the city
including the peninsula, bay area and we've been trying to
recruit massively so that's
where we're at as far as the
recruitment and staffing. Any questions?"
2022-09-26,"have you seen applications as
a bases of the recruitment efforts?"
2022-09-26,"we have been lucky because
the sheriff's office has a
:   Job scope so we're doing better than the
police department as I would
like to say. We average between ten to 20 applicants so we've gone all over trying to push and push and we continue to push. We're trying to encourage to do a collaboration where we're trying to encourage our
employees to be a part of our recruiting program, to promote the department and promote the
office about what the job is so people can hear about it from line staff and everybody else."
2022-09-26,"chief, it wasn't in the slide
but I'm concerned see especially when it comes to our law enforcement agencies, like, how
many folks in the sheriff's department live here in the city
verses outside of the city?"
2022-09-26,"we're, I think we're pretty tough because san francisco is a high cost-of-living."
2022-09-26,of course.
2022-09-26,"I think the majority, it's probably safe to say 70% do not
live in the city compared to the police department, the same thing. There were 70 to 85%,
people do not live in the city
because of the cost of living."
2022-09-26,"it looks like you suffered significant drop in the deputies, personnel involving
custody. How does that compare with the number of individuals and custody over that same five-year period?"
2022-09-26,"we try to keep our numbers
low in custody low. We try to
get it at 800 at most if we can.
Of course, we're trying to alleviate some of the -- the
lock up too by putting on
electronic monitoring. So we're trying to maintain that as much as possible especially too with
the current situation with covid. It's still active so we're requiring that people
still wear their mask and get
tested and everything and not to
mention m-pox so there's a lot of things happening. In relationship with that, it made prisoners -- staffing is low so people are -- our staff is getting burned out because they
have to work sometimes double shifts just to cover it to make
the jails safe and the rest of our programs too."
2022-09-26,"I guess what I'm interested
in is the -- the average daily population, would that be correct term?"
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"the period 2017 to 2022 and
how that corresponds to the staffing because what I have
heard from you and the press is
the amount of mandatory overtime increased dramatically."
2022-09-26,"yes, it has. Like we said, because of the covid situation and everything, we're trying to
keep the numbers down but the staffing still has to be able to
cover all the shifts and everything, so but again, we go
back to covid. We go back to burnout and we go back to people MAY want to seek other careers
in another department, we lose a lot from attrition too. So we're
trying to recruit more to accommodate that. Unfortunately,
it looks like the recruitment doesn't keep up with the attrition."
2022-09-26,"would it be possible for you to get us to the figures on the average daily population during
that same time period so we can compare it with the number of
deputies assigned to the custody
division?"
2022-09-26,"the numbers right now, as you look at it, we're at 673, so we're trying to keep up."
2022-09-26,right.
2022-09-26,"you go and see the population
is bigger than the amount of employees we have. They are in custody. That's why it's mandated in overtime to keep up with this."
2022-09-26,"right. That's the population now but I would like to see what
the population was in 2017,
2018, 2019 and how that compares to the number --"
2022-09-26,I have those figures right now. [Multiple voices]
2022-09-26,for the future --
2022-09-26,I was looking at the staffing you were talking about and not relation to what's happen nothing the population.
2022-09-26,is it possible --
2022-09-26,"we can come back with that number again at the next session but right now, I do not have it."
2022-09-26,"compared to the prior years
at san bruno, do you have the
same number of pods occupied,
more pods occupied or fewer pods
occupied? Because I know each
pod requires two deputies in
that pod and there were two
deputies in each pod?"
2022-09-26,"I have bring someone who is
more familiar with the count in jails because I'm just here reporting the staff mode. I have to bring somebody that's there. You do understand that
I've been with the sheriff's office for two years."
2022-09-26,"and then regarding
recruitment, I know a lot of law
enforcement agencies are also recruiting."
2022-09-26,yeah.
2022-09-26,"I know that many of the individuals, if they decide a career in law enforcement, they will apply to multiple agencies and often take the job that is first offered to them because
they want to start in their career, so what are you doing to
address the timeframe issue of
people who apply and move the
process along?"
2022-09-26,"we're going with the same practice as the police department. They have to go through eight examines and that's a background check and medical and psychological and everything else so they have to
go in steps before we can go on.
We do try to expedite but we
have to be very thorough since
we are given these new employees a great responsibility, so we have to be very, very detailed
as far as what we're doing on that."
2022-09-26,"as you know, I have worked at
dpa so I was aware that sfpd had lateral transfers from other departments."
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"the sheriff's department
getting lateral ral transfers
and how are those handled."
2022-09-26,"some do apply and not as many
as the pd. But we do get a handful and they go through a process. They don't have to go
through the academy but they have to go through the full
course and background and get an
orientation from us to go through that process but the
recruitment drive for laterals
isn't in abundance compared to
someone who want a job freshly as a deputy."
2022-09-26,other questions?
2022-09-26,"I had a couple of questions
and in terms of electronic monitors and can you talk about the challenges and what
personnel is needed as opposed
to being in custody? That's a fixed location but if people
have to go out and monitor the different people, I suspect that
takes more personnel and more hours?"
2022-09-26,"we need more personnel. Right
now we're short staffed in that
unit right now. We're very short
staffed. So we have our deputies
over there working sometimes double shift or because -- we
have to shift them to another unit to work that unit."
2022-09-26,"so at the next meeting, could
you talk about the staffing for that electronic monitoring and
how many people are currently monitored, outreach, maybe?"
2022-09-26,"I don't have that number and
I'll have to bring it back in
terms of electronic monitoring"
2022-09-26,I mean at the next meeting.
2022-09-26,yeah.
2022-09-26,"the other part is in terms of recruitment, it's one thing to recruit. It's a whole another thing for someone to make it
through the entire academy and what is the percentage of people
who tangle out and don't make it
through -- through the academy?"
2022-09-26,"on average, we don't have a
big abundance but usually we see
between six and ten, maybe 15 recruits at one time but the --
knock on wood, we've been having
a success rate where mostly
everyone has passed the --  passed academy and it could be
because we give them a
pre-academy and give them a good pep talk and they can stay the
20 weeks or 28 weeks and which academy they do attend. As far
as percentage wise, if it was going to happen, it's not every
class, maybe one or two MAY not make it or they resign because
they find out the job is not for them."
2022-09-26,"and then does the sheriff's department have something similar to the pal program with
the police department in terms
of working with kind of junior exposure?"
2022-09-26,"we have a junior deputy program. We have a lot of youth
programs we go out there and try and do outreach out there."
2022-09-26,"anything at stones town? I
see them competing at alameda county poster."
2022-09-26,alameda is a big recruiter and sell a lot.
2022-09-26,"anymore questions -- I didn't want to take too much of your
time so I kind of -- we have the
:   You were asking about. We cover custody and that
covers the two months we had in the past two months so far and
to give you the total that we
received in JULY of 2022, if you look at the numbers there and
the red it says JULY 2022, we
had a total of five cases that
overall, three of them -- for if
you look at it, it was crimes
against a person and then we had
one property crime and then
others were just one and so the
total split up was five felonies
actually and go misdemeanors. Three of them were active, still
open for investigation and two
of them are currently closed right now."
2022-09-26,is these cases involving people in custody --
2022-09-26,"people in custody, yes."
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,"and in AUGUST, we had
received 26 cases, if you look
at it, we had -- over here if you look at the colors over
here, 11 felonies and 18 were misdemeanors so again, breaking
it down, 15 was crimes against a
person. We had one property crime. We had three section
crimes and the rest were seven
others. And that MAY be related
to vandalism and if you have not
heard, we had one vandalism case
a few days ago that were -- we had to report because that
person vandalized the water sprinkler and damaged our county
jail three -- county jail one
with the extension amount of money that goes into six figures
we have to do for repairs."
2022-09-26,"do you have figures on
internal investigations of
:   Against deputies?"
2022-09-26,"that's our ia. I would have
to get numbers. We ask for
criminal investigatings not
related to ai. That's why we went with the custody but next
round I can bring our lieutenant
over here to talk about our ai cases."
2022-09-26,"I would be interested in
getting a sense of a number of complaints and disposition and findings and also some figures and I don't know if you can provide this or city attorney can provide these on lawsuits against the sheriff's department and settlements."
2022-09-26,"okay. Again, that would go
with ai and also with our legal
team. And we'll have to discuss that -- we'll lay that out for the next meeting."
2022-09-26,"recognize, we know that a
lawsuit does not mean something happened. The city sometimes happens to settle as a cost saving measure but I think it's useful to get a look at those figures and have a sense --"
2022-09-26,"we'll bring our ai team in
here and explain that to you."
2022-09-26,"sorry. When you say lawsuits
against the city, do you mean in
what time period? So if that's something -- because I had something -- you're talking
about times a deputy or the
department was sued in what period of time?"
2022-09-26,the last five years would be a reasonable period?
2022-09-26,"I think it would be better to
start with the last year and I worked in the past with the
departments and my guess -- I
haven't looked to see what is involved but I would recommend a year."
2022-09-26,okay. I just have no idea what we're talking about.
2022-09-26,I don't either at this point. [Laughter]
2022-09-26,"chief, one thing I would be
interested in, obviously, you
have people on leave, I don't
know how much is for medical
reasons, others -- but I would
be interested in figures on the
number of attacked on deputies."
2022-09-26,I'm seeing you track that --
2022-09-26,you mean deputies on disabilities?
2022-09-26,"actual assaults on deputies by ien
by -- by incarcerated people in the jails."
2022-09-26,we can do that.
2022-09-26,"that's a factor in morale and staffing. We would hope it doesn't happen but unfortunately, I'm certain it does."
2022-09-26,"we had recent cases that it did happen, so.... They are
still being investigated right now."
2022-09-26,"okay. Just in figures and no
details to violate anyone's con
--  confidentiality. Is it increasing overtime and leading
to more adults on deputies?"
2022-09-26,we'll bring that up.
2022-09-26,"okay, thank you."
2022-09-26,"anymore questions related to
this? Okay. So I know you heard
last about our access for
incarcerated and who has access to education and as you all know, hopefully, we have a lot
of programs related to -- that's
in our jails and everything. One
:
Program. I do have the policy related to that each one of you
would like to look at it. I believe it's in your usb drive we gave to you in training so if you don't want one, I'm fine
with that. Would anyone like one
before I move on? Okay. They do
have access. There's a policy
related to it. The criteria is
usually for sentence and non-sentenced inmates in the general population. They are
eligible to apply for five keys.
Again, if I can use a charter
school -- they have to go through an assessment program to try figure out where they can
place them when they go to academics on there. Again, it
doesn't matter about agenda in this city or anything like that. Everybody is eligible and everyone has access to that part
of it. Again, there are rules
that they have to follow, again,
there's not a mandatory where
they can get disqualified or
dismissed but there's guidelines
if they violate policy and they will get reviewed before anything happens on that. If
they cannot finish their five
keys education, there's a post release where they can go out
:   For education after they post for
release. We do offer other programs and there's 13 other programs in the county jail two and three and they have access
to all those programs available
to them. And that concludes my
presentation unless -- unless you've got anymore questions?"
2022-09-26,"anymore questions, board members."
2022-09-26,there's job training as well.
2022-09-26,"there's job training and we're connected to the city college and they help us out too
so we try and expand it and our courses even more.
:   Are we saying the educational programs are
paused because of staffing issues and to what extend?"
2022-09-26,"there was a pause because of
staffing but covid did play a
role in that too, our director
is in charge, alisa riker and
it's not a staffing program and usually it's the first to go so that's we're aggressively are trying to improve the staffing
portion of it right away so we can get the programs and everything back up to par."
2022-09-26,are there educational programs currently taking place in the jail.
2022-09-26,"currently right now, they
are. They have access to it right now."
2022-09-26,"could you describe how --
what that access is and what the programs are?"
2022-09-26,"let me pull it from my notes
here. Currently right now,
besides the five keys program,
they have access to a program
called one family where staff
helps family members of the incarcerated to go and have video visits right now and they
facilitate that. We also have
the public library that deliver
books to the jails on a regular
basis over there. We have access
to -- the city has access to
college classes and there's a
mentoring men's movement. That
group -- they work from jails
and they are available for that.
There is a stanford lecture
portion that we do have. Substance abuse program, violence prevention program,
also we have programs for
veterans. Those just a few I just named."
2022-09-26,are those virtual or any in person?
2022-09-26,"right now, some are in person
and some of them are virtual and
some have been postponed because of staffing."
2022-09-26,"and the ones that have been postponed for staffing, do you have a sense of how many and which ones owes ----"
2022-09-26,I don't have those numbers yet.
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,"do you have a sense when
those ones paused might be resumed?"
2022-09-26,"I can give you more detail in the next round and bring the
person in charge of the program."
2022-09-26,"okay, great. Thank you."
2022-09-26,"just a statement if I could,
PRESIDENT Wetchter. First and foremost, chief chiu, thank you for coming out today. It's an opportunity for us to work through the presentation and
what we want to see from the sheriff's department and just
really want to make sure that you know, as we look item no.
Nine and making sure we
agendized some of the topics for discussion in that section so that folks get the opportunity to bring motion before us, I think that would be good and I want to say thank you."
2022-09-26,"I didn't know if you were
going to leave. I did a tour of
is not bruno before the pilot
program, the crows net program
was implemented and maybe my fellow board members would be interested to see how it works because I have been trying to
visualize it and I have been having a difficult time and I
know no more than three of us can be present at any one place
but MR. Long, we can see if we can schedule that at a convenient time."
2022-09-26,we can work that out. I need to talk to the chief deputy and the captain and give us dates and times and we can arrange it.
2022-09-26,thank you very much. I appreciate that.
2022-09-26,you're welcome.
2022-09-26,"thank you all so much. Also,
I think it's really important to
keep in mind that we have heard how very much understaffed our
sheriff's are, so I think we want to be thoughtful about when we think about the future agenda
items and scheduling as to what
the is the priorities and why we need certain things at certain
times because we want to make sure our deputies are also healthy and working double time and doing all the things, they are members of community and we want them to be, you know, not
on medical leave and what not so
we do greatly appreciate your work and this is a new commission and we'll work with
you to figure out the best way
to facilitate the delivery of
information in a way that is not overburdensome but reasonable in what our action items are and what we tend to do here."
2022-09-26,"I appreciate that, thank you."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,"I think -- I got one more question. What role does the sheriff's department play in
making sure that the courtrooms
are open and available for people to have their
constitutional hearing to a speedy trial?"
2022-09-26,"we work with them, with supervisor roden who tried to push it through. We've been
working on opening the courts in civil courts but we're still
working on that. Again, it goes
back to staffing. And it goes to
public safety and officer safety issue and staff those areas and again, if you look at the numbers, we're down at 600 so
that requires additional staffing to cover those areas.
We are still in the works. We're
still working and corporating
with supervisor roden and that relationship."
2022-09-26,"I was going to add, commissioner palmer, I have been to court watching the last couple of months so people have refused to show up and waive
their right to a speedy trial,
so we also have victims waiting
to be able to confront the
defendants -- and haven't been
able to and I have been to the preliminary hearing for several
cases so that's the issue as
well."
2022-09-26,that's it
2022-09-26,"yes, thank you."
2022-09-26,thank you.
2022-09-26,I guess we'll go to public comment now.
2022-09-26,"for members of the public who would like to make public
comment online item 7, if you're
present, please line up at the
podium. Otherwise, please call 415-655-0001 and enter access
code 24946776879. Press three to
raise your hand to be added to
the queue."
2022-09-26,"thank you board and congratulations to the PRESIDENT
And vice-PRESIDENT. My name is
ken, I'm the dha PRESIDENT And
I'm very glad that you are speaking about staffing. I think
this board should make staffing
a priority. As the PRESIDENT Of
the dha and board we researched the staffing for many years and if you look into it and dive deep into it, we're not the only
ones that looked into it, the civil grand jury has, and they have written multiple reports and the controller's office
have, they have written multiple
reports. This is a continuous problem and so much of a
problem, I have listened to every reason and every excuse from the sheriff's department
and I have researched it and the most and recent and last excuse
led me to the controller's
office where I met with the
controller and I do agree with the sheriff's office that the sheriff's budget is a problem.
And so does the controller,
budget needs to be higher and
appropriate. That's partial effect but that's not the only
effect of our staffing crisis.
Here we are today, we're talking about staffing and that's a priority that should be the
priority because really if you
think about it, what does it affect?"
2022-09-26,"it affects safety inside the jail and affects peace and
affects going to programs, it
affects walk time. It affects
gym time and it affects medical
appointments and court trials
like you brought up, it's the cog in the wheel that slows everything done, it's the cog in
the wheel where our deputies are getting attacked because the
lack of staffing. It's the cog in the wheel because other incarcerated people are being
attacked and employees are being a
-- attacked and this needs to be
your priority. I would like to say although the sheriff's
office presents they are
aggressively hiring and they are
trying to recruit, you know, the
contrary based on our research, there's trying and there's doing
and the trying, there needs to
be more fire under the trying.
There needs to be more urgency under the trying. The marketing
and recruiting right now pretty
much that started in JUNE prior
to that, there was little to no marketing and the recruiting was
week and the department rerye  --
relied on other employees to network on getting new applicants and it worked well until the last two years where
morale decreased the lowest
levels to where our contract has
been violated multiple times to
the point of our members losing
time off because of contract violations, to the point of
applicants coming in with
experience, with academy
certificates, laterals, getting
underpaid and paid at a training wage when that never happened
prior to 2020, so there's problems within the department
that I urge you to look at. Now, if we fix all those inter department problems where they
:
And promoted deputies to sergeants and I mean a lot of
sergeants during the staffing crisis, where they skipped and
not offered testing for senior deputy which could have balanced some of the issues with the impact of staffing instead of going from deputy --"
2022-09-26,"I think we've hit the time limit for your public comment,
my apologies but we need to add here to that."
2022-09-26,"thank you. But please
research it and look into it.
[Timer]"
2022-09-26,"to the parents for the public comment, there was missing --
the password to get into the
meeting, so the meeting id is
24946776879. And the password is 63879899. Public comment is now
open. We'll give you a few seconds."
2022-09-26,could you repeat that because usually when people hear it specifically --
2022-09-26,"and slower because if it was
me, I wouldn't have caught any of those numbers."
2022-09-26,"it appears public comment was
missing the password, so the meeting id, let me start with
the phone number, 415-655-0001.
Meeting id is 24946776879. And
the password is 63879899. There's no public comment."
2022-09-26,"the next item on the agenda
is item 8, rules of order/by-laws, this is a discussion item."
2022-09-26,"board members about --  discussion by board members
about any of the proposed rules
of order that MR. Long has sent
us based over the past five weeks?"
2022-09-26,"city attorney clerk, are you
going to finalize it if we send
comments or -- would you prefer
that maybe one commission member
accumulate the comments and revise the draft as necessary?"
2022-09-26,"yeah, I mean, it can go
either way. I made comments so
the ones from existing bodies,
someone, ten tee city attorney reviewed those so the main thing we are looking for is they are consistent with the ""brown act""
and the sunshine ordinance, so
for those that were for existing bodies, that's already -- our
office reviewed those. The one
that, the draft that PRESIDENT
Wetchter sent to me, I went
through and made edits and to make sure and it looked at it with the eye towards, is it it consistent with the ""brown act""
and the sunshine ordinance and I haven't looked at this current
draft since then, so if it's not
changed, since I looked at it last, then I'm sure it's fine but what rules you adopt are entirely up to you with the caveat, like I said, they are
consistent with the ""brown act"" and sunshine ordinance. It can
go either way. If you want me to
make comments on other drafts, I
could do that or if you want --
if this body decides that the
draft that PRESIDENT Wetchter
sent which I think is built off the police commission rules of order, if this body decides
that's the draft they want to work on, I can go back and finalize it and send it to the group and at the next meeting,
if you elect to adopt that, you'd have to put it on the
agenda as an action item because you're adopting rules and you
have to give 15-days' notice for
that meeting so if you want to
do that, I can do that. So today, you couldn't adopt them. It's only an informational item,
so those are some of the possibilities so --"
2022-09-26,"I asked that only because not
just substantively but also the format was off. I didn't know
how in shape you wanted the things because obviously if
we're going to adopt something,
the formatting is important as well."
2022-09-26,"yeah. I'm happy to -- I'm happy to make a comment on the
-- comment on formatting also. I
didn't notice anything in particular. The draft I'm looking at now --"
2022-09-26,"I mean I see spaces in the
underlining isn't consistent so
I'm -- as an attorney, I'm anal about some of these things
having worked on regulations as well."
2022-09-26,"I wasn't looking at it for that purpose because it was one
of three four drafts floating around."
2022-09-26,"I was wondering if we were
submitting drafts or comments to
you, like how perfect of a form?"
2022-09-26,it's entirely up to you.
2022-09-26,"okay. Because I mean, if this
came to me as a final draft and
even with the 15-day notice, I couldn't vote for it because I'm
looking not only substantively but also in terms of
presentation and format as well."
2022-09-26,"yep. So, the way I approached this is when people sent me
drafts, I have been look at it
an item consistent with the sunshine ordinance and the ""brown act"" and I haven't been
looking at it for formatting
purposes. It's not -- but I can
do that if that's something you want but I'm happy to take
whatever comments or edits you
had that go to formatting or wording or anything like that on
a draft -- on one or two of the
drafts and get back to you and
send back to you a for final form."
2022-09-26,"okay. Thank you. I mean, main
thing is they are your rules. They can look however you want
them to look. Meaning the body's rules."
2022-09-26,"yeah, I had one concern about
actually on agenda items and including the inspector general
because the inspector general
works for this body so I think
it's better to keep it within
the board to come up with agenda
items. I mean, it can be in
consolidation with the inspector general but I think just to keep
it consistent and maybe a media policy as well. That really,
things shouldn't be in the media that hasn't been a consensus of our entire commission and
anything that touches a legal
arena, it would be best directed
to you or if -- if it's germane to the sheriff's department/sheriff's council."
2022-09-26,"what I think might work best
is if, so everyone has a draft,
right, and I think there were copies so if -- I can make a
note of those edits you
suggested and if the body wants me to make the edits to the
document and bring that back, I can do that but you could also, at the next meeting when you're adopting the rules, anyone is
free at that point to make suggestions to the draft that's
out there, like, they can be oral suggestions and then you can vote on whatever those suggestions are and I can commit
what you have voted on to writing or edit it as everyone directs me to at the meeting so it can go either way."
2022-09-26,"okay. I'll try and make it
easier for you and do a clean
copy myself and then I'll probably just highlight changes
in language rather than -- and I
always find underlining and then
:   Too confusing so I highlight in a particular color whether it's yellow or green."
2022-09-26,"that works fine. Maybe what
I'll do when we come back, I'll shift that draft around through the secretary and try and make
clear what our -- your suggestions and what were my suggestions, so then when you
come back to vote on the rules, if you decide to do that at the
next meeting, you'll know when
you're voting on basically. At
that meeting and if there's a draft and close to final form, this body is free at that
meeting as long as it has been agendized to make suggestions
and they can be a part of the final draft too, so that's --  what is brought to the next meeting doesn't have to be
exactly what you end up voting on, if that makes sense."
2022-09-26,"I have a question. I don't
require sending a media policy
in the other commissioner rules
of order that you sent to us, is
there one we can copy or adopt?"
2022-09-26,"there isn't a media policy for the other commission I advise and I don't remember
seeing it in the ones I have
shared. So I can ask around my office to see if other
commission -- where the rules aren't before you and not one that is advised they have a
media policy and I can bring that to you too."
2022-09-26,"I'm sure there's something
that stood up and ensuring
there's not a first amendment right of board or commission members."
2022-09-26,"the other commission i
advise, I think the rules of
order say that the PRESIDENT --
can speak for the body. But even now I think it's problematic. It's one thing to be able to
speak to the media about
something that the board, a
decision that the board collectively made but it might
get confusing in terms of what you are saying as an individual
verses what you're saying as a
member, so but I have seen that
in the other commission I advise
in the juvenile commission.
It's in their rules but it's up to you and I can look at it with
an eye to the first amendment issues."
2022-09-26,"I was looking at the police
commission rules of order
because they closely -- their
work most closely resembles
ours. Any questions or comments?
Okay. Is there any public comment?"
2022-09-26,sorry.
2022-09-26,"I was going to make a motion
that we all submit -- I was going inform say we submit
things -- I was going to say we
submit information because we
need 15 days' notice and I don't
want if you want the board
members so it can be finalized
or we have a month and carry it and do it --"
2022-09-26,I was thinking latter of NOVEMBER and agendized it for NOVEMBER.
2022-09-26,"but realize there's going to
be thanksgiving in there too."
2022-09-26,"yes, there is."
2022-09-26,"and MS. Clarke, I -- say this
is a pdf so all comments you
made which were attorney/client
privilege would be excluded and I can send you this in word version and if you can take it out so it's easier and you can
send it to dan, if you can send
it to people so it's easier to
make changes using track changes so we can see which changes each
individual is proposing, if
that's easier."
2022-09-26,"I tend not to use track
changes so I use highlighting. Usually, I think my role has been master scripter in the past
so usually it's easier and I would say that because city
attorney is finalizing it. City attorney is the master scripter
so there's not too many people playing with the draft and then
one goes out in error as a final."
2022-09-26,"so if I'm hearing you correctly, do you want to volunteer to receive those of us
-- the corrections or additions to it and then you can share --"
2022-09-26,"it can be either or or I was
going to say it would be city attorney working on it because  --"
2022-09-26,"it's better you send it to
dan and they forward it to me
individually. I want to avoid us
accidentally share things among  --"
2022-09-26,I agree.
2022-09-26,"and thank you for doing all
this work, it's very tedious."
2022-09-26,that's why we went to law school.
2022-09-26,I'm having flashbacks.
2022-09-26,I presume we have to do it once. Okay. Are we ready for public comment?
2022-09-26,"for members of the public who would like to make public
comment online item 8, if you're
present, please line up at the
podium. Otherwise, please call 415-655-0001. And enter access
code 2496776879. With the
password 63879899. Press three
to raise your hand to be added
to the queue. And given the
technical difficulties of this, I believe we can take public
comment on any lines one three
eight. There is one public
caller. Good evening, caller,
you have two minutes."
2022-09-26,"commissioners, can you hear me?"
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"okay. I had to call the
sheriff's department because sf
tv -- so we can verify and get a
password to participate in this meeting. I think all this should
be done before you start your
meeting and start the middle in
the meeting or the end. We, the
public are watching y'all like a
hawk. And I did listen to the
entire meeting, the first
meeting and I want to say even
though this wasn't an action item and you're discussing about
the rules of order but I want to
say that our city in recent
months have many new
commissions. We have a
commission on public housing,
street and sanitation, the sheriff's now have a commission
and each of these meetings have
to have some standard. And one
of the most important points is that the public has to participate."
2022-09-26,"caller, you have 30 seconds."
2022-09-26,"thank you for the 30 seconds.
We, the people, need to be
respected and we were not respected today. And I'm going to participate in the future
agenda items. I'm on standby."
2022-09-26,"thank you, caller. No other callers."
2022-09-26,no more callers.
2022-09-26,"okay. Then item 9, future
agenda items and scheduling
regular meeting. Discussion and
possible action item. And you
gave us the list of potential
accessible meeting room times."
2022-09-26,"as a reminder going forward,
sfgo tv will not be broadcast
this live and it will be recorded to be heard next day."
2022-09-26,will people be able to listen online?
2022-09-26,"they can sign in into webex.
But it won't be broadcast on cable tv."
2022-09-26,"webex, will they have visuals or audio?"
2022-09-26,I believe it's audio only.
2022-09-26,"audio only, okay."
2022-09-26,"I understood this list to
mean if we were to choose one of
these dates, we can have live broadcast, right?"
2022-09-26,correct
2022-09-26,"it's only -- so, I'm looking
at this and to maximize public participation, I think fridays
are not necessarily a good day. I would make myself available
but fridays aren't the best and
I think the second best would be the fourth wednesday where we're able to have that window of
opportunity from 9:00 A.M. To
4:00 P.M. But again, I think
during work hours minimizes the ability for the public to
participate and to me, that's
the most crucial aspect of this commission. But I guess if I needed to prioritize a preference, it would be the
fourth wednesday from 9:00 to 4:00."
2022-09-26,"I would also prioritize that
date. I would -- I think I'm concerned also about the fact that people need to work and
they might not be able to give
their input during these hours
but given the circumstances, this is what we have available
to us, I would also prioritize
the wednesday, the fourth."
2022-09-26,"yes, I concur. I echo the same sentiments my colleagues
have in terms as we just heard, able to ensure we can have public comment and folks can
call in, so if we were to choose a different date for
availability for sfgovt tv, it's
that wednesday but I'm not opposed to, since we had a steady rotation of the last two
months of keeping the months although they are not live
broadcast, it allows folks an
opportunity to call in because
if it's not an sfgov tv, it's
still a live link, correct? It
will be a webex but shown the next day so --"
2022-09-26,we won't --
2022-09-26,we won't have the video.
2022-09-26,"we wouldn't have access
unless somebody was actually
here live in our -- owe"
2022-09-26,the room is open
2022-09-26,in the room with us and I'm trying to layout the options. That's my thought process.
2022-09-26,"on the commission -- on the status of women, we were audio tape and that presented an issue
and this isn't during covid, so
I'm thinking, second best is the longer hours but as I look at this monday, window is only
three years and if we had longer
meetings and this is work time 9
to noon. If anything happened
noon or later, we could have more latitude and people could have lunch hours between noon and 2:00. I'm concerned about that."
2022-09-26,"I'm not having visuals means members of the public would not see the powerpoint presentations
that are made to us which are often valuable information."
2022-09-26,"and also not recognizing who
is speaking unless we identify
their selves each time we spoke although I know secretary taylor and you're good at calling on
people so, but I think it makes
it so much better to have visuals."
2022-09-26,"I work during the day, weekdays, so definitely monday
through thursdays are not an
option for me and I would prefer
fridays just because it has a longer timeframe but yeah. And
I'm more flexible on a friday
too, so.... That's my point of view."
2022-09-26,"michael and william, what about your availability?"
2022-09-26,"I would prefer friday evenings rather than something
in the morning monday through
friday because yeah. That's busy hours for myself. Do we have a time limit, like, can we just be
here for two years or do we have
to be here until every item is covered?"
2022-09-26,"I think we will allow
ourselves the flexibility in
case it's longer and public comment MAY one over."
2022-09-26,"we can carry the meeting over
to the next meeting. I have been in somewhere the agenda is long
where we move it to the next meeting. Is there an end time? Right now we don't have an end time?"
2022-09-26,"I second that. I think it
would be helpful to have an end time or time keep so that we're
kind of moving through the items quickly because I think some of the questions that, even the follow up questions we have for the discussion items can be
e-mailed, you know, like, we can
kind of save time that way."
2022-09-26,"and I think we did more, I mean, like you said, there's
going to be meeting where we need more time but then we can reschedule that for a different
day if we think our agenda items need more time but for routine agenda, I say friday went 5:00
and 7:00 is good or 4:00 to
7:00."
2022-09-26,michael?
2022-09-26,"actually, I agree with palmer
due to work conflicts. I think friday would be best."
2022-09-26,"I'm so happy to spend my first friday of every month with
you wonderful people. I'm okay with that."
2022-09-26,"it's might be better than the
fourth friday but the overall, you know, priority for me is public participation."
2022-09-26,absolutely! Absolutely!
2022-09-26,"so are we talking about the
first friday or the fourth friday?"
2022-09-26,first friday.
2022-09-26,okay.
2022-09-26,first fridays.
2022-09-26,"I would imagine my personal feeling is we want as much public involvement as possible
so we want to encourage people
to watch the meetings and to call in or come in person and speak because as we have said, I
think we want to hear from the
community about their concerns
and listen to that and hopefully our audience will grow."
2022-09-26,"and then do we want to get a
time for the first friday?"
2022-09-26,"yeah, like 4:00 to 7:00. That's what I put down."
2022-09-26,I'm okay with 4:00 to 7.
2022-09-26,great.
2022-09-26,"what do we do with holidays
or vacation? You MAY --"
2022-09-26,we don't take vacations.
2022-09-26,okay. [Laughter]
2022-09-26,just checking. We do.
2022-09-26,we can work around it but --
2022-09-26,"is 4:00 P.M. The earliest that people can start? Or is
there a possibility of starting earlier?"
2022-09-26,"I'm still thinking about public participation so I think
4:00 P.M. Is the earliest we
should start."
2022-09-26,agreed.
2022-09-26,"so can I make a motion we
meet on the first fridays in
room 400 at 4:00 P.M. Until 7:00
P.M.?"
2022-09-26,I second that motion.
2022-09-26,"for members of the public who would like to make public
comment online item the, if
you're present, line up at the
podium or call 415-655-0001 and
enter access code 24946776879.
Password 43879899. We have one
caller. Good evening caller, you have two minutes."
2022-09-26,"my name is francisco de costa
and I would like to participate
in some of the key virtual
meetings that our city has and
there is no doubt that at this
time, the san francisco police
department and the commission
and the sheriff's department and
commission are playing an important role in advancing
quality-of-life issues in our
city. Very, very serious
quality-of-life issues in our
city. That is why we have to
have everything to allow the
taxpayers, constituents who are
:   The constitution
participate in these meetings.
It's very important. Now, at
every meeting, we have a choice whether to state your name or
not state your name. [Beeping] I
don't mind stating my name. It's ""brown act."" so, some people
don't like to state their name
and that's fine. I like to state my name. [Timer]"
2022-09-26,"caller, you have 30 seconds."
2022-09-26,there are no other public comment.
2022-09-26,do you want to take a vote?
2022-09-26,"okay. We have a motion on the
floor. And I do have a question.
Would that mean our next meeting would be friday, OCTOBER 7th?"
2022-09-26,I was going to ask that? Or did you want to move it to NOVEMBER?
2022-09-26,"I was going to put a caveat
on that motion to move it to NOVEMBER."
2022-09-26,"I think a month to prepare
those materials."
2022-09-26,for sure.
2022-09-26,yep! That gets us prepared as well.
2022-09-26,no procrastinating.
2022-09-26,"NOVEMBER 4th from 4:00 to
7:00 is our next meeting."
2022-09-26,"I'll be at a national bar
association asian conference so I won't be here but materials
still can be sent in."
2022-09-26,we'll take the vote. Member afuhaamango?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member afuhaamango is aye. Member brookter?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member brookter is aye. Member carrion?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member carrion is aye: member palmer?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member palmer is aye. Member nguyen?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member nguyen is aye. Member soo?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,member soo is aye. PRESIDENT Wetchter?
2022-09-26,aye.
2022-09-26,PRESIDENT Wetchter is aye.
2022-09-26,"item nine is future agenda
items and scheduling regular
meetings and we have addressed
scheduling regular meetings of
future agenda items. I didn't realize you were going to be
here and that's why I made the request earlier."
2022-09-26,[Mic is off]
2022-09-26,"I was going to quickly review
what has been sitting kind of on
our back-burner so-to-speak now
and I have made, I have redrafted the mission statement
to clean it up a little bit and
maybe we could send it to city
attorney clarke so we don't do
:   Things if that's
okay with you."
2022-09-26,"I'm happy to look at it. So you want me to look at it for purposes of making sure it's
consistent with your charter, duties and et cetera."
2022-09-26,"yeah. I draft a mathematician
and the elegant proof is the most -- I like to keep it direct and that's why I cleaned up the mission statement. My colleagues
are going to work on the mission statement and that's why if we could add here to particularly
deadlines and get this completed
by NOVEMBER, so we can actually vote on a mission statement in NOVEMBER."
2022-09-26,so you're recommending this is an agenda item.
2022-09-26,"uh-huh. And then also I think
:  , you
took a poll on the logos and
that will go to business cards
and then I think if we're going to set out some community hearings and I know we're going to get into the holidays but
maybe that is a good way to have
some kind of community involvement and I think commissioner afuhaamango, you really are looking forward to the community engagement as well, so I think maybe at the next meeting, if we can talk about some dates for some of the
community engagement and maybe
also even look at the sheriff's calendar, if they have some community events that they are
doing over the holidays as well
and make we can ducktail or at
least make announcements at a
sheriff's community event that we're going to have a hearing
other a criteria of an inspector
general, so.... But I think it's important to actually get the mission statement done and the
logo and business cards so as members, those of us involved in
the community, at least are willing to give out contact information to solicit input, so
those are the four items, thank you."
2022-09-26,"chief, would it expedite
things if you send it in advance
of the meeting and if we had
questions about them we send
them to dan in advance of the meeting, is that permissible or
would it expedite things?"
2022-09-26,"I don't know how far out in advance because staff has to put
things out in advance but usually I call dan and let him
know if I can put it on there. Today, he said I can plug in my
own usb but it does take time
for our folks to work on that to
the specific to what you're asking."
2022-09-26,"I'm wondering if we had the
materials a few days before the
meeting, if we had questions we can e-mail them to dan and he
can forward them to you and we wouldn't have to ask them here and you'll be prepared to provide the information."
2022-09-26,"I was going to share and for
a point of clarity as we move far forward, when we have presentations it should be mosted to the public at the same time we post the agenda so everybody is aware transparent wise of everything that's going on, so I think that might be a good practice to start with, if we can get it 72 hours in
advance as we post the agenda so we can post it so member of the publics who have questions on what we're seeing, we can write our questions and reach out before hand if we want and have questions prepared as we're coming into it."
2022-09-26,excellent!
2022-09-26,is the link the same all the time for the public?
2022-09-26,no.
2022-09-26,oh!
2022-09-26,it changes.
2022-09-26,hopefully it's more consistent since we'll have a consistent meeting.
2022-09-26,"I want to be mindful of what
commissioner carrion said, that
we do prioritize our request of staff because there's a lot
going on right now."
2022-09-26,for sure. For sure.
2022-09-26,"was there -- the only thing I want to agendized as we just talked about it was the rules of
order for NOVEMBER meeting. Hopefully by that time everybody has a month to send out less
views and edits and grammar and hopefully we can vote on that in NOVEMBER and also because we
talked about it and we can
discuss it when you talk through
the agenda but have dhr come out
to address the questions. Those are my two things."
2022-09-26,"maybe we could is a list few
the timelines when dhr comes back and coordinate with
community hearings and I don't anticipate, maybe two community
hearings would be adequate but I
want to make sure we have
language access and spanish and mandarin and cantonese."
2022-09-26,would you look at having a commission meeting in addition to our regular meeting?
2022-09-26,yes.
2022-09-26,"okay. So then perhaps we
could look for one some time in
NOVEMBER before thanksgiving."
2022-09-26,"I don't know if that's possible or maybe DECEMBER
because we want the report back
from dhr and the report and timeline."
2022-09-26,"they will bring back the
report on NOVEMBER 4th so if we
had a community meeting between NOVEMBER 4th and thanksgiving, we would have gotten the report
from dhr?"
2022-09-26,I think it's better for DECEMBER.
2022-09-26,you know --
2022-09-26,"to a flounce it during our
NOVEMBER -- to announce it during our NOVEMBER meeting we'll have a community meeting."
2022-09-26,"there's too much going on
during the holidays, so given that we're going to be getting
these five potentially
proposals, information that
we're going to get, an entire
month to review that and it's an
action item and I don't think we
should have a community meeting during dez. It's busy for different reasons and we should
plan on doing that in the
beginning of the new year following the break. And we can
use this time if we are able to maybe identify a date by next
NOVEMBER, our next meeting, we can identify and then publicize that JANUARY meeting much more
in advance and give people a
month and a half notice."
2022-09-26,"I think it's possible to have
two community meetings in JANUARY."
2022-09-26,"yeah, yeah."
2022-09-26,that's a great idea.
2022-09-26,"where is the link to view
this for the public located to share with people?"
2022-09-26,it's on the sheriff's website. Where is it currently?
2022-09-26,"the link for the meetings we have, are they --"
2022-09-26,we have -- on our website.
2022-09-26,"yeah. Someone texted me today
saying the link wasn't working,
I sent them a link on the agenda."
2022-09-26,"it worked for me. I have one question, so I think you're
still listed as a pol for police commission after your name and
then under mine, I'm still sba
consultant, I think, so at what
point are we going to be sdod
after our names, our e-mail?"
2022-09-26,"the e-mails are going to follow the budget and it's going
to say fda. We need to get you
all processed first, I'm waiting
for -- and that one thing and
then hr doesn't work quickly but
I'm trying to get them --"
2022-09-26,"I know, you have worked
diligently since we have been onboarded."
2022-09-26,I'm trying to get you guys processed.
2022-09-26,"by that time it will be time
to file another form 700."
2022-09-26,the new fiscal year.
2022-09-26,all right. Do we need general public comment on that item?
2022-09-26,"at this time the public is welcome to address the board for

2022-08-22,"seat number 2, board member jason wechter."
2022-08-22,"good evening. I'm jason wechter. This is a osuspicious day for me to be here. It was exactly 39 years ago today on AUGUST 22, 1983 that I and the other first staff members of
the office of citizen complaints reported for work and that began what has been a very long and deep career and commitment to civilian oversight. I learned a lot over the way-along the way.
I'm here because of that continuing commitment. I worked in a professional capacity for various agencies, served on the board of directors for the national association for civilian oversight of law enforcement and been very active in their activities. I think this is a natural extension for me to be here. I hope a major thing I can contribute is helping avoid the mistakes made in
1983 when a unsupportive commission set
up a agency that did not function effectively and not choose the right director, they did not insure adequate resources and staffing so those are very hard lessen tuesday to learn and hope I can bring what I learned along the way to this board and help it succeed.
Thank you."
2022-08-22,"good evening. My name is
:   Been with the san francisco sheriff office for 6 years. I sit on the union seat for the sheriff oversight
board, and I'm looking forward
to bridging the gap between the public and our office to get a better understanding of what we
do. Thank you."
2022-08-22,"thank you very
much. I am julia diane soo and proud to continue service with the city. I previously served on the san francisco of commission on the status for women 12 years. My dayiary s is enforcement attorney for the california department of insurance, where
I protect the public, conduct disciplinary actions through administrative hearings against individuals as well as companies. My prior life was a mathematician so I'm very oriented towards
numbers, dash
boards, accountability and I'm pleased to try to strike a balance with building a professional staff enhancing the professional staff of the sheriff's department as well as
listening to the community. My family has been in san francisco since the late 1880's and I'm very committed to public service so very pleased
to be here."
2022-08-22,"thank you. Seat
number 7,
board member dion-jay brookter."
2022-08-22,"thank you. Diane jay
brookter. Dj. I'm the executive director of
:   Focused on work force development, education services as well as the designing and building of affordable housing, so I have been in san francisco over 12 years and had the opportunity to serve some of the most underserved communities in san francisco. Most notably on the general obligation bond oversight committee where I served a couple years under the controller and most recent leon the san francisco police commissioner who
served as liaison. A natural fit. I want to say thank you
to the
sheriff department coalescing and pulling us together. Chief has done a phenomenal job communicating with all of us and dan. Looking forward what we can do together. I want to bring a community voice as we serve a lot of individuals just involved and continue to do soio want to continue to figure
how to bridge the gap between what sogoing on in the jails and in the communities so we can all continue to live here together side by side."
2022-08-22,"thank you.
Continuing on to line itm 1a, introduction and remarks by sheriff paul
mimeeto of miyamoto of the san francisco sheriff office."
2022-08-22,"hopefully this is on. Okay. Good evening everyone. On behalf of myself and the women and men of the san francisco sheriff office, I want to congratulate and welcome all
sof you have to the responsibility of being members
of the first sheriff oversight board. You have a important jobs and obligations are intertwined with the sheriff office. You bring professional
knowledge and life experiences and you are going to be able to shine a good light on all the
work we do. And the good work our deputies do every day. I want to insure you that we are here as you mentioned earlier, board member brookter, that we are here to operate in full transparency and work together with you to make this all
happen and become a successful endeavor. During my 2019 campaign to get this job as sheriff, I wanted to
create a
community advisory board. Why? Because collaboration is the
key. We need to communicate with the community and advocate
not just for incarcerated or injusted involved persons but everybody and everything the sheriff office does. We want to make sure what we do is transparent and understood by the rest of the community and you are going to be a part of
that as we move forward. In MAY of 2019, our office entered into agreement with department of police accountability to investigate several existing high profile allegations of misconduct. In AUGUST of 2020, the relationship between the dpa and sheriff office was modified to strengthen the
provision of that oversight; including the ability for justice involved persons and public to file complaints directly to dpa opposed to just the sheriff office assigning
cases and this is the growth of what we see as a continuing commitment to make sure we are transparent and make sure we
work with you. We are fully invested and commit td to this
and I wanted to say personally, I want to recognize all you for your civic commitment whether your first time or whether you have been here 39 years, I appreciate that having been in
the sheriff office for 27 years now the commitment to everything we are going to do and your voluntary commitment in terms of giving your time and energy to this is going to help improve us and I want to commend you for your service to all of us, the community and
our office. Please, embrace this responsibility to make recommendations to both myself
and the board of supervisors about our operations, about complaints against employees or contractors and how we deal with in custody or out of custody operations relate today the sheriff office, please embrace this responsibility.
Our deputies are often overlook in comparison to the amount of support given to other public safety agencies and we hope you not only hold our deputies accountable and also hold the community accountable in regards to supporting the sheriff office and doing this job. It is real easy to focus
on negative thinks when we talk about the sheriff office because we are a intgle part for the sheriff cyst so responsible for the jails and courts. Sometimes people dont
want to think about those places unless they have those involved or directly related to the justice system itself. You will be a part of the voice the department has been in the justice system. One thing that
we do ck that sometimes isn't recognized is the fact that we
work with people that are justice involved every day. Gives unique perspective and ability to provide for opportunities for change. This has been reflected in the past in what our department has been
about with what is not a traditional justice jail setting. We have been able to achieve and accomplish a lot, which served to be a national
model for success in areas such
as programs and
services that help to reduce recidivism.
Things we have in terms of 5 keysant grated treatment, therapeutic art, things we talked about during your training and orientation process, you will be able to emerse in first hand and we have been challenged recently with the restrictiveness and challenges of operating under the covid emergency protect ive order. I'm hopeling you will be a part of moving us on from that and reestablishing a lot of what we have done and what
we hope to accomplish moving forward. We are very proud of
being a part of the transformation people experience when justice involved. I hope you all realize just what you have seen
so far this is very important work. As I mentioned during our time together during the training orientation, I'm optimistic our work together will peel back the curtains and show the community who we are and what we do. Our work will reflect the core values of service, professionalism and pride and I look forward working with all of you in the
years to come. Thank you."
2022-08-22,"thank you sheriff paul miyamoto. Line item 1b, introduction and remarks by
director paul
henderson of
department of police accountability. Spearheading
the deputy
investigations."
2022-08-22,"go? Thank you so much. Thank you. Good evening.
Thank you for being here. I didn't realize paul was making a speech and feel there is pressure, but that's okay. I
want to thank you guys paul henderson for having me here and to speak a little bit about the work. I'm up here with my chief of staff sarah hawkins
but I want to talk a little bit about the work because we
actually started the
conversations with sheriff hennessey in 2018 and that transitioned to the mou and the
loa you guys have already as public record outlining what the work has been. I think that history is
important,
because it reflects a non -- a substantial period of time that
the work was being done to
provide some of the inquiry and investigation regarding the oversight that is not lost on me in terms of the significance
to the benefit for the
city. Over 130 cases, more
then 60 of them involved serious kind of cases that have been well above the national average in the work and so, our role
here is
to provide seem less transition in terms of the work and the leadership for the work. I just want to take the opportunity to thank my staff
for doing what has been pretty complicated work. The work was
similar to the police oversight, the investigations and the discipline, but different and so, I asked a lot of my staff from the very beginning and they provided a
lot of work, a lot of
expertise, a lot of developed expertise doing the work and I
didn't want to not acknowledge
how hard the folks at dpa have been working to make sure we have a professional product delivered both to the commission and to the citizens
here and to the sheriff department. And thank all of you, the commissioner here for volunteering your time. This
is day 1 of what will be a long
and very busy journey I expect.
I think everyone has copies of
the mou and the letter of understanding that governs our
work and that defines what has been done and what gets done
for the work so far and that's
should be a solid foundation for everyone so I want to thank everyone for allowing us to do
the work that we have done so far. Did I MISS Anything? You have anything?
:"
2022-08-22,"and I will yield the remaining balance of my time-do
I get a timer? I didn't realize. I yield the remainder of our time to my chief of
staff, sara hawkins."
2022-08-22,"thank you commissioners. I look forward helping with the transition as well.
The main 2
things alluded by sheriff miyamoto and director henderson are the jurisdiction outlined
in the agreement. It started with 8 cases referred
to us by sheriff hennessey, those 8 cases were about 35 cases once
we broke them apart. That involved into seeing the need to broaden the scope to take complaints directly from members of the community and
individuals who are incarcerated and to better define the scope of the types
of cases we did so I think that was a important step that has driven the work. Also in
attendsance is germane jones
dpa staff attorney. He
:   Who dedicated a lot of resources to this work really have done the training, done a lot of work to understand the best practices for sheriff ovsite and bring that to what we are doing. We
also had a very productive relationship with sheriff legal margaret bum gartner and sheriff department unlike the
hiccups we experienced with getting things from sfpd for various reasons, not trying to comment on that but we had a very agreeable and productive relationship in terms of document protocol, how we handle cases, access to materials so sure the sheriff department will continue with this commission and how the work moves forward and we are happy to help and committed to
doing the work until there is transition in place and being a part of adviceing, helping, do whatever we can to make sure work is getting done and
getting done well.
Thank you."
2022-08-22,"I want to thank the other partners involved in bringing this project and the work to and with dpa, which were involved the mayor's office, obviously the sheriff's office,
the city attorney's
office, the community and
:   Walton and board of supervisors. I think that was integral and not lost on me
those individuals and those agencies collectively trusted
the work, the independence and outcome from the work at dpa to come to us in the first place. It isn't lost on me and I want to acknowledge and thank them for trusting all of us to deliver the products we have done so far and we
look forward to the seemless transition so,
thank you all."
2022-08-22,"thank you director henderson
and chief hawkins. Line item 1c, introduction and remarks by
deputy city attorney jana clark. Deputy city attorney will give a presentation on her
role to the board as deputy city attorney, the scope of the body authority and the realm of the individual board members."
2022-08-22,"hi, everyone. I think I met most of you at the training and those that I didn't meet, again my name is jana clark, I work for the city attorney's office
and thought I would give background into what I do in general and then I was going to
hit three topics. One base any
the role of boards and commissions generally and speak to the role of this body in particular specifically, and then discuss just high points
of the public meeting laws. And then I will probably have
comments on a couple other
agenda items as they come up, for example
recruitment of the
inspector general and-basically, I am advice attorney and my role is to
provide advice to the departments I'm assigned, and
just by way of background, I
advice the juvenile probation department including the juvenile probation commission. Advice the department of police accountability and advice the sheriff department. I do a few other thing s but those are the highlights of what I do, and what that means is, I'm available to all those departments to answer any questions that come up related
to your work and that includes
you all of course. You all have my contact information and you can all feel free to contact me by e-mail or phone any time you have a question that comes up as we progress and we all learn because this is a brand new body so I'm learning along with you the ins and outs of this body. Guided
by the charter. basically I thought it would be a good idea to go through generally what boards and commissions, what their authority is in general and some of the restrictions on boards and commissions
and individual members. I will probably keep calling you commissioners but think you are technically all members and don't think there is a real distinction in the law but forgive me if I call you a
commissioner and you are not.
Starting with the charter, section 4.102 speaks generally to the powers and duties and restrictions of boards and commissions. In general, your duties are and this is true of every board or commission, unless the charter section that
applies to you specifically says differently, these are the rules and restrictions that
apply to your board. Basically
the first duty is to formulate and-I provided these materials but should probably said for
anyone else who didn't get the materials ahead of time I will follow what we call the good government guide. It is a document that my
office creates and it has-it is our bible basically for advising boards and commissions and it basically talks about what your roles are, what the restrictions are. There is a
section on public meetings, and the rules that apply to those and a whole section on public records so basically I'm starting like from page 13 of the good government guide that everyone can find on the city attorney website and that page was included in the material, so page 13-25 of the good government guide. basically under charter section 4.102, your duties are to formulate evaluate and approve goals objectives plans and programs and set policies consistent with the overall
objective s of the city established by the mayor and board through the adoption of regulation. Number 2, developing keep current
anium statement of purpose outlining jurisdiction, authority, purposes and goals subject to review and approval by the mayor and board. The third category is
after public hearing, approve department budget. That for this board is going to be the office-the budget for the office of inspector general. You dont have a inspector
general yet, you don't have a department so have a department technically so there isn't a budget to approve. The budget approval process usually happens in the
spring and I'll be available at that time to guide the board through the process. Recommend to the mayor for further submission of the board rates fees and similar charges. That is probably not going to come
up for you. Rec and park might set fees for different events they have and those would go-that would be something the rec and park commission would do but don't think you guys with ilhave these. Number 5, unless the charter provides
differently, and it does, basically this talks about a
process by which the mayor submit nominees to a body to choose a department head for you. You are not going-it
isn't dpoeing going to go that way. Charter section 4.137 that applies specifically to this body, this body appoints a department head without going
through that process of mayoral appointments so that is one that doesn't exactly apply to
you. Number 6, remove department head. Again, that
would be up to it this body. Number 7, conduct investigations and any aspect of governmental operations within your jurisdiction, which is sheriff department oversight through the power of inquiry and make recommendations to the mayor and board. Number 8, exercise whatever powers and duties the board might give you. Number 9, appoint executive secretary to manage the affairs and operation of the board of commission. You have a acting secretary who I think so far as I seen done a fabulous job. A little later down the line because you have
a lot on your plate we can talk about the appointment process
for a secretary and we'll pull
in dhr to make sure
dot all is and cross t. Restrictions on commissions. The main thing to
focus on here is that you act through the department head, so what the charter says is each board or commission relative to the affairs of its own department shall deal with administrative matters through the department head or his or her designee and any dictation suggestion or interference prohibited on the member of the
board constitute official misconduct. Provided however that you can still exercise your power of inquiry. Meaning you can have hearings and bring people from different departments in front of you to answer questions, but otherwise, the board needs to act through the department head, which will be for this body the inspector general when that person is hired. The same
will be true of when you interact with the sheriff department. We talked about this at the training I think. Any questions you have for the sheriff department need to go through the sheriff himself or the sheriff designee and my
understanding is the sheriff designated chief gu and think you all had interactions with him already. You cant reach out to someone else in the department with questions, even though that might seem more straight forward and easy, that
is a hard and fast rule. The
same restrictions apply to individual commissioners. First of all, your power is as a body and so no individual
commissioner has the power to exercise any of the powers and
duties of the board, so-in
order for this body to act you need 4 members, that is quorum.
The same rule about interference applies. The body can't interfere and each individual commissioner can't
interfere with the administrative affairs of the department, meaning again, you have to go thru the sheriff or sharing designee or inspector
general or who ever he or she might designate. You can ask questions at any point but I'll guess I'll go through and ask questions at the end and you can e-mail questions if quou are more comfortable doing that. The role of commission officers. I think you have on
the agenda today the
election of officers. Basically the officers have the power that
you guys decide they have individual officers the PRESIDENT And vice PRESIDENT As
long as it isn't inconsistent with the charter or public
meeting laws. You all get to say whether the presidents sets the agenda. Whether the
secretary sets the agenda.
Trying to think what else-how officers are elected, what day you meet. Things like that.
Isent you sample bylaws. The bylaws usually set out how you are going to elect your officers. One thing to note because this is on the agenda
like I said, you can decide to put off electing officers at a later point till you all get to know each other and are more familiar with your roles and one option you might have before you get into formal election of officers is to elect a PRESIDENT Pro tem,
which I had to google to appreciate means for the timebeing, so if you want to put off electing a PRESIDENT And vice PRESIDENT You could decide when this item
is called to instead PRESIDENT Pro tem to run the meeting until you decide to elect officers or you can elect them tonight but I
want ed to give that option. Moving through my notes here.
So, the role of the department head, page 16, those materials I provided. Basically the department head for the sheriff is the sheriff department is the sheriff. For the office of inspector general it is
inspector general. They will hire-for the sheriff he hires who is in the department and for the inspector general it is
up to that person to hire the investigators or whatever staff they think are necessary. So, I won't go into a lot of detail about the role of department
heads because you have a elected sheriff now, but happy to answer questions about that, but because you don't have a inspector general I wasn't going to into a lot of detail what they power might be. The commission secretary, moving to page 17. You have a big agenda so trying to move quickly, but tell me to slow down if you
want me to. So, the commission
secretary, is appointed by the board and their job is you have seen it in action so don't have to explain it. Working with who ever the chair is typically is how it works to create the agenda. The way it work frd this meeting was different because you didn't have a chair
at that point but usually-often what bodies do is some point in the meeting they have future agenda items and people throw out what they think is a good idea for the agenda for the following meeting or next meeting or two meetings away and what I have seen is the PRESIDENT Working with the secretary makes arrangements. For example, if the body were to say, we want to hear from the district attorney. Just
making it up. Then the-usually the secretary would reach out to the district attorney, fiend out their availability and based on that decide what
agenda it would make sense for
that item to be set. It could be fluid and it works best if it is usually one officer and the secretary working together because you have-usually it requires flexibility. The role
of the city attorney,
that is
me. So, the most important thing to remember is the city
is the client. The city attorney represents the city and county of san francisco, and all of you are officers of the city and county of san francisco because you are sitting on this board now, and
so our office provides advice
to every city officer. Some
things that happen in practice are sometimes different departments have different
views on things. But everybody gets the same legal advice. That is the most important take-away and the role of the city attorney, there is three pages and I will not go through all of it. The most important thing is, the city is the client, you can ask
us any questions, and then this is all within the privilege if
you come to me with questions,
but what we don't do is-even though you are all the city-say you like to ask a question about the sheriff department, a
legal question but you don't rather not-the sheriff know you
are asking me, sorry to be -- sometimes that happens
believe it or not. Then you
can trust that I am not going to -- MR. Brookter if you say have a question about the sheriff and the scope of his authority. I will give the legal advice. If the sheriff came and asked the same question I will give him the legal advice and not tell either party their asked. It works better if everybody feels they can come to us and ask advice and questions without worrying someone else will find
out they are asking. There is a lot more detail and written in a lot more fancy form but
basically that is the bottom line. Every once in a while it is necessary that we bring everybody in and everybody is
aware that different departments asked for the same advice and might
prepare a memo directed to the board and sheriff office and everybody would be brought into it but
that is a rare ocurance. The advice you get from our office, this is a public meeting and going through the basics, none of the advice I'm giving you now is privileged because I'm giving it in a public setting but if you come to me sep aretly and ask a question and I give you legal advice it is privileged and this is a important fact. Especially if I give the body advice. Every once in a while there MAY be a issue and maybe a few brought it up so might send e-mail to the whole board with legal advice. It is privileged the body can wave the privilege but when the advice is given to the body but no individual member can wave the privilege. If you think I think the world should know this advice, if I gave the
advice to the body the body has to wave the privilege in order
to share that advice outside
the group included in
theed advice. Racing through, because I know you have a lot
on your plate. I sent out in the spring it feels a million years ago, a letter with basically some trainings required like sunshine. There
is a harassment training. certain ethics filings so that was laid out in the letter. If you have questions about that,
feel free to contact
me, but there were deadlines in the letters and dont think we have to go over them now because I think everyone is up to speed on that. Normally there wouldn't have been a time lag and so I might be more reminding you but I think your former acting secretary, now the secretary made sure you are
all up to speed on your form 700 filings and required trainings. Again, feel free to
ask me questions. Rules and regulations, this is a item on the agenda. The bylaws to discuss anyway, adopting bylaws so we can talk more about that when that item is called. But
like I said before, those things usually-rules and regulations usually cover things like the terms
of office for officers, the
duties of the
officers, establishing regular meeting time and place and procedure for setting the agenda, what we already talked about. Quorum, page 24 for those following along in the material. It takes 4 members
of this body to act. Even if the-right now there are 5 of you here, you still need 4 members to act. If there is
not a majority present-it isn't the majority of seats filled it is the chapter. Seven in the charter and need 4 to act.
That is a hard and fast rule. Election of officers. Just generally the way that it works, if you don't have a procedure set up in the bylaws which you don't have bylaws yet
so don't have a procedure, generally the way that works is the presiding officer and in this case I think the way we'll do it is a secretary will act
in that role for this purpose. Request nominations from the body. You don't have
to have a second. And when no one else wants to offer nominations then the commission votes on the nomination in the order received and the first candidate to receive majority of the votes is elected to the
office, so that's generally how-based on robert rule ofered
order and you dont have a bylaw we look to robert rule of order. When you adopt bylaws you can have a different process. It is a good idea to
run that by me first.
This body-this body 4.137, sure you are familiar with it. I will go through what your powers and
duties are but you can read
them and just make a few comments. Basically,
under the charter 4.137b, there is a whole first section
that talks about appointments. The first
duty is to appoint and if necessary remove the inspector
general and sheriff office of inspector general. That is one thing you need to be thinking about getting done right away. Number two, evaluate the work of the office of inspector general and they review that inspector general's performance. You don't have one yet so that is not going to
kick in yet. Number three, compile evaluate and recommend law enforcement custodial and patrol best practice. Number four, connect community outreach and receive community
input regarding the sheriff office operation and jail conditions by holding public meetings and solicited input from persons incarcerated. Five, prepare and submit quarterly report to sheriff and board regarding this board's evaluations and outreach and the inspector general reports
submitted to this board. MARCH 1 each year prepare a annual report to the board that includes a summary of your evaluation and outreach and summary of the inspector
general report submitted. Performing duties you can hold hearings, issue subpoenas to witnesses to appear and protection of evidence administer oath and take testimony. Let me make sure -- those are
basically your duties. Just to give you the lay of the land before you came
into existence, basically the investigations insdants or complaints or whatever regarding the sheriff
department were handled in-house until-I think they already spoke about
this, the sheriff's department enlisted the department of police accountability to investigate the complaints and things like
that coming in. The department of police accountability through a memorandum of understanding with the sheriff's department is conducting those investigations
for the sheriff. So, once the inspector general is up and running, they will then take on that role. What the department of police accountability does right now is on behalf of the sheriff, because like I said, those things are previously done in-house. Once you have a
inspector general the
department of police accountability presumably can step down. There is nothing to prevent the sheriff to continue to work with department of police accountability should he decide, but under the charter the office of inspector general will take on the investigative role, so that's kind of the set up. The second role that the
department of police accountability played, which is very helpful is that because under the charter there was no department assigned to provide administrative support for this body. The department of police accountability stepped in and has been playing that role, so that's their role. Those are
the two ways in which this body interacts with the department
of police accountability. Let's see -- public meeting laws.
This is a thrill. Basically the good government guide
starting page 132 has a long discussion of public meeting laws but some things I want to highlight because I have thrown a lot of information at you, a meeting. So, you can only-you are supposed to meet in public. All your meetings are supposed
to be public, but the tricky thing is what is considered a meeting is any time there is a quorum in the same place at the same time is a meeting. I know
that seems a broad definition
but that's the rule. So, if
four of you are-if you all run into each other at a restaurant and start talking about anything to do with the body's work or sheriff department or
anything under your jurisdiction and basically even if it is not technically under your jurisdiction I would be careful because you would have a meeting. Every meeting has to be noticed, means there has
to be a agenda posted 72 hours before, so any meeting outside
of a noticed public meeting.
In other words, any gathering of the 4 of you without the conditions being met is a unlawful meeting. That is just a real broad way to think of meetings. If you-that is why
we had to do the training, sequentially which I know was a ton of work for the sheriff department but that is why
because if all were there together there would have been 4 at the same place and time discussing or basically discussing the business of the body, so that's why we
have to
do that. And this gets trickier. There is the conspt
:   I know some
sat on a board or commission before so familiar with it. The other way you can
meet and doing air quotes here, the other way you can meet is by
:   Meeting. If you are not all together in the same place and
time but you are-four of you are discussing
the business of the body sequentially or serially is the way I think of it. For example, if two of you are e-mailing back and forth and then you say-you forward the e-mail to one of you and that person brings in another person and they respond back you are having a meeting, even though that seems crazy. When the
effect of your
communication mean that discussing even if is is e-mail or phone call, the business of the body you are having a meeting. The best way to avoid that, because I think
it can accidently happen, if you want to communicate communicate through the secretary and then the secretary can blast out what you need-what you want to get
to the rest of the body and
then that will avoid someone inadvertently replying back all and generating e-mail discussion. Happy to answer questions about that because that is a tricky concept if you
haven't come across it before. As I said before,
agendas, this is all like in a lot of detail in the good government guide. Everything you talk about at a public meeting has to be agendized, meaning on the agenda. Say today you want to talk about jail visits, you can't because it isn't on the agenda. Even though it is the
business of the body. And all the agendas have to be posted
72 hours ahead of time. If it
isn't on the agenda 72 hours before the meeting you should
not discuss it at the meeting. One exception is if you have on the agenda future agenda items
and at that people will say
put jail visits on the next agenda. That wouldn't be
violating the public meeting
laws. Public comment. For each item you have to invite
public comment and so we are still on item 1 so
when I'm done yakking we'll invite public comment and also at every meeting you have to have a opportunity for general public comment where people can comment on anything that is relates to the business of the
body but not on the agenda. During the public comment, especially someone brings up something not on the agenda, especially if you are not that item you shouldn't have discussion that is triggered by the public comment, even though that might seem unnatural, someone raising a
issue and not respond MAY seem-anyway, MAY seem uncomfortable but
that is
the rule. I put a lot at you. If you have questions you ask now and if I don't know the answer I will get back with the answer and like I
said, I will have a few more chances to drone on when we call the other agenda items, but you have any questions on any of the stuff I
covered so far?"
2022-08-22,board member wechter.
2022-08-22,"yes. Thank you. You mentioned that the inspector general will hire their staff
and a couple weeks ago paul henderson told me everyone had been hired. He described as a chief position. A combination of his chief of staff and chief of investigation so I
wanted to
get clarification on that."
2022-08-22,"so, the inspector general is the one who will hire all the position in the office of inspector general and then who appoints the secretary will be
up to this body, and whether that person is a contract person whether they
work for a different department is a more complicated question I don't know the answer off the top of my head and want to bring in hr."
2022-08-22,"how can we determine whether someone has been hired because director henderson told me
someone has been hired and the mayor's office had their name but hadn't been publicized yet?"
2022-08-22,you mean the secretary-?
2022-08-22,"no, the chief position.
That is how he described it."
2022-08-22,"I can talk to director henderson off-line but the
inspector general is the under charter responsible for all the appointments to that office."
2022-08-22,"okay, thank you."
2022-08-22,"any other question? Like I said, feel free to e-mail me and I'll shoot a response back
to you. If I know off the top
of my head I'll reach research it and let you know.
Okay.
Thank you."
2022-08-22,"thank you MRS. Clark. For members of the public who are present and would like to make public comment on line item 1, you MAY line up at the podium.

2022-08-22,"my name is joanna hernandez
a parent of someone incarcerated in san francisco county jail so this committee
oversight is pornts important to me. Born and raised in san francisco public safety is number one as well. In regards to the position we are talking
about, is there any community
input on that as well? I guess that is a question or does it
just have to be a
comment? Just putting it out there."
2022-08-22,I just tell you any action of the body happens and will happen at a public meeting so to that extent there is the opportunity for the public input.
2022-08-22,"perfect. Thank
you."
2022-08-22,"good afternoon. I'm
:   I just wanted to thank you all for the commitment and the time that you have committed to do this. It is definitely something we waited a long time to see in san francisco and I just wanted to publicly thank you all for making that commitment
to the people in custody and everybody who MAY want to use this body, get information et cetera and I
want to also thank
director
henderson and chief-sheriff miyamoto for their commitment
to all of these reforms so I look forward working with you all. I'm with the office of PRESIDENT Walton so if there is
anything we can do to help out in every way, please let us
know and I say during budget advocacy, everything is public for us as well so want to be sure you guys all have the supports you need and we are definitely looking at you all
as we go into the office of inspector general hiring that process is going to be hard and something for you all to figure out, so good luck on that and we hope you bring us a candidate that is about reform, a candidate about language access and all the stuff that
is coming up again and again so
thank you all."
2022-08-22,"thank you. There is no
other public comment in person.
We'll take phone calls now.
Thank you caller, you
have 2
minutes.

2022-08-22,"my name is william palmer
and I'm a member of the board. Unfortunately my travel dates did not align with me being in person, so I wasn't able to
attend in person but
:   Just wanted to let
the public know that I'm
honored to serve and I will do my due diligence and attend all other meetings. I want to bring to attention because I'm
in tune with the jail
population as well as those
members in the community that
the conditions in san bruno are
lock down. They are not able to contact a attorney and help and go to the library and we just want to bring this to the attention of the sheriff department to make sure they
get the type of programming
that is holistic and humane for everyone. Thank you very much and I look forward to our next
meeting in person."
2022-08-22,"thank you MR.
Palmer. Thank
you caller, you have two

2022-08-22,"alright. Checking if I'm
the caller."
2022-08-22,yes.
2022-08-22,"great. Good evening everyone. My name is
:   Also on the board and unable out of the country
at this time. I'm not there in person but I want to thank everyone that has been working on this for several years. It took a lot of people, took a
lot of partnership and a lot of thought, resources and now we are here. I'm honored to be on
this board. I was previously a prosecutor in san francisco and
one of the things I did was serve as a attorney, prosecutor
in the independent investigation bureau that investigated sheriff misconduct and other issues, potential criminal acts. I'm excited to
bring a perspective of criminal justice refirm and someone in the trenches assisting people not only in my role as a
prosecutor but as a community advocate for queers, people of color, women, et cetera. Very excited to be here and thank you all for your time and commitment to making san francisco the place that we want to continue
living in and love and cherish so
thank you so much."
2022-08-22,"thank you MRS.

2022-08-22,can you hear me?
2022-08-22,yes.
2022-08-22,"good evening. My name is
:   The local policy director with the san francisco public defender's
office. I just wanted to thank you all for being here today and thank the commissioners.
This is a really long time coming and we are just really in need of this oversight and just wanted to stress the importance of having a strong sheriff oversight, particularly when it comes to the conditions in the jail and treatment of our clients, many of whom are vulnerable people
with mental illness,
transgender and jnder non conforming people, people with young people, seniors
, a lot of vulnerable people inside the jail so making sure the people are being treated with respect and dignity is not abused is so important for our city, for the office and for your work, so thank you so much and look forward to monitoring these meetings and seeing what you all are able to do and bring to light. Thank you."
2022-08-22,"thank you. There is no other public comment. Moving
on to line item 2. resolution making findings to allow teleconferencing meetings under
california government code section 5493e discussion and possible action. Discussion and possible action to adopt resolution setting
forth findings under assembly bill 361 that allow the sheriff department oversight board and any subcommittees to hold
meetings remotely as specified.
Deputy city attorney jana clark.
:"
2022-08-22,"hi. So, I have my office prepared a draft resolution and the purpose of this as the secretary indicated is if there
is a member of the board who for covid related reasons cannot attended the meeting ing rks they are permitted to attend remotely provided the
board-this board makes the two findings on the serkd page of
the draft resolution provide you find there continues to be a state of emergency due to the covid nan pandemic and you consider the circumstances of the state of emergency and
because of the covid-19 pandemic connecting meetings of
the body and the committee without allowing members of the
body to attend remotely would present risk to health and
safety of the members due to covid-19 and directly impact the ability of the members to meet safely in person.
It next section says the-if
you adopt this resolution that for the
next 30 days anyone-if you had a meeting and some member of the body couldn't attend because of covid in person they could attend remotely. That permit that. Otherwise you have to appear in person and that basically you also-the other part of the resolution says the secretary will put
this on the agenda within 30 days so you continue to have this option if it becomes the case you can't come because you have covid or exposed to covid or caring for somebody with covid and if that happens the process is you let the secretary know that you won't
be attending for covid related reasons and you don't have to get into anymore detail than
that. This is the draft
resolution that our office prepared that we
propose that
you adopt."
2022-08-22,thank you MRS. Clark.
2022-08-22,I guess you would invite if anyone would like to make a motion and second and there would be a vote.
2022-08-22,is there a motion to adopt?
2022-08-22,you have to have public comment before you vote.
2022-08-22,"sorry, thank you. For members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item 2, please line up at the podium or calling in press star 3 to raise your hand to be
added to the queue."
2022-08-22,"I think there has to be a motion on the floor before we
take public comment. You just have to take public comment before you act. It doesn't have to be on a motion on the floor."
2022-08-22,I thought if we didn't have something on the floor to act we wouldn't have public comment.
2022-08-22,"if you prefer to proceed that way you can. It isn't required, but I understand what you are saying and maybe it does make it-make sense if that is how you prefer to proceed. Just have to have public comment before you vote."
2022-08-22,right.
2022-08-22,"it appears there is no public comment. Is there a
motion to adopt the resolution? Board member wechter makes the motion. Is there a second?"
2022-08-22,I move we adopt the resolution as written.
2022-08-22,thank you. Is there a second?
2022-08-22,second.
2022-08-22,"thank you MR.-board member
brookter seconds. The resolution passes."
2022-08-22,public comment.
2022-08-22,public comment again?
2022-08-22,why don't you just because of the board members suggestion. I think that is a good one.
2022-08-22,"members of the public who
like to make public comment on 3, line up the podium or press
star 3 to raise your hand to be added to the queue. There
appears to be no public comment."
2022-08-22,I have a question. This is member carrion.
2022-08-22,"yes, MRS. Carrion."
2022-08-22,"I want to clarify as a
absent member due to unexpected family matters, does this mean
as a board member I would not be permitted to vote because I'm calling in?"
2022-08-22,"that's correct. The only condition under which a member
can appear remotely is if it is for covid related
reasons."
2022-08-22,understood.
2022-08-22,"alright. I will take a vote
on the resolution, on
the motion.
[Roll call]"
2022-08-22,"this is for the covid policy? I vote in favor of
adopting the
resolution.
[Roll call continued]"
2022-08-22,"we have 5 yeses so motion
passes. Moving to item 3, nomination is election of
osers. Discussion and possible action. The floor is
now open
for discussion."
2022-08-22,"how do you feel about it?
There are e-mails that have come out so we can have open discussion about election. I do like what jana shared with
us in terms of able to have a pro tem as we really get our feet wet and get a opportunity
to spend time together and spend time with sheriff office and dpa but also happy if folks want to run from the floor to have nominations in order to continue. Thoughts?"
2022-08-22,I agree with your thoughts.
2022-08-22,"I think I would-I'm supportive as well since we have two members absent, I
think it is prude nt to hold the election over and
have a pro tem."
2022-08-22,"I think as we do that, then
I will actually okay. I'm nominate myself as the pro tem for the group as we think about everybody coming together and having the rest of our colleagues come forward unless someone else wants to
take on that responsibility."
2022-08-22,you are welcome.
2022-08-22,"things we sign up
for."
2022-08-22,"so, when you are done discussing and someone wants to make a motion just reminder because you are now taking an
action, you should invite public comment. I know you haven't-no one-well I guess-"
2022-08-22,"I can make a formal motion.
I move-it would be a conjunkative-I move that we-I'll do it at once. I move we hold over the election for officers until the next meeting where our two absent members
are present and that board member-I like the term commissioner, so commissioner
dj brookter be the pro tem PRESIDENT."
2022-08-22,do you have a second?
2022-08-22,I could be the second.
2022-08-22,now you should invite public comment.
2022-08-22,"for members of the public who would like to make public comment on line item 3, please line up at the podium or if you are calling in, press star 3 to raise your hand to be
added to
the queue. There appears to be
no public comment.
I'll take a
vote for --
:"
2022-08-22,"both on the motion
to
continue the elections.
[Roll call]"
2022-08-22,"we have 5 ayes.
The motion
to continue is passed.
Passes.
And on the motion to nominate
board member brookter to pro
tem PRESIDENT.
[Roll call]"
2022-08-22,"5 ayes, the motion
passes."
2022-08-22,"I want to say thank you to my colleagues. We literally just did that from the floor and this is
:   I think
it is pro tem but I do think just as many folks here bring the knowledge and wisdom to get
us through our meetings over
the next couple months or this month, so I appreciate the confidence and the vote and
again we know it is pro tem position and I will do my duty and make sure I meet with all my fellow commissioners and making the decisions to do things we need to do as a body. With that, secretary do you
want to go to item number 4?"
2022-08-22,"congratulation pro tem brookter. Item 4 is rules of
order information and discussion. Before you are the samples of the rules of order.
The floor is now open for
discussion."
2022-08-22,"are we-now-we have a pro tem
but is this a conversation-do we want to put the bylaws over for the next meeting?"
2022-08-22,"it is just for discussion right now. It is not agendized
as action item so you couldn't adopt rules or bylaws today so more just discussion and I provided samples. Some are more involved, some are less involved and I thought it would be a good idea for people to get a sense how a meeting works before deciding whether you want more involved or less
involved rules of order."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. So, we got a
opportunity to receive documents from counsel in terms
of how we conduct and the
orders in which we conduct business here from counsel. Is there any discussion or conversations or thoughts that colleagues have on
what we
received?
:   Police commission rules of order I looked at rules of order for several other city commissioners, not the fire
department but the ethics, entertainment, one or two others and also looked at the rules of order for other oversight entities around the country and sent a draft around to people I know in the oversight field who had served on boards to get their input,
so I made some I think miner changes because MRS. Clark indicated which conflict with city law. Primarily designed to make it more collaborative rather then putting too much authority in one person's
hands. I feel as a few board it would be good to as much as
possible share our varied backgrounds and expertise and
have a opportunity to bring item 4th for discussion on the agenda rather then perhaps one person having significant authority over that.
I know a former police commissioner told
me that there was a point where the chair PRESIDENT Of the police commission routinely
kept the items off the agenda which prevented them being heard so like to avoid something like that because I'm
a strong believer in inclusiveness and everyone's voices heard. We have a lot of different opinions and will hear from different communities and think we want to bring all
that into our discussion. I know MRS. Leungsent it out. I don't think it is in the packet because one version had the city attorney comments and changes. I printed it out without those, but I think
those should be considered."
2022-08-22,"thank you commissioner wechter. Absolutely. That makes total sense. As a new body and as we formulate and look how we conduct business I think being collaborative and really working across each of
our talents and each of our strengths is going to be making a really strong commission and insuring we are doing what it is we are supposed to do. Any
other colleagues have comments?"
2022-08-22,"as a practical matter it generally is good to have a key person to actually vet through
things and as I understand based on past bylaws it would be a collaborative approach between the inspector general as well as the PRESIDENT Or
vice PRESIDENT, so I think all commissioners are welcome to submit things and I think if we see any pattern where someone is left out I think that is something to be brought up in the public. I don't see a
problem of actually excluding items, but just as a practical matter and for the commission secretary to be able to efficiently work it really
should be channeled through the inspector general as
well as
the PRESIDENT."
2022-08-22,"thank you for that
commissioner soo. Any other commissioners, any
other
comments? Discussion? I think with that, since-"
2022-08-22,"sorry, I want to add. I do think it is important to kind
of like make sure we
have more
inclusive voices and leverage the different
strengths of the
members and also understand
julie's point about practicality. I worry about what jason was saying making sure agenda items are not pushed so if there is a way we
can make a compromise and maybe-PRESIDENT Can have the final say but like I it would be nice if we can make sure
that we include the agenda items the rest of the board feels is important."
2022-08-22,"I say the way my past commission and commissioner
brookter you also sat on prior commissions, often timeatize is the commissioners who raise a particular item towards the end
of the meeting for
future items to be agendized so that is something that is open to the public, so I think that's where
we get the community input and oversight and so I think it
would be pretty
transparent if somebody's agenda item is left
off and if it is consistent."
2022-08-22,absolutely. Also taking the fact we meet monthly gives that opportunity. Sometimes for more robust agenda to make sure everybody's items are on the agenda as we continue to move forward. Okay. Is there any other discussion there on the bylaw section?
2022-08-22,"I can snd the specific
addition but they have appointments to commissions done in consultation between the PRESIDENT And vice
PRESIDENT And that if the PRESIDENT Removes someone from a committee over that member's objections the PRESIDENT Shall
state the reason for removing the member and again that goes towards transparency which we talked a lot about transparency in the sheriff
department and law enforcement. I think we
have to impose the level of transparency on our operation so we are very open to the public and accountable."
2022-08-22,"absolutely.
Absolutely.
Anymore discussion there? Seeing none, open up for public comment."
2022-08-22,"members of the public who like to make public comment on
item 4, please line up at the podium or press star 3 to raise your hand to be added
to the
queue. It appears
there is no public comment."
2022-08-22,"okay, go to item number 5."
2022-08-22,"line item 5. recruitment of
inspector general.
Discussion.
Deputy city attorney jana clark."
2022-08-22,"I just thought it is good idea to share my experience and I think couple mentioned you had been on boards or commissions so that is for discussion but just what I have seen in the past and and thought it worked well is that the someone fwraum from the department of human resources
comes in and makes a presentation. The last
experience I had the hiring of juvenile probation chief. Department of human resources came to the body and explained what they could do for the body
in terms of recruitment and
screening and things like that, and so what they did was worked with the body to come up with a job announcement at a public meeting. That can all happen
at a public meeting and then basically members weighed in on what they wanted the job announcement to look like and then dhr went back and drafted the job announcement based on what the members suggested and
I want to say dhr brought samples of prior searches for comparable positions to give a idea, suggestions for how to proceed, and then based on the
members comments or commissioners comments, drafted
a job announcement and then
brought it back to the body to
adopt and then they also shared
how they could help to based on minimum qualifications identified in the job announcement how they make the initial screen for people who
did or didn't meet the minimum qualifications and the next
step of the process is again working with-this is how it
worked before, working with
dhr. They made arrangements for interviews of those who had made the minimum qualification before the body and there MAY
have been one step in the middle where they met the minimum qualifications and widdled it down. Once you are actually looking at applicants, those sessions are generally held in closed session. It
could be open session too, but the reason for doing that is because someone might be in a job. We all applied for jobs when we had a job and didn't want the former job to know we are looking for a job so that is one reason it tends to work in their experience this was their advice to hold those
meetings where you are considering applicants, real live bodies to do the screening and interviews in closed
session. And then once those interviews happened then the body meets and in my past
experience and they selected the person to fill that position and I think that is how it also worked with the police commission but I had
less experience with that. My suggestion would be at the
outset at the next meeting to invite dhr to come and share with the body what they have done in the past for different-I think they have done it differently. I think there are also some entities that have some bodies that have public bodies that
have hired a recruiting firm to do part of it job and whether or not that is in your budget not sure. I think it is good idea for them to be inviting to come to a meeting and share what they have done in the past and what works and doesn't work based on their experience because they
are the experts in the city. I know member wechter also shared some job announcements. Anyway, that would be my suggestion. But it is
up to this body how you decide to
proceed, but those are our suggestions."
2022-08-22,thank you city attorney clark. Any discussion there colleagues in regards-
2022-08-22,"I think I had a point of clarification. I understood that when this body was formed in the contmplation of a officer of inspector general that civil service MAY have
come up with a description and
a potential salary for the position?"
2022-08-22,"I dont think so, but I can check and let you know."
2022-08-22,okay.
2022-08-22,"if there is, we love to get that information. If it could
be passed along to us."
2022-08-22,"director henderson told me the salary has been set for
classification 0961 which is department head for small department head and
the range is $153 thousand to 2
:   The chart shows that is below the comparable position in the san francisco bay area. This is-I have a lot of experience working with oversight practitioners around the country. This position is unlike any other position in the city and county of san francisco. It is a newly created position that create a department from scratch that will be doing oversight of a body that not had civilian oversight before. I think we should as MRS. Clark said, go to the professionals, invite the recruitment firms that have done this in the past. There
are two that recently completed recruitment, one for city
berkeley and one for sonoma county. It is bob murray associates and the other is escaping my mind, but they v have a lot of experience in the field. They have done it for comparable positions around the country so they know the very specific qualifications
required to do the job of
establishing a department, investigate complaints against
members of the sheriff department who's primarily responsible is custodial and two, conduct audits of that department and those are somewhat different skillsets so you want someone who can do it all and has the background and experience to set this up from the very beginning. It is not a position for someone to learn how to do it, you need someone who is really skilled to get it right the first time because as I alluded to earlier, I saw it done very badly once and it tooks years if not decades for the agencies to recover from it. And other agencies one in chicago that was abolished and had to start all over again. I think everyone involved in this
wants the entity to succeed,
wants it fairly and effectively
so that is why I advocate a outside consulting firm and how
to get the salary raised for comparable positions to attract the necessary talent and not sure who sets those positions, but I think they should
establish a separate job classification not based on department size because again I think inspector
general is a
very very different type of position then the existing department heads we have in the city."
2022-08-22,"agreed. Thank you member wechter and I think I heard is having the conversation with dhr. That would be who we would have the conversation
with. Thank you for that and also thank you deputy city attorney clark for
that advice and counsel. Anything from colleagues?"
2022-08-22,"I just had a quick question for city attorney clark. How long did that recruitment
process take?"
2022-08-22,"sorry -- am I on? Okay. I
want to say that it
was a pretty accelerated process. Trying to remember back. The
former chief left the end of NOVEMBER and want to say they were interviewing in DECEMBER and JANUARY and the person was on-board shortly thereafter. the person they ended up selecting was already a city employee so MAY have gone quicker because of that but someone with the dist
rth district attorney office who came as the chief probation officer. Dont think it was more then 3 months. The end of
NOVEMBER is when the former chief resigned and the new chief came on-board and like weeks later covid hit and covid was the first week of MARCH. That is why I'm pretty sure it
was two months, so yeah -- but what I recommend is if you-I do think it is a good idea to hear from dhr and the secretary could invite representatives from that department to the next meeting and they could tell you a lot more
about the process. Because I want part of hiring outside firm, I know it is something done, just don't know any details of that if that is faster or slower, I don't know."
2022-08-22,"it is roughly like two months, maybe quicker if it
was-because of the pandemic?"
2022-08-22,that was my experience in the past.
2022-08-22,"just a point of clarification, dpa
will be like
the interim to help with investigative cases until we find our inspector?"
2022-08-22,"in terms of what happens investigating complaints against or that relate to the sheriff department or investigating the sheriff department, now that is the sheriff responsibility and the sheriff has chosen to enter
into mou with dpa to handle the investigations for the sheriff department but that is between the sheriff and dpa
and that is not-they are not-I guess effectively they are doing the
job of the inspector general
now, but it is by arrangement
the sheriff made mose arrangements. The sheriff could terminate the mou and continue to handle things as
they have done decades in-house
if he chose to do that."
2022-08-22,"okay, thank you."
2022-08-22,until the inspector general is up and running.
2022-08-22,member soo.
2022-08-22,"more recently we had a couple years now that we had new executive director for the department on the status of
women so we went to the department of human resources and they gave us training. We had to go through certified training what kind of questions you ask during the interview process and also sign a statement of non disclosure and I don't like to go on heresay so don't want to put
you on the spot director henderson but rather not say what I think you told me in the past and rather you be able to answer directly. First of all, I want to thank you for everything you have done. All the extra hours to
get us going. I think your staff has been over-looked and you are over-looked so I want to publicly thank you for everything you have done. I understand you MAY have candidates that are already available who have been vetted by dpa and I say that because these national search firms can be quite expensive.
We had consultants before and sometimes you don't end up turning up anybody so I think if we have available candidates I think it is prudent to go through them first before pulling the trigger on a national search firm that could be very expensive. I don'ts think we have the
budget right
now."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. That has been discussion and conversation that we definitely have been
having and see member
wechter."
2022-08-22,"for the stated reasons with all due respect I think that is a bad path to go down. I think
we want to advertise widely. I
don't think we want to accept candidates how one person knows. I think it should be openly advertised and all candidates should be able to apply and take the time to do this carefully and I looked at the budget and think we have a good deal of money in the budget but berkeley found the money to do this, sonoma county found the money to do this, I think it was a worthwhile investment and I think a lot of experts in the field will tell
you that. When you-I have a letter here
:   Who worked at oversight agencies
including department of police accountability-dont know if
:   Don't know when letters come through e-mail, but it argues very forcefully
to do a nation wide professionally managed recruitment and if you like I can read it into the record, which-"
2022-08-22,"I like to hear from director henderson first what candidates
MAY be in the offering first. If we do open it up anyway I think the candidate said would probably reapply possibly. Director henderson-sorry to put you on the spot."
2022-08-22,"I was going to say depy city attorney clark, because it isn't necessarily on the agenda. It is to have discussion, but is this
something that we should garner more information who the candidates are sent to us currently and also receiving information that member wechter has I think would be good for us as a body to have so we can make a more totality conversation and discussion how to move forward."
2022-08-22,"so, what is on the agenda is recruitment of inspector general, so my understanding is you are discussing ways you would recruit an inspector general and I offered one suggestion, which is to bring
in dhr to explain how they handled recruitment for another commission in the past, so I think if-it is up to you at
this point. If you want to hear from anyone about how their suggestions for how to
recruit an inspector general, that is on the agenda,
you can do that. Ultimately it is up to this body what process you
decide to adopt and who you ultimately choose. It would be
up to the body. But I'm sure
that the process I'm sure
will-sure dhr will
advise and I probably will afterwards too,
you have to advertise it and give anyone who meets the minimum qualifications the same opportunity basically."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. Colleagues how do you feel? If we receive information who the candidates are and the information that
member wechter has?"
2022-08-22,"not necessarily specific candidates but the criteria of people who come
through dpa."
2022-08-22,"okay. If paul is okay with presenting that information.
If you have it readily available."
2022-08-22,"the information I had was just groups of folks that I have talked to that are
interested in the position I think would do well in the position but I echo the same
thing that your legal counsel advertised, it is this body choice how they want to proceed. The issue I was raising when I spoke with all you individually and never given the names of who the folks remember and wont do that now either because I think those folks want to apply on
their own to be considered fairly and whatever packet or package way however you want to
proceed. From my perspective the issue was and I think we
just heard very clearly from MRS. Clark is dpa is going to continue in the meantime as long as we have the permission authority from the sheriff office and that
continues to do the investigations. The issue that I would raise that I dont know you guys discussed yet is
what the time hp line would be until you have your staff where your questions that gets
answered, your inquiries, reports, analysis kind of stuff but I think many of you had interest in how and when that
gets done is also contingent on when the staff is hired to be brought in so what you should be also having a conversation about in my humble opinion is what kind of process is going to be most efficient in order to get to whatever goal you guys are going to get to. That
said, the folks I know that are interested are likely to remain interested and I'm happy to follow whatever direction and rules or standards you
want to follow to be as helpful as I can."
2022-08-22,thank you for that. Member wechter.
2022-08-22,"director henderson, since you are here, could you clarify the issue about the hiring of a chief position for the office of inspector general that you discussed with me a
couple
weeks ago?"
2022-08-22,"it is also-hiring-when you say the chief, do you mean the chief of staff at the office of inspector general or the inspector general?"
2022-08-22,"no, director henderson described it as a cross between MRS. Hawkins position, chief of
staff and the chief of investigations positions at the department of police accountability, correct? You
said that person had been hired. The mayor had their
name. The job had not been advertise #d so I would like to know and the board should want to know and community as well, has someone been hired as a staff member for the office of inspector general
other then
MR. Leung?"
2022-08-22,"that is not on the agenda,
so-but -- why don't we talk off-line about that? I'll e-mail you tomorrow about that okay?"
2022-08-22,okay.
2022-08-22,I'm not aware anyone besides-not aware of anyone being hired to assist this body besides the secretary. I can say that.
2022-08-22,"same, but if that is so, we absolutely want to know who the individual is and receive the information on it."
2022-08-22,"I would like to make a
motion."
2022-08-22,to?
2022-08-22,it isn't a action item.
2022-08-22,any other discussion as it pertains to recruitment?
2022-08-22,"if we could adhere to the agenda and also talk about when
we hire the inspector
general maybe particular criteria or-I
dont know if is premature totalk about the
staffing we need?"
2022-08-22,like structure?
2022-08-22,"the number of people, but think before that-I dont think
the sheriff department has a adequate it system so that-the reporting we want. I dont know
if we are putting the cart before the horse and like to discuss the it system and having the budget for that, because if it takes more man hours because we don't
have a it system-I'm familiar with the police department and they are upgrading now and they are I think-maybe you are not at the mulineal yet. Sorry."
2022-08-22,something we can agendize in the future.
2022-08-22,that is what I recommend is suggest that for future agenda item.
2022-08-22,"great point. Great point. Any other discussion
in terms of recruitment of inspector general?"
2022-08-22,"MRS. Clark, what would we
need to do to have bob murray associate and buyers group make presentation at the next meeting when someone from hr does as well?"
2022-08-22,"I think you just put it on the agenda and invite
them."
2022-08-22,okay.
2022-08-22,and it is just informational at that point.
2022-08-22,"I just wanted to add for the recruitment process, if maybe it is helpful to work towards a deadline when we want to have
this inspector general hired by?"
2022-08-22,"I think that is something
obviously brought up. I get weary of timelines. I want to have a conversation with dhr understanding the city process and changing requisitions and
just the hiring practice sometimes can be lengthy and with laborious so if we hear from them and put dates and
action lines and timelines and milestones in there
would be best."
2022-08-22,question. Who would we talk to about getting the salary raised and classification from o961?
2022-08-22,"I can look into that and e-mail you if I can get that information. My guess
it comes from dhr."
2022-08-22,"thank you. I want to say the comparable positions has taken several months and this is established practice, it isn't something that I think can or should be rushed. I don't think the community would
want to rush this, I
think they want input and see us do it properly according to established practice. I understand we are delayed, but hiring the inspector general is probably the single most important decision this board will make. The one thing we
have very significant authority
over and these people tend to stay in those position a long time and if you dont hire the right person you are in a very poor foundation and that can doom the success of the agency and doesn't serve the city or community and just spending a million and a half or $2 million dollar and not getting
very much return."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. Concur. We want to do due
diligence and also making sure we have timelines and milestones so we hold ourselves accountability and hold other folks
and departments accountability to reach the dates and deadlains."
2022-08-22,"based on experience
it could
be between 3 months and 6 monthsed. We review the it system and what is practical going forward to getting the reports we want."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. I think we can all look at our own process in terms of getting here so we know things can take time. Anymore discussion from colleagues? Okay, seeing none, we'll open up to public comment."
2022-08-22,"members of the public who
like to make public comment on
line item 5, please line up to the podium or if calling in press star 3 to raise your hand
and be added to the
queue.
:   Again. So, my understanding of the position is they are already in the budget and that budget was
approve d by the mayor's office so any negotiations about the budget or the salaries would have to be directly with the mayor's office. It could not
be with I don't think with director henderson, but city attorney can answer that question for you. There is a
budget that was past. There were cuts this year in the budget because we didn't have the oversight committee started and so there were savings and so hopefully next year you all are fighting for that to come back into the budget. Hopefully next year in the budget process you are advocating for these positions to be different classifications, higher salaries, whatever the case MAY
be, but for right now I would say and city attorney can let me know-let you all know what that process is, is to talk to dhr. They will only follow
what is in the mayoral budget."
2022-08-22,"thank you for that. I think deputy attorney clark it is great if we can get the section within the budget to speak to these positions so we have it and armed with it as we have
these discussions in and
conversations. Any other
public comment?"
2022-08-22,no.
2022-08-22,let's go to item number 6.
2022-08-22,"line item 6, future agenda
items and scheduling
regular meeting. Discussion."
2022-08-22,"I'm used to reading the
whole thing in. Do we normally do that?"
2022-08-22,"I understand the description to be like items to be
considered for future agenda items but don't think that you are necessarily limited by that list."
2022-08-22,"no worries. Not that we were but usually is read in.
Let's go with a future agenda items and scheduling of regular meetings. I think what I hear from colleagues is we absolutely at our next meeting
we have want to have dhr come
out and begin to have
discussion with us on hiring and requisitions as well as
able to see funding. Members
that have other future agenda items they would like
to see on
the agenda? Member wechter."
2022-08-22,"I read about staffing issue at the sheriff department and that is something we learned about when we did our tours of the jails so I wonder if we can get a report on
staffing how it is changed over last 5 years
and how staffing is allocated
to the different facilities, because it seems that is a very potent issue in the
public mind
and I think-concern that son or daughter does not have access to any educational programs and that is something in the press.
Also there was a television report, a interview with
someone in the jail charged
with murder who made statements about the crime so curious what the media policy is for gaining
entry to the jail? Particularly since I think the
mission local article said you
to limit or cut down visits
because staffing issues, deputies not available to escort visitors so I like to know about that because that is also been in the news."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. What I hear is sheriff department and staffing and think it is good to get
with dan or chief to make sure the presentation reflects some of the points we have. I found in some meetings they can be very long and robust and not get to the information the body is requesting so it would behoove all of us to work together what we presented to the body to make sure when folks are reporting they report on what we are asking.
Any
other colleagues fuch r agenda items?"
2022-08-22,I have another.
2022-08-22,my apology.
2022-08-22,"are director henderson gave
figures statics in the welcome packet but his office told me the sheriff department maintains ownership of the statist ics about the work
they've done, so I would be interested in seeing statistics getting a sense of the number of complaints, how they are categorized, how they have been disposed of, all the things mentioned in the letter of agreement that would be provided on a monthly and yearly basis to give us a sense
of what the nature of the
number of complaints are.
Might be useful to get some record of lawsuits
against the sheriff department which there is a settlement or judgment. Get a sense what they are. Working for city oakland I know most of their claims against the police department involve vehicle collisions, which the way many people drive
today are probably somewhat unavoidable. Get a sense what is comparable in the sheriff department."
2022-08-22,absolutely. Also presentation from dpa on the statistics.
2022-08-22,I think I would-
2022-08-22,sheriff department.
2022-08-22,"so, the way it would work is you ask the sheriff department for that information and the sheriff department can ask those they charged
with-they provide it or can provide it themselves."
2022-08-22,okay.
2022-08-22,"I just wanted to have a request as we make the requests for the reports that the numbers be disaggregated and sometimes percentages can be very misleading so also nice to
have raw numbers. If we only had two complaints and there was one sustained that is 50 percent which looks high, but we only had two complaints so I want to make sure we
have the raw numbers to consider."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. I think we
heard earlier chief of staff hawkins received 8 files turned into 30 files so make sure we have the raw numbers and aggregates."
2022-08-22,"some agencies report number of complains against individual officers and also number of complains generated by a specific individual because my years at dpa we had certain people who generate a complaint any time they had interaction with a police officer, so that could artificially elevate the
numbers and if you didn't know that you might have a more negative opinion about the police activity in the dist rth station or unit, so having the context I think is very important."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. Look forward working with the sheriff department around those presentations to make sure we gather and get the information
and raw data the body definitely wants to see so I appreciate that. Anything else from colleagues in terms of future agenda items we like to
see?"
2022-08-22,"I don't know if there is a particular triage system, but
the severity of the complaints so those that come to us more immediately and those that are
not so immediate. For instance, someone in custody who has immediate needs then we-and they haven't been able
to get them we should know about it and be able to advice and make recommendations."
2022-08-22,absolutely. How about scheduling regular meetings? Now we are on par and on track for the 4th monday?
2022-08-22,"I think that we got
notice from sfgovtv is we
want it to be televised they don't have the staff to accommodate on the 4th monday of the month so I
dont know if MR. Leung has alternative dates where staff might be available."
2022-08-22,"I'm still working on those dates. They have a
lot of day time slots available. I don't think our charter says it has
to be televised live. The legislation says it can be recorded and so we can continue to have monday at 5:30 if you like and it would be recorded for the public."
2022-08-22,"okay. What I hear from now,
we are okay with the 4th monday of the month."
2022-08-22,"I guess I want to clarification, was it they can
record us on tv to show later? I know some commissioners are only audio recorded."
2022-08-22,it is audio recorded.
2022-08-22,audio only then?
2022-08-22,yes.
2022-08-22,"okay. I don't know if that is okay with everyone to clar
ify it is just audio."
2022-08-22,"thank you for that. Do we
have public comment?"
2022-08-22,"hello. Joanna hernandez. I
want to see if we can discuss language access. When you try to follow a complaint now on the san francisco department website everything is in english and the complaint forms are english. I feel it is very important we provide access to our communities to be
able to do that. Also, the complaint
process not just on the
undeputized staff but civilian
staff when it comes to subcontractors. Some don't have the best relationship and
I would say that with
8420 and program rehabilitation coordinators supposedly the community liaisons. I think is imperative we look at that relationship and how people are being treated when they try to provide a service inside san francisco county jail. Thank you."
2022-08-22,"thank you for that.
I think absolutely. We should ajndize at a afuture meeting to make sure we have information and presentation on language access and how folks that english isn't their first language."
2022-08-22,"I was going to say that I
worked on equal access service ordinance in 1998 or 99, so it
is law that we provide language services and to the extent that people need language interpretation during the meetings or translated materials we should also have it at our meetings as well."
2022-08-22,"absolutely. All our materials. Agreed.
Thank you
for that. Any other public comment?"
2022-08-22,"for members of the public
who like to make public comment
you MAY line up at the podium or you can call-press star 3 to raise your hand to be
added to
the queue. It appears there is no other public comment."
2022-08-22,"you want to go to item
number 7?"
2022-08-22,"hello. This is
:   Been trying to make a comment. I believe other people have been trying to make comments as well but it is a little difficult to be able to be called at the time we want to make comment. Maybe something to look into for the next meeting. My comment was I think raised my hand a couple times during the recruitment of inspector general. Withed it be preoperative to make that
comment just for the record?"
2022-08-22,"yes, that's fine."
2022-08-22,"okay, great. I think one thing that I heard
during the conversation which I want to make very clear from my understanding of the events that have happened in the development and now the implementation of this
commission is that the people voted this-for the commission a
long time ago and grateful to the people doing the work to get this. I'm grateful for the
fact there has been efforts in trying to see and people who are interested in the inspector
general position and dpa-thank
:   Leading that in
doing the kind of ground work
because the roles and
responsibilities have been available as voted by the people, right? So I think it is important to recognize that
work. Not as something nefarious like trying to choose my person or this that, but it is literally information the
people have wanted for a long time so grateful we already have potential candidates and I look forward to our city attorney indicated going
through the process as director henderson affirmed following the process of the board and what the board sets out so I want to make sure for the
record we make it very clear that isn't what is happening here. We have this process in place now excited to be part of it and it will continue to be
transapparent transparent and the board will be able
to make inquiries and decisions with guidance from our city attorney so thank you so much."
2022-08-22,thank you MRS. Carrion.
2022-08-22,thank you member carrion. Go to item 7.
