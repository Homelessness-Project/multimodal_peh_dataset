Meanwhile, a Tuesday report6 from Acting State Auditor Michael Tilden found that California isnt effectively using the states surplus properties to alleviate the affordable housing crisis  one reason why more than 1.4 million low-income households were unable to access affordable housing in 2021. The report found that California could build more than 32,000 affordable housing units under Newsoms 2019 executive order directing state agencies to identify surplus land for that purpose. However, after surveying more than 44,000 parcels of surplus land, the state Department of General Services identified just 92 suitable for development. Of those, its made only 19 available for more than 1,700 units of affordable housing. The departments current pace means it would take another seven years to make the remaining 73 properties available  though adding just one staff member could slash that time by more than two years. Tilden wrote The states need for affordable housing is significantly outpacing its production, which is negatively affecting Californians. High housing costs often result in families becoming behind on their rent and going without food, utilities, or health care. Further, a lack of affordable housing correlates with a significant increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness. Also Tuesday, Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Woodland Democrat, unveiled a bill7 that would require the state to create an online database of affordable housing listings and help low-income applicants simplify their search for a place to live.

Gavin Newsom has announced a suite of proposals aimed at helping homeless people get housing, health care, and access to services, making homelessness a top priority for the states budget in 2020. Newsom released the plan in a memo yesterday, ahead of his formal annual budget proposal which is expected by Friday. The two biggest parts of the proposal are a new 750 million fund that would provide county and municipal governments with funding to get people into housing and to help keep them from losing their homes in the first place, and another 700 million aimed at addressing health needs by expanding the states Medicaid alternative, Medi-Cal, to better assist people with mental health services and integrate Medi-Cal with other social services that will help people get into stable housing. In addition, Newsom signed an executive order 1directing state agencies to identify vacant state-owned land and buildings that can be used for emergency shelters and for longer-term housing needs.","homeless, homelessness",4,4,False,True,1,0

Californias homeless population has grown sharply in recent years, largely due to a shortage of affordable housing thats gotten worse as big tech companies have attracted new employees, driving up housing prices. From January 2018 to January 2019, Californias homeless population has increased by about 21,0002 to a total of just over 150,000, according to a new US Department of Housing and Urban Development report.

Newsoms upcoming budget plan is aimed at4 addressing homelessness at all levels, funding existing facilities that serve people without housing, building more shelters and transitional housing, providing temporary safe parking 5locations for people living out of cars and RVs, and funding rent and other assistance for people before they get evicted.

The effects will be limited, since affordable housing is only a small part of the overall housing sector. In another twist, the fees are not necessarily paid out of builders wallets. The dollars taken in by the Department of Building Inspection during the permitting process for affordable housing projects are provided for by the Mayors Office of Housing and Community Development, which is, according to the Chronicle the main source of funding for affordable housing programs. Its fairly ludicrous, Sam Moss, executive director of the Mission Housing Development Corp., told the Chronicle, for one city department to recoup a portion of the funds that had been granted by another city department. Breeds bill should eliminate that practice. But fee relief needs to be extended to all home building in San Francisco. Eliminating punitive charges could mean the difference between profit and loss for a contractor planning to build homes, which would mean the difference in the homes being built or not. Affordable housing projects receive a great deal of attention - and piles of public dollars. Its a mistake, though, to focus on this single facet of housing. The stock of affordable housing for all is increased by the addition of higher-priced homes, even luxury models.

As I go through the exercise in my head, I view it as if I were the one who was homeless. If I had to, I think to myself, would this location work? That day as a ten-year-old, I was already well aware of the Golden Rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I concluded then - as I continue to conclude now - that allowing people to live on the street as that man was doing, along with countless others that Ive come across over the years, was not abiding by the Golden Rule. People shouldnt have to live like that, and herein lies a fundamental question of an important debate in America what should be done to help homeless people? The rate of homelessness in America increased by 2.7 from 2018 through 2019, in spite of record-low unemployment rates and a roaring economy nationwide. So why the increase? The answer to the question lies in the location of the problem. According to a San Francisco Chronicle article published last December, While the latest counts compiled by the federal government show that Americas homeless population is growing again after more than a decade of declines, the entire national increase and more can be attributed to California alone. In other words, homelessness continues to be on the decline in the U.S., if we exclude California. To their credit, the Chronicle looks inward1 in assigning the blame, stating, The dire statistics underscore the extent to which state and local policies drive the failure. The state and local policies they refer to are in the bluest of blue states, and the cities impacted are almost exclusively run by Democrats. The homeless problem in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles is the result we can expect when leftists run a government, and voters continue to double-down by voting them into office every year. Yet somehow, the New York Times cant help but try to point the finger at the federal government and President Trump. According to the New York Times last year, potential solutions from the Trump Administration could be problematic as there is, fear Mr. Trumps pending executive order could crack down on homeless encampments, give more resources to police departments to clear shanty towns and threaten cities that fail to control their homeless populations. Californias homelessness grew at over 16, but the New York Times thinks that taking a tough stance would be wrong. The compassionate thing to do, according to the Times and the Left in general, is to continue to allow people to live on the streets. Thats compassionate, dont you know. The California Right to Rest Act of 2018 states just that. The state government is working on the problem of affordable housing, it tells us, but in the meantime, its OK for people to live wherever they want. To hell with the taxpayers who want to be able to walk on the sidewalks in front of their homes without stepping in human feces, that homeless person has a right to live there and the kind-hearted thing to do is allow them to.

Whats needed to solve homelessness in California is the free market, not more government intervention. Liberal, big-government policies are what brought this mess on in the first place. Rent control is a disincentive to any prospective real estate investor, which will result in less investment. Less investment in real estate will result in less housing, and less housing will result in even more homelessness a vicious cycle. Its time for true compassion and a common-sense approach to the problem. First, its not OK for people to live on the streets. Its not compassionate to the homeless and its not fair to the taxpayer. Scrap the stupid laws advocating for living on the streets, construct shelters, and bring the homeless in for safe and humane housing on a temporary basis. Second, provide effective care for the mentally ill and drug-addicted members of the homeless population, which makes up a majority. Allowing them to exist as they are, living on the streets as they deal with their challenges being untreated, is wrong its cruel. Help the addicted to get clean, help the sick to get well, and use a proper approach for those who can do neither. Finally, stop being so hostile to corporations and partner with them to employ the homeless. Work with businesses, dont just tax them. The next time you see a homeless person shivering in the cold and muttering under his breath, consider the misery theyre dealing with. Then, perform the mental exercise of putting yourself in their shoes. How would you handle the situation? Where would you be planning on spending the night? And then, consider the root causes of the problem.

Auditor State wasted 2.7 billion for affordable housing California State Auditor Elaine Howle at a press briefing in Sacramento. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters Californias affordable housing shortage is due in part to the states failure to develop a well-coordinated plan, which allowed a state agency to mismanage and ultimately lose 2.7 billion that could have financed thousands of affordable housing units, according to a scathing report the state auditor released Tuesday19. The news comes as California scrambles to find permanent homes20 for homeless people temporarily housed in hotels amid the pandemic and thousands of renters stare down an eviction moratorium that expires in February21. Although the state needs to build an estimated 125,000 affordable housing units annually through 2029 to meet demand, its only supported an average of 19,000 units annually, the auditor found. A major factor Californias labyrinthine financing process. While most large states have one department that handles affordable housing funding, California has five  and they report to different elected officials, meaning no one oversees the entire system, the Los Angeles Times reports22. The lack of state oversight has also slowed development in cities and counties, which as of June 2019 had issued building permits for only 11 of the affordable units in their housing plans. To overhaul the process, the auditor recommended eliminating one of the state agencies, improving communication among the others, and strengthening state oversight of local development. On Monday, the California Department of Housing and Community Development announced23 it would temporarily pause some affordable housing funding programs while other state agencies revised their funding criteria in order to achieve increased collaboration and alignment for our customers. 2.","homeless, affordable housing",57,11,True,True,1,0

It is interesting that one of the downfalls of Nishi turned out to be lack of Affordable Housing.

Senate Bill 5, introduced last week, would allow municipalities, counties, joint powers agencies, and certain other entities to use some of the property tax revenue they currently are required to send to the state to support education to build housing instead. The approach bears a strong resemblance to redevelopment agencies, which were eliminated in 2011 on the recommendation of Governor Jerry Brown. Redevelopment agencies supplied the largest ongoing source of revenue for affordable housing, an estimated 1.5 billion annually at their peak. But the funds werent always used as intended, and they were eliminated to help balance the state budget.

Californias conservatorship laws came under a national spotlight last summer, first when pop star Britney Spears sought to overturn her conservatorship16, then when some Republican recall candidates said homeless Californians should be forced into mental health treatment17. Newsom dismissed the idea that his focus on conservatorships was a political response to the recall, arguing that the issue of encampments is not directly tied to the issue of conservatorships.

Heres a quick rundown San Francisco31 saw a 3.5 drop in its homeless population, with volunteers counting 7,754 unhoused people on a single night in February, down from the 8,035 counted at the same point in 2019. Most of the rest of the Bay Area32 saw sizable upticks, with Santa Clara County notching a 3 increase in its homeless population, Alameda County a 22 increase and Contra Costa County a 35 increase compared to 2019. San Jose, which is in Santa Clara County, saw an 11 uptick in its homeless population, while Oakland, in Alameda County, saw its number of unhoused residents skyrocket by 24. Fremont, also in Alameda County33, saw a whopping 69 increase in the number of homeless residents. Orange County34 notched a more than 16 decrease, with 5,718 homeless residents this year compared to 6,680 in 2019. Final tallies of homeless populations arent due until July. But experts say the early numbers suggest that an unprecedented amount of federal and state money to combat homelessness35 has made a difference in some locations, even as the crisis worsens in others and many voters express discontent36 with the states handling of the issue.

West Coast progressives have sought to decriminalize public camping, drug consumption, and property crimes because they view authority as the problem, not part of the solution. Second, because progressives discount the moral foundation of purity, they overlook and excuse the filth associated with street camping. Homeless encampments have proved to be havens for trash, needles, drugs, human waste, and infectious diseases, yet West Coast progressives have fought to âœstop the sweepsâ of tent cities and filed lawsuits against encampment cleanups. They prioritize âœcare for our curbside neighborsâ over sanitation, cleanliness, and public-health concerns. Third, because progressives discount in-group loyalty, they do not see a significant homeless influx as a problem. They tend to make no distinction between the local and nonlocal homeless population and reject concerns about cities becoming magnets for homeless migrants as âœxenophobicâ and âœhomeless-hating.â Put simply, progressive cities have adopted a philosophy of all compassion and no enforcement that creates a cycle of permissiveness, enablement, and disorder.","homeless, homelessness",8,8,True,True,1,0

Martin, letting stand a ruling that amounts to a broad curb on police powers in California and eight other states to stop people from sleeping on public property if no other shelter is available. For Los Angeles and dozens of other cities across the West, all struggling to deal with a growing number of people living on the streets, Monday made clear that the only solutions to homelessness are more housing and more services. By declining to take the case on Monday, the high court let stand a 2018 ruling from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that it is unconstitutional to prosecute people for sleeping on public property if enough shelter or housing isnt available as an alternative. Police can still intervene when there is criminal activity, however, such as drug use. Dozens of cities and counties across the West, including Los Angeles, had urged the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the Boise ruling.

On Wednesday22, the mayors of Californias 13 biggest cities emphasized that homelessness remains one of their main priorities23. They threw their support behind the homelessness funding proposals in the Legislatures version of the state budget, which includes 350 million for local governments that Newsoms propsosal does not. Both Newsom and the Legislature propose using 600 million in federal funds to convert motel rooms into supportive housing24 for homeless Californians  though local governments would likely be on the hook for the motels operating costs and supportive services.

Photo by Julie Leopo for CalMatters How serious is Californias housing crisis? Well, Long Beach City College recently authorized homeless students to sleep in their cars29 in a secure parking lot. And at least four University of California campuses have resorted to renting hotel rooms for hundreds of students unable to secure housing  though theyre offering different levels of financial assistance, Ryan Loyola and Sindhu Ananthavel report for CalMatters College Journalism Network30. At UC San Diego, undergraduates must pay for their own hotel rooms  which works out to about 5,000 per month even with a discounted rate negotiated by the university. Contributing to the steep costs, many students are forced to eat out or order in food because the hotel rooms dont have kitchens. Add lengthy commutes and frequent shuttling between hotels, and you get a recipe that some students say have caused them to fall behind in their classes. Rojina Bozorgnia, a senior at UC Santa Cruz31 Its not really a sustainable way to deal with the housing crisis.

I believe the San Francisco media push will encourage other media to report on homelessness in new ways, with a view to assessing accountability and offering solutions. The five-day media initiative led by a local daily newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, and starting on 29 June, will feature stories on multiple causes of homelessness and potential solutions. It will involve almost 70 local, national and international news outlets. Describing homelessness as a human catastrophe, Farha urged all governments to recognize it as a human rights crisis and commit to eradicating this global phenomenon by 2030, in line with the new Sustainable Development Goals. The media have an important role to play in this without public pressure, this global crisis will continue, she noted. Farha also noted that the initiative is an opportunity to shift the conversation on homelessness from one of individual failure to government responsibility and systemic causes. In her latest report to the UN Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur had noted that homelessness is a fact of life in all countries of the world, regardless of the level of development of their economic or governance syste Underlining homelessness as one of the most egregious violations of the right to housing, she urged UN Member States to address its root causes by implementing national strategies anchored in human rights.

Photo by Anne Wernikoff, CalMatters The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday passed a controversial ordinance30 outlawing homeless people from sitting, camping, sleeping or storing personal property near schools, day care centers, libraries, parks, homeless shelters, tunnels, bridges, freeway overpasses and other key public areas. If signed by Mayor Eric Garcetti, the rule could effectively make nearly half of the citys land off-limits to the homeless31  an abrupt shift in policy that underscores the increasing pressure on politicians32 to solve a crisis whose proportions only seem to keep growing. Whether the ordinance will actually make a difference remains to be seen Before enforcement can proceed at a specific location, the city council will have to give its approval33  a process that could drag on for months. Its also unclear if the city has enough shelter or services for all the homeless people in question, or how it will handle those who refuse aid. Further complicating matters, each city council member is likely to apply the ordinance differently  creating a complex and contradictory patchwork of policies. City councilwoman Nithya Raman34 This takes us back to what weve been doing in Los Angeles for a very long time, which is 15 council members responding to homelessness in 15 different ways, in a really ad hoc manner. 3.

There are no hulking public apartment complexes here, nor are there homeless people begging for money on the subway, because there isnt a subway though there is a downtown light-rail system. Instead, people here stay in their cars and drive from work to home, making it possible to completely avoid seeing poverty at all. Lisa Silva, for instance, has spent weeks sleeping behind a library. I met Silva in a well-manicured parking lot for the countys social- services office, where she was sitting on a bench, guarded by her dog Shorty, who was in a shopping cart nearby. Silva had lived in a duplex in San Jose for seven years, until the landlord decided to make it into a single-family apartment and charge more rent. Silva, who is on Social Security Insurance, could no longer pay the rent-she only receives 900 a month-so she became homeless.

We saw a shift in the pandemic with people moving here from higher priced markets, said Andrea Davis, executive director of Homeword, a Missoula-based affordable housing nonprofit. Missoula has been on that list of great places to relocate for a long time, but the pandemic just accelerated that change. In Missoula, home values shot up 57 from January 2020 to January 2022, while housing inventory declined 58, according to the Zillow data. Other cities on the list include Provo and Salt Lake City in Utah Port Angeles, Washington and Raleigh, North Carolina.

DEVELOPING TO MEET DEMAND Missoula was already on a path to an affordable housing crisis prior to the pandemic. Though the demand to live in Missoula increased in recent years, the area was slow to add new housing, apartments and townhomes, in part due to zoning regulations and difficult approval processes for the city and county, Wahlberg said. Nearly a decade of underbuilding after the Great Recession also contributed to reduced inventory and less construction of entry-level homes, Davis said. In response to the accelerated housing crisis, the city of Missoula and Missoula County have each started working on affordable housing initiatives and overhauling their zoning codes with propelling development as one of the primary goals. Over the last year, the city reorganized its office of Community Planning, Development and Innovation to dedicate more resources to reviewing and approving building permits, and began prioritizing residential permits over commercial permits or other land use activity.","housing crisis, affordable housing",67,6,True,True,3,1

Davis said the apartments on Cooley Street in Missoulas Westside neighborhood will start to become available at the end of 2022, and the full project will be available for lease early next year.

The model seeks to fund up-front costs through donations and investments from the private sector, and asks only that the city government repay investors if the program meets its goals.

Lockers could allow people to meet social workers, go to work or interview for jobs without having to schlep all of their belongings. Last year, the Berkeley City Council approved a project to provide storage space so homeless people can safely store their belongings while they seek a permanent place to put them.

Homeless activist Amy Farah Weiss, a founder of Saint Francis Homelessness Challenge, is launching a program to help people living in homeless encampments transition from hard drugs to medical marijuana. Though no studies have proved conclusively that medical marijuana helps curb addictions, there is evidence to suggest that medicinal pot might help addicts into recovery. Weiss said medical marijuana can also help reduce the anxiety caused by homelessness, helping people cope with pain and helping them sleep. Weiss said her pilot program could have other benefits. First, because a legal form of identification is required to apply for a medical marijuana card, this program would encourage people to apply for IDs, which would also allow them easier access to housing options in the future. She said that in the process of applying for the card, homeless people get to talk to a doctor. The growing cannabis industry could lead to future jobs for the homeless, such as rolling joints for medical marijuana facilities, she said.

San Francisco is changing its plans to uxe the citys Moscone Center and the beloved Palace of Fine Arts to house some of its homeless population to fight the coronavirus disease. City officials had intended to use Moscone Center2, a popular conference venue favored by the regions tech companies, to shelter up to 4003 people living in existing homeless shelters in the city. The goal was to thin out existing homeless shelters in the city by distributing some residents to makeshift shelters. That would create more space for physical distancing to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the homeless community. And on Monday, the city announced it was turning to its beloved4 Palace of Fine Arts facilities, originally built in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific Exposition, to house up to 162 people. But now officials say the city will focus more heavily on hotel rooms to house the homeless. Neither Moscone nor the Palace will be used for homeless moved from other shelters, Trent Rhorer, director of San Franciscos Department of Human Services, told Curbed SF.5 Instead, physical distancing in the shelters will be achieved by moving vulnerable individuals from shelter into hotel rooms. Moscone Center will still be used to house members of the citys homeless population, but no more than 200 at a time, as the San Francisco Chronicle6 reports. The center will house those exiting rooms used for self-isolation and who have tested negative for the disease or are recovering and have tested negative, according to Curbed SF.7 The change of plans means that officials now need more rooms, roughly 1,0008 more than were originally projected according to the Chronicle. The decision comes after the StreetStreet9, a publication operated by the Coalition on Homelessness, reported that the citys plan for the Moscone Center included placing thin mats on the ground six feet apart from each other for people in the indoor camp. Homeless people had already started10 moving into the center this past weekend. It looked like a World War I flu hospital, said San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney, according to CBS San Francisco11. Exactly the kind of environment we need to get people out of, not put people into. Renting empty hotel rooms throughout San Francisco has been apart of the citys broader mission to prep temporary treatment and housing sites for not just those who are homeless, but also first responders and healthcare workers who require self-isolation. A similar plan12 to house the homeless population in New York City is in place. The citys travel and tourism industries have been slammed amid the coronavirus pandemic, rendering hotel rooms empty throughout San Francisco. The homeless people in San Francisco who would be moved to the hotel rooms are those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who have been tested and are waiting for results to return. The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people over the age of 60 with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. About 150 rooms13 are currently occupied, and 945 rooms are under contract across eight hotels according to Curbed SF.14 Some officials15 argue that the thousands of empty hotel rooms in the city should be used to house the entire homeless population in the city regardless of the need for self-isolation. The plan has never included those living on the streets  only those in existing shelters  and unhoused people are at a much higher risk of contracting the disease. But Mayor London Breed said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people. We are not going to be able to solve our homeless problem in San Francisco with this crisis, Breed said Friday.16 The first confirmed case within a San Francisco homeless shelter was announced on Thursday17. And two more18 homeless people housed at San Franciscos largest shelter were confirmed to be infected with the virus on Monday.

But new guidelines4 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide further direction on how to respond to the virus and its effects on unsheltered individuals in the US. The most stand-out measure is to halt homeless encampment sweeps and to not move homeless individuals into temporary housing units unless they have space to social distance once inside. Unless individual housing units are available, do not clear encampments during community spread of COVID-19, reads the CDC website.5 Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread. That means that the potential makeshift shelters being created in hotels, schools, and other facilities in San Francisco are viable options to get people who have tested positive off the streets as long as there is enough space for social distancing in them. There are about 8,500 hotel rooms6 in San Francisco that could potentially serve this purpose. According to the San Francisco Chronicle7, there has yet to be a confirmed case in San Franciscos homeless population. The guidelines also include encouraging each individual to carve out 144 square feet of space for their sleeping quarters on the streets and to send counselors into the streets to remind people of best practices, like to distance from others. There are an estimated 552,8308 people living in homelessness in the US, more than 100,000 in the state of California, and an estimated 28,200 in the Bay Area. As the coronavirus continues to spread, those living on the streets are more at risk of contracting infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus. Many dont have the luxury of taking the recommended precautions to avoid contracting COVID-19, such as handwashing and keeping a distance from sick people, as Business Insiders Holly Secon9reported.

An emergency coronavirus fund has been created to help California grapple with the spread of the virus. Gov. Gavin Newsomannounced Wednesday that 100 million11 of that fund would go to local government to use to shelter and support homeless communities. Another 50 million would go to the state to put toward travel trailers, private vendors, and hotel rooms to expand temporary housing for the homeless.

And, when it comes to addressing homelessness, theres a lot the general public could do well to know. Some of the most resonant words spoken during the all-day affair were also some of the first. On the days opening panel, Margot Kushel, a UCSF professor and a doctor at San Francisco General Hospital, said that even the basic way we categorize homeless people is wrong and dehumanizing. There is no such thing in my mind as a homeless person, she said. There are people who experience this. Homelessness, in other words, is not an identity. Its an experience  a phrase that resonated with Carbins in particular. And the doctor knows the culprit for this experience. Look, I love medical conditions, she said. But homelessness is caused by a lack of affordable housing. That statement hit home for Joe Wilson, the executive director of Hospitality House, who was himself homeless in the 1980s. There are ways to help homeless people in drips and drops  he has committed his life to this  but fully addressing the situation would require a remaking of society. Putting Money in the Right HandsThe money to solve homelessness is there, he continued. Its just not in the hands it needs to be in. Five corporations in San Francisco made almost 28 billion in profits last year, he said. Thats 100 times what we spend on homelessness in this city. Put another way, in three-and-a-half days, they make as much profit as we spend on homelessness. The primary source of affordable housing for minorities is now incarceration, he continued. This is unsustainable. We cannot have a society and culture that is sustainable given this obscene level of wealth inequity. During a discussion with people experiencing homelessness, organized by Stories Behind the Fog, Shanna Couper Orona shared her journey from living the life in Diamond Heights to a tent encampment on Erie Alley. A retired firefighter who was injured in a blaze, she said she went from being the wife of an attorney, driving an Audi and spending my money, to fixing bicycles on the sidewalk. There was a divorce. There was a spree of couch-surfing. There was that horrific moment when all the money was gone and she had nowhere to go and no idea what to do. There is, she said, no manual for being homeless. But nothing was so hurtful as the day a woman walked out into oncoming traffic rather than share the sidewalk with Orona. She offered a wry grin, but it was not funny Its not like Im going to bite you and give you homelessness. I am a strong, smart, educated woman. But that thing she did  that fucked with my head a little bit. Asked what homeless people want, Orona made a simple request A smile, a nod, a greeting.

A resident at a San Francisco homeless shelter has tested positive for the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19. Its the first confirmed case of the disease in a San Francisco homeless shelter, as the San Francisco Chronicle2 reports. The individual was living at one of the citys Navigation Centers3, the shelter programs set up in the city to help people exit homelessness. Officials are now attempting to prevent a potential outbreak among the citys homeless community. Following the residents positive test, healthcare workers were sent to the shelter to screen all residents and staff for COVID-19 symptoms, and a cleaning crew was instructed to disinfect the facility, according to the Chronicle. The person was taken for self-isolation in a hotel room and is in good condition. The city has turned to the thousands of unoccupied hotel rooms in San Francisco as priority housing sites for healthcare workers, first repsonders, and those who are homeless who need to self-isolate. The citys travel and tourism industries have taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, and hotels have offered more than 11,000 rooms4 for that purpose. San Franciscos Moscone Center, which usually hosts large tech conferences, has been turned into a makeshift homeless shelter5 to make way for better social distancing practices at existing shelters. Homeless advocates, like Jennifer Friedenbach with the Coalition on Homelessness, had been urging city officials to begin placing those who are homeless in hotel rooms even before an outbreak began. The folks who live at that Navigation Center are very vulnerable ... this was exactly why we had been pushing them to stop the practice of having them sleep one on top of the other, Friedenbach told The Chronicle. The Coalition of Homelessness posted a tweet about the resident who tested positive.

Houseless Communities Revillaging The concept of village has a particular life in homeless communities throughout the U.S. When Andrew Heben, an urban planner, professional tiny house builder and author of the book Tent City Urbanism19, visited homeless encampments across the U.S. as a project for his masters thesis between 2009 and 2011, the medias portrayal of homeless encampments was one of dismal spaces rampant with drug abuse and crime. But what he actually encountered were uniquely supportive, democratic, often intricately organized and relatively nonviolent20 communities. Heben now works as project director for SquareOne Villages in Eugene, Oregon, which has been a national model for low-income, tiny home villages since 2012. The organization works to establish both temporary, transitional villages for people who have been houseless, as well as permanent, affordable housing villages. Their permanent villages are set up in an alternative homeownership model that is a hybrid between a community land trust, where the organization owns the land, and limited equity co-ops that allow residents to co-own shares of the village and gain equity over time. The idea is to ensure living in these villages remains affordable for low-income people in perpetuity. Amanda Dellinger, SquareOnes community relations director, says houseless communities offer a particularly potent example of how people naturally gravitate toward villages and interdependence in order to survive, which is why the majority of the rules, standards and operations of their villages are all independently run by residents. SquareOne also sets itself up as a model for anyone interested in forming an affordable tiny house community.","homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing, houseless",120,10,True,True,3,1

The project has drawn mixed reactions from local organizations that work with the citys homeless population, largely because of the past controversies surrounding Gopman.

On the heels of the news of the Oracle conventions move to Vegas, Mayor London Breed declared that San Francisco is a world class city and pledged further steps to address homelessness. Yet as the Chronicles Matier noted19, Breeds comments in Union Square came at the same time that an image of a man with his pants around his knees defecating in a San Francisco Safeway aisle was rocketing around the internet and TV. For San Francisco, the Oracle convention wasnt even the first blow. In 2018, tourism and convention bureau SF Travel announced that a medical association, never named, was looking for another location for its conferences after 2023, despite holding the gatherings in the city since the 1980s. Postconvention surveys showed their members were afraid to walk amid the open drug use, threatening behavior and mental illness that are common on the streets, reports20 the San Francisco Chronicle. I see a couple of homeless people around Union Square, but nothing unusual for an urban area. The Union Square neighborhood effectively borders the Tenderloin, however, meaning a confused tourist could easily end up there.5. A Church for the HomelessAt lunchtime, I pop into a church one with the glorious architecture, high ceilings, and impressive art characteristic of so many older Catholic churches in the United States. As the churchs bells chime, the sound of a vigorous snorer fills the lulls in between. St. Boniface Church, in the Tenderloin neighborhood, allows the homeless to sleep in the pews every weekday through a nonprofit program called the Gubbio Project. Around since the 1860s, the parish originally was the religious home of Germans in the city. The current church was built in 1902, and although it escaped the 1906 earthquake, it was ravaged by the subsequent fires. Rebuilding was completed in 1908. The Gubbio Project uses the back two-thirds of the sanctuary the church uses the front one-third to celebrate the daily Mass, the program states on its website21. This sends a powerful message to our unhoused neighbors they are in essence part of the community, not to be kicked out when those with homes come in to worship. It also sends a message to those attending Mass the community includes the tired, the poor, those with mental health issues and those who are wet, cold and dirty. The day I arrive at St. Bonifaces, the front of the church glitters with Christmas decorations. During the Communion service there isnt a Mass that day the church is mostly quiet. During one brief moment, someone starts babbling, only to be told to be quiet by others. When I look back, I dont see any of the homeless people actively participating in the religious rites. After the service, I explore the rest of the church. Most of the wooden pews with no padding for comfort are occupied by a sleeping person. Three people are lying on the floor in the back. I speak briefly to Michael Bonner, a new employee of the Gubbio Project. When I ask Bonner how the homeless can be helped and what should be done, he speaks of a lack of motivation, of people going down a path of not caring anymore instead of having a fire burning in you. Bonner talks about the need for a work ethic, and how its too simplistic to say the homeless problem is an effect of the citys expensive housing. But hes also adamant that people need help We just cant give up on the willing, he says. I ask him if the homeless people he encounters have loved ones or families who could help. Bonner says most of them are probably embarrassed to go home because you dont want to hear it from your family anymore after presumably failing in previous tries to get off the streets.6.","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused",184,30,True,True,11,5

The launch represents a growing effort, led by newly-elected MayorLondon Breed,to crack down on the citys visible homeless crisis. San Francisco is one of the top-ranking1 cities for homelessness in the country, with an estimated2 homeless population of 7,500. The new system intends to track thehealth, housing, jail, and counseling history of every homeless person in the city. Its a far cry from the old method, which spanned 15 different databases across multiple agencies. This allowed homeless residents to slip through the cracks, with people who might be registered in one system left out of others. The new solution known asONE System Online Navigation and Entry System aggregates this data into a singleplatform. As part of the test process, the city solicited feedback fromvolunteer consultants at Google and other tech companies. The final product allows homeless outreach professionals to log in to an app and view the state of homelessness in the city in real time. But first, it requiresindividuals to be registered at shelters or one of the citys two walk-in centers, which are run by Episcopal Community Services. Upon registration, homeless residents are asked 17 questions that relate to their history of care and future needs. This helps determine which residents are in dire need of housing, and which can have their concerns met relatively quickly. By next year, the database will have collected enough names to begin the housing placement process for individual residents. As of late last year, the system has already begun to track homeless families throughout the city. According toJeff Kositsky, the head of the citys Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, the platform hasslashed wait times for families at local shelters from one week to just two days. I know its going to make a difference, he told The San Francisco Chronicle3.Maybe not right away, but it will happen. If the systems in other cities are any indication, Kositsky could be right. In Salt Lake City, where a program recordsevery time a homeless person receives shelter, counseling, or another service, the city managed to reduce chronic homelessness4by 91 in a single decade.

Art Agnos, who led the city from 1988 to 1992, wants to create a temporary shelter aboard a retired Navy ship.

sanfrancisco,A former San Francisco mayor wants to put the city's homeless on a Navy ship,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,San Francisco Chronicle,"There are some 6,500 homeless people living in San Francisco, which has the second2 highest homeless population in the US. Some surveys suggest that figure should be doubled3. Our city desperately needs a humane, progressive game changer to house them until there is enough permanent housing, Agnos writes. The USS Peleliu has sleeping quarters, kitchens, medical clinics, offices, and recreation facilities, and once carried 5,000 military personnel on the open seas, according to Agnos. He proposes docking the ship at the Port of San Francisco, just steps from the citys tourist-packed Ferry Building, where the homeless populations can board at night. His idea might not be as crazy as it sounds. After a 1989 earthquake leveled the Marina district and caused about 5 million in damages, people left homeless by the disaster sought shelter in the Moscone Convention Center. When the venue needed to reopen for business, a Navy admiral offered the USS Peleliu as a temporary dwelling. During the day, 300 homeless individuals kept their usual routines. At night, they came home to the ship, writes Agnos, who served as mayor at the time. It was popular, because it was a safe, civilized shelter with good food. The ship departed two weeks later to continue with its mission. Its unclear the costs or logistical challenges associated with Agnos idea. In 1989, the US military ate the costs4 of housing and feeding the homeless aboard the USS Peleliu. There will certainly be protests from city officials, who have long weighed the homeless populations affect on tourism. Docking at the citys popular waterfront area is far from discreet, though it may be game-changing.

Another anonymous resident of the area told the San Francisco Chronicle9 that neighbors had called the police hundreds of times before the boulders went up in September.

Residents are divided over whether homeless camps should be allowed to stayGiant rocks to deter tents arent a new fixture for San Francisco In 2017, the city placed boulders16 under a highway to block homeless encampments near Potrero Hill, a residential neighborhood. At the time, city officials said it was a humane way to discourage people from camping out, the Chronicle reported17.In previous years, various groups in San Francisco have tried to deter homeless residents in other ways. In 2015, the San Francisco Roman Catholic Archdioceseinstalled sprinklers outside a cathedral18that sprayed homeless residents who tried to camp out in their doorways. In the 1990s, the city removed benches from a plaza near City Hall toprevent people from sleeping on them19. Other benches throughout the city feature rails and spikes to prevent homeless people from lying down  a common design tactic20 in crowded urban areas. Not all neighbors in Clinton Park supported21 the boulder plan, though. An anonymous resident told Curbed22 that the installment sets a bad precedent, while another, Pablo Soriano, said the decision comes from a negative place. Needles and human feces have always been an issue, but I dont think this is the best solution, Soriano said. Maybe instead of putting the time and effort of putting ugly rocks on the sidewalk, my neighbors could donate to foundations and try to get City Hall to fund more shelters, counseling, and methadone clinics. The debate over how to address San Franciscos homelessness crisis took the national stage in September, when President Trump accused homeless people23 of ruining the citys highways, streets, and buildings. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein responded by saying homelessness cant be solved24 by simply sweeping people off the street. Although the boulders in Clinton Park are in the process of being removed, public works department officials have said theyre still open to other ways to block homeless encampments.

An emergency ordinance was introduced Tuesday that would require San Francisco to find and rent 7,000 hotel rooms to house all of San Franciscos homeless population during the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual news conference Tuesday2, five members of the Board of Supervisors announced they are backing the proposed ordinance, which would require the city to procure the rooms by April 26, the projected date3 for the number of confirmed cases to hit its peak in the state of California. According to a press release, the mandate also includes establishing 750 rooms for healthcare workers and first responders who have been infected with or exposed to the virus, as well as 500 rooms for those being released from local hospitals following infection of or exposure to the virus but who cannot self-isolate at home. According to an article4 the San Francisco Examiner, the full board plans to vote on the proposal next Tuesday it will require eight votes to pass under emergency rules. Since the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, reached San Francisco in early March, the city has endeavored to address how the illness could impact its sizable homeless community. There are an estimated 8,0005 unhoused people in the city, and an outbreak among that population could overwhelm the healthcare system. Renting empty hotel rooms throughout San Francisco has been apart of the citys broader mission to prep temporary treatment and housing sites for not just those who are homeless, but also first responders and healthcare workers who require self-isolation. Asimilar plan6to house the homeless population in New York City is in place. The citys travel and tourism industries have been slammed amid the coronavirus pandemic, rendering hotel rooms empty throughout San Francisco. As the plan stands now, the homeless people in San Francisco who would be moved to the hotel rooms are those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who have been tested and are waiting for results to return. The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people over the age of 60 with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. About 9457 hotel rooms have already been leased across eight hotels. But some officials8 and homeless advocates argue that the thousands of empty hotel rooms in the city should be used to house the entire homeless population in the city as a preventative measure, regardless of the need for self-isolation. The plan has never included those living on the streets  only those in existing shelters  and unhoused people are at a much higher risk of contracting the disease. But Mayor London Breed said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people. We are not going to be able to solve our homeless problem in San Francisco with this crisis,Breed said Friday.9 If this emergency ordinance passes, however, it would introduce an urgency to sheltering every unhoused person in the city in spaces fit for healthy social, or physical, distancing practices. Housing those living on the streets in homeless shelters isnt an option at the moment  the city has banned new admissions10 to maintain healthy physical distancing among residents already there. The city has toyed with turning its Moscone Center and the Palace of Fine Arts into mega-shelters housing up to 400 and 162 people, respectively. But those plans were scaled back11 after a backlash was stirred over the camp-like living conditions slated for the facilities. And their purpose was originally to free up room in existing homeless shelters by redistributing people to the makeshift shelters, not to house those coming off of the streets.

Visit Business Insiders homepage for more stories1. An emergency ordinance was just passed in San Francisco requiring the city to procure and rent 7,000 hotel rooms for its entire homeless population. In a virtual meeting on Tuesday, San Franciscos Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to pass the emergency proposal that gives the city until April 26  theprojected date2 for the number of confirmed cases to hit its peak in the state of California  to find the hotel rooms. Now that the board has approved the ordinance, Mayor London Breed has 10 days to decide whether to sign or veto it, though the board could override that ruling as the San Francisco Examiner3 reports. The measure requires the city to find 7,000 hotel rooms for its unhoused residents. But in total, 8,250 rooms are included in the ordinance that would also house first-responders and healthcare workers who require self-isolation. The purpose of the ordinance was in part to give the citys homeless population space to shelter in place alongside the rest of the city as the coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, continues to spread. When the regionwide shelter-in-place order went into effect on March 17, those who are homeless were exempt and instead instructed to wait until officials could find ways to house them during the public health crisis. In addition to housing and protecting the citys most vulnerable residents, doing so would also help mitigate an outbreak, which would prevent the healthcare system from potentially being overwhelmed. But an outbreak has already hit the homeless community. On April 24, the first positive case in a San Francisco homeless shelter was found at the citys Division Circle Navigation Center. And on April 6, two more cases were confirmed at MSC South, the citys largest homeless shelter. Then on April 105, 70 people at that shelter were reported to have tested positive, a number that has since swelled to at least 100. At least 23 residents6 living in SRO hotels have also tested positive. For weeks, San Francisco has been pushing forward with a mission to identify temporary housing and treatment sites that would prioritize isolation housing for those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the estimated8,0007who are unhoused. Since the citys travel and tourism industries have been hit hard amid the coronavirus pandemic, the thousands of empty hotel rooms have become a viable solution. The five supervisors  Matt Haney, Hillary Ronen, Aaron Peskin, Dean Presto, and Shamann Walton that cosponsored the proposal have been advocating for the housing of all of the citys homeless individuals as a preventive measure, regardless of exposure to the virus or having been tested positive for it. Tweet Embed twitter.commimsstatuses1250218680891273216?ref_srctwsrc5Etfw Our emergency ordinance to house the unhoused in hotels just passed unanimously. This legislation will save lives. Its a shame we needed it, but unanimous passage is a loud statement of the values of this Board of Supervisors. Now lets get our neighbors safely inside! As the plan previously stood, those who are homeless in San Francisco who would be moved to the hotel rooms are those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who have been tested and are waiting for results to return. The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people over the age of 60 with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. But Mayor London Breed said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people. We are not going to be able to solve our homeless problem in San Francisco with this crisis,Breed said8 on April 3. The city had previously toyed with housing its homeless community in mega shelters with congregate living conditions in an effort to increase social distancing in existing shelters. San Franciscos Moscone Center and Palace of Fine Arts were involved in those plans, which have since been scaled back. At a Board of Supervisors budget meeting last Wednesday, City Controller Ben Rosenfield said the estimated cost to rent the estimated 7,000 units for 90 days is 105 million, much of which could be refundable according to Supervisor Haney during the Tuesday meeting. Rosenfield previously said that more than half of the estimated 105 million will likely be covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but the rest of the 50 million is part of the puzzle were trying to get put together, as Curbed SF9 reports. Human Services Agency Director Trent Rhorer said that the city may also be able to use some of the 150 million in emergency funds10allocated to counties throughout the state of California. The estimated costs include the cost of security, cleaning services, and other resources for the homeless. During the Tuesday meeting, Supervisor Aaron Peskin  one of the co-sponsors of the measure  said he would rather invest in this at the front end than pay for it at the back end.","homeless, unhoused",34,33,True,True,1,0

Additional positive factors, not quantified in this analysis, include an expected improvement in health outcomes, a reduction in acute service costs, and an attractiveness of the City, because of the likely decline in the homeless population, the report stated. To the extent that these policy objectives are achieved, the economic impact could be better than we project. Further, increased spending on housing and related services will stimulate those sectors of the economy, leading to positive multiplier effects on other industries. Officially, based on the most recent biennial point-in-time headcount in 20176, an average of about 7,500 people reside on the citys streets or in shelters. That figure certainly underplays the number of people experiencing homelessness, however.

Spending Could ShiftWith the citys current annual homelessness outlay of more than a third of a billion dollars, how that money and future funds will be spent is one of the oppositions biggest talking points. The No on Proposition C campaign10 has argued that the measure lacks accountability, in part because it has no detailed plan for how the money would be distributed. While this is a matter of interpretation, the proposition does outline an oversight structure. The measure does not mandate that each type of tax-funded housing and social service go to specific quotas of recipients. Instead, it requires that proportions of revenue go toward general categories of assistance At least 50 percent for getting homeless people into housing. This would primarily include acquiring, creating or rehabilitating permanently affordable housing where the tenants receive social services on site, though up to 12 percent of this money could go toward the citys rapid rehousing program  rental subsidies lasting up to five years, for people who have recently become homeless. Of all the beneficiaries of these types of spending, at least 25 percent must be families, and at least 20 percent must be homeless youth  adults 18 to 29.

It is true that this could happen, but the Board of Supervisors could also choose to siphon money from this purpose and pour it into affordable housing instead, helping fewer people but in a more permanent way. The plan also states that the money would let the city acquire up to 1,000 currently vacant units in single-room occupancy hotels, as additional units of affordable housing. The Public Press reported in fall 2017 that 1,827 SRO rooms were being held vacant15 for a variety of reasons. Some needed renovations, or repairs after fire damage.

So in late March, the city quiety added a team tasked with preventing encampments from re-emerging.",homeless,3,3,False,True,1,0
sanfrancisco,"After City Clears Homeless Camps, Team Works to Prevent Return",2017-07-06T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,SF Public Press,"The Re-Encampment Prevention and Response Team consists primarily of two members of the Human Service Agencys Homeless Outreach Team as well as workers from the Department of Public Works and the San Francisco Police Department. The prevention team monitors areas that have been cleared, responds to citizen complaints about encampments that have reappeared and offers people living on the streets access to safety and services, said Randy Quezada, a spokesman for the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. But some who work closely with the homeless worry that involving police officers so heavily in prevention efforts disrupts the trust social workers have gained with encampment residents. Quezada said the department created the prevention team to support another group, the Encampment Resolution Team, which was created last summer to get people to leave their camps so they could be dismantled. The thinking was that in addition to what was happening to resolve various areas, and whatever work we were doing with neighborhoods and other stakeholders to maintain the areas resolved, that there were additional sorts of things that the city could do to help bolster those efforts, Quezada said in an interview. And part of that was bringing together this team, which was dedicated to returning to the areas that have been resolved. Concerns About Bad PublicityA former worker with the Homeless Outreach Team and the resolution team, who spoke with the Public Press on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, believes that the team was created because officials are worried about negative publicity from having homeless people reappear at seemingly resolved locations, particularly given the amount of money spent on the navigation centers. Once it became apparent that people would return to the same place each time they said, Well, we need a team to go out and dissuade the campers, the residents, from returning to the same exact spot, because it looks so bad media-wise to have the same exact characters, after a million dollars has gone into this project, the former worker said. For fiscal year 2016-17, which ends June 30, about 9.4 million was budgeted for three navigation centers 2.6 million for Mission Street, 3.1 million for the Civic Center Hotel and 3.7 million for the Central Waterfront facility, which opened in late May. The former worker was also critical of how the re-encampment prevention team integrated the police department into the Homeless Outreach Team, fearing it would erode camp residents trust toward the outreach squads, which are not affiliated with the prevention program. The outreach and encampment-resolution teams both were always very adamant, We dont work with the police, the source said.","homeless, homelessness",36,11,True,True,2,0
sanfrancisco,"After City Clears Homeless Camps, Team Works to Prevent Return",2017-07-06T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,SF Public Press,"Thankfully nothing has. In early June, according to documents compiled by the Department of Public Works, there were 55 active homeless encampments in the city as of June 9. Last summer, the city combined several programs and contractors from different departments to form a new Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. Because the prevention team is relatively new, data to evaluate its effectiveness are scarce. Laura Guzman, a service provider and former member of the citys Local Homeless Coordinating Board, voiced concern about having police involved with the team. We need to actually minimize police intervention, said Guzman, who in May retired as director of homeless services for the Mission Neighborhood Resource Center. I think a re-encampment strategy is giving even more power to the police to do what theyve been doing, which is to move people from one block to another. At the coordinating boards April meeting, she requested information about the prevention team from Jeff Kositsky, head of the homelessness department, who said he would provide it at next meeting. At its May session, Kelley Cutler, a social worker with the Coalition on Homelessness, reiterated Guzmans information request. Kositsky acknowledged the teams existence but declined to elaborate about the teams purpose or functioning. He said that, in general, the homelessness department works closely with the police and Public Works when needed. Police Provide Support RoleDavid Stevenson, the police departments director of strategic communications, wrote in an email that 10 officers works with the departments of public health, public works and homelessness. Eight officers have received Crisis Intervention Team training to work with mentally ill individuals. He had no specific information about police officers working with the re-encampment prevention team. In response to criticisms about the level of police involvement on the team, Stevenson wrote that dealing with homelessness requires resources and participation from several city departments, and that the department meets weekly and has conference calls daily with other city departments about homelessness. In general, he said, the police provide a support role in addressing homelessness. Quezada rejected the idea that police involvement with the re-encampment team should be cause for concern.","homeless, homelessness",36,17,True,True,2,1

Outcome goes beyond Heres a bed to Lets not make someone homeless anymore. To that end, local and state governments are increasingly experimenting with what are called social impact bonds, a novel pay for success model of financing services through private capital. Investors are repaid, with a small profit, only if a project proves successful. Since their debut seven years ago, these bonds have generated 200 million in the United States and 14 other countries toward programs to reduce homelessness and related social problems. San Francisco could tap into this new funding source to permanently house homeless families, as well as help low-income mothers and at-risk youth, after the city upgrades and unifies its computer systems. Santa Clara County, however, is already experimenting with leveraging private investment to house 150 to 200 people who are among the countys most costly and chronically homeless individuals. In 2015, the county raised about 7 million for Project Welcome Home, one of four social impact bonds established as of March 2016 targeting about 1,200 homeless individuals or families in the United States. The others are in Denver nearly 9 million for 250 individuals, Massachusetts 3.5 million for up to 800 people and CuyahogaCounty, Ohio, which includes Cleveland 4 million for 135 families. See Comparing 4 Social Impact Bond Projects1The six-year Santa Clara County project emerged after a study of the records of more than 100,000 homeless individuals from 2007 to 2012. The review found that around 2,800 chronically homeless individuals cost the county an average of 83,000 each per year. That was nearly half of all public service costs. The federal government defines a chronically homeless individual as someone who has been homeless for at least a year or has experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in the last three years, and has a long-term disabling condition. Project Welcome Home targets these highest-need individuals  the top 5 percent of the chronically homeless  through what is known as a housing first model, said Maria Raven, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, the projects independent evaluator. Based on a previous housing-first program for a broader group of homeless people, the countys costs fell 70 percent annually for those who remained housed through the program. After contemplating the pay-for- success approach, San Francisco determined in a September 2015 feasibility study that it did not have the baseline data system required to track target populations, the types of services needed or outcomes on services provided. That could change. With the creation of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing and its recent investment in the Online Navigation and Entry System  a unified network to better collect and manage data on the homeless population  the city is closer to adopting a pay-for- success model. The question is Will the city turn to social impact bonds to do so?The Bond BreakdownUnlike conventional investments, social impact bonds raise private seed money for long-term, innovative endeavors such as keeping the homeless housed and reducing their use of costly emergency services. Spending tax dollars directly on challenging problems or populations is usually a hard sell politically. What differentiates a social impact bond from other general outcomes-based approaches is the use of outside investors to front direct-service costs. This lets governments test new interventions without digging into their budgets right away and pay only when goals are reached. The best part, some experts say, is that these bonds align governments, nonprofits and the private sector in a way not seen before. The structure links the capital provider much more directly to Are these peoples lives being improved long term for themselves and for the society? said Andrew Rachlin, managing director of lending and investment at the Reinvestment Fund, which has invested in homelessness bonds for Santa Clara and Cuyahoga counties. And were at risk, so were very invested in making sure the service provider is doing what they say theyre going to do.","homeless, homelessness",64,25,True,True,2,0

Repurposing such properties may sidestep some of the factors that have contributed to a near-doubling of the cost of building housing in California14 in less than 20 years, a trend that - coupled with years of legal challenges - has increasingly led to even small-scale affordable housing projects becoming financially infeasible before ground is ever broken15.Project Roomkey16 - the state program to house homeless persons at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 - includes a clause allowing the state to negotiate with owners to subsequently purchase these properties and convert them permanently to housing for the homeless. The extent to which this provision is utilized may provide evidence on the feasibility of this concept. Recently proposed state legislation, Assembly Bill 310717, would ease restrictions on rezoning underutilized commercial properties for residential use. Some form of state or local subsidization18 may be required to effectively incentivize such a reallocation. Fully realizing such an opportunity would also likely require significant federal fiscal aid, as both dedicated funding sources like L.A. Countys Measure H19, and broader state and local revenues have been dramatically affected by the economic shocks from the pandemic, though the likelihood of any such aid remains unclear.

Many thought that this provision was an obstacle to building any housing at all. Though I recognize that some developers said that these affordable housing thresholds were financially unworkable in housing developments, this decision overtime will reduce the stock of affordable housing in the City of Davis. I believe the best way for the city to start improving the situation is to recommit to its own affordable housing ordinance. This will help expand the stock of affordable housing built in future development projects. As market-rate housing expands, so should the availability of affordable housing. The city should also encourage more developers to contribute to the housing trust fund. This would give the city resources to finance the building of additional affordable housing or to provide other kinds of support for those struggling to afford rising housing costs. At some points in the past developers have use the option of housing trust fund contributions to get out of obligations to build affordable housing units. To avoid this, the city should use this option in conjunction with the building of affordable housing units, along with making sure that developer contributions are fair for the community and have an actual impact addressing housing needs. Colin Walsh The loss of redevelopment funding is regrettable, but affordable housing is continuing to be built across the state with other sources of funding and mechanisms. The end of redevelopment agencies has not been the end of affordable housing construction. The first step is to do an independent, in-depth study that looks at what level of inclusionary housing is actually achievable. We need a solid understanding of what can work so that the city is not relying on subjective claims by developers of what does or does not pencil out. The city needs an independent arbitrator of how affordable housing can be included so we can maximize affordable units in future projects.

sanfrancisco,Davis City Council Questions: Question 5 - Affordable Housing,2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,The People's Vanguard of Davis,KQED,"Id like to see a suite of recommendations from this stakeholder process for the Council to consider, prior to making necessary changesupgrades. Larry Guenther Changes to the Affordable Housing ordinance removal of the exemption for mixed-use buildings, an actual number for minimums in the Downtown to be determined by the Social Services Commission using evidence and input from local developers, update the in-lieu fee, and include the recommendations from the Social Services Commission. By its nature, new construction is expensive, though residential rents have gone up a lot faster than materials costs. Refurbishing existing housing stock to Affordable Housing is a good way to make more headway on this issue and would be a more efficient use of the Affordable Housing fund. Also, there is affordable housing that is not officially designated Affordable. Many of the older apartment complexes - many near downtown - are heavily populated by working families. We must not trade this for new construction with what can be defined as Affordable. The University Commons project is an example of defined Affordable Housing that is actually more expensive than existing market-rate housing. This is a somewhat shameful use of an equation to make a project look good. Additionally, Affordable Housing numbers should be net numbers. For example, the Lincoln 40 project removed housing that was less expensive than the Affordable Housing associated with that project. Again, using math to make things look better than they are should not be City policy. Long-term affordability - increasing limited-equity ownership opportunities a la Dos Pinos, etc. allows a much broader swath of the economic spectrum to gain equity and improve their economic station. District 5 Josh Chapman The City should enforce the existing ordinance and be consistent in its expectations from developers. In the current environment, projects and modifications to affordable housing are approved on an ad-hoc basis, which creates great inconsistencies in affordable housing inventory. Affordable housing requirements exist for proposed development projects and enforcing these requirements would create more certainty for developers and add to the affordable housing supply. Approval of the Downtown Plan with a focus on densification and building up would create more opportunities for affordable housing units. If we truly value equity and inclusivity, then the best way forward is to have a diverse plan that leads to more affordable units on the ground. Expanding the Housing Trust Fund will support a wide variety of affordable housing development. Slight increases in development impact fees, allocating Transient Occupancy Tax TOT dollars to this fund, and re-exploring the 50 social services parcel tax that was proposed by Mayor Davis are several options to explore. While as a small business owner I recognize the economic impact of the pandemic on all businesses, cities of comparable size in California have much higher in-lieu fees and this is a realistic approach to building more affordable housing. Council should work to address the anti-development culture. There is a tremendous amount of misunderstanding about how much affordable housing single development projects generate. A social services parcel tax, which would generate 1.5 million a year, will open new and more sustainable ways to fund affordable housing. Kelsey Fortune Things like affordable rent by the bed allows property owners to charge higher prices for a unit by increasing the occupancy of a two bedroom to four people for instance. This is unacceptable. The current affordable housing ordinance offers too much flexibility and opportunities for developers to get around providing units at affordable prices. Building market rate housing in Davis will make money. Period. Rents and housing appreciation are so high, and vacancy rates so low that we can and should ask more of developers and current development. I would recommend a simplified affordable housing ordinance for rentals that includes the following or something similar. 25 of rented units going to households making less than 120 of Yolo median income with price capped at 75 of market rate and 10 of rented units going to households making less than 80 of Yolo median income with price capped at 50 of market rate.",affordable housing,94,32,True,True,5,2

Personally, I think we need to be more thoughtful about placement of Affordable housing in relation to the type of housing - extremely low, very low and low income. The breakdown of the 30 required Affordable units for new developments should be distributed according to location and availability of services. Not only should Affordable housing in Davis be distributed throughout the City, it should also be located near grocery stores and community amenities. My focus is on people and not simply a door count. As to funding, we should maintain a set threshold of an agreed upon percentage within new developments along with an option for in-lieu fees where location and use is incompatible. In addition to in-lieu fees, I want to explore real investments into a Housing Trust Fund to augment Affordable housing and provide down payment assistance for market-rate affordable.

We need to stop enabling, excusing and ignoring these drug addiction and mental health issues, he said in a recent interview. Ose wants to make it easier to bring homeless people into the states custody, and then establish enough community care centers to treat drug addiction and mental illness. He also proposes that state-funded facilities demand sobriety from all individuals receiving services.

Republicans are counting on it,2021-07-15T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,KQED,"And yes, were going to have to force people into that treatment if need be. In his homelessness plan, Cox cites a Heritage Foundation blog post15 pointing to a study of Treatment First facilities that found nearly half of participants recovered from substance use, entered housing and maintained steady employment. Neither Cox nor Ose has put forth a price tag for that treatment  but it is likely far higher than simply providing beds for people, as the current shelter model does. The candidates do, however, have a point that more mental health treatment is sorely needed. Board-and-care facilities for low-income Californians with serious mental illness have been shuttering across the state at an alarming rate16. The state budget for the next fiscal year includes 805 million for counties to purchase, build, preserve, or rehabilitate such facilities17, but the state has yet to patch the growing hole in the availability and delivery of mental health treatment. The prevalence of mental illness among the homeless is a source of debate18, and being on the streets can worsen existing mental health conditions. There is general agreement among experts and elected officials19 that mental illness alone isnt responsible for homelessness. The people who are suffering from substance use disorder or mental illness are very visible, theyre very challenging. But there is a very large unsheltered population that doesnt have either. Janey Rountree, founding executive director of the California Policy Lab at UCLA Of the more than 248,000 people who accessed homeless services throughout 2020, 41 reported disabling conditions20, which could be anything from diabetes or a broken leg to a mental disorder, according to Ali Sutton, the states deputy secretary for homelessness at the California Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council. Janey Rountree, founding executive director of the California Policy Lab at UCLA, said a recent study found21 that less than a fifth of 37,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles had a clinically diagnosed mental illness, substance use disorder or both. The people who are suffering from substance use disorder or mental illness are very visible, theyre very challenging, she said. But there is a very large unsheltered population that doesnt have either. Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at University of California San Francisco, who leads the UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative22, also says theres little evidence of correlation between mental health and homelessness. Instead, she says the places with highest homelessness have a split population of high earners who can afford to pay housing costs, and those who cant, competing for a limited supply of housing. Think San Francisco. Once people are living on the street, theyre much more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol, Kushel said. A lot of people on the streets use stimulants so they dont sleep, because when they sleep, they get assaulted, and their stuff gets stolen, she said. Turns out that when you bring people inside and that goes away, peoples lives calm down, and they can engage in therapy. Kushel recently conducted a study in which researchers approached the 400 most chronically homeless people in Santa Clara  the people who most frequently ended up in the emergency room or jail you might find yelling in the middle of the street  and offered them a permanent home. All but one said yes.","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused",129,22,True,True,8,2

Republicans are counting on it,2021-07-15T00:00:00Z,CalMatters,KQED,"But his main idea is to create enough shelter beds to get everyone on the streets inside with services, including mental health treatment. Under his plan, if space in a shelter is available, a homeless person must take it. How many beds would that take? A lot. The 2020 tally of homeless people found California had the highest share of people living on the streets, or unsheltered, at 70. Asked about a price tag, Faulconer said the cost of not doing it is extraordinary. People are literally dying on our streets. And my whole plan is about giving people the ability to get off the streets, out of an unclean, unsafe, unsanitary environment into one that is supportive with the services that they need, he told CalMatters. Faulconer cites a 12 reduction in homelessness in San Diego as evidence that shelters work but local critics have questioned that record31. While Newsom has added record numbers of shelter beds in the last year32, he has prioritized more expensive individual hotel rooms, as opposed to the large shelters Faulconer suggests.","homeless, homelessness, affordable housing, unhoused",129,10,True,True,8,5

Advocates say these plans stigmatize people who are unhoused Theyre forced to live in that trash, Martin said. And oftentimes its not trash. Its all they have in their life. The candidates also all agree California needs more housing, and addressing the homelessness crisis is impossible without that. Thats the same argument Newsom has been making since his 2018 campaign. His challengers propose changes such as streamlining permits and costly environmental reviews. But none of the candidates offer a clear way around the political pressures that make housing construction so difficult35. Like his opponents, Faulconer says the state simply needs a better governor I believe this cries out for leadership at the statewide level. With a budget surplus bonanza, Gov. Newsom calls for spending 12 billion more to end homelessness in California. One idea expanding motel conversions, an emergency plan during the pandemic.

sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"Cities and counties create massive bureaucracies. The nonprofits dont just run these projects - the actual people staffing these shelters arent overpaid - they operate huge bureaucratic empires with overhead, marketing budgets, and executive salaries that do nothing for the homeless. None of these dynamics are terribly unique. Government funded programs are rarely considered bargains. And despite prodigious waste, Americas military is nonetheless the most fearsome in the world. Similarly, despite mismanaging literally billions in proceeds from bonds and taxes collected to help the homeless, in absolute numbers Americas population of homeless may have actually declined over the past 10 years. How Many Homeless Are There in America?This surprises a lot of people, but theres a lot more to that story. According to the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development HUD, in 2007 there were 647,000 homeless people in the U.S., but by the time the most recent count was released in 2018, that number had declined to 543,000. Why, if so much money is being wasted, and the homeless crisis seems to be more acute than ever, are the absolute numbers of homeless actually falling? First of all, the numbers may be incorrect. These counts may be grossly understated. An illuminating critique of how HUDs point-in-time homeless count may be understating the numbers was published by CityLab in March 2019. Author Alastair Boone participated in an official count, covering a section of Oakland, California, in the early hours of January 30, 2019. HUD requires cities and counties to complete the count, on this day, every two years, in order to receive federal funding for homeless programs. But canvassing the streets of any city during the pre-dawn hours during the coldest month of the year is bound to miss a lot of people. Quoting from the article, The count is during the winter early in the morning, when its harder to actually find folks because theyre seeking some sort of refuge. They want to stay out of sight in general for their own safety. Knowing just how many Americans are homeless is further complicated by competing definitions of homelessness. The National Center for Educational Statistics NCES claimed in a 2015 report that 1.3 million K-12 students were homeless in that year. But NCES defines the homeless as not only those who are unsheltered or in homeless shelters, but those sharing housing due to loss of their own home, or living in hotels or motels. Even in California, a state where homelessness is now a crisis célèbre for state legislators in Sacramento, and a cautionary horror story for conservative critics of California politics, at first glance, the overall numbers suggest the problem is overblown. On the map depicted below, using HUD data, the state by state homeless trend is shown for the ten years from 2007 to 2017, in which Californias total homeless population actually dropped by 3.4 percent. But reports from around the state dispute the HUD assessment. According to a June 2019 article published in the New York Times, in Alameda County, the number of homeless residents jumped 43 percent over the past two years. In Orange County, that number was 42 percent. Kern County volunteers surveying the regions homeless population found a 50 percent increase over 2018. San Francisco notched a 17 percent increase since 2017. When Los Angeles officials released the results of their most recent count, homelessness was up by 12 percent over last year in the county and up 16 percent in the City of Los Angeles. Nobody seems to know whether these flaws and ambiguities in how the homeless are counted mean that the crisis is in fact worse now than ever, despite official numbers showing a decline. But total numbers alone dont tell the whole story. How the homeless are treated, and where the homeless are concentrated, has changed a great deal in the past ten years. This is the real reason the homeless crisis today is worse than ever. The next map, below, using data from the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, shows 2018 estimates of the total homeless population by state. Viewed in this context, the states where homelessness increased dramatically over the past ten years, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, nonetheless confront a relatively insignificant challenge. As of 2018, the estimated homeless population of all three of those states combined totaled only 2,340 people. Most homeless, on the other hand, are concentrated in states that share one or more of three characteristics a mild winter climate, large urban centers, and liberal politics. New York, with the nations second largest homeless population, fulfills two of those three criteria. Sunny California, in first place with an estimated homeless population exceeding 129,000 in 2018, fulfills all three. Whether the numbers of homeless people are up or down in California is only half the story. How Californias homelessness has worsened over the past ten years represents a qualitative change. The mismanagement of Californias homeless can be attributed to the Homeless Industrial Complex, but other policy failures are also to blame. All in all, Californias response to homelessness is a textbook example of how to get almost everything wrong. Policies That Made Californias Homeless Crisis WorseAn assortment of policy failures can be directly linked to why homelessness in California is a bigger problem than ever, even in the unlikely event the numbers of homeless have not dramatically increased. These policy failures have taken the form of overzealous court rulings, citizen approved ballot measures that wreaked havoc in their unintended consequences, and flawed legislation. Court Decisions The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, unsurprisingly, is the author of at least three rulings that have tied the hands of law enforcement in dealing with the homeless. The first of these is Jones v. the City of Los Angeles, decided in 2006, that ruled that law enforcement and city officials can no longer enforce the ban on sleeping on sidewalks anywhere within the Los Angeles city limits until a sufficient amount of permanent supportive housing could be built.","homeless, homelessness",369,46,True,True,18,1

The practical impact of these cases is to create private space wherever a homeless person camps on publicly owned property. Apart from trying - often ineffectively - to prevent the homeless from blocking passage on roads and sidewalks, if a homeless person wants to camp in a public space, they cannot be removed. State Ballot Initiatives In 2014 California voters approved Prop. 47, which downgraded drug and property crimes. Prop. 47 has led to what police derisively refer to as catch and release, because suspects are only issued citations with a court date, and let go. With respect to the homeless, passage of this initiative has made it a waste of time for police to arrest anyone for openly using illegal drugs or for petty theft. Only very serious crimes are still investigated. Prop. 47 has enabled anarchy among the homeless and in the neighborhoods where homeless are concentrated. In 2016, California voters approved Prop. 57, intended to make individuals convicted of nonviolent felony crimes eligible for parole. About 7,000 inmates became immediately eligible, and as of early 2016, there were about 25,000 nonviolent state felons that could seek early release and parole under Proposition 57. Hopefully most of these released inmates reintegrated successfully into society. But those among this at-risk population who did not joined Californias homeless. State Legislation Flawed legislation by California lawmakers would include AB 109, passed in 2011, which released tens of thousands of non-violent criminals out of county jails due to overcrowding without providing adequate means to monitor and assist their transition back into society. Thousands of these inmates were coping with drug addiction and mental illness, and they have found their way onto Californias streets and parks. Many of them are non-violent drug dealers or convicted thieves. As with Prop. 57, AB 109 has changed the character of Californias homeless population. And then theres the infamous AB 953, a ridiculous bit of legislation that epitomizes the mentality of Californias utopian leftist politicians.","homeless, homelessness",369,18,True,True,18,2

No summary of counterproductive state legislation would be complete without mentioning the laws that make it nearly impossible to get treatment for mentally ill homeless people. According to a report published by CalMatters, this problem began way back in 1967 in California with a law signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Aimed at safeguarding the civil rights of one of societys most vulnerable populations, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act put an end to the inappropriate and often indefinite institutionalization of people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities. Ever since, and especially in recent years as the percentage of homeless who suffer from mental illness has increased, attempts to reform the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act have been tenaciously resisted by the ACLU and other homeless advocacy groups. As reported by San Franciscos public radio station KQED, during 2018 three laws were introduced by California legislators that would attempt to change conservatorship rules to allow city health workers to help homeless people with substance abuse and mental health problems by legally and temporarily stepping in to force a mentally ill person into treatment. Only one, SB 1045, became law, and the final version was so watered down that San Franciscos Mayor London Breed, a liberal Democrat, claimed As drafted, SB 1045 would allow us to help fewer than five individuals. There are an estimated 7,000 homeless living on the streets of San Francisco. Most of these court rulings and laws, nearly all of them passed or decided in the last decade, have made it far more difficult to manage Californias homeless population. Their effect has been to increase the proportion of mentally ill, drug addicts, and criminals as a percentage of the homeless, at the same time as police and social service workers have far less ability to detain, relocate, or even offer help to the homeless. Mismanaged Homeless Encampments Raise Threat of Medieval Disease EpidemicsNotwithstanding the many passed or proposed state laws that attempt to create more housing, or throw additional billions at the Homeless Industrial Complex to be largely squandered, another set of state laws - either proposed or already passed - threaten to turn Californias homeless epidemic into a serious disease epidemic.

And the mountains of trash that create rat habitat are not just coming from homeless people, they are a product of a disastrous decision by the Los Angeles City Council that has led to mountains of uncollected trash from businesses and residences. In 2017, the Los Angeles City Council began to implement the RecycLA program, where they gave seven companies the exclusive right to collect trash. Putting small haulers out of business in the name of saving the streets from excessive traffic, the measure was sold as a way to create economies of scale. Instead, these companies were unable to smoothly absorb the additional work, at the same time as in many cases they doubled or tripled their collection fees. The consequences of these failed schemes are that Los Angeles now has two sources contributing to the mountains of trash in the city - homeless encampments, but also illegal dumping by disgruntled businesses and residences. Where theres trash, there are rats, and where there are rats, there are disease carrying fleas.","homeless, homelessness",369,7,True,True,18,4

Shigella, a communicable form of diarrhea, is now common among the homeless. There have even been outbreaks of trench fever, spread by lice. As reported by the Atlantic earlier this year Medieval Diseases Are Infecting Californias Homeless. To-date, except for those people living and working in proximity to the many encampments, the homeless crisis in America has been an abstraction. But now there is a possibility that this perfect storm of neglect, indulgence, and corruption may lead to disease outbreaks on a scale not seen in this country for over a century. The homeless problem has become a timebomb. Homelessness Around the United StatesWhen it comes to mismanaging the homeless, California may be leader of the pack, but other major urban centers are not far behind. The following table shows which American cities have the largest homeless populations. While four out of the top ten - Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco - are in California, it is New York City with the most homeless. An estimated 78,000 homeless are living on the streets of the Big Apple. As usual with numbers, however, theres more to this story. According to a report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, New York City has one of the lowest levels of unsheltered homeless at 5 percent, while in Los Angeles, 75 percent of people were found in unsheltered locations. Overall, over half of all homeless people live in one of the countrys 50 largest cities. In fact, nearly a quarter of all people sleeping unsheltered did so in either New York or Los Angeles. But how is it that New York City manages to get 95 percent of their homeless into overnight shelters, whereas Los Angeles only gets 25 percent of their homeless into shelters? An interesting analysis published in Medium in May 2018 explains how New Yorkers addressed the problem of homelessness. The approach was first to simply build more shelter beds. The correlation between the number of available shelter beds and the number of sheltered homeless is high across the nation, as the graphic below illustrates. What New York City did was to prioritize getting people under a roof for the night. In other cities where this has been tried, such as Columbus, Ohio, the number of unsheltered homeless has been brought under control. But New York City has gone a step further, offering reasonable conditions and incentives to their sheltered population even at this most basic first step of assistance.","homeless, homelessness",369,22,True,True,18,5
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"New York shelters provide a small platform from which people can rebuild their lives, but are also affordable enough to be able to scale to meet the citys immense problem. As the next chart shows, New York Citys nearly 800 shelters with an overnight capacity of over 62,000 individuals gives them a rate of unsheltered homeless of only 45 per 100,000 residents. San Francisco and Los Angeles, by contrast, have a rate of unsheltered homeless ten times higher Seattle, five times higher. Whats different in these cities?Part of it is New Yorks legacy of providing assistance to the homeless dating back to the Great Depression of the 1930s. New Yorks network of overnight shelters were acquired over decades, meaning New Yorkers today are able to allocate a higher percentage of the nearly 1.7 billion in city, state and federal money on caseworkers and shelter subsidies, and relatively less on acquisition of new shelter capacity. And because New York City prioritizes providing immediate shelter over the far more expensive permanent supportive housing, what seems like a prodigious amount budgeted to help the homeless comes out to only around 21,000 per homeless person. One obvious challenge facing cities such as Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other West Coast cities facing a homeless crisis is the high cost of housing. But other policies have helped cause the problem, and are making the problem worse. As described, state and local laws, court rulings and citizen initiatives have all made Californias homeless crisis much harder to manage. Not only is it harder to compel the homeless to seek shelter, or get them into treatment for addiction and mental illness, or prosecute them for criminal offenses, but the emphasis on permanent supportive housing takes money away from funds that could be used for overnight shelters. Up north, Seattle faces similar policy failures. Four articles published in City Journal over the past six months by Christopher Rufo, a research fellow at the Discovery Institutes Center for Wealth amp Poverty, offer a blistering critique of Seattles inept response to homelessness, and the growing backlash from residents. For starters, the Seattle metro area spends more than 1.0 billion fighting homelessness every year. That equates to nearly 100,000 per homeless individual living in Seattle, nearly five times as much as New York City spends. And yet, as previously shown, Seattles rate of unsheltered homeless is five times greater than New York City. By these measures, New York City is twenty-five times more efficient at battling homelessness than Seattle. Why is it that Seattle, the Emerald City, home to what is arguably the second biggest high-tech nexus on earth, a locus for fabulous wealth and a place of dazzling scenic beauty, with per capita income 50 percent higher than New York City, cant begin to manage their homeless problem?Rufo attributes the root cause of Seattles failure to what he calls unlimited compassion, and calls for a complete rethink of the assumptions that guide policies towards the homeless. It would not be much of an overstatement to characterize Rufos lengthy first article, from the Fall of 2018, entitled Seattle Under Siege, as a seminal manifesto challenging the entire ideological framework of the compassion brigades that dominate Seattle politics. This ideology is not unique to Seattle. It informs failed homeless policies across the U.S., especially in blue states, and especially on the West Coast. The SocialistLiberal Ideology That Fails to Help the HomelessWhat Rufo identifies as the four ideological power centers that frame the homeless debate in Seattle and elsewhere are the socialists, the compassion brigades, the addiction evangelists, and the homeless-industrial complex. The first three fit nicely into a SocialistLiberal ideology. The last of Rufos categories, his shared concern about the homeless industrial complex, is a bit more complicated, and motivated not by ideology but by desire for power and profit. More on that later. An interesting fact about the urban centers on the West Coast is that their high-tech driven wealth is highly correlated with higher wealth inequality, along with higher home prices and higher rents. And where the rich and poor live elbow to elbow at the same time as the cost-of-living soars, socialists come out of the woodwork, offering indignant soundbites and instant solutions. In Seattle, along with San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, avowed socialists sit on the city councils, offering a political agenda thats guaranteed to make everything worse for the people its supposed to help. In Seattle, the Socialist Alternative city council member is Kashama Sawant, who along with Adrienne Quinn, the new of boss the homeless activist group All Home, promotes an agenda that is all too familiar for anyone watching urban politics in cities controlled by liberals. For Sawant, that agenda includes rent control, public housing, minimum-wage hikes, and punitive corporate taxation. As for Quinn, Rufo writes In an op-ed in the Seattle Times, she lays out her plan to address the root causes of homelessness by solving racism, wage inequity, climate change, housing costs, public transportation, green building, sanctuary cities, the child-welfare system, brain injuries, and mental-health and addiction services. Needless to say, this socialist agenda will never solve the problem of homelessness. Rent control discourages investment in housing public housing is rarely built cost-effectively, especially in blue cities with extreme environmentalist building codes and costly labor laws, minimum wage hikes are job killers, and punitive corporate taxes send corporations packing for Texas. The most ironic thing about the socialist agenda in 21st century America is that it is inevitably co-opted by the corporate Left. The only thing these two special interests have in common, ultimately, is a vested interest in never seeing lasting solutions to any of the problems theyre supposedly fighting to solve. Lasting solutions would end their revenue streams. Compassion brigades, as Rufo puts it, are the moral crusaders of homelessness policy, the activists who put signs on their lawns that read In this house, we believe black lives matter, womens rights are human rights, no human is illegal, and so on. They see compassion as the highest virtue all else must be subordinated to it.","homeless, homelessness",369,37,True,True,18,6

And understanding this moral weakness in the moral arguments of liberal advocates for the homeless is a prerequisite to developing counter-arguments that offer equivalent moral worth. Which brings us to Rufos third ideological power center, the addiction evangelists, who he describes as the intellectual heirs of the 1960s counterculture.","homeless, homelessness",369,3,True,True,18,7
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"But providing addiction infrastructure has the predictable consequence of attracting addicts, and the more addiction infrastructure is provided, the more addicts are attracted. In all of these ideological movements - socialism, compassion, addiction evangelism - Rufo documents how the unintended consequence has been to increase the number of homeless people and the number of drug addicts on the streets of Seattle. Another consequence has been to invite a growing backlash from residents who have had enough. But progress is slow, especially when the will of the people isnt enough. When over 70,000 Seattle residents submitted a ballot measure to ban safe injection sites, it was thrown out in court. Apparently public health policy is not subject to veto by citizen initiative. The Homeless Industrial ComplexAs is usually the case with leftist movements in America, public policies would not embrace the movement unless powerful special interests saw an economic benefit. In the case of the homeless, this economic benefit has grown over time. Litigation and legislation, as described, have increased the cost of providing shelter for the homeless. These costs have also increased because the character of the homeless population has changed due to a variety of causes, making it more costly to effectively help them permissive drug laws combined with easier access to harder drugs such as opiates, mass release of nonviolent prison inmates, and laws restricting the ability to compel treatment for addiction or mental illness. At the same time as per capita costs have risen, public awareness has led to massive increases in funding to provide assistance.","homeless, homelessness",369,11,True,True,18,8

When I spoke with Eleanor Owen, one of the original co-founders of Seattles Downtown Emergency Service Center, she explained that the organizations mission has shifted over the years from helping the homeless to securing government contracts, maintaining a 112 million real-estate portfolio, and paying a staff of nearly 900.

Nowhere, however, is the mismanagement of homeless more acute than in the deep blue state of California, where land values and anti-development legislation, along with a host of other laws and court rulings as previously described, combined with the most forgiving winter weather in America, have combined to make it Americas homeless capital. Californias homeless are estimated to number over 130,000, living on sidewalks, parks and parking lots, vacant lots and on the beach. In Los Angeles County, the most recent count puts the number of homeless at 59,000. And in greater Los Angeles, there is plenty of money available to help the homeless. In 2016 Los Angeles voters approved Measure HHH, allocating 1.2 billion in bonds to build 10,000 units to house the homeless. Since then, Los Angeles voters approved a quarter cent sales tax increase, also to help the homeless. Additional hundreds of millions are coming from the state to help the homeless. Every major city in California is spending tens of millions or more on programs for the homeless. But most of the money is being wasted. Why? Because there is a Homeless Industrial Complex that is getting rich, wasting the money, while the homeless population swells. A disgraceful example of wasteful spending can be found in the homeless shelter being built in Venice Beach, where a permanent population of over 1,000 homeless have taken over virtually every public venue, including the beach. Because their tents are now protected by law as private space, they not only serve as housing, but as pop-up drug retailers and brothels.","homeless, homelessness",369,14,True,True,18,10

Not only is it only capable of housing a small fraction of the 1,000 homeless already in Venice, it will attract more homeless people to relocate to Venice. The story gets worse. This property, owned by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit District and located on some of the most precious real estate on earth, could have been sold to private investors to generate tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Why wasnt that choice made? Why, for that matter, arent homeless shelters being built in Pacific Palisades, or Brentwood, or Beverly Hills, or the other tony enclaves of LAs super rich? The answer speaks to the hypocrisy of the proponents of these solutions as much as it nurtures the cynicism of its critics. Because as with all boondoggles that destroy neighborhoods in the name of compassion, the Homeless Industrial Complex knows better than to foul their own nests. The Homeless Industrial Complexs expensive maltreatment of Venice Beach in particular, and taxpayers in general, is an example of how bridge housing projects are co-opted and corrupted. But even more horrendous waste is exemplified by the efforts to construct permanent supportive housing. According to an NPR report from June 2018, when voters passed Measure HHH, they were told that new permanent supportive housing would cost about 140,000 a unit. But average per unit costs are now more than triple that. The PATH Ventures project in East Hollywood has an estimated per-unit cost of 440,000.A privately funded development company, Flyaway Homes, has debuted in Los Angeles with the mission of rapidly providing housing for the homeless. Using retrofitted shipping containers, the companys modular approach to apartment building construction is purported to streamline the approval process and cut costs. But the two projects theyve got underway are too expensive to ever offer a solution to more than fraction of the homeless. Their 82nd Street Development will cost 4.5 million to house 32 clients in 16 two-bedroom, 480 square foot apartments.","homeless, homelessness",369,16,True,True,18,11
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"These costs are utterly unsustainable. But the Homeless Industrial Complex has grown into a juggernaut, crushing the opposition. At community hearings across California, homeless advocates, who are often bused in from other areas expressly to shout down local opposition, demand action, because no one deserves to live on a sidewalk. Money is squandered, and the population of homeless people multiplies. The Transformation vs Containment Approaches to the HomelessSan Diego has the fourth highest number of homeless of any city in the U.S., over 8,500. According to Paul Webster, operator of a privately funded homeless shelter in San Diego, there are two ways to treat the homeless, the transformational model and the containment model. The transformation model works to identify homeless individuals who are able to transition back to self-sufficiency and gives them the training and services to accomplish that. The containment model emphasizes getting shelter for the homeless before offering additional services. Webster is critical of a relatively recent federal law, the 2009 Hearth Act, that bureaucratized the process of getting public money to combat homelessness at the same time as it made it harder to secure funding for transformational programs. Since 2009, all organizations set up to help the homeless have to submit applications through regional quasi-government organizations called continuums of care. The applications have to be evidence based and reliant on data such as the HUD point in time counts. All grant requests as well have to include homelessness management information systems that facilitate coordinated entry of the homeless into supportive care. The new guidelines, enforced by HUD, also incorporated low barrier entry requirements in order to reach the most vulnerable. This meant applicants could not prohibit drug use, they cant require work, and they cannot require program compliance. Applicants for state and local grants have to adhere to these same HUD guidelines. Websters organization, Solutions for Change, requires no drug use, work, they have roommate restrictions, partying restrictions, and they do drug testing. This means that they cant accept federal funds and they also arent eligible for state funds because of the housing first rule, meaning that housing has to be provided before providing any other solutions to homelessness. The implications of the Hearth Act on how the homeless are treated go well beyond determining who gets funds. It has created an incentive for homeless organizations to prioritize helping drug addicts, because one of the ways to attract benefits to help the homeless is by getting Social Security Disability income. The so-called housing navigators who help qualify people for SSDI know it is easier to secure this benefit if the person is afflicted with drug addiction. According to Webster, there are three types of homeless. The cannots who are mentally ill or disabled these comprise about 15 percent of the homeless. Then there are the have nots who could succeed if they were trained to acquire new skills and had access to services. The have-nots are often not counted they live doubled up in homes, with friends, in cars, many of them are single mothers who want to avoid living on the street. These have-nots are about 42 percent of the homeless. The third group are the will nots who do not want to change.","homeless, homelessness",369,26,True,True,18,12
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"The will-nots become very sophisticated at getting things for nothing - the government doesnt make a distinction between the unwilling and the unable - as a result the unwilling will always have the ability to crowd out the unable. The result of laws aimed at helping the homeless, the Federal Hearth Act, or at criminal justice reform, Californias Prop. 47 and AB 953, are that the will-nots generally receive the bulk of the services aimed at helping the homeless, despite the fact that their treatment is invariably more expensive, and the likelihood they will ever change is much lower. Left behind are the cannots and the have-nots. Also left behind, at least when it comes to funding, are organizations that work on permanent transformation, instead of mere containment. To state the obvious, all of this must change. Here are some ways to make that happenSolutions to Americas Homeless CrisisPick Up the Trash With Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and other cities already facing the imminent threat of a breakout disease epidemic, this measure comes before all others. It ought to be easy, Americas cities in the second half of the 20th century were not inundated with tons of uncollected trash on the streets. In the case of Los Angeles, if their recently launched RecycLA program is truly the corruption riddled, ineffective, price gouging, trash neglecting disaster it appears to be, then cancel the program and go back to what worked in the past. The failure of large urban cities to even pick up their trash points to larger shifts in culture and governance that have to be addressed. Some cities, notably New York City, still manage to fulfill most of these basic obligations of local government. To the extent that piled up trash remains a problem after waste management contracts are restructured and the system of garbage collection works again, these larger structural issues have to be addressed - starting with the homeless encampments. Time could be running out. If rodent populations arent brought under control - perhaps also by temporarily permitting application of otherwise problematic rodenticides in infested urban settings - large numbers of innocent people may become afflicted with deadly diseases. If this does happen, it will be something that was totally avoidable. Look for an avalanche of lawsuits and possible criminal prosecutions against negligent local politicians. Lower the Cost of New Housing This is a monster topic, but cannot be excluded from any discussion of the homeless crisis. In some respects it is an excuse, since with other policy revisions it would be possible to shelter the homeless without having to engage in ridiculously expensive housing solutions. But the cost of housing, especially in blue states that are dominated by extreme environmentalists and labor unions in that order, is artificially high as the result of policies that must change if costs are to come down.","homeless, homelessness",369,18,True,True,18,13
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"This is perhaps the true motivation for smart growth. Reversing these policies will not solve the homeless crisis, but it will make it less likely for the hard working have nots roughly 40 percent of the homeless population to lose their homes and rentals, and it will make it easier for them to afford housing once they get back on their feet. Quit Blaming Homelessness on Prejudice and Privilege According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, African Americans make up 13 percent of the general population, but more than 40 percent of the homeless population. Similarly, American IndiansAlaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and people who identify as two or more races make up a disproportionate share of the homeless population. Clearly, minority communities are disproportionately represented among the homeless. While these statistics are probably accurate, they are used to reinforce the liberal catechism that finds all disparities by race to be the result of white racism.","homeless, homelessness",369,7,True,True,18,14
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"As shown, 57 percent of Black children in 2014 were being raised by single mothers, compared to only 18 percent of white children. Note the remarkable degree of correlation between the proportions of homeless by race, and the proportions of single parent households by race. Its easy, and plays well to the crowd, to attribute minority homelessness to racism. But a growing body of evidence suggests that intact families are the prevailing indicator of individual success in life. Until that evidence is confronted by the communities affected by it, other suggested causes for minorities being disproportionately represented among the homeless lack authenticity, and smack of opportunism. Untie Hands of Law Enforcement The theory of Broken Windows, or order maintenance policing argues that tolerating too much local disorder created a climate in which criminal behavior, including serious crimes, would become more likely, since criminals would sense that public norms and vigilance were weak. Broken Windows policing, whereby police crack down on low level crimes, was begun in the 1990s in New York City and is often credited with greatly reducing crime rates. At the other extreme is the near lawlessness that prevails on the streets of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other cities experiencing a homeless crisis. In California, as described, well-intentioned citizen approved ballot measures and ill-conceived legislation have tied the hands of law enforcement.","homeless, homelessness",369,10,True,True,18,15

It is important to stress that of while a little over 40 percent of the homeless are so-called have nots, these people almost all find shelter, often with friends or family. The remainder, the cannots and the will nots, are the ones found living on the streets.","homeless, homelessness",369,3,True,True,18,16
sanfrancisco,America 's Homeless Industrial Complex - Causes & Solutions,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"Often the afflicted have family members that have the means to help, and are desperate to get their relative into treatment, but the laws prevent them. Approximately 15 percent of the homeless are mentally ill arguably, the alcoholics and drug addicts are also suffering from a form of mental illness. Together these cohorts constitute well over half of all homeless, and nearly all of the unsheltered homeless seen on the streets. Families, caseworkers, and mental health professionals need to be given the legal tools to help these people. Overturn Jones vs Los Angeles and similar court rulings Starting over a decade ago with the 2006 decision in the case Jones vs the City of Los Angeles, homeless cannot be prohibited from sleeping on the street unless permanent supportive housing is available. Similar rulings have been issued in Idaho and Washington State. The impact of these rulings, combined with the other constraints on law enforcement, make it nearly impossible to clear the streets of homeless encampments. The problem has been exacerbated by subsequent lawsuits to enforce the Jones decision which have defined permanent supportive housing in ways that make it more expensive. The practical impact of the Jones case has been to make it financially infeasible to ever deliver adequate housing alternatives to the homeless. A major city with the financial wherewithal to pay for a sustained legal battle needs to challenge the Jones decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, with the objective being a ruling that will permit less elaborate, more cost-effective housing and shelter solutions to be allowable. Set Limits on Costs In Los Angeles today, a temporary shelter designed to last three years is being constructed at a cost of over 50,000 per bed, and permanent supportive housing units are being constructed for, on average, over 400,000 each. Los Angeles is also planning to deploy mobile toilets for the homeless to use, with the expected cost per unit of 339,000 per year. In Seattle, the cost for existing programs to help the homeless is approximately 100,000 per homeless person per year. Given the number of unsheltered homeless in Seattle, this spending is totally ineffective. These costs are absurd. Designing solutions that cost less, but offer shelter to 100 percent of the homeless, is vastly preferable to solutions that cost so much that only a fraction of the homeless get assistance. Creative solutions exist that cost far less. Off the shelf tents, sheds, prefab tiny homes, and prefab homes made from shipping containers are all less costly options. Relocating the homeless to repurposed industrial or retail sites that are already built out and not on premium real estate would cut costs. Putting shelters in the middle of some of the most expensive real estate on earth not only squanders finite available funds, but when the unused property is government owned, the chance is lost to sell that property and invest the proceeds in less expensive locations.","homeless, homelessness",369,20,True,True,18,17

For these homeless residents, nights in the city can be riddled with fear of their vehicle being impounded or their belongings vandalized. Assoaring housing costs3threaten to increase the number of homeless people residing in vehicles, cities are turning to the streets for an answer. In the last few years, multiple West Coast cities have rolled out programs that allow homeless residents to park safely overnight. In Los Angeles, a program calledSafe Parking LA4has opened three safe parking lots in the last year alone. After unveiling its first lot in Koreatownin 2018, the program rolled out two more a lot exclusively for homeless veterans on theDepartment of Veteran Affairs Campus and a third lot in Hollywood. The lots cater to themore than 8,5005residents who livein cars, vans, and campers throughout the city.

The program is modeled off ofNew Beginnings Safe Parking Program7, which originated in Santa Barbara in 2004.

sanfrancisco,Parking lots are the new solution to the homelessness crisis in cities — but they're also part of the problem,2018-09-04T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KQED,"Even in LA, where safe parking is becoming more common, only 10 of the citys streets allow residents to lodge in their vehicle. These restrictions are often driven by concerns over homeless residents bringing crime, litter, or noise to a neighborhood. A better use of parking spacesTheres an irony to all of this controversy. Aside from their ability to safely shelter homeless residents, parking lots take up quite a bit of unnecessary space in cities. A recent study13from theResearch Institute for Housing America found that cities often have more parking spaces than their residents require. In certain parts of Seattle, parking accounted for 40 of the land area, despite the fact that nearly half of all of households didnt own or operate a car. And in Philadelphia, the city had enough parking space to give four spots to every household. This pattern is likely to grow worse as the share of drivers in US cities continues to decline. With many parking lots left unoccupied, these spaces could easily be converted into a more permanent solution for homeless residents affordable housing. The problem is that developers and landowners profit far more from parking structures than they do from affordable development. In many cases, developers are even required14 to install a certain number of parking spaces in residential or office buildings. This has the effect of driving up rents15 in cities, making them less accommodating to low-income residents. As cities debate whether to expand or restrict their safe parking programs, they must confront an unfortunate paradox Parking lots might lessen the strain of homelessness in cities, but theyre also a big part of the problem.

Apple spent 70 million widening roads and making other improvements, and it contributed 5.85 million to Cupertinos affordable housing fund. The city required Apple to pay just 2.5 million in affordable housing fees, but the tech titan voluntarily more than doubled the amount. That money has helped produce just 19 units of affordable housing in Cupertino  all at The Veranda, which opened in August and cost the city 3.67 million from the affordable housing fund. Six million dollars frankly just doesnt go very far, said Cupertino Councilman Rod Sinks, who recuses himself from Apple-related city decisions because his wife works for the company.

Thats unfortunate, because tiny homes offer a creative solution to the homelessness crisis. Tiny homes cost between 200 and 400 per square foot, depending on the materials used and their extravagance, according to Forbes4, while the median list price in San Jose is 5155 per square foot. Earlier this year, the city became the first6 in the US where the average home costs over 1 million. In San Jose, where many of the citys homeless stay in camps7 along trails, creeks, and rivers, something had to give. The city declared a shelter crisis back in December for the purpose of building homes that skirt existing development codes, according to the Mercury News8. This law really is the first of its kind, Ray Bramson, San Joses homeless response manager, tells the Mercury News9. It will allow us to create bridge housing opportunities  a stable place people can live and stay while theyre waiting to be placed in a permanent home. San Jose isnt the first city to build tiny houses for the homeless. A number of cities, including Austin, Texas Detroit, Michigan and Portland, Oregon, have experimented with tiny villages for the homeless. Residents of these villages speaking to the media describe10 a sense of pride in their communities. In Austin, the creator of one such village estimates it will save taxpayers up to 3 million annually11 thats normally spent on medical bills and criminal justice expenses for the homeless.

Tamlyn Monson 2015a, 2015b argues that the deep historical inequalities of racialized citizenship in South Africa remain spatially embedded in informal squatter settlements with long histories of popular resistance against apartheid, characterized by distinctive repertoires of collective action that continue to be mobilized in a still-unfinished history of struggle for race and class equality. This continuing struggle for equality and social justice on the parts of South Africas Black poor  ostensible citizens  draws on shared experiences of everyday deprivations and collective labor, exacerbating the social distance between long-established local squatters and foreign newcomers whom they perceive to be politically indifferent or opportunistic. At times of protest, familiar practices of insurgent citizenship among the seasoned denizens of apartheid and its aftermaths have increasingly been diverted into mob violence against other Black African migrants. Thus, paradoxically, apparently xenophobic mobilizations, while clearly plagued by nativism and anti-foreigner racism, may be seen nonetheless to articulate the frustrated claims for inclusion on the parts of structurally excluded ostensible citizens, rather than a purely exclusionary impulse on the part of those who are presumed to already belong.",squatter,5,5,False,True,1,0

Drawing on the work of Frances Webber, it is clear that the government has achieved the creation of a racist, Islamophobic, and nativist hostile environment through several policies that treat non-citizen domestic work as property of their employers by using highly restrictive visa policies that limit legal rights to enter and exit the UK that treat asylum seekers as tenants deserving of only the most squalid accommodation of rendering asylum seekers and non-citizens homeless through the Scheme discussed above, and of excluding them from basic social goods such as healthcare and education Webber, 2019 86. There is a spectrum here of property relationality  from being treated as a commodity labor to be owned, to being excluded from shelter and rendered as lacking the legal capacity to hold property rights and with respect to the racial dimensions of nationalism informing these policies, as seen above, as lacking these capacities in some kind of ontological and a priori sense. Simultaneously, these subjects of ownership and control are bound by legal and regulatory frameworks that make it impossible to live without working and simultaneously making work illegal, forcing vulnerable people to accept conditions of super-exploitation and total insecurity as the price of remaining in the country, and enables private companies to profit from such super-exploitation ibid. 86.",homeless,5,5,False,True,1,0
