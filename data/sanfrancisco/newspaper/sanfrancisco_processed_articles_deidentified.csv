Scrap the stupid laws advocating for living on the streets, construct shelters, and bring the homeless in for safe and humane housing on a temporary basis. Second, provide effective care for the mentally ill and drug-addicted members of the homeless population, which makes up a majority.

[ORGANIZATION] is changing its plans to uxe the citys FAC0 and the beloved [ORGANIZATION] to house some of its homeless population to fight the coronavirus disease. City officials had intended to use [LOCATION], a popular conference venue favored by the regions tech companies, to shelter up to 4003 people living in existing homeless shelters in the city. The goal was to thin out existing homeless shelters in the city by distributing some residents to makeshift shelters. That would create more space for physical distancing to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the homeless community. And on [ORGANIZATION], the city announced it was turning to its beloved4 [ORGANIZATION] facilities, originally built in [LOCATION] for [ORGANIZATION], to house up to 162 people. But now officials say the city will focus more heavily on hotel rooms to house the homeless. Neither [ORGANIZATION] nor the [PERSON] will be used for homeless moved from other shelters, [ORGANIZATION], director of [ORGANIZATION]s ORG2, told [ORGANIZATION], physical distancing in the shelters will be achieved by moving vulnerable individuals from shelter into hotel rooms. FAC0 will still be used to house members of the citys homeless population, but no more than 200 at a time, as the [ORGANIZATION] ORG66 reports. The center will house those exiting rooms used for self-isolation and who have tested negative for the disease or are recovering and have tested negative, according to [ORGANIZATION] of plans means that officials now need more rooms, roughly 1,0008 more than were originally projected according to the ORG6. The decision comes after the ORG7, a publication operated by [ORGANIZATION], reported that the citys plan for the FAC0 included placing thin mats on the ground six feet apart from each other for people in the indoor camp. Homeless people had already started10 moving into the center DATE2. It looked like a World War I flu hospital, said [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON], according to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]11. Exactly the kind of environment we need to get people out of, not put people into. Renting empty hotel rooms throughout [ORGANIZATION] has been apart of the citys broader mission to prep temporary treatment and housing sites for not just those who are homeless, but also first responders and healthcare workers who require self-isolation. A similar plan12 to house the homeless population in GPE2 is in [STREET]. The citys travel and tourism industries have been slammed amid the coronavirus pandemic, rendering hotel rooms empty throughout [ORGANIZATION]. The homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] who would be moved to the hotel rooms are those who have tested positive for [PERSON] or who have been tested and are waiting for results to return. The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people over [ORGANIZATION] with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. About 150 [LOCATION] are currently occupied, and 945 rooms are under contract across eight hotels according to [ORGANIZATION]0 Some officials15 argue that the thousands of empty hotel rooms in the city should be used to house the entire homeless population in the city regardless of the need for self-isolation. The plan has never included those living on the streets  only those in existing shelters  and unhoused people are at a much higher risk of contracting the disease. But Mayor [PERSON] said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people. We are not going to be able to solve our homeless problem in [ORGANIZATION] with this crisis, [ORGANIZATION] said Friday.16 The first confirmed case within a [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] was announced on DATE4.

But new guidelines4 from [ORGANIZATION] provide further direction on how to respond to the virus and its effects on unsheltered individuals in the [PERSON]. The most stand-out measure is to halt homeless encampment sweeps and to not move homeless individuals into temporary housing units unless they have space to social distance once inside. Unless individual housing units are available, do not clear encampments during community spread of [ORGANIZATION], reads the ORG1 website.5 [ORGANIZATION] encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread. That means that the potential makeshift shelters being created in hotels, schools, and other facilities in [ORGANIZATION] are viable options to get people who have tested positive off the streets as long as there is enough space for social distancing in them. There are about 8,500 hotel rooms6 in [ORGANIZATION] that could potentially serve this purpose. According to the [ORGANIZATION] Chronicle7, there has yet to be a confirmed case in [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population. The guidelines also include encouraging each individual to carve out 144 square feet of space for their sleeping quarters on the streets and to send counselors into the streets to remind people of best practices, like to distance from others. There are an estimated 552,8308 people living in homelessness in the [PERSON], more than 100,000 in the state of [PERSON], and an estimated 28,200 in [ORGANIZATION].

On the [LOCATION] opening panel, [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION] professor and a doctor at [ORGANIZATION], said that even the basic [STREET] we categorize homeless people is wrong and dehumanizing. There is no such thing in my mind as a homeless person, she said. There are people who experience this. [PERSON], in other words, is not an identity. Its an experience  a phrase that resonated with ORG2 in particular. And the doctor knows the culprit for this experience. Look, I love medical conditions, she said. But homelessness is caused by a lack of affordable housing. That statement hit home for [PERSON], the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], who was himself homeless in [DATE]. There are ways to help homeless people in drips and drops  he has committed his life to this  but fully addressing the situation would require a remaking of society. Putting Money in the Right HandsThe money to solve homelessness is there, he continued. Its just not in the hands it needs to be in. Five corporations in [ORGANIZATION] made almost 28 billion in profits [ORGANIZATION], he said. Thats [ADDRESS], in three-and-a-half [LOCATION], they make as much profit as we spend on homelessness. The primary source of affordable housing for minorities is now incarceration, he continued. This is unsustainable.

The FAC0 neighborhood effectively borders the [ORGANIZATION], however, meaning a confused tourist could easily end up there.5. ORG3 lunchtime, I pop into a church one with the glorious architecture, high ceilings, and impressive art characteristic of so many older Catholic churches in GPE2.

After the service, I explore the rest of the church. Most of the wooden pews with no padding for comfort are occupied by a sleeping person. Three people are lying on the floor in the back. I speak briefly to [LOCATION], a new employee of [ORGANIZATION]. When I ask PERSON3 how the homeless can be helped and what should be done, he speaks of a lack of motivation, of people going down a path of not caring anymore instead of having a fire burning in you. PERSON3 talks about the need for a work ethic, and how its too simplistic to say the homeless problem is an effect of the citys expensive housing. But hes also adamant that people need help We just cant give up on the willing, he says. I ask him if the homeless people he encounters have loved ones or families who could help.

An emergency ordinance was introduced [ORGANIZATION] that would require [ORGANIZATION] to find and rent 7,000 hotel rooms to house all of [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population during the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual news conference [ORGANIZATION]2, five members of [ORGANIZATION] announced they are backing the proposed ordinance, which would require the city to procure the rooms by DATE2, the projected [ORGANIZATION] for the number of confirmed cases to hit its peak in the state of GPE2. According to a press release, the mandate also includes establishing 750 rooms for healthcare workers and first responders who have been infected with or exposed to the virus, as well as 500 rooms for those being released from local hospitals following infection of or exposure to the virus but who cannot self-isolate at home. According to an article4 the [ORGANIZATION] Examiner, the full board plans to vote on the proposal next [ORGANIZATION] it will require eight votes to pass under emergency rules. Since the coronavirus disease, known as [ORGANIZATION], reached [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], the city has endeavored to address how the illness could impact its sizable homeless community. There are an estimated 8,0005 unhoused people in the city, and an outbreak among that population could overwhelm the healthcare system.

See [ORGANIZATION] Impact Bond Projects1The DATE3 [ORGANIZATION] project emerged after a study of the records of more than 100,000 homeless individuals from [ORGANIZATION] to DATE5.

Spending tax dollars directly on challenging problems or populations is usually a hard sell politically. What differentiates a social impact bond from other general outcomes-based approaches is the use of outside investors to front direct-service costs. This lets governments test new interventions without digging into their budgets right away and pay only when goals are reached.

Many thought that this provision was an obstacle to building any housing at all. Though I recognize that some developers said that these affordable housing thresholds were financially unworkable in housing developments, this decision overtime will reduce the stock of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I believe the best [STREET] for the city to start improving the situation is to recommit to its own affordable housing ordinance. This will help expand the stock of affordable housing built in future development projects. As market-rate housing expands, so should the availability of affordable housing. The city should also encourage more developers to contribute to the housing trust fund. This would give the city resources to finance the building of additional affordable housing or to provide other kinds of support for those struggling to afford rising housing costs. At some points in the past developers have use the option of housing trust fund contributions to get out of obligations to build affordable housing units. To avoid this, the city should use this option in conjunction with the building of affordable housing units, along with making sure that developer contributions are fair for the community and have an actual impact addressing housing needs. PERSON1 The loss of redevelopment funding is regrettable, but affordable housing is continuing to be built across the state with other sources of funding and mechanisms. The end of redevelopment agencies has not been the end of affordable housing construction. The first step is to do an independent, in-depth study that looks at what level of inclusionary housing is actually achievable. We need a solid understanding of what can work so that the city is not relying on subjective claims by developers of what does or does not pencil out. The city needs an independent arbitrator of how affordable housing can be included so we can maximize affordable units in future projects.

PERSON0 Changes to the ORG2 ordinance removal of the exemption for mixed-use buildings, an actual number for minimums in the [ORGANIZATION] to be determined by [ORGANIZATION] using evidence and input from local developers, update the in-lieu fee, and include the recommendations from [ORGANIZATION]. By its nature, new construction is expensive, though residential rents have gone up a lot faster than materials costs. Refurbishing existing housing stock to ORG2 is a good [STREET] to make more headway on this issue and would be a more efficient use of the ORG2 fund. Also, there is affordable housing that is not officially designated [PERSON]. Many of the older apartment complexes - many near downtown - are heavily populated by working families. We must not trade this for new construction with what can be defined as [PERSON]. The FAC0 project is an example of defined ORG2 that is actually more expensive than existing market-rate housing. This is a somewhat shameful use of an equation to make a project look good. Additionally, ORG2 numbers should be net numbers. For example, the FAC1 project removed housing that was less expensive than the ORG2 associated with that project. Again, using math to make things look better than they are should not be [PERSON] policy. Long-term affordability - increasing limited-equity ownership opportunities a la Dos Pinos, etc. allows a much broader swath of the economic spectrum to gain equity and improve their economic station. District 5 PERSON1 The [PERSON] should enforce the existing ordinance and be consistent in its expectations from developers. In the current environment, projects and modifications to affordable housing are approved on an ad-hoc basis, which creates great inconsistencies in affordable housing inventory. [PERSON] housing requirements exist for proposed development projects and enforcing these requirements would create more certainty for developers and add to the affordable housing supply. Approval of the [ORGANIZATION] Plan with a focus on densification and building up would create more opportunities for affordable housing units. If we truly value equity and inclusivity, then the best [STREET] forward is to have a diverse plan that leads to more affordable units on the ground. Expanding [ORGANIZATION] will support a wide variety of affordable housing development. Slight increases in development impact fees, allocating [ORGANIZATION] to this fund, and re-exploring the 50 social services parcel tax that was proposed by Mayor [PERSON] are several options to explore. While as a small business owner I recognize the economic impact of the pandemic on all businesses, cities of comparable size in [ORGANIZATION] have much higher in-lieu fees and this is a realistic approach to building more affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION] should work to address the anti-development culture. There is a tremendous amount of misunderstanding about how much affordable housing single development projects generate. A social services parcel tax, which would generate 1.5 million a year, will open new and more sustainable ways to fund affordable housing. PERSON3 Things like affordable rent by the bed allows property owners to charge higher prices for a unit by increasing the occupancy of a two bedroom to four people for instance. This is unacceptable. The current affordable housing ordinance offers too much flexibility and opportunities for developers to get around providing units at affordable prices. Building market rate housing in [PERSON] will make money. Period.

The nonprofits dont just run these projects - the actual people staffing these shelters arent overpaid - they operate huge bureaucratic empires with overhead, marketing budgets, and executive salaries that do nothing for the homeless. None of these dynamics are terribly unique. Government funded programs are rarely considered bargains. And despite prodigious waste, [ORGANIZATION] military is nonetheless the most fearsome in the world. Similarly, despite mismanaging literally billions in proceeds from bonds and taxes collected to help the homeless, in absolute numbers [ORGANIZATION] population of homeless may have actually declined over [ORGANIZATION]. How Many Homeless Are There in America?This surprises a lot of people, but theres a lot more to that story. According to [ORGANIZATION], in [LOCATION] there were 647,000 homeless people in the [ORGANIZATION], but by the time the most recent count was released in [DATE], that number had declined to 543,000. Why, if so much money is being wasted, and the homeless crisis seems to be more acute than ever, are the absolute numbers of homeless actually falling? First of all, the numbers may be incorrect. These counts may be grossly understated. An illuminating critique of how ORG2s point-in-time homeless count may be understating the numbers was published by [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. Author PERSON0 participated in an official count, covering a section of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], in [TIME] of [DATE]. ORG2 requires cities and counties to complete the count, on [PERSON], [PERSON], in order to receive federal funding for homeless programs. But canvassing the streets of any city during the pre-dawn hours during [ORGANIZATION] is bound to miss a lot of people. Quoting from the article, The count is during [LOCATION] [TIME], when its harder to actually find folks because theyre seeking some sort of refuge. They want to stay out of sight in general for their own safety. Knowing just how many Americans are homeless is further complicated by competing definitions of homelessness. ORG3 [ORGANIZATION] claimed in a [ORGANIZATION] report that 1.3 million K-12 students were homeless in DATE9. But [ORGANIZATION] defines the homeless as not only those who are unsheltered or in homeless shelters, but those sharing housing due to loss of their own home, or living in hotels or motels. Even in [ORGANIZATION], a state where homelessness is now a crisis célèbre for state legislators in [LOCATION], and a cautionary horror story for conservative critics of [ORGANIZATION] politics, at first glance, the overall numbers suggest the problem is overblown. On the map depicted below, using ORG2 data, the state by state homeless trend is shown for [DATE] from [LOCATION] to [LOCATION]3, in which [ORGANIZATION]s total homeless population actually dropped by 3.4 percent. But reports from around the state dispute the ORG2 assessment. According to a [LOCATION]1 article published in [ORGANIZATION], in GPE4, the number of homeless residents jumped 43 percent over [LOCATION]2. In [PERSON], that number was 42 percent. GPE6 volunteers surveying the regions homeless population found a 50 percent increase over [DATE]. GPE7 notched a 17 percent increase since [LOCATION]3. When [PERSON] officials released the results of their most recent count, homelessness was up by 12 percent over [LOCATION]4 in the county and up 16 percent in the City of [PERSON]. Nobody seems to know whether these flaws and ambiguities in how the homeless are counted mean that the crisis is in fact worse now than ever, despite official numbers showing a decline. But total numbers alone dont tell the whole story. How the homeless are treated, and where the homeless are concentrated, has changed a great deal in [LOCATION]5. This is the real reason the homeless crisis [LOCATION]6 is worse than ever. The next map, below, using data from [ORGANIZATION], shows [DATE] estimates of the total homeless population by state. Viewed in this context, the states where homelessness increased dramatically over [LOCATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, and [ORGANIZATION]2, nonetheless confront a relatively insignificant challenge. As of [DATE], the estimated homeless population of all three of those states combined totaled only 2,340 people. Most homeless, on the other hand, are concentrated in states that share one or more of three characteristics a mild [LOCATION]7 climate, large urban centers, and liberal politics. [ORGANIZATION]3, with the nations second largest homeless population, fulfills two of those three criteria. Sunny [ORGANIZATION], in first [STREET] with an estimated homeless population exceeding 129,000 in [DATE], fulfills all three. Whether the numbers of homeless people are up or down in [ORGANIZATION] is only half the story. How [ORGANIZATION]s homelessness has worsened over [LOCATION]5 represents a qualitative change. The mismanagement of [ORGANIZATION]s homeless can be attributed to FAC0, but other policy failures are also to blame. All in all, [ORGANIZATION]s response to homelessness is a textbook example of how to get almost everything wrong. Policies That Made [ORGANIZATION]s Homeless Crisis WorseAn assortment of policy failures can be directly linked to why homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] is a bigger problem than ever, even in the unlikely event the numbers of homeless have not dramatically increased. These policy failures have taken the form of overzealous [STREET] rulings, citizen approved ballot measures that wreaked havoc in their unintended consequences, and flawed legislation. [STREET] Decisions ORG7, unsurprisingly, is the author of at least three rulings that have tied the hands of law enforcement in dealing with the homeless. The first of these is [PERSON] v. the City of [PERSON], decided in [LOCATION]8, that ruled that law enforcement and city officials can no longer enforce the ban on sleeping on sidewalks anywhere within the [PERSON] city limits until a sufficient amount of permanent supportive housing could be built."

About 7,000 inmates became immediately eligible, and as of early [LOCATION], there were about 25,000 nonviolent state felons that could seek early release and parole under [LOCATION]osition 57. Hopefully most of these released inmates reintegrated successfully into society. But those among this at-risk population who did not joined [ORGANIZATION]s homeless. State Legislation Flawed legislation by [ORGANIZATION] lawmakers would include [ORGANIZATION], passed in [LOCATION], which released tens of thousands of non-violent criminals out of county jails due to overcrowding without providing adequate means to monitor and assist their transition back into society. Thousands of these inmates were coping with drug addiction and mental illness, and they have found their [STREET] onto [ORGANIZATION]s streets and parks. Many of them are non-violent drug dealers or convicted thieves. As with [LOCATION]. 57, [ORGANIZATION] has changed the character of [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population. And then theres the infamous AB 953, a ridiculous bit of legislation that epitomizes the mentality of [ORGANIZATION]s utopian leftist politicians."

No summary of counterproductive state legislation would be complete without mentioning the laws that make it nearly impossible to get treatment for mentally ill homeless people. According to a report published by [ORGANIZATION], this problem began [STREET] back in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] with a law signed by then-Gov. [PERSON]. Aimed at safeguarding the civil rights of one of societys most vulnerable populations, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act put an end to the inappropriate and often indefinite institutionalization of people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities. Ever since, and especially in [LOCATION] as the percentage of homeless who suffer from mental illness has increased, attempts to reform the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act have been tenaciously resisted by the ORG1 and other homeless advocacy groups. As reported by [PERSON] public radio station ORG2, during DATE2 three laws were introduced by [ORGANIZATION] legislators that would attempt to change conservatorship rules to allow city health workers to help homeless people with substance abuse and mental health problems by legally and temporarily stepping in to force a mentally ill person into treatment. Only one, SB [DATE], became law, and the final version was so watered down that [PERSON] Mayor [PERSON], a liberal Democrat, claimed As drafted, SB [DATE] would allow us to help fewer than five individuals. There are an estimated 7,[ADDRESS] rulings and laws, nearly all of them passed or decided in [LOCATION], have made it far more difficult to manage [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population. Their effect has been to increase the proportion of mentally ill, drug addicts, and criminals as a percentage of the homeless, at the same time as police and social service workers have far less ability to detain, relocate, or even offer help to the homeless. Mismanaged Homeless Encampments Raise Threat of Medieval Disease EpidemicsNotwithstanding the many passed or proposed state laws that attempt to create more housing, or throw additional billions at FAC0 to be largely squandered, another set of state laws - either proposed or already passed - threaten to turn [ORGANIZATION]s homeless epidemic into a serious disease epidemic. In [DATE] the [ORGANIZATION] Legislature passed AB [DATE], banning rat poison that uses anticoagulants."

And the mountains of trash that create rat habitat are not just coming from homeless people, they are a product of a disastrous decision by the [ORGANIZATION] City Council that has led to mountains of uncollected trash from businesses and residences. In [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] City Council began to implement the ORG1 program, where they gave seven companies the exclusive right to collect trash. Putting small haulers out of business in the name of saving the streets from excessive traffic, the measure was sold as a [STREET] to create economies of scale. Instead, these companies were unable to smoothly absorb the additional work, at the same time as in many cases they doubled or tripled their collection fees. The consequences of these failed schemes are that [ORGANIZATION] now has two sources contributing to the mountains of trash in the city - homeless encampments, but also illegal dumping by disgruntled businesses and residences. Where theres trash, there are rats, and where there are rats, there are disease carrying fleas."

[ORGANIZATION], a communicable form of diarrhea, is now common among the homeless. There have even been outbreaks of trench fever, spread by lice. As reported by the ORG0 DATE0 Medieval Diseases Are Infecting [PERSON]s Homeless. To-date, except for those people living and working in proximity to the many encampments, the homeless crisis in [PERSON] has been an abstraction. But now there is a possibility that this perfect storm of neglect, indulgence, and corruption may lead to disease outbreaks on a scale not seen in this country for [LOCATION]. The homeless problem has become a timebomb. [PERSON] GPE4 it comes to mismanaging the homeless, [PERSON] may be leader of the pack, but other major urban centers are not far behind. The following table shows which [PERSON]n cities have the largest homeless populations. While four out of the top ten - [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], GPE6, and GPE7 - are in [PERSON], it is [PERSON] with the most homeless. An estimated 78,000 homeless are living on the streets of [LOCATION]. As usual with numbers, however, theres more to this story. According to a report from [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] has one of the lowest levels of unsheltered homeless at 5 percent, while in [ORGANIZATION], 75 percent of people were found in unsheltered locations. Overall, over half of all homeless people live in one of the countrys 50 largest cities. In fact, nearly a quarter of all people sleeping unsheltered did so in either [PERSON]0 or [ORGANIZATION]. But how is it that [PERSON] manages to get 95 percent of their homeless into [TIME] shelters, whereas [ORGANIZATION] only gets 25 percent of their homeless into shelters? An interesting analysis published in ORG2 in DATE2 explains how [PERSON]0ers addressed the problem of homelessness. The approach was first to simply build more shelter beds. The correlation between the number of available shelter beds and the number of sheltered homeless is high across the nation, as the graphic below illustrates. What [PERSON] did was to prioritize getting people under a roof for [TIME]. In other cities where this has been tried, such as [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2, the number of unsheltered homeless has been brought under control. But [PERSON] has gone a step further, offering reasonable conditions and incentives to their sheltered population even at this most basic first step of assistance."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,37,True,True,18,6,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"[ORGANIZATION] shelters provide a small platform from which people can rebuild their lives, but are also affordable enough to be able to scale to meet the citys immense problem. As the next chart shows, [ORGANIZATION] Citys nearly 800 shelters with an [TIME] capacity of over 62,000 individuals gives them a rate of unsheltered homeless of only 45 per 100,000 residents. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], by contrast, have a rate of unsheltered homeless ten times higher [PERSON], five times higher. Whats different in these cities?Part of it is [ORGANIZATION]s legacy of providing assistance to the homeless dating back to the Great Depression of the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]s network of [TIME] shelters were acquired over [LOCATION], meaning [ORGANIZATION]ers DATE2 are able to allocate a higher percentage of the nearly 1.7 billion in city, state and federal money on caseworkers and shelter subsidies, and relatively less on acquisition of new shelter capacity. And because [ORGANIZATION] City prioritizes providing immediate shelter over the far more expensive permanent supportive housing, what seems like a prodigious amount budgeted to help the homeless comes out to only around 21,000 per homeless person. One obvious challenge facing cities such as [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and other [ORGANIZATION] cities facing a homeless crisis is the high cost of housing. But other policies have helped cause the problem, and are making the problem worse. As described, state and local laws, [STREET] rulings and citizen initiatives have all made GPE7 homeless crisis much harder to manage. Not only is it harder to compel the homeless to seek shelter, or get them into treatment for addiction and mental illness, or prosecute them for criminal offenses, but the emphasis on permanent supportive housing takes money away from funds that could be used for [TIME] shelters. Up north, [PERSON] faces similar policy failures. Four articles published in [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], a research fellow at [ORGANIZATION], offer a blistering critique of [PERSON]s inept response to homelessness, and the growing backlash from residents. For starters, the [PERSON] metro area spends more than 1.0 billion fighting homelessness [PERSON]. That equates to nearly 100,000 per homeless individual living in [PERSON], nearly five times as much as [ORGANIZATION] City spends. And yet, as previously shown, [PERSON]s rate of unsheltered homeless is five times greater than [ORGANIZATION] City. By these measures, [ORGANIZATION] City is twenty-five times more efficient at battling homelessness than [PERSON]. Why is it that [PERSON], [PERSON], home to what is arguably the second biggest high-tech nexus on earth, a locus for fabulous wealth and a [STREET] of dazzling scenic beauty, with per capita income 50 percent higher than [ORGANIZATION] City, cant begin to manage their homeless problem?PERSON3 attributes the root cause of [PERSON]s failure to what he calls unlimited compassion, and calls for a complete rethink of the assumptions that guide policies towards the homeless. It would not be much of an overstatement to characterize [ORGANIZATION] lengthy first article, from [PERSON], entitled [PERSON] Under Siege, as a seminal manifesto challenging the entire ideological framework of the compassion brigades that dominate [PERSON] politics. This ideology is not unique to [PERSON]. It informs failed homeless policies across the [ORGANIZATION], especially in blue states, and especially on the [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] Ideology That Fails to Help the HomelessWhat PERSON3 identifies as the four ideological power centers that frame the homeless debate in [PERSON] and elsewhere are the socialists, the compassion brigades, the addiction evangelists, and the homeless-industrial complex. The first three fit nicely into a [ORGANIZATION] ideology. The last of [ORGANIZATION] categories, his shared concern about the homeless industrial complex, is a bit more complicated, and motivated not by ideology but by desire for power and profit. More on that later. An interesting fact about the urban centers on the [ORGANIZATION] is that their high-tech driven wealth is highly correlated with higher wealth inequality, along with higher home prices and higher rents. And where the rich and poor live elbow to elbow at the same time as the cost-of-living soars, socialists come out of the woodwork, offering indignant soundbites and instant solutions. In [PERSON], along with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and elsewhere, avowed socialists sit on the city councils, offering a political agenda thats guaranteed to make everything worse for the people its supposed to help. In [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] member is [ORGANIZATION], who along with PERSON5, the new of boss the homeless activist group [ORGANIZATION], promotes an agenda that is all too familiar for anyone watching urban politics in cities controlled by liberals. For [PERSON], that agenda includes rent control, public housing, minimum-wage hikes, and punitive corporate taxation. As for [ORGANIZATION], PERSON3 writes In an op-ed in the [PERSON] Times, she lays out her plan to address the root causes of homelessness by solving racism, wage inequity, climate change, housing costs, public transportation, green building, sanctuary cities, the child-welfare system, brain injuries, and mental-health and addiction services. Needless to say, this socialist agenda will never solve the problem of homelessness. Rent control discourages investment in housing public housing is rarely built cost-effectively, especially in blue cities with extreme environmentalist building codes and costly labor laws, minimum wage hikes are job killers, and punitive corporate taxes send corporations packing for GPE10. The most ironic thing about the socialist agenda in [ORGANIZATION] GPE11 is that it is inevitably co-opted by the corporate [LOCATION]. The only thing these two special interests have in common, ultimately, is a vested interest in never seeing lasting solutions to any of the problems theyre supposedly fighting to solve. Lasting solutions would end their revenue streams. Compassion brigades, as PERSON3 puts it, are the moral crusaders of homelessness policy, the activists who put signs on their lawns that read In this house, we believe black lives matter, womens rights are human rights, no human is illegal, and so on. They see compassion as the highest virtue all else must be subordinated to it."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,3,True,True,18,7,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"But regardless of what social psychologists theorize, or how those theories are latched onto by various ideologues, [ORGANIZATION] assertion that the compassion brigades ascribe inordinate emphasis to compassion, at the expense of other moral considerations, is evidence based. And understanding this moral weakness in the moral arguments of liberal advocates for the homeless is a prerequisite to developing counter-arguments that offer equivalent moral worth. Which brings us to [ORGANIZATION] third ideological power center, the addiction evangelists, who he describes as the intellectual heirs of the [ORGANIZATION] counterculture."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,11,True,True,18,8,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"But providing addiction infrastructure has the predictable consequence of attracting addicts, and the more addiction infrastructure is provided, the more addicts are attracted. In all of these ideological movements - socialism, compassion, addiction evangelism - PERSON0 documents how the unintended consequence has been to increase the number of homeless people and the number of drug addicts on the streets of [ORGANIZATION]. Another consequence has been to invite a growing backlash from residents who have had enough. But progress is slow, especially when the will of the people isnt enough. When over 70,000 [ORGANIZATION] residents submitted a ballot measure to ban safe injection sites, it was thrown out in [STREET]. Apparently public health policy is not subject to veto by citizen initiative. FAC0 is usually the case with leftist movements in [ORGANIZATION], public policies would not embrace the movement unless powerful special interests saw an economic benefit. In the case of the homeless, this economic benefit has grown over time. Litigation and legislation, as described, have increased the cost of providing shelter for the homeless. These costs have also increased because the character of the homeless population has changed due to a variety of causes, making it more costly to effectively help them permissive drug laws combined with easier access to harder drugs such as opiates, mass release of nonviolent prison inmates, and laws restricting the ability to compel treatment for addiction or mental illness. At the same time as per capita costs have risen, public awareness has led to massive increases in funding to provide assistance."

When I spoke with [ORGANIZATION], one of the original co-founders of [ORGANIZATION], she explained that the organizations mission has shifted over [ORGANIZATION] from helping the homeless to securing government contracts, maintaining a 112 million real-estate portfolio, and paying a staff of nearly 900.

Nowhere, however, is the mismanagement of homeless more acute than in the deep blue state of [ORGANIZATION], where land values and anti-development legislation, along with a host of other laws and [STREET] rulings as previously described, combined with the most forgiving [ORGANIZATION] weather in [PERSON], have combined to make it [PERSON]s homeless capital. [ORGANIZATION]s homeless are estimated to number over 130,000, living on sidewalks, parks and parking lots, vacant lots and on the beach. In [PERSON], the most recent count puts the number of homeless at 59,000. And in greater GPE4, there is plenty of money available to help the homeless. In [LOCATION] GPE4 voters approved [PERSON], allocating 1.2 billion in bonds to build 10,000 units to house the homeless. Since then, GPE4 voters approved a quarter cent sales tax increase, also to help the homeless. Additional hundreds of millions are coming from the state to help the homeless. Every major city in [ORGANIZATION] is spending tens of millions or more on programs for the homeless. But most of the money is being wasted. Why? Because there is FAC0 that is getting rich, wasting the money, while the homeless population swells. A disgraceful example of wasteful spending can be found in the [INSTITUTION] being built in [PERSON], where a permanent population of over 1,000 homeless have taken over virtually every public venue, including the beach. Because their tents are now protected by law as private space, they not only serve as housing, but as pop-up drug retailers and brothels."

Not only is it only capable of housing a small fraction of the 1,000 homeless already in [ORGANIZATION], it will attract more homeless people to relocate to [ORGANIZATION]. The story gets worse. This property, owned by [PERSON] and located on some of the most precious real estate on earth, could have been sold to private investors to generate tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Why wasnt that choice made? Why, for that matter, arent homeless shelters being built in [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION], or [PERSON], or the other tony enclaves of GPE4 super rich? The answer speaks to the hypocrisy of the proponents of these solutions as much as it nurtures the cynicism of its critics. Because as with all boondoggles that destroy neighborhoods in the name of compassion, FAC0 knows better than to foul their own nests. FAC1 expensive maltreatment of [ORGANIZATION] Beach in particular, and taxpayers in general, is an example of how bridge housing projects are co-opted and corrupted. But even more horrendous waste is exemplified by the efforts to construct permanent supportive housing. According to an [ORGANIZATION] report from [ORGANIZATION], when voters passed [PERSON], they were told that new permanent supportive housing would cost about 140,000 a unit. But average per unit costs are now more than triple that. The ORG1 project in [LOCATION] has an estimated per-unit cost of 440,000.A privately funded development company, ORG2, has debuted in GPE7 with the mission of rapidly providing housing for the homeless. Using retrofitted shipping containers, the companys modular approach to apartment building construction is purported to streamline the approval process and cut costs. But the two projects theyve got underway are too expensive to ever offer a solution to more than fraction of the homeless. Their [ORGANIZATION] will cost 4.5 million to house 32 clients in 16 two-bedroom, 480 square foot apartments."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,26,True,True,18,12,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"These costs are utterly unsustainable. But [ORGANIZATION] has grown into a juggernaut, crushing the opposition. At community hearings across [ORGANIZATION], homeless advocates, who are often bused in from other areas expressly to shout down local opposition, demand action, because no one deserves to live on a sidewalk. Money is squandered, and the population of homeless people multiplies. [PERSON] has the fourth highest number of homeless of any city in the [PERSON], over 8,500. According to [ORGANIZATION], operator of a privately funded [INSTITUTION] in [ORGANIZATION], there are two ways to treat the homeless, the transformational model and the containment model. The transformation model works to identify homeless individuals who are able to transition back to self-sufficiency and gives them the training and services to accomplish that. The containment model emphasizes getting shelter for the homeless before offering additional services. [PERSON] is critical of a relatively recent federal law, the [ORGANIZATION] Hearth Act, that bureaucratized the process of getting public money to combat homelessness at the same time as it made it harder to secure funding for transformational programs. Since [ORGANIZATION], all organizations set up to help the homeless have to submit applications through regional quasi-government organizations called continuums of care. The applications have to be evidence based and reliant on data such as the ORG2 point in time counts. All grant requests as well have to include homelessness management information systems that facilitate coordinated entry of the homeless into supportive care. The new guidelines, enforced by ORG2, also incorporated low barrier entry requirements in order to reach the most vulnerable. This meant applicants could not prohibit drug use, they cant require work, and they cannot require program compliance. Applicants for state and local grants have to adhere to these same ORG2 guidelines. [PERSON]s organization, [PERSON], requires no drug use, work, they have roommate restrictions, partying restrictions, and they do drug testing. This means that they cant accept federal funds and they also arent eligible for state funds because of the housing first rule, meaning that housing has to be provided before providing any other solutions to homelessness. The implications of the Hearth Act on how the homeless are treated go well beyond determining who gets funds. It has created an incentive for homeless organizations to prioritize helping drug addicts, because one of the ways to attract benefits to help the homeless is by getting [ORGANIZATION] income. The so-called housing navigators who help qualify people for SSDI know it is easier to secure this benefit if the person is afflicted with drug addiction. According to [PERSON], there are three types of homeless. The cannots who are mentally ill or disabled these comprise about 15 percent of the homeless. Then there are the have nots who could succeed if they were trained to acquire new skills and had access to services. The have-nots are often not counted they live doubled up in homes, with friends, in cars, many of them are single mothers who want to avoid living on the [STREET]. These have-nots are about 42 percent of the homeless. The third group are the will nots who do not want to change."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,18,True,True,18,13,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"The will-nots become very sophisticated at getting things for nothing - the government doesnt make a distinction between the unwilling and the unable - as a result the unwilling will always have the ability to crowd out the unable. The result of laws aimed at helping the homeless, the Federal Hearth Act, or at criminal justice reform, [PERSON]. [DATE] and AB 953, are that the will-nots generally receive the bulk of the services aimed at helping the homeless, despite the fact that their treatment is invariably more expensive, and the likelihood they will ever change is much lower. Left behind are the cannots and the have-nots. Also left behind, at least when it comes to funding, are organizations that work on permanent transformation, instead of mere containment. To state the obvious, all of this must change. Here are some ways to make that happenSolutions to [ORGANIZATION] Up the Trash With [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and other cities already facing the imminent threat of a breakout disease epidemic, this measure comes before all others. It ought to be easy, [ORGANIZATION] cities in [ORGANIZATION] were not inundated with tons of uncollected trash on the streets. In the case of [ORGANIZATION], if their recently launched [ORGANIZATION] program is truly the corruption riddled, ineffective, price gouging, trash neglecting disaster it appears to be, then cancel the program and go back to what worked in the past. The failure of large urban cities to even pick up their trash points to larger shifts in culture and governance that have to be addressed. Some cities, notably [PERSON], still manage to fulfill most of these basic obligations of local government. To the extent that piled up trash remains a problem after waste management contracts are restructured and the system of garbage collection works again, these larger structural issues have to be addressed - starting with the homeless encampments. Time could be running out. If rodent populations arent brought under control - perhaps also by temporarily permitting application of otherwise problematic rodenticides in infested urban settings - large numbers of innocent people may become afflicted with deadly diseases. If this does happen, it will be something that was totally avoidable. Look for an avalanche of lawsuits and possible criminal prosecutions against negligent local politicians. Lower the Cost of New Housing This is a monster topic, but cannot be excluded from any discussion of the homeless crisis. In some respects it is an excuse, since with other policy revisions it would be possible to shelter the homeless without having to engage in ridiculously expensive housing solutions. But the cost of housing, especially in blue states that are dominated by extreme environmentalists and labor unions in that order, is artificially high as the result of policies that must change if costs are to come down."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,7,True,True,18,14,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"This is perhaps the true motivation for smart growth. Reversing these policies will not solve the homeless crisis, but it will make it less likely for the hard working have nots roughly 40 percent of the homeless population to lose their homes and rentals, and it will make it easier for them to afford housing once they get back on their feet. [ORGANIZATION] According to [ORGANIZATION], African Americans make up 13 percent of the general population, but more than 40 percent of the homeless population. Similarly, American IndiansAlaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and people who identify as two or more races make up a disproportionate share of the homeless population. Clearly, minority communities are disproportionately represented among the homeless. While these statistics are probably accurate, they are used to reinforce the liberal catechism that finds all disparities by race to be the result of white racism."
sanfrancisco,2019-07-17T00:00:00Z,ContentEngine Think Tank Newswire English,KQED,"homeless, homelessness",369,10,True,True,18,15,[ORGANIZATION] 's [ORGANIZATION],"As shown, 57 percent of Black children in [ORGANIZATION] were being raised by single mothers, compared to only 18 percent of white children. Note the remarkable degree of correlation between the proportions of homeless by race, and the proportions of single parent households by race. Its easy, and plays well to the crowd, to attribute minority homelessness to racism. But a growing body of evidence suggests that intact families are the prevailing indicator of individual success in life. Until that evidence is confronted by the communities affected by it, other suggested causes for minorities being disproportionately represented among the homeless lack authenticity, and smack of opportunism. Untie Hands of Law Enforcement The theory of [PERSON], or order maintenance policing argues that tolerating too much local disorder created a climate in which criminal behavior, including serious crimes, would become more likely, since criminals would sense that public norms and vigilance were weak. [PERSON] policing, whereby police crack down on low level crimes, was begun in [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and is often credited with greatly reducing crime rates. At the other extreme is the near lawlessness that prevails on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and other cities experiencing a homeless crisis. In GPE4, as described, well-intentioned citizen approved ballot measures and ill-conceived legislation have tied the hands of law enforcement."

It is important to stress that of while a little over 40 percent of the homeless are so-called have nots, these people almost all find shelter, often with friends or family. The remainder, the cannots and the will nots, are the ones found living on the streets."

Approximately 15 percent of the homeless are mentally ill arguably, the alcoholics and drug addicts are also suffering from a form of mental illness. Together these cohorts constitute well over half of all homeless, and nearly all of the unsheltered homeless seen on the streets. Families, caseworkers, and mental health professionals need to be given the legal tools to help these people. Overturn [ORGANIZATION] vs [ORGANIZATION] and similar [STREET] rulings Starting over [ORGANIZATION] with the [PERSON] decision in the case [ORGANIZATION] vs the City of [ORGANIZATION], homeless cannot be prohibited from sleeping on the [STREET] unless permanent supportive housing is available. Similar rulings have been issued in [PERSON] and GPE2. The impact of these rulings, combined with the other constraints on law enforcement, make it nearly impossible to clear the streets of homeless encampments. The problem has been exacerbated by subsequent lawsuits to enforce the [ORGANIZATION] decision which have defined permanent supportive housing in ways that make it more expensive. The practical impact of the [ORGANIZATION] case has been to make it financially infeasible to ever deliver adequate housing alternatives to the homeless. A major city with the financial wherewithal to pay for a sustained legal battle needs to challenge the [ORGANIZATION] decision all the [STREET] to ORG1, with the objective being a ruling that will permit less elaborate, more cost-effective housing and shelter solutions to be allowable. Set Limits on Costs In [ORGANIZATION] DATE2, a temporary shelter designed to last [ORGANIZATION] is being constructed at a cost of over 50,000 per bed, and permanent supportive housing units are being constructed for, on average, over 400,000 each. [ORGANIZATION] is also planning to deploy mobile toilets for the homeless to use, with the expected cost per unit of 339,000 per year. In [PERSON], the cost for existing programs to help the homeless is approximately 100,000 per homeless person per year. Given the number of unsheltered homeless in [PERSON], this spending is totally ineffective. These costs are absurd. Designing solutions that cost less, but offer shelter to 100 percent of the homeless, is vastly preferable to solutions that cost so much that only a fraction of the homeless get assistance. Creative solutions exist that cost far less. Off the shelf tents, sheds, prefab tiny homes, and prefab homes made from shipping containers are all less costly options. Relocating the homeless to repurposed industrial or retail sites that are already built out and not on premium real estate would cut costs. Putting shelters in the middle of some of the most expensive real estate on earth not only squanders finite available funds, but when the unused property is government owned, the chance is lost to sell that property and invest the proceeds in less expensive locations."
