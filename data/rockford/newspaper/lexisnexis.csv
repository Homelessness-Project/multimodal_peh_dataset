We're surprised bicycles were exempt. Of course, we don't want to give lawmakers any ideas.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The reason for most of the new taxes, fees and fines is to help fund a sorely needed, multiyear $45-million capital infrastructure plan. Some of the increases are more bone-jarring than the average pothole.</p><p>Here are a few of the new taxes we thought would be of special interest to you.</p><p>Vehicle registration: Registration fees for passenger vehicles will increase to $151 from $101, while electric vehicle registration fees will increase to $251 annually from $34 every other year. These are hefty increases and we wonder whether the electric vehicle fee, in particular, will discourage some Illinoisans from being more environmentally friendly. Their vehicles are on wheels, of course, so they might want pack them up and move to a different state to do their driving.</p><p>Trailer fees: The licensing fee for a trailer weighing less than 3,000 pounds will increase to $118 from $18, with every weight class above that also seeing a $100 increase. This looks like a mistake that needs to be corrected. A $100 increase to pull your boat is outrageous, especially because fees for the vehicles that pull those boats also increased by quite a bit.</p><p>Trade-in tax: The state currently does not collect sales tax on a car's trade-in value. That changes Jan. 1 when the state will begin taxing any trade-in value more than $10,000. State Rep. Andrew Chesney, R-Freeport, was a co-sponsor on a bill that would have stopped that extra taxing. The measure was sent to the rules committee where legislation often goes to die.</p><p>This increase, which is expected to raise $60 million, will go toward ""vertical infrastructure"" such as new state buildings and renovations.</p><p>If you're in the market for a new vehicle, you'll be better off buying it before the year ends so you can save yourself a few hundred dollars.</p><p>Stop for the bus: The stop sign that school bus drivers extend when they're making their rounds is not a suggestion. Stop means stop. However, far too often motorists ignore the bus stop sign and put the lives of children at risk.</p><p>Maybe those motorists will think twice now that the fines have doubled. The fine for passing a school bus with its stop sign extended goes to $300 from $150 for a first offense. Fines for second and later offenses also are doubling, to $1,000 from $500. This is an increase we agree with 100%.</p><p>Slow down, move over: Drivers who do not slow down or move over for parked emergency response vehicles will be hit in the pocketbook a lot harder and could face jail time.</p><p>The Move Over Law, or ""Scott's Law,"" which is named for Chicago Fire Lt. Scott Gillen, who was killed in 2000, was meant to protect people and save lives. The law took effect in 2002.</p><p>However, too many people have been injured and lost their lives. This year, in particular, has been deadly.</p><p>There have been 27 Illinois State Police troopers who have been hit this year while attending to traffic incidents - and three have died, including Trooper Brooke Jones-Story, 34, who was killed March 28 after she was struck by a semitrailer while inspecting a vehicle on the side of the road near Freeport.</p><p>Jones-Story's death was the impetus for tougher penalties. State Rep. John M. Cabello, R-Machesney Park, was chief co-sponsor of the legislation, which Gov. JB Pritzker signed in Rockford.</p><p>The fine for a first violation of the law is going up to $250 from $100. Subsequent violations now carry a minimum fine of $750. Violators also will be charged an additional $250 fee to fund education and enforcement of the law. A violation becomes a Class 2 felony if it leads to the injury or death of a first responder.</p><p>We hope the increase penalties make a difference for trooper safety. We don't want to see a repeat of 2019.</p><p>___</p><p>Dec. 29, 2019</p><p>The News-Gazette (Champaign)</p><p>Is Pritzker's wealth a problem</p><p>Great fortunes provide great flexibility, as Gov. J.B. Pritzker has demonstrated.</p><p>Illinois has so many problems that it seems rather silly for the people who are paid to think high-minded thoughts to search for more.</p><p>But since they have done so, it's worth discussing.</p><p>Reform for Illinois, a good-government group in a state steeped in corruption, has suggested that it's a bad thing for the state that Gov. J.B. Pritzker has used a teeny-tiny part of his mind-blowing personal fortune to personally finance the renovation of state buildings and supplement the salaries of a handful of close aides.</p><p>""We continue to have the same general concerns we've expressed in the past about elected officials paying for public functions with private funds, especially at the scale this governor is able to do it. It provides yet another advantage to wealthy officials and candidates, and depending on the use, can create conflicted loyalties and perhaps even increase the potential for corruption,"" Alisa Kaplan, policy director for Reform for Illinois, told The Chicago Tribune.</p><p>Kent Redfield, professor emeritus at the University of Illinois-Springfield and another veteran watcher of state politics, expresses similar concerns.</p><p>""It's my responsibility as a citizen to contribute to the funding of the political system, and there's no free lunch. We can't offshore the cost of government to a bunch of rich elected officials,"" said Redfield.</p><p>Slow down there. It's important to keep this issue in perspective. Illinois has a roughly $40 billion budget, and Pritzker has spent roughly $3 million of his personal fortune on state affairs. No one is offshoring ""the cost of government"" to Pritzker or anyone else.</p><p>Hyperbole aside, what seems to concern the Nervous Nellies is that Pritzker is spending his personal money to achieve objectives that are important to him - supplementing the salaries of aides he thinks he needs and paying for renovations of his Springfield office.</p><p>He, like predecessor Bruce Rauner, is also working for nothing. Both Rauner, a multi-millionaire, and Pritzker, a billionaire, declined a paycheck. Should that, too, be a source of concern? Not from our perspective.</p><p>This is a unique situation - individuals who have the kind of wealth Pritzker acquired through inheritance are few and far between, even though they stand out like drunks at a funeral.</p><p>Former Arkansas Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller, a scion of the Rockefeller family oil fortune, was among the first to use personal funds to make state government work better and smarter. But that was in the 1960s. How many others have there been since then?</p><p>Pritzker is using a small part of his fortune to do the same in Illinois, which is effectively bankrupt.</p><p>Is that a problem? Perhaps it could be if Pritzker - or someone like him - had some malicious intent. That doesn't appear to be the case. He's been above-board about his spending of personal money and no doubt will continue to be.</p><p>The reformers' real gripe stems from this incontrovertible fact - the rich are different, and it skews their perspective.</p><p>Former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, during his confirmation hearings, once said that spending $100,000 to him was like spending $10 to Joe Sixpack. That's a stupefying statement, but from Rockefeller's point of view, it makes perfect sense.</p><p>So, too, it is with Pritzker, whose personal fortune has been estimated to be about $3.4 billion.</p><p>Of greater concern than Pritzker's use of personal funds to pay for state-related spending is the use of his fortune to win elections. He spent about $170 million on his gubernatorial election campaign. He recently deposited another $5 million into an account to spend on passing his proposal for a progressive income-tax amendment to the Illinois Constitution.</p><p>Spending that kind of money can blow away the opposition. But it's not illegal. So it will continue.</p><p>It's the same with Pritzer's personal spending on state projects. That's not illegal either, and the public certainly doesn't seem to mind. Given Illinois' many other serious problems, why should it?</p><p>___</p><p>Dec. 20, 2019</p><p>The State Journal-Register (Springfield)</p><p>Thumbs up to initiative to improve coordinated service for the homeless</p><p>Thumbs up to the leadership of the city of Springfield, the Community Foundation for the Land of Lincoln and the Heartland Continuum of Care for their initiative to secure improved service coordination for the homeless. The group announced plans to hire a coordinator by early February of 2020. Though this action does not eliminate homelessness, this one step - creating a centralized point of contact - has the potential for much improved outcomes.</p><p>Since the 1980s, the Federal agency for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has required areas to establish local continuums of care, that is, agencies providing services to homeless should collaborate to assure coordination of services. Locally, representatives of some 20 agencies come together through board and task force meetings to improve coordination, all the while, working full time at their respective agencies. Heartland Continuum of Care, then, serves as the primary HUD designated body designated to develop, coordinate and implement long-range plans meeting the needs of homeless persons. These leaders began to imagine the value of a full-time, paid coordinator who will improve the communication between and among these member agencies, who finds and applies for grants to further their collective work, and who will identify overlaps and gaps in these services to strengthen the safety net.</p><p>Like waves on a beach and over many years, homelessness has come to our attention and then receded. Events of the last summer and fall, though, have prompted a deeper commitment to addressing this challenge in a permanent, thoughtful, and systemic fashion. Listening to what service providers said they needed, staff of the Community Foundation of the Land of Lincoln identified this initiative and secured the generous support of the Foundation's Jane and Paul Ford Family Fun's and the Sommer Family Fund. John Stremsterfer, Community Foundation president and CEO, sees the person in this position making ""sustainable system-level improvements"" by better coordinating our system of care and bringing additional resources. Mayor Jim Langfelder noted that the city ""is proud to enhance this partnership in order to provide greater efficiencies to all our efforts to end homelessness in our community.""</p><p>We applaud this important first step to assure the long-term resolution of homelessness.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTE-d627ee48c695eeb2b09232aa391490cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5XW1-X3R1-DYN6-W1N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""1804""/><timeReceived>8:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

We are reminded again that changing hearts and minds, so often the work of pop culture, matters as much or more than changing laws.</p><p>""Rainbow family""</p><p>Sanna Marin, who was elected the prime minister of Finland earlier this month, was raised in a working class family by her mother and her mother's female partner. She credits her ""rainbow family"" for her confidence as a woman, her achievements and her values.</p><p>""For me, people have always been equal,"" she told The Guardian. ""It's not a matter of opinion. That's the foundation of everything.""</p><p>But though Marin is young - just 34 - she grew up in less accepting times and has experienced that slow bend toward justice. As a school child, she never talked about her family, aware of the stigma attached to LGBTQ people. Only ""now in the 21st century,"" she told the Guardian, are families like hers discussed in Finland ""quite openly.""</p><p>Hallmark buckles to pressure</p><p>In a similar way in the United States, full equality for LGBTQ people remains a distant shore, but gains have been made and there's no going back - as Hallmark has learned the hard way.</p><p>On Friday, the Hallmark Channel made a decision to pull advertising for the wedding site Zola that featured same-sex couples. Hallmark did not pull Zola's ads featuring different-sex couple.</p><p>Hallmark's decision followed pressure from One Million Moms, a part of the conservative American Family Association, that complained about the ads to Bill Abbott, the CEO of Hallmark's parent company Crown Media Family Networks.</p><p>One Million Moms claimed on its website that Abbott said the ads ""aired in error.""</p><p>Where's the error? We can't find it.</p><p>Are LGBTQ people an error? Is same-sex marriage - the law of the land - an error?</p><p>Hallmark gets schooled</p><p>Crown got an earful all weekend from advocacy and civil liberty groups and ordinary outraged Americans. In a tweet, the talk show host Ellen Degeneres asked Hallmark and Abbot, ""What are you thinking? Please explain. We're all ears.""</p><p>On Sunday, Crown and Hallmark backed down and reinstated the ads.</p><p>""The Crown Media team has been agonizing over this decision as we've seen the hurt it has unintentionally caused,"" Hallmark CEO Mike Perry said in a statement. ""Said simply, they believe this was the wrong decision.""</p><p>We're not privy to the inner sanctums of decision-making at Hallmark, but we'd bet two things turned the bosses around.</p><p>First, it's all about money. Hallmark figured out the company would lose more viewers and customers by killing the ads than by running them.</p><p>Second, you can bet that hundreds of employees let it be known they had a problem with working for a company that would so easily buckle under. Corporate recruiters have learned that values matter when recruiting the best and brightest young employees.</p><p>Hallmark might have thought that One Million Moms speaks for mainstream America, but the group does not. It doesn't speak for even 1 million moms. It has only 96,000 followers on Facebook.</p><p>Meanwhile, 63% of Americans, according to a Gallup Poll, support the legalization of same-sex marriage.</p><p>Diversity is just life</p><p>Which is where ""Sesame Street,"" and the power of popular culture in general, come into this.</p><p>Several generations of American children have grown up absorbing the show's message of kindness and acceptance. They have met a Muppet named Lily who was homeless, a Muppet named Ari who was blind, and a Muppet named Julia who had autism. They have met Muppets and human beings of all colors and abilities - and disabilities.</p><p>Diversity on ""Sesame Street"" is just how life works.</p><p>""Sesame Street"" has never included an overtly gay character, whether human or Muppet, unless you think of Bert and Ernie that way. But we like to believe - we would hope - that its message of inclusion and kindness has washed over 50 years of children in a more general way, helping to make them more compassionate adults.</p><p>It's not just ""Sesame Street."" It's also ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."" And, when the kids got a bit older, pioneering shows like ""Will &amp; Grace"" that made gay people just folks. And pioneering people like DeGeneres.</p><p>We could go on and on, but the point is made: Pop culture at its best is changing hearts and minds.</p><p>Hallmark's initial mistake was to see One Million Moms as the ""real"" America and those who champion equal rights for LGBQT people - and people up against it in every way - as the elitist fringe. They got it backward.</p><p>We are a better nation than we give ourselves credit, regardless of groups like One Million Moms and the moral ugliness of President Donald Trump.</p><p>It will be our salvation, we can only hope, in next year's presidential election.</p><p>___</p><p>Dec. 10, 2019</p><p>Rockford Register-Star</p><p>Community leaders need to keep doors open for refugees</p><p>It is morally and economically right to accept refugees into our communities.</p><p>We should welcome people who have nowhere else to go. They have fled wars and persecution and are grateful to still be alive. All they have is hope - and the clothes on their backs.</p><p>President Ronald Reagan used to refer to America as a ""shining city,"" and in his farewell address to the nation after eight years in office he went on to say: ""And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.""</p><p>We commend Winnebago County Board Chairman Frank Haney and Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara for reaffirming their local commitment to keeping doors open to refugees with the ""will and the heart to get here.""</p><p>The affirmation was necessary because of President Donald Trump's executive order declaring refugees will be resettled only with the consent of state and local governments.</p><p>Local governments have the option of saying no, an option that - so far - none has exercised. Local governments across Illinois must send letters to the federal government affirming their consent by Dec. 25. The Christmas countdown means a bit more to refugees this year.</p><p>Refugee resettlement tends to be an emotionally charged discussion as opponents fear a drain on resources and a change in the fabric of the community.</p><p>But as a practical matter, the number of refugees who have entered - and are expected to enter - the Unites States is small.</p><p>Nationwide, about 190 communities resettle refugees. California, Texas, Ohio and Washington took in the most during fiscal year 2017, with between 2,000 and 5,100 each, according to State Department data.</p><p>Refugee admissions have been capped at 18,000 for 2020, down from 30,000 this year. That's not enough to sell out an NBA arena and hardly addresses the worldwide need.</p><p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 25.9 million refugees have been forced from their home countries because of religious persecution, wars in Syria and Afghanistan and economic deprivation in Africa.</p><p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Evangelical Immigration Table and the U.S. commission on International Religious Freedom oppose the reduction in refugee resettlement numbers.</p><p>In Illinois, more than 123,644 refugees from more than 60 countries have been resettled since 1975. More people than that go to Wrigley Field on a summer weekend.</p><p>Most refugees use help from social service agencies to become self-sufficient.More than 90% of employment-eligible refugees are employed within 120 days of arrival. They pay taxes and are engaged in our communities.</p><p>They are needed, especially in a state that is losing population.</p><p>Refugees are mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers whose lives have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own because of conditions in their native countries. We encourage all cities and counties in Illinois to reaffirm their local commitment to keep their doors open to refugees.</p><p>___</p><p>Dec. 19, 1919</p><p>The News-Gazette (Champaign)</p><p>Chicago casino plan still stalled</p><p>If Illinois is to allow widespread gambling, why isn't there a casino located where it would do the most good?</p><p>Just in terms of the revenue potential alone, it makes perfect sense for the State of Illinois to locate a casino in Chicago.</p><p>Located in the midst of one of the world's great cities, a site that draws tourists from all over the United States and beyond, a Chicago casino would generate many millions of dollars in new revenue for the city and the state.</p><p>So, nearly 30 years after casinos were allowed in Illinois, why isn't there a casino in Chicago?</p><p>One obvious reason is that all the other casino owners here, particularly those relatively near Chicago, don't want the brutal competition a casino in the city would represent.</p><p>That, of course, raises question about the massive gambling expansion bill passed this past summer by the General Assembly and signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.</p><p>The legislation, in addition to allowing sports gambling and permitting the state's two race tracks to offer casino-style gambling, also authorized six new casinos, including one for Chicago.</p><p>At least it authorized one for Chicago on paper. Reality has proved to be a different story.</p><p>Legislators added so many expensive conditions to obtaining a casino license that the total cost became prohibitive for prospective operators.</p><p>There's a $250,000 up-front application fee, a $15 million ""reconciliation"" fee and up to $120 million in gambling position fees. In addition, the state wants to impose a 33.3 percent ""privilege"" tax on top of the existing tax rates other casinos pay.</p><p>A Las Vegas consulting firm retained by the Illinois Gaming Board to study the situation contended that ""the reconciliation fees alone would wipe out any profits generated for many years.""</p><p>In other words, the conditions amounted to killing the goose that laid the golden egg.</p><p>Those conditions raise questions about the legislative process that produced these onerous conditions.</p><p>Were legislators oblivious when they signed off on requirements that would blow up the permit process before it got started? Or were opponents playing a more stealthy game - appearing to permit a casino while really working to block or delay one?</p><p>In Illinois, one never knows.</p><p>But Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot made it clear the rules need to be revised by legislators. So she made an appearance in Springfield during the recent three-day veto session to get that done.</p><p>What happened? Nothing.</p><p>Lightfoot noted the arrest of state Rep. Luis Arroyo on bribery charges proved to be a major distraction. But she also complained that her request for changes in the gambling bill as it affects Chicago prompted other interests to seek their own changes.</p><p>""They saw this piece of legislation, particularly around casinos, as their one opportunity to get something that they felt they were promised,"" she said. ""People came out of the woodwork with their 'letters to Santa.'""</p><p>Whether there really were too many mouths to feed or that was the appearance given to justify doing nothing, Chicago again was denied the opportunity to get its casino project off the ground.</p><p>Whether their tactics are deny, deny, deny or delay, delay, delay, those in the gambling business benefit from each day that Chicago offers no competition.</p><p>Legalized gambling has proved to be a mixed blessing for Illinois.</p><p>It was originally billed as a tourist draw that would help beleaguered communities hosting casinos to generate more revenue. Instead, the facts showed that those living near the casinos, not visitors to the area, patronized these venues.</p><p>In that respect, it did not generate significant economic development. Instead, it redirected local dollars that would have been spent on the local economy to the casinos.</p><p>Nonetheless, our legislators keep going back to the gambling well, hoping in the face of the facts that the revenues generated will bail the state out of its financial woes. That hasn't happened, and it won't happen.</p><p>If new revenue really is the goal, Chicago is the logical place for a casino. That it hasn't happened yet is a source of wonder and suspicion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier
