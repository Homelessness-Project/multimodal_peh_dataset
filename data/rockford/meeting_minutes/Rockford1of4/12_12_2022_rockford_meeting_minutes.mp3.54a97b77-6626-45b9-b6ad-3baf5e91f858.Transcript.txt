It is an award of RFP for Home Investment Partnership Program American Rescue Plan allocation consulting services through Frank Newton of Marietta, Georgia, in the amount of $31,500. The contract creation is through March 31, 2023. The funding source is the HUD Home ARP administration allocation. Thank you. We have one item before us. Is there any discussion on that one item? Alderwoman McNeely. Thank you. For three months, I think it's three months, this individual or company will be paid $31,500 for consulting. Does he have special expertise in some particular area? Director Frantz? Thank you, Alderwoman. So yes, that is what the contract is amount. We did receive four bids. This was the lowest bid. I believe the high bid was in the $84,000, $85,000 range. But one of the reasons we did select this was they have successfully had a home ARP plan accepted by HUD, so has demonstrated experience for this particular grant. Thank you. Any other discussion?
