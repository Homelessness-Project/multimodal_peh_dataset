Okay, we have a quorum. Alderman Shirely. Item number three, motions or resolutions. Under A1, the committee recommends approval of special event permit for Five Forks Wine & Wine 10th Anniversary Party scheduled for Sunday, October 18, 2015. I place this up for passage. We have an item up for passage. Is there discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed?
 I'll now entertain a motion to adjourn. Thank you. Certainly, all going to be charred. Thank you. We have a joint caucus planned for this Thursday, I-15 at the Perry Street Brewhouse. Thank you, sir. All in favor? Thank you. I just wanted to make sure the public knows that tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock p.m. at Clem Arboretum, we will have a meeting on
 regarding facts and figures regarding level one trauma centers. This is in regard to the Mercy Rockford proposal to change some of the services at Rockford Memorial. We have a trauma specialist coming from Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, not to give a biased view, but to give us factual information about what level one trauma centers do and don't do. So I hope everyone can attend. Again, 6 o'clock p.m. at beautiful Clare Margarita.
 Anyone else? Having lost our quorum, we're no longer in session.
