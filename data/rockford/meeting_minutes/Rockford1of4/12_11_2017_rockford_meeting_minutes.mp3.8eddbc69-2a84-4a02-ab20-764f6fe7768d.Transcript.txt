 Thank you. Before I call on Alderman Durkee for some even better news for this evening, I will just make mention that I was asked about snow operations. We did receive a little bit of snow today. And so our snow operations were out there for arterial and collector streets from about 3 o'clock to about 8 o'clock.
 When I originally asked, it was only 630, so I thought we would be done by then. So they will be going out, if on an ask-me-it basis, for some residential, but probably not, because we just got a small amount of snow. Alderman Durkee, do you have additional good news for us? Do you have a request of this body?
 You'd have to talk to someone else about our laundering scheme to get that money. All right. We'll be moving forward on discussion of adding litigation. Sounds so confident when you say that.
