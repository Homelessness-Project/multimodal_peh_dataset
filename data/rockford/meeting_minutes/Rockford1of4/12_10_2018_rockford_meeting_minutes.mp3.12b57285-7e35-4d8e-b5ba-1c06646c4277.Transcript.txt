to serve a three-year term on the Community Action Advisory Board. Ms. Snyder is filling a vacancy in the private sector position. Is there any discussion over the one item before us under appointments laid over? Alderman Hervey? Just...
 Questioning, is this the Laura Snyder that just was appointed exec director of RHA? Yeah, I believe she's filling the void on that board that the previous RHA director had served. I just didn't know that they were considered a private sector. They're basically, to me, government. That's their funding. They're considered a municipality. They have independent powers. I didn't consider them private sector. Director Myers? Yes.
 I had raised that concern also to Director Davis. He'd forwarded me some language under the act that he believes covers that, and I think his position is that it's a broad definition of what is considered private for purposes of this appointment. So he's satisfied that she would qualify. So much for public housing. Yes, sir. Any other further discussion? Seeing none, clerk, will you please call the roll? Aye.
 Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Excellent. The item passes. Next up, I don't, and I apologize, I was in and out earlier today. So I don't know if you've already done officers' reports. So I don't want to be redundant. Is there any pressing officers' reports? None? All right. Next up, we have motions and resolutions, finance and personnel. Alderman Beck? Just lost my, I'm losing them everywhere. There we go.
 Thank you. All right. We have one item under finance and personnel. It's the award of bid for demolition of 804 2nd Avenue to Northern Illinois Service Company in the amount of $79,982. Funding source is General Fund Emergency Demolition. Place it up for passage. Excellent. We have one item before you. Is there any discussion on the one item before you? Seeing none, clerk, will you please call the roll? So moved. Ayes. Toomer? Ayes. Frost? Ayes.
 Herbie? Hoffman? Beach? Quinones? Beck? Aye. Chiarelli? Aye. Nainais? Excellent. Item passes. Is there a motion to adjourn? We have a motion and a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed, same sign. Have a wonderful night.
