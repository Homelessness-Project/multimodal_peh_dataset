 Thank you Alderman. So we have nine items before us. Appreciate that. Is there any discussion on those nine items? Alderman McNeely. Thank you Mr. Mayor. On item number three, is this a new grant? Structure parking? No. Alderman McNeely, all of these grants are continuing grants for the continuum of care. So they all go to the sub-recipients that we work with in the community for various subsections of the homeless population.
 And with this particular grant, as I questioned the other grants, is there more than one organization that would be a recipient of these funds? No. Each one of the individual grants goes to that recipient only. I'm sorry? Each one of these individual grants goes to that particular recipient only. So this one is Rapid Youth Rehousing? The Rapid Youth Rehousing, yeah. That's the name of the organization? Yes. Okay, thank you.

 Rose. Aye. Beach. Aye. Quinones. Aye. Meeks. Aye. McNeely. Aye. Bonney. Aye. 14 ayes. Excellent. Thank you. So we'll go back to officers' reports. Just again, really great seeing the whole committees this evening and all the discussion with new aldermen and returning aldermen. Really just appreciate it. And are there any aldermen who have officers' reports? Alderman Rose.
 Real quick, I just wanted to say thank you to city staff, especially Tim Hinkins, for his work on a new art install that's going in off of Huffman Boulevard in coordination with RACVB, John Groh and his staff. I had it written down here, but...
 I just wanted to say thank you also to the president of NASA for their work on. On that project, so 1 other quick item I also wanted to give a shout out to Robert Jones. He is a former president of the United States.
 an East alumni who was recently drafted to the Miami Dolphins. He did a lot of work at East, working out and getting into Middle Tennessee University. And so Rockford, Illinois has yet another pro football player and just wanted to say go E-Rabs with Robert Jones. That's awesome. I think probably the biggest question is how â€“
 How would you be able to fit his bobblehead on your desk if he does well? I think that's a great problem, and I'm looking forward to figuring it out. Maybe a second shelf? I don't know. Maybe. Any other officers' reports?
 The only thing I would say is I had the opportunity to be with Alderman Hoffman today as our Rockford Housing Authority was one of only 10 in the country who were a recipient for this round's federal job plus program of $2.3 million. So just really wonderful work in bringing those dollars and can help impact the lives of many people who call Rockford Housing Authority home now.
 Congratulations to the director and the board and all the residents. With that, is there a motion to adjourn? Second. We got a motion, we got a second. Any discussion? None. Clerk, could you please call the roll? Gerke, Logerman, Toonberg, Frost, Tarina, Prenti, Wilkins, Hoffman, Rose, Beach, Quinones, Meeks, McNeely, Abani. 13 ayes.
 Have a wonderful night.
