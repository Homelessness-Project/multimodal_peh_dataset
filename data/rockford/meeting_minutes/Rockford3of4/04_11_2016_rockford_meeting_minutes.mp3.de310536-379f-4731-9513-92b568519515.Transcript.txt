Open session, but I would ask for a motion to go into closed session to discuss pending litigation of the Kingdom Authority International Ministries et al. v. the City of Rockford. Case? It's been moved and seconded. Is there any discussion? All of them against us? I heard, but you don't have ten people. We can do a simple majority? Okay. Thank you. Any further discussion? Hearing none, clerk, please call the roll again. This is the motion to go into closed session for the discussion on the Kingdom Authority case. Clerk, please call the roll. Pardon me?
 We need a roll call on the motion. Alderman Frost. Please. Alderman Hervey, would you like to be on the record for this? This is the vote to go into closed session to discuss the Kingdom Authority case. I'll take the fifth. Yes, I will. We'll mark that as an aye. Thank you. Thank you. The motion carries. We will go into closed session, recessing, for the purposes of discussing the Kingdom Authority case. Thank you.
