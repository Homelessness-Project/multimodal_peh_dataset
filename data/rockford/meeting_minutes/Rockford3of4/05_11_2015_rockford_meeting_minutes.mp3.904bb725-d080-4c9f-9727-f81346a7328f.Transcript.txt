Thank you very much for the beautiful quorum. There's a special meeting called One Item for Business. It's under Ropen World 2, Motions and Resolutions. Alderman Shirelli, do you want to read that in? Is that yours?
 This is for the special event permit for the PetSmart National Adoption event, Saturday, May 16th, 2015, Sunday, May 17th, 2015, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., 6320 East 8th Street. If you'll recall, this was brought to our attention to perform tonight, so we didn't have another one of these things where we didn't meet again. So is there a motion to approve? Second. Is there a motion and a second to approve? Item again is an enrollment.
 Roll call 2-1 for discussion. Hearing none, all those in favor? Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it. The matter is approved. There's been a motion to adjourn. It's been seconded. Any additional conversation, questions, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it. The meeting is adjourned. Thank you.
