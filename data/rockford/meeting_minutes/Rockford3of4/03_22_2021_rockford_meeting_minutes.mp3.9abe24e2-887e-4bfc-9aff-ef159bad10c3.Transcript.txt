 it's 12 further thank you clerk uh item number two new committee reports uh under uh block a planning and development committee alderman rose thank you your honor he recommends approval of the development agreement between the city of rockford and sci-fi networks rockford llc for the utilization of public way right away for the establishment of a city-wide fiber optic system believe the director shall prepare their appropriate ordinance
 Any questions on the floor? Alderman McNeely. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank all of the aldermen for allowing this to be held out. I did do some research and talk with various companies. I do think this will be great for the city overall, but certainly it's going to help to improve the
 the viability of the 5th, 7th, and 13th Ward, allowing businesses the opportunity to come in with such increase in the fiber network there and throughout the city. So I am impressed with the company and the way this is going to be done. So thank you. And I hope we all support it. Governor McMillan, any other questions online or on the floor?
 I don't have a question. Just a quick comment. I initially had quite a few objections. This is Alderman Hervey. I was really concerned about the number of fiber optics that we have in our right-of-way, what the status of those is, and
 I took a nice long look at it and spent a lot of time talking with Director Saunders and some other folks about this entire fiber optic push and what it potentially brings. And I agree with Alderman McNeely. I think it has the potential.
 because this one specifically is looking at bringing, number one, competition to the Internet service providers that can all vie to get their link to this fiber optic network. There will remain some provisions, one that is federal, that gives that â€“
 benefit to low-income families. They still have to pay something. I think everybody should have some skin in the game for these kinds of services, but it will certainly make it affordable, especially if there's a piggyback with cable or cable,
 streaming or whatever else the services have. So given that I am going to flip flop and support this, hoping that staff and city leadership will continue to take a hard look and monitor this. I know,
 Director Saunders' department will on the hardware side, if you will. But I hope our IT department and our management staff, Mr. Rory, and our other folks who are watching these long-term projects,
 to make sure that this organization holds up to its promises and keeps it affordable, not just for the city and our business partners and residents, business residents, but also for our residential users. So thank you. Thank you, Alderman Hervey. Any other questions, comments from the floor or online? No.
