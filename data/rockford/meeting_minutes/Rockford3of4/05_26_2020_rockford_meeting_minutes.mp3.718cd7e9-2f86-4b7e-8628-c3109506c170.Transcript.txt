 Thank you. So, Alderman, we're going to move past item Roman numeral number two and go right to motions and resolutions. This was on there in that order in an error. We typically have the new alderman as we did with Alderman Gasperini, have them sworn in at the end of a council meeting. So we'll just move forward with that.
 with motions and resolutions. And as I did last council meeting, not just last Monday, I'll do it on this and read these items. So the first is application for the Illinois Department of National Resources IDNR
 Password mitigation program is item number one. Item number two is application for the 2020 Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Rebuild Illinois Fast Track Public Infrastructure Program Grant for the replacement of water main wall on Montague Street. Item number three, application for the 2020 Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Rebuild Illinois Fast Track Public Infrastructure Program Grant for exterior facade improvements to the Coronado Performing Arts Center.
 Is there any questions or discussion on those items? Alderman Hervey, you're on mute. I'll unmute you, Alderman Hervey. I'm sorry, I didn't know I still had my hand up. Oh, no worries. I took it down, thank you. Okay, yep. Any other, I don't see any other questions. Clerk, could you be on the call? Tim Burtt. Aye. Frost. Frost. Aye. Hervey.
 Thompson-Culley? Aye. Hoffman? Aye. Rose? Aye. Beach? Aye. Keonis? Aye. McNeely? Aye. Sciarelli? Aye. And I believe Audubon-Durkey is not on, right? Audubon-Durkey and Gas Green are both on. They both are on. Okay. Audubon-Durkey? Aye. Keonis? Aye. Keonis? Aye. Keonis? Aye. Keonis?
 It's nice to be remembered. All right. Okay. Alderman Gasparini. That's 12 I's, Your Honor. Okay. Awesome. So next we'll go to the Oath of Office Administrator to Alderman Hanley. Mr. Meyer or Mr. Trommels, you want to take it away from here? Okay.
 Anyone? I feel like Dealer. Can you hear? Is this the bad one? Can you hear me, Tom, Mr. Mayor? So, Mr. Meyer, Mr. Trommels, anyone want to provide the oath of office to Ginger Hanley so she can be an alderman and we can move on with city council? Can you hear me? We're out.
 Having some problems with wireless mics, evidently. Yes. So if you'll be there with me, I'll just go downstairs and see what they're doing. Oh, I can swear, Ian. Yeah. Take it personally, Ginger. I'll be happy to swear, Ian. Check. Stand up, Anne. Where is Ginger? I can't see her. There's another room.
 Huh? She's in another room. Oh. She's in Chambers, isn't she? Yeah, she's in Chambers with Mr. Trommels. Oh, they're going to do the swearing in in Chambers. Okay. All right, then I'm going to cheat and answer my phone. I got a black box on my phone. I know you guys missed my face. I'll swear, Ian. You swear to do everything you want you to do.
 And tell your husband, too. That's right. I think, Ann, you just swear. Yes. Oh. I want to know what that thing is behind your head. What? Just like a big...
