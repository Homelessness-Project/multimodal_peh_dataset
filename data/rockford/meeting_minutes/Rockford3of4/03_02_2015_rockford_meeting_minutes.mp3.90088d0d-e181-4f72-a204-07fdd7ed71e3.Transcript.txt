Good evening. Welcome to the City Council meeting in the city of Rockford, Illinois. The date is March 2, 2015. Our invocation this evening will be from Fire Police Chaplain Sherman Nichols from Central Christian Church. Let's pray together. Father, thank you tonight for these men and women who have gathered to serve as your vessels, your tools, for a city full of people with a variety of needs. Father, we thank you that we can come to you.
 Jesus said that no sparrow falls apart from your knowledge of it. You surely take note of what will be done here tonight. So we invite you to guide these proceedings. I pray that there would be a healthy dose of truth and appreciation of our need for you. God, I pray that you would take each good intention, each human effort and multiply it and accomplish good here tonight.
 We pray for protection for those who are serving us tonight throughout the city. Lord, help them to arrive home safely after their shift. And Father, we pray that in all things, your name would be upheld. Your will will be accomplished. I ask in Jesus' name, amen. It's time for our Pledge of Allegiance. I want you to invite...
 of the Daisy Troop, number 1309, and Browning Troop 773. They're here to help lead us in the pledge. I invite those folks to, and ladies and gentlemen, to the floor. We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under no circumstances, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Yeah. Great job. Thank you. Great job.
 Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Excellent job. Excellent job. Thank you again, ladies. And we'll ask our clerk to please call the roll. Durkee. Here. McNamara. Here. Frost. Here. Hervey. Here. Hill. Here. Thompson-Kelley. Odo. Newberg. Here. Beach. Elliott. Chiarelli.
 There's been a motion and a second to accept the journal. Are there any amendments or changes to the journal? Hearing none, all those in favor of accepting the journal as presented, please signify by saying aye. Opposed, no. Nice to have you. Thank you. We have several speakers signed up for public participation this evening. I'd like to remind our speakers that they can use either of the microphones in the back of the chamber.
 Our speakers have three minutes to make their comments, and if they start going over, they should hear this beep from my phone, and I will ask them to wrap up. Our first speaker this evening is Reverend Darren Sheldon. 2nd Timothy chapter three, verse one to four. Just know also that in the last days perilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of their own selves,
 Covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truth breakers, false accusers, incontinence, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. But did she know that in the last days perilous times shall come? I will speak from the subject today. The chief is doing a good job.
 Point number one, despisers of those that are good. Point number two, false accusers. I read something in the paper last week that just broke my heart. I got it right here. A bunch of big shots got together and talked about 50 years of economic expansion and how they kept the black people out of it. There's a few other kids here. They wrecked our kids on purpose.
 And now we got a chief that's trying to be fair to the whole city, and they got this, help me Lord Jesus, this filthy human being. I just keep trying to figure out how's he trying to run the police department? He's an officer in the union or whatever. Despises of those that are good. There's a lot of people in our society like that. If you're doing good, they get mad at you.
 Rockford has a history, a serious history of raping black people. They ran into big shots. They had meetings and they kept us out. He despises us. He deliberately is trying to rape the police department. I keep trying to figure out why. Point number two, it's a false accuser. The whole thing is based on a lie.
 Chief never told the police to leave. The man, Lloyd Johnson, testified in open court under oath. Most people don't mean nothing to you when they say under guard. But everybody's gonna meet with Lloyd Jesus Christ. All the Muslims that's lying about their false religion, running around murdering people, most of them going to hell. The whole thing is a lie.
 that the chief didn't tell them to leave. And the president of the union told the man, he told Lloyd, we need, we trying to react to the chief. We need your help. Reverend Shelby, just your time is up actually this evening. The chief's doing a good job. Thank you. Thank you, our next speaker is John Brantley.
 Okay. Good evening, Mayor Marcy, all the women, and Rockford citizens of Rockford, Illinois. Proverbs, this is part four. Proverbs 17, verse 27 to 28, highlights seven benefits of keeping quiet. First, it's the best policy if you have nothing worthwhile to say. Two, it allows you the opportunity to listen and learn.
 Three, it gives you something in common with those who are wiser. Make sure to pause to think and listen so that when you do speak, you will have something important to say. Well, well, well, I truly understand more than ever now why Brother Brantley, why do you go to so many different meetings? For one, are you getting anything at the meeting? Two, are they listening to anything that you have to say?
 Three, are they just there to make it look like they really care about transforming Rockford or are some of them there because they get government funds to pretend like they are doing something for us and our community? Well, for one, I want to say this has been a good year for us. We have taken the bull by the horn and brought it down to where it is needed. We have opened up doors that before were closed to us. However, we got a long way to go in order for us to be able to do that.
 to work together to transform Rockford. I was at a town hall meeting at the Bedron Memorial Hall. The topic of discussion was what makes Rockford neighborhood vibrant? The panel includes five people, three whites and two blacks. All of them have good paying jobs and a powerful position.
 The young man, Sid, from Channel 13, asked several questions. I looked into the audience and it was a full house, 240 people. However, I could count the number of minorities on both hands. The place was packed with white people, yet the sad part about this is how are we going to transform Rockford if the African American community stand away from the table?
 Just like the election, if you do not get out to vote, then you cannot say or do anything if those in the power do whatever they think is best. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Too many of our African American brothers and sisters will sit on the sideline and complain and do nothing.
 Plus, when some of them do get around the power of the beat, they just show their white teeth. Too afraid to speak up. Now on the other side, how are you going to transform Rockford when you have realtors, bankers, and big business talking about rooftop? And they do not want to build on our side of town. And some are working behind the scenes to drive the property value down so that when they do buy up the land, that's another story, and I only have three minutes, but plus, they
 When you look on the other side of town, if you look on our side of town, every gas station, liquor store, grocery store is run down and owned mostly by foreigners. We, meaning African Americans, are nine out of ten of the time likely to get turned down when we try to apply to open a business
 or buy a house. What about the brothers and sisters that get out of jail that are trying to find a job but cannot get legal employment due to a felony? Finish up here. We had a meeting with HUD and SC with colleagues from the Department of Justice. I was surprised and glad to see that they wanted to talk to me. But just talking is not going to get anywhere. We have to start walking the walk and not just keep
 keep talking. So far this year we have been about education, training and jobs. Plus we are going head up with black on black crime and domestic violence. We have taken our average youth and adults on tours to Rock Valley College, Rockford University, Woodward Governor Plant and Downtown Library. We have neighborhood network meeting with Rock River Training, Rockford Fire and Police Recruiting, RHA, Prairie State Legal Service and Transform Rockford.
 Thus, let's just not talk about transforming Rockford. Let's work together. And just like because you may not like me, but you have no other choice but to respect me as I will respect you. And let's get our hands dirty and start working together to get the job done. If we really want to transform Rockford. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, next week I'm going to talk about the school system and our police union here in Rockford and why they're holding us back. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Roland Poston.
 Okay, I got two minutes left. I am Fishy Whale Roland Posca. This is my Rockford City Council speech for 3-2-15. No one will change their beliefs, but everyone can have their beliefs added to. We are born and we will die. But in between, let's do some magic and do the impossible.
 and to have had the opportunity to be creative. We need to set up Fishy Whale Art Labs all over the world to make artists, show art, sell concepts, sell IOUs, clone Fishy Whales. March 11th, 4.30 to 6 p.m., come to the Art Lab.
 the art lab at RESA to see the making of an international art show, sign declarations to do the impossible. We are in eternity and we can't get out. And we are now doing the impossible. We are achieving respect for all. We are expanding thinking.
 We are ending prejudice. We are ending violence. We will expand the money supply, and we must stop revenge and end war in 63 years. Rockford will lead the way. The world is finally ready for messages by fishy whales from Rockford, Illinois. And add your creative solutions.
 Order by our books of creative solutions and messages by Fishy Whales. $24. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Our final speaker this evening is Toby Haldeman. I truly appreciate the police arresting the Johns from the internet, but in my neighborhood the prostitutes don't get online to send updates. They work the street.
 The Johns from the internet are low hanging fruit, easy to get. Two weeks ago, someone had stolen a purse, came down my back alley right next to Turner School, emptied the contents which consisted of nine lighters, many CDs, four heroin spoons, three books of matches, assorted garbage, and three individually wrapped balloons. On the 21st of last month, while walking my dog,
 Guess what I found at Broadway and 7th Street, right in front of Thrifty Boutique? A barrel and a slide for a Ruger 9mm automatic handgun. Now, my question is, why would someone piece this gun out and throw the pieces away? My opinion is the gun was used in a crime, robbery, murder, you name it. I only hope the police are able to use it to solve a crime and put another scumbag in jail. So tell me what's happened in your neighborhood.
 I hope all of you have read Sunday's paper, Transform, Transform, Transform, Recycle, Reuse, Reduce, Wind Turbines, Solar Panels, Geothermal, which brings me to a speech I gave on December 30th, 2013, when I stated that when you buy Turner School for geopolicing, you should put in geothermal, solar panels, and wind turbines, thus reducing the cost to the taxpayers. But let's not stop at Turner School.
 You should install all of these at all three of the jail policing sites. It's not too late. Let's get this done before the taxpayers have to foot the bill. I will not be silent. I will be heard. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you to each of our speakers this evening. Thank you.
 move on to our agenda petitions and communications over Durkee planning and development. Thank you, I have two items. The first is a memorandum from LaKeithra Vaughn, Assistant City Attorney regarding West State Street Shopstead non-compliance. This is at 1718 and 1720 West State Street. This will be referred to Planning and Development Committee.
 Another memorandum from David Sidney, manager of comprehensive planning and design, for a presentation on the 2015 to 2019 implementation plan as part of the Rockford 2020 comprehensive plan update. These will be referred to planning and development. Thank you, Mr. Burford. Ms. Shirely. Thank you, Your Honor.

 From Ann Wilkerson, our financial analyst regarding street lighting for the electric supply contracts, and that's going to be referred to finance and personnel. And also a memorandum from Patrick Hayes, our legal director, and this is regarding the local agency agreement between the city and IDOT for Davis Park rails to trails. That also will be referred to finance and personnel.
 Thank you, Alderman Frost. Thank you. The Legislative and Lobbying Committee would like to refer a resolution urging the Governor and General Assembly to protect the full funding of the local government distributed fund revenues and we would refer that to the Finance and Personnel Committee. Thank you, Alderman Frost. Further petitions and communications? We have two proclamations this evening. Two proclamations this evening. Our first proclamation is for the Irish Marching Society.
 And I invite the members that are here from the Irish Marching Society to please come forward and accept the proclamation, including Linda Carroll, Aaron Kerr, and any other members that may be with them. Right up here with me. Where's the Irish Marching Society Rockford Chapter Number 1 is strictly a non-for-profit organization chartered in 1977. It was established to preserve and promote Irish heritage within our community.
 And whereas the Irish Marching Society continues to contribute financially from its various activities and events to local charitable organizations. Whereas the Irish Marching Society's 38th Annual St. Patrick's Day Parade will be held Saturday, March 14th, 3 p.m., beginning on 7th Street and 5th Avenue and ending at Memorial Hall on North Main Street. The 38th Annual St. Patrick's Day Party will be held at the Prairie Street Brewhouse, 200 Prairie Street, from 4.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. that same day.
 Now therefore, I, Lawrence J. Morrissey, as mayor of the city of Rockford, do hereby proclaim the week of March 9th, 2015 to be Irish Marching Society Week. We'll urge our citizens to recognize and support Irish Marching Society's enthusiastic efforts and we hope for warm weather as we celebrate and preserve our Celtic heritage. I'd like to share with the board. Hi, Danny McNaid here. When we celebrate a cultural thing like this, you know, it's funny because we look at it as how many cultures left
 and came to America because they wanted a new start and a new way. And we left, the Irish left starvation and economic tyranny and all these things to survive as a culture. How many cultures are surviving here because they came to America? We have freedom. And that's what we celebrate. So that's why we say on St. Paddy's Day, that celebration, everyone's Irish because we celebrate that coming to America and the freedom that we have.
 So I want to thank the people of Rockford, the mayor who marches in our parade, and I encourage you all, come on out. It's a great time. Put on your well coat. You know, we hope it's not arctic conditions. But, you know, and just celebrate with the Irish. That's what it's all about. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
 Next we have a proclamation for Red Heels Day. We'd invite David Burns, president of Midway Village, and any members of his board or organization that are here with him to please come forward to accept the proclamation, including former alderman Victor Bell. Go ahead and do that, Mike. So as we get prepared to make the proclamation, our guests are handing out some red socks as part of our Red Heels Day celebration, and our red heel should be widely recognized throughout the globe.
 as our very famous sock monkey from Rockford, Illinois, Nelson. You can use a nice warm pair of those socks on St. Patrick's Day when you're marching in the parade. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. So now I'll read the following proclamation in support of Red Heels Day. Whereas it is well known that Rockford has a rich history of manufacturing and industry,
 And whereas from 1932 to 1992, the Nelson Knitting Company of Rockford manufactured and sold the red heel work sock. Whereas during the Great Depression, the Rockford red heeled socks were used to create folk art monkey toys. And an interest in creating this uniquely American handmade doll continues to this very day. Whereas for several years, Midway Village has hosted the Sock Monkey Madness Festival,
 attended and enjoyed by thousands of residents and tourists. The 10th annual Sock Monkey Madness Festival will be held Saturday, March 7th, and Sunday the 8th from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both days. Now therefore, I, Lawrence J. Morsi, as Mayor of the City of Rockford, do hereby proclaim March 2nd, 2015 to be Red Heels Day, and we urge our citizens to attend this year's event and embrace our proud manufacturing heritage. Thank you very much, Mayor.
 Sock Monkey Madness Festival is now 10 years old. Thousands of sock monkeys have been made at the Sock Monkey Madness Festival. So we're hoping everybody will bring their sock monkeys back to Rockford, and we'll have a big reunion. And thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Excellent. Thank you. Excellent. Got our socks. Thank you again. New committee reports.
 Paul Maderke. Thank you, Your Honor. One item. This is the proposed River Edge redevelopment zone boundary amendment for the expansion of boundaries to provide opportunities to re-divitalize commercial properties on both sides of the street along Broadway between 7th and 11th Street. I'd ask that we suspend rules and then pace this up for passage.
 There's been a motion and second to suspend the rules on the proposed River Edge redevelopment zone boundary. All those in favor of suspending the rules please signify by saying aye. Aye. Opposed no. I say I will the rules be suspended. Thank you your honor. Then I place this up for passage. That is up for passage. It's their discussion.
 Is there a limit on I know with the enterprise on some of these are square miles and how much so are we approaching our limit did we have some leftover did we take space away from another area I remember the original map but I can't tell by just looking at the
 Thank you, Your Honor. There is a limit in regards to number of square miles. I believe it's 12 square miles and we're quite a bit under that limit, so this is solely an expansion. Just one comment of note that in our proposed enterprise zone application that's pending review by DCEO, there would be some removal of additional over-the-edge equipment.
 So there may be some additional room for expansion in the future should our enterprise sell and be able to. Thank you. Any further questions? Thank you, ma'am. I'm not understanding the river edge is a certain area and this area that you are asking to be included is not geographically attached to that, correct? I'll take that on.
 Under state law, it allows us to set the boundaries just about however we want.
 There's some parameters around it. It's gotta be contiguous. So we've created the boundary to expand to cover this area intentionally so that we can capture the building where our geo policing district two building's going to be. That would enable us to take advantage of the state historic preservation tax credit in addition to the federal historic preservation tax credit. So that's the, that meets the obligations and the requirements that are held by law.
 Yes. Follow up please. There is not, is there a Broadway development group at this time? There was at one time I know. Mr. Cagnoli. Thank you Your Honor. Yes there is an active group of individuals and businesses located along Broadway that are actively meeting on a monthly basis.

 Julia Valdez has sent around, based on some questions that have been asked from some council members, a copy of an HR report including an update on new hires since January 2015, the working weekly report that has used a monitor activity and process within the department, the 2014 stewardship report from the workers' compensation provider, the year-to-date report from Marathon Health, who runs our wellness center,
 and a copy of the 2014 Rockstat report for HR. If you have additional questions or are looking for follow-up or feedback, please feel free to contact Ms. Valdez directly. Also, just wanted to note, this week will be the State of the City Address. This Thursday, that will be at the Nordloff Center. I should know this, Ms. Valdez, doors open at 5 and there's just speech.
 God willing, we'll start at 6 o'clock. So looking forward to that. It's, as I mentioned before, a different setting. It'll be a smaller, a little bit more intimate setting, a little bit more conversational. I'm going to have some time at the end for Q&A, which hopefully will be live streaming. Hopefully the same system that we use to stream our meetings tonight will be able to use for the State of the City Address. If all goes well, I've got a few minutes left.
 Nothing better than waiting until the last minute to ask Mr. Trammell to try to help us out with that, but he's been working with Julia Valdez, and hopefully we'll get that worked out. But appreciate the opportunity. If you need tickets, please feel free to contact Susan or Deb in the mayor's office and accommodate all of our council requests.
 And there'll be some other folks, I think, downtown that had asked about also if it's live streaming to be able to help host if some of the surrounding areas and restaurants downtown if it hopefully sells out, which we would certainly hope.
 I just wanted to also thank council members who were able to participate in the last week's affordable housing discussion. It's really not at all the end, it's more of a beginning and we anticipate being able to do some follow up in the near future, getting to more specifics. We learned and discussed a lot of best practices, things that were happening around the country.
 The next discussion, Mr. Cagnone is going to work directly with council members and with some of our friends at the RHA to put that together. But we hope to get into some specific conversations about opportunities in Rockford. Finally, I just wanted to share our condolences.
 Last week, as I think most of us know, one of our members of the City of Rockford employee family, Mark Williams, tragically lost his daughter, Amanda, who died just 19 years old in a tragic car accident involving a Metro train.
 She was an incredibly bright and by all accounts just beautiful young lady. It's a tremendous, tremendous loss for Mark and his entire family. So we just ask that we do our very best to keep him and his family and our love and prayers as they go through this incredibly challenging time. And just as a dad myself, it causes all of us to
 hug our children more closely and just keep them in our thoughts and prayers each and every day when they leave our arms For their officers reports all the maneuver. Thank you, man Good fortune to go to the YWCA luncheon today. It was a nice day
 intimate get-together of 600 plus women. Very good meal, but saw some of the leaders of Rockford and the doers of Rockford receive the recognition that they should have received and want to say again, there are a lot of good people in Rockford and we need more of that. Thank you.
 Thank you very much. Further officer's reports, we'll come back to Mayor. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to thank you for your testimony for the train hearing. I thought you did a wonderful job. Also want to thank you and Todd Cagnone for putting together the housing discussion. I thought it was really meaningful and I think I'm eager to see the next steps. And lastly, just my heart goes out to the Williams family. Nothing's more tragic than that.
 Thank you. I just wanted to specifically recognize Mr. Ryan. So believe it or not, I don't always write everything that I read in testimony, but Jim and I worked on that. He did most of the hard work. I helped to edit the remarks, but that really draws upon a lot of his work and his understanding of the rail system. Chuck Sweeney, I met with Mr. Sweeney today from the newspaper. He's got a column that's been posted online. And I would just add,
 My dad says if it might help, it won't hurt, let's give it a try. So when it comes to politics and it comes to the state's capital investments, everything that we can do to get the word out about the importance of this investment, the importance of leveraging the multiple modes of transportation that would use the rail line, freight, commuter, and Amtrak, all of the related opportunities of economic development around that, it's important to get that message out, so I appreciate that. Thank you again, Mr. Ryan, for all your work on that.
 further officers reports business I'll try thank you your honor under unfinished business committee reports laid over a one amendments to the city of rockford code of ordinances section 3 dash 58 classification of liquor license liquor licenses to create new classifications based on food and alcohol sales compared to gaming revenue puts that up for passage under thank you very much up for passage under unfinished business committee reports laid over
 7-8-1 Is there discussion? I'd like to make a motion. There's been some questions come up from concerned citizens and council members. I'd like to make a motion that this be sent back to the codes and regs. Second. There's been a motion and a second. For the matter of fact codes and regulations. Discussion on the motion. Holder.
 Just that there was also some legislation pending that we just learned about today that some people may already be aware of it, but it's not just an issue in Rockford. So there is some legislation that's pending. It's in the early stages, I believe. But I think it could be helpful with this whole issue of gaming parlors and video gaming
 where and when and allowing more flexibility on the parts of cities so we don't have to resort to some of these types of measures.
 with mr hayes input and some others that might be able to guide us a little bit better as we move along with this thank you all right thank you on that note i i would like to request that mr hayes shared the information with us and legislative and lobby could uh he extend that to the other alderman so they have the same information that we have thank you mr
 The bill has been introduced in the state house. House Bill 259, Alderman Cisnowski is the sponsor. The bill would allow municipalities that authorize video gaming as well as counties to place restrictions on the locations of the video gaming terminal.
 the boundaries of the municipality or the unincorporated areas of the county including but not limited to requiring mandatory distance and feet between sets of video gaming terminals. This would address the density issue that was a significant discussion between and among the alderman here related to video gaming.
 That was introduced in the State House early this session and it's been assigned to the Executive Committee. We'll keep the Alderman apprised if there's a hearing on that. Thank you. Thank you. Any further discussion? Alderman Newberg? Would you repeat what bill number was that? Yes, ma'am. That is House Bill 259. Thank you. Further discussion? Thank you.
 Hearing none, the motion on the floor is to refer that item back to committee. All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Motion to vote. Ayes 7, the mail will be referred back to the committee. So in the area of the additional unfinished business appointments, let's see, we just want to make sure that these are up this evening and have a date.
 agenda. Alderman Hervey will read those for the passenger. I was looking for the same thing. I had three appointments for tonight. The first is to the Community Action Advisory Board for Ms. Carol Santiago and that would be for term ending January of 2016.

 Regarding item number five, the move or improve to own, I'd just like to thank Dahlia Altman for taking the time to send me a number of questions and feedback in regard to this program, and I'd appreciate your support. I'd also like to thank Todd Cagnone and the staff for working through much of that program with me. And then lastly, I would like to amend
 the city market dates under Roman numeral IV, A4. The resolution currently says May 21st through September 26th plus October 16th for the fall festival.

 that it shows 830 for every evening and I understand there was a special time for the October 16th. Who can help on the staff? Ms. Feld, that's your ticket. So the time listed which says September 26th through October 16th from 330 to 830 is actually the time the streets are closed. So that's what we cite when we do the permit is when the city streets will actually be closed.
 So the event itself is starting a little bit earlier this year and ending a little bit earlier but the streets will close out this time then officially. Thank you. So we don't need any changes? No. So the, let me guess, just. I was just going to move on to the VOTA owner improvement program we've already been done with. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I just wanted to take a minute to thank all of you back in the mirror.
