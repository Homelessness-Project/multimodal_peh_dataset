And there's the one item under finance and personnel that's previously been read in. Are there any questions or comments on that matter? Other makes thank you so much. I just wanted to ask just To clarify so the total grant amount through 2026 was 500,000 499,000 and then work was everything for that whole 499,000 have you already? like made the request of what you want to do with that money through 2026? Yeah, so that had to be submitted in the grant application. Now I will advise Our submission was for about $580,000, so we didn't receive the full amount we requested, but it was just under $500,000. So we as council don't have any say in how that money is spent over the next two years. Just want to clarify that. According to the grant application and what was submitted, so we're actually going to have to cut some things because we didn't receive the full award. Okay. Thank you, Senator. You're welcome. Any other questions? Can we do a voice vote? All those in favor, make it by aye. Aye. Opposed? Opposed? All right, the matter passes. Is there a motion to adjourn? So moved. Thank you. All those in favor indicate by aye. Aye. Special meeting is adjourned.
