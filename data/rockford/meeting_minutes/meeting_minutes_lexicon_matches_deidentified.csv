And the rapid rehousing, which is I think the other set of alphabet soup that you were referring to, refers to the ability to quickly get someone into housing that is already homeless and then provide supportive services to them [ORGANIZATION] while they are stabilized in terms of income and permanency. So, it's an extension of what normally would be a temporary housing solution for [ORGANIZATION]."

10_21_2019,homeless,Abandoned citizens die homeless in the streets [ORGANIZATION]. But it doesn't make the [TIME] news everyone to wonder why.

10_13_2020,homeless,"yeah, it may have been a little excessive with the many tents and the generators and all the other things. But, you know, if we're following the heart of [ORGANIZATION] and the God that we trust that's written on the back of our dollar bill,  then feeding the homeless and sheltering the homeless, feeding the hungry and clothing the poor, that's exactly what righteousness calls us to do, to serve."

And so I It's going to be, it's going to expound on the blue and white signs with billboards, social media campaign, some PSAs."

09_19_2022,panhandler,"You don't mind so then if a panhandler is hit by a car that it's just like a Anyone getting hit and the driver is going to be responsible for that Accident even though the panel is on the [STREET] shouldn't be industry. Is that is that the [STREET] it's going to work? So I IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR PROFESSION IS, IF YOU GET IT BY A [ORGANIZATION], IF THERE'S A [ORGANIZATION] WHO IS A CITIZEN WALKING, CERTAINLY IF THE [ORGANIZATION] IS AT FAULT, THEN IF THE [ORGANIZATION] IS NOT AT FAULT, THEN WHETHER YOU'RE A PAIN HANDLER OR SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE HERE."
12_06_2021,homeless; homelessness,"The grant award will provide funds to benefit individuals and families who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, or in other vulnerable populations. Item number 13, committee recommends approval and acceptance of administration of children and families, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] continuation of [PERSON], early [PERSON] services for [LOCATION] and approval of the self-assessment report, self-assessment work plan and program goals. That concludes the items for finance personnel mayor."
12_06_2021,homelessness,"And it seems to be going on now. The federal government is great at it because none of it is results-driven. I mean, we look at the money that the federal government, states, and local municipalities have spent since the [ORGANIZATION] administration, the homelessness rates, the  poverty rates, all this stuff is still the same."
12_06_2021,homeless,"And so throwing money at programs, throwing money at people, and doing this without results being, I can't support this stuff anymore. So either we have to sit down and focus on what works, what is a root cause. Now, I understand there are certain folks that are homeless, as far as this relates to, that have a high degree of mental illness, and that's a tragedy."
12_06_2021,homeless; homelessness,"I would say, too, as it relates to the homeless funds, I think just speaking broadly, maybe not these specifically, I think... One, you probably have some argument to be made and would find agreement with me and a host of others about how the federal government does not provide a lot of metrics for a lot of their dollars. But I would also say that when you look at the city of [ORGANIZATION] and what our human services department has done with homeless dollars and reducing homelessness in our community,  we are really a national story to look at much of the work that can be done."
12_06_2021,homelessness,"I think it's veterans' homelessness, and I think we've done two other categories as well and are working towards [DATE] of the five categories in homelessness for functional zero. I think obviously we, and I don't think any staff member would say, even if we get those five, we've done it. You just got to keep working."
12_06_2021,homeless; homelessness,"But I believe the numbers were [ORGANIZATION] ago, [LOCATION], it was 230, 250 in homelessness count. Even after the, not after, through the pandemic, just as DATE2, and my memory could be off, this is from memory, it was about 150. So the efforts that our human services staff is doing is actually pretty incredible.  older woman PERSON0 Thank You mayor speaking on the homeless I had a young lady come to my house DATE3 and she what didn't have a [STREET] to stay it was right before it started to get really cold"
12_06_2021,homelessness,"So over the course of the pandemic, some of those circumstances have changed. However,  Each of the funding streams that come from [ORGANIZATION] have different requirements for those programs. So, for example, the Emergency Solutions Grant will have different requirements for actually qualifying for that program and what a person actually has their situation has to be in order to be indicative of imminent homelessness."
12_06_2021,homeless,"It's not always the exact same thing for a person depending on their situation. So sometimes that will change depending on the assistance that they actually qualify for, like how they qualify for it can change. Now with regards to these funds,  These home ARP funds are different from some of the other homeless funds that [ORGANIZATION] has accepted from ORG1 and that these dollars are actually intended, although your description said to provide housing and services, these dollars really are more so with regards to housing."
12_06_2021,affordable housing,"development and support of affordable housing. So what happens is that the approval of this grant award from [ORGANIZATION] would actually allow [ORGANIZATION] to immediately start utilizing up to 5% of the total award for administrative and planning activities, but acceptance of this award is not approval for specific projects or plans. The city is then required to go through a full consultation and public participation process  that assesses unmet need with qualifying populations as well as creating an overall plan."
12_06_2021,homeless,So this is more for funding like large-scale projects that actually address some of the gaps in housing and availability for homeless folks. So this is not intended to be another rental assistance program or a program for folks that are imminently housed just paying the rent somewhere. ARP dollars are really more so about funding a large-scale project or allowing the city to come up with a comprehensive plan for how to support a large-scale project to help house homeless individuals.
12_06_2021,affordable housing,"But that was part of my point. It all sounds exactly the same. It's all is the same stuff said over and over again in a different package and this is what I'm driving at and in our city You know, we talk about affordable housing."

06_10_2019,homeless,"I find it a little bit disturbing in the state of [ORGANIZATION] that we just passed a budget with no, nothing for mental health. Mental, as long as the folks with some, let's face it, many of the homeless suffer from schizophrenia. It's not their fault and there's some mental challenges that they have and it is a disease."
07_10_2017,homeless,"I'd like to give a thanks out to the members of the [INSTITUTION] and our code enforcement area who went with me on a trip down into the FAC0 homeless encampment that's under the FAC1 viaduct. One of the gentlemen who was there is the man who killed the individual on the second floor there.  of a building on FAC2. He's also believed to be the same gentleman who murdered a homeless man, I believe it was in his own tent, in the viaduct encampment, and that was just back in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_06_2022,homeless,"And we did schedule a meeting with their team. Our contact over their homeless programs was on vacation [ORGANIZATION], so we have not been able to meet with her. yet since I put that request in, but we do plan to meet and ask that question."
09_06_2022,homeless,"well i'm gonna do a bad choice of words Thanks, thank you any other discussion alderman [ORGANIZATION] then alderwoman PERSON1 follow-up on the [LOCATION] cranes in this housing and I share the same concerns and It's one of those things where you like to trust but verify be interesting to see really that the data on these and Actually their effectiveness. You know you read the document and obviously Lot of who a lot of homeless we all know a good percentage of them are schizophrenic One of the biggest problems with them is getting them on their meds and trying to get these folks treatment now We we closed singer because schizophrenics don't have a pack and they don't have a voting block."
09_06_2022,homelessness,"The ability for schizophrenics to hurt themselves and sometimes hurt others, not intentionally, they're mentally ill people, is high, and the in and out is high. And I'm not so sure that I agree with this [ORGANIZATION] model. If it's a standard homelessness venture where somebody has lost their job or something has happened, that's not their fault and we need to assist them, that's fine."
09_06_2022,homelessness,I'll give you an example of [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. that the definition of functional zero of homelessness.
09_06_2022,homelessness,"At any point in time, the number of people experiencing sheltered or unsheltered homelessness will be no greater than the current [ORGANIZATION] housing placement rate for people experiencing homelessness. Now if anybody understands that, let me know. As a clinician or anybody, we look for helping these folks out and being effective."
09_06_2022,homeless,"Director [PERSON]? [PERSON], so for, I'll speak specifically about [PERSON] because that's kind of where the conversation has been around, but I will say typically we do have clients that are in this collaborative program that will reach out to our case managers in the homeless program. They do have contacts within [ORGANIZATION], so they will reach out to you."
06_26_2017,homeless,"I would like to ask that the [INSTITUTION] and the city and the homeless coalition... I don't know how [ORGANIZATION] got started, and I'm not gonna point the fingers, but I had a homeless gentleman who was killed by another homeless gentleman in a building on FAC0. It's just out of control."
09_04_2018,homeless,"We have been to [STREET] [DATE]. We have a family that was evicted, get reinstated. We have homeless youth."
09_04_2018,affordable housing,"i don't know that we're going to meet that deadline but we would like them out by [ORGANIZATION]  The next thing that is in front of us is that we have $3.9 million to bring down FAC0, but it has been found to be filled with asbestos, so we are going to be working on creative ways to develop partners to get it down. We currently have an RFP out for a consultant to help us design and move forward on fairgrounds. And we all want everyone to know that we are going back to the original purpose of housing, which is to help people have clean, safe, affordable housing while working on reducing unemployment and maximizing self-sufficiency."
06_06_2022,homelessness,"Number 13 is approval of the acceptance of [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $487,000. The grant term is from [ORGANIZATION] and does not require a cost match.

06_15_2015,homeless,"And as well as feeding them, they also clothe them. I can remember in the state of the city's address, one of the things that Your [PERSON] pointed out is there would be no more homeless in this community. This is an organization that I think that we could definitely partner with to help accomplish those needs."
06_15_2015,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] and I had a conversation earlier today that we would at least have a conversation with the founder to see if there's something that we can do to achieve the goal of the homeless in the community. So I would like to forward PERSON1 phone number to [ORGANIZATION], so hopefully there'll be a contact and a conversation. I don't know what possibly could happen, but everything starts with a conversation."
08_03_2015,homelessness,"Good [TIME], folks. Update here. DATE0, I joined [ORGANIZATION], aka [ORGANIZATION], or [ORGANIZATION]."
08_03_2015,homeless,"I asked if this person was a veteran. When the answer I was expecting was revealed, I also announced, it takes one to know one. And [TIME], I was elected to represent the homeless veterans with their issues."
08_03_2015,homeless,"The lesson is, if you are not somewhat challenged in representing people and have no idea what their needs are, you have no business making a power play. DATE0, I spoke to the full [ORGANIZATION] to continue collecting support for [ORGANIZATION] area's homeless veterans with good success. And I can't forget all the support and requests from the union heads that we had a meeting with [LOCATION]."
06_19_2017,homeless,A [ORGANIZATION] GPE0 [ORGANIZATION] report found the poverty rate for children raised in female-headed households was 45.8 percent while the rate for children raised in married couple households was 9.5 percent. homeless and runaway children are fatherless. Four times more likely to be raised in poverty and without the guidance of a father.
08_17_2020,homeless,I observed some of the young men who are homeless. I know a couple of them. They are homeless that walked around and pulled branches out of the [STREET].
07_18_2016,homelessness,"And as we've stabilized the growth around downtown, the restaurants, other things, people feeling comfortable walking around, you know, we're not dealing with issues of any kind of concern with security or homelessness. All those things just feed into each other. The other challenge I just want to kind of leave you with, if it's okay, [ORGANIZATION], is just, you know, we are now, I believe, in [ORGANIZATION] bonds."
06_22_2015,affordable housing,"Pursuant to council rule, that will lay over. Their resumes will follow. I also just wanted to make a quick but important note and would just ask everyone, so everyone either was at that meeting [ORGANIZATION] or heard about the meeting that we had regarding [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing development proposal."
08_05_2024,affordable housing,"Plus, there's a newer fire station in that same area that will support the infrastructure that's needed there. Ideally, we need 25 to 30 more projects like the FAC0 facility, FAC1, and the [ORGANIZATION] complex to meet the housing needs of our community. More affordable housing and upscale housing will be key to [ORGANIZATION]'s future success."
08_05_2024,affordable housing,"We will also can't look the other [STREET] when it comes to seeing affordable housing is also at the root of the problem for all the shortages we're seeing in the workforce. Housing programs offered through [ORGANIZATION] as Section 42 low-income housing tax credits are the key to energizing our inner city business districts with public and private partnerships that are very popular in the larger cities and are now being seen in [ORGANIZATION]. We must also realize that increasing the density of our city's neighborhoods, we will be increasing the average per capita income of our neighborhoods."
08_05_2024,affordable housing,"We just approved that That is I guess categorized as low income But or what would you categorize it as officially I can't affordable housing affordable housing and But again individuals who have to meet certain criteria jobs Full-time jobs etc. And just need you know, basically a hand up not a handout I am all for that"
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"It's all about affordable and low-income housing. It must be built differently than market rate, and this will explain what we should be looking for when somebody is presenting affordable housing to make it a safe space for the people that decide to move there. Again, it is called Creating Defensible Space."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,But really good stuff in here and you really should read it before you approve any affordable housing. Thank you.
06_03_2024,homeless,"The current situation in [ORGANIZATION] is horrific. Over 36,000 people have been killed, 30 percent of [ORGANIZATION]'s population is starving, and 86 percent of [ORGANIZATION]'s population is homeless. Over 6 percent of [ORGANIZATION]'s population is either dead, wounded, tortured, or missing."
08_17_2015,affordable housing,"And that's what I really resent about it. If Mr. [PERSON] truly wanted to have a conversation and start a dialogue about affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and about what it means to affirmatively further fair housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION], this is not the [STREET] to go about it. This is orchestrated almost to assure that many people won't be able to attend the meeting."
08_17_2015,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is the only, the major city in this county that supports homelessness, that has a program to eliminate homelessness among our veterans, that provides emergency shelter and housing to people who are in critical need. We bear almost the entire burden for the entire county. So for [ORGANIZATION] to say that [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] is not furthering the goals and the aims of fair housing is insulting, it's ludicrous, and I hope we stand up to it through legal means and through practical means."
08_17_2015,affordable housing,"I'd like to pull our percentage of public housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION] compared with our population. I would like to look at our percentage of affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION] compared with our population. And I would like to look at the amount of subsidized housing that is cited within the public, I'm sorry, within the corporate boundaries of the city of [ORGANIZATION] as opposed to [PERSON]."
08_01_2022,homelessness,The eighth cause is financial problems. The ninth cause is homelessness. The tenth cause is health problems.
08_31_2015,homelessness,Enough money to lower the unemployment rate by putting people to work. Enough money to eliminate homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] by putting people in the home. Enough money to eliminate poverty in [ORGANIZATION].
09_03_2024,homelessness,The eighth cause is financial problems. The ninth cause is homelessness. The tenth cause is health problems.
08_21_2023,affordable housing; unhoused,"I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you for the support you provide [PERSON] on a regular basis, through both funding our home ownership program, our critical home repair program, and most importantly, a down payment assistance program for our first time home buyers that we have the privilege of walking alongside. As many of you know, affordable housing is a crisis, not just in the city of [PERSON] and in [ORGANIZATION], but across this state and across this entire nation. There are so many people here in our city that are both under housed and unhoused."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,But they're necessary people and they're as entitled as anyone to clean safe affordable housing. I also want to say FAC0 It was FAC1.
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"[PERSON]. Thank you, Your Honor. I think it's pretty well known that over [ORGANIZATION] I've had some concerns about affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], how it's transpired over time."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"I don't have the advantage of growing up in [ORGANIZATION], But I've seen a west side of [ORGANIZATION] that essentially became, in a sense, subsidized housing, affordable housing, dumping ground. The sites were not scattered. They were of high density, crowding people together, and complete opposite to how this should have been done."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], other major cities, have learned this. And I don't. No, that we quite have, and we really don't have a [STREET] to look at housing and affordable housing or subsidized housing in [PERSON]."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"And it's almost like putting more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] is like drilling holes in a hull of a sinking ship, hoping the water will run out. And I think we're struggling here across our city. And I'll outline a couple of reasons."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"I know there's a distinction between affordable housing and subsidized housing, and people like it to make it that [STREET]. I think it's a matter of semantics. Most housing that receives either government funding with Section 8 tax credits, grants, tax rebates, whatever you may call them, essentially is subsidized housing and essentially almost a public housing project."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] now approaching 200,000. [PERSON], a little over probably 150,000. These data are from an affordable housing survey."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"website and there is I guess they're as good as [ORGANIZATION] and this is concerning the city of [ORGANIZATION] we bet have repeated I've had and others repeated calls for us to develop some kind of comprehensive approach to how this works we had a [ORGANIZATION] representative here [LOCATION] and I asked him several questions when he stood here As to what is the ratio of public housing units per capita or subsidized units per capita that is sustainable in a given demographic? I also ask them, what is the city's per household or per capita income that is required to sustain a number of affordable housing units within a demographic? I asked..."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"So we never, the big question I have is we don't study the ripple effect that creating more subsidized or affordable housing units have within a demographic. There's a significant percentage of these folks, not all of them, but some of them who require the housing have other challenges that need to be met by schools, schools. [ORGANIZATION], fire calls, social service calls, non-government agency contribution, and police calls."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"Is there another agenda? But I do support, affordable housing for people for no fault of their own who land up in dire straits for those unable to care for themselves. But however, general housing in [ORGANIZATION] has been a failure."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,How are we going to dilute them? What is our philosophy? What are we doing with public and affordable housing?
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"and I believe alderman [ORGANIZATION] had her hand up again. Yeah. Thank you your honor for allowing me to speak Just a few things on this number one is, you know I think most rock 40 ins have received their assessments and if you haven't you'll probably get the sticker shock of 11% increase in your property assessment and that is basically because we have a shortage of housing in our in our area it's created a really Undue need for housing and cause and causing prices to skyrocket in this area and so whether it's low income whether it's Affordable housing middle income, you know, I don't care if it's a mansion We should be seeing build build build here in the city of [ORGANIZATION] otherwise, we're going to continue to see our property assessments go up at rates like 11%"
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"and So I'm very much in favor of this project because I hope it gets other developers noticing that [ORGANIZATION] is moving these types of things forward. The other thing that I just would like to recognize is that, you know, the low income and affordable housing units will probably continue to go up at rates. And part of that is because when you give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and you don't allow people to make a living wage, you generally see people losing access to housing to the American dream."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"And I think part of that goes to the idea that [ORGANIZATION], not [ORGANIZATION], but [ORGANIZATION] has used [ORGANIZATION] as its central hub for housing. And at places like [PERSON], GPE2, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and surrounding communities, do not have that access to affordable housing because ORG2 has decided to use GPE6 as its number one stomping grounds and so i would encourage residents to get involved and get and understand that fact is that we have two interests both GPE6 housing authority [ORGANIZATION] who have used the LOC0 for [ORGANIZATION] as a part of their housing strategies because Those properties are cheaper."
08_21_2023,affordable housing,"They can access them cheaper and then can provide those [ORGANIZATION] units and I think it's unfair to residents on the west side. I think That areas like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] should have access to affordable housing they have continue to buy units in [LOCATION]. They will not share, again, Alderman [ORGANIZATION] talked about sharing addresses."
07_15_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], in collaboration with [ORGANIZATION], requests approval of ORG2 to serve as a sponsor of a nonprofit community housing development organization, which are also known as [ORGANIZATION].  for the purpose of developing affordable housing and reducing homelessness and there is attached memorandum this will be referred to planning and development  Thank you, sir. Next up, we don't have any finance and personnel items, so we'll move into public speakers. Just want to make all the public speakers aware that there's microphones on the back right and back left of the chamber and that each public speaker has [TIME]."
07_23_2018,affordable housing,"And one of the things I want to bring up is that many of us, when we talk about mixed income, it doesn't necessarily mean what we think it means. There is mixed income that is market rate and low income, and there are developments that are affordable housing and low income. And they make a great difference in what the development ends up looking like."
07_11_2022,homelessness,"should have the bus run [TIME] a day, [ORGANIZATION] a week, so people who don't have a car to get to work and school. [ORGANIZATION] should have their own cab service to help [ORGANIZATION] buses because most of the cabs in [ORGANIZATION] are from out of town. If you listen to this idea, you could reduce crime, poverty, homelessness, and the dropout rate, and increase the graduation rate in high school and college."
06_17_2024,homeless,"NUMBER THREE IS THE [ORGANIZATION] FROM [ORGANIZATION], DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF [ORGANIZATION] the acceptance of [ORGANIZATION] for additional funding, number four is a memorandum from [ORGANIZATION] Manager, regarding the approval of a professional service agreement with [ORGANIZATION] for tax increment financing consultation for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] district.

08_19_2024,homeless,"First, I was known for the guy that Mayor [PERSON] kicked out of [ORGANIZATION] for DATE0 DATE1. And then shortly after that, I was known for the guy that helped many homeless veterans. That was much better."
08_19_2024,homeless,"Now that my sentence is completed, the prison sentence that is, I am now moving ahead with [ORGANIZATION]. When this is accomplished, I will get back to the best job I ever had in the world, working for homeless vets for free. Until that time, I will continue my crusade to have people replace and remove these torn, disrespectful American flags."
08_19_2019,homelessness; affordable housing,"Thank you, your honor. The committee recommends approval of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s request for the city to establish a tax exempt organization under section 501C3 of the ORG2 code. Establishing a 501C3 organization serves as the initial step to create a program in which a city would serve as a sponsor of a non-profit community housing development organization, otherwise known as [ORGANIZATION].  for the purpose of developing affordable housing and reducing homelessness."

08_07_2023,affordable housing,I'm also the Senior Vice President of [ORGANIZATION]. I run ORG1 of [ORGANIZATION] for the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here [TIME] to speak on support of ORG2.
07_06_2015,affordable housing,"The meeting that was on [ORGANIZATION], on  at FAC0 on a potential affordable housing development on FAC1 was a total chaos. How do people in [ORGANIZATION] with their $100,000 home or more act so much with hate at that meeting? That was not fear."

04_04_2022,affordable housing,"I guess my, it's not really a question, it's more of a rhetorical question, but if I'm understanding properly, this forgivable loan that was created using CDBG dollars to support the development of affordable housing in this community,  So now on [TIME] that we recognized [ORGANIZATION] for their work in the development of affordable housing, we're contemplating if this resource that's allowed for thousands of low- to moderate-income folks to secure housing in our community for [ORGANIZATION] is worthy of our support.

05_04_2015,homeless,I wonder if the folks in charge think that by ignoring the poor they will just go away. We will hear much about the middle class and how both parties are not going to be able to get a lot of money  plan to help that group of people. But I'd like to know what their plans are for the poor and homeless in [ORGANIZATION].
05_04_2015,homelessness,"as for that safety net, true or misstated by [ORGANIZATION]. While the increase in poverty primarily reflects developments in the economy, weakness in the safety net, particularly in the temporary federal unemployment benefit program, also contributed criminologists say 95% of crime in [ORGANIZATION] emanates from an economic position. Only when we have seen enough killing in [ORGANIZATION] among young folks who are willing to get money or things they value by any means necessary, we will see a significant change in how we address the issue of poverty and homelessness."
03_20_2023,homeless,"Number seven, the committee recommends approval and acceptance of the amended [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON].

The grant term is from DATE2 to [ORGANIZATION]."
05_10_2021,homelessness,"Number five is also a carbon risk [STREET], but this one is a renewal of a [ORGANIZATION] for existing housing supportive services for those struggling with homelessness. This grant is $32,810 and runs from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION]. Number six is [ORGANIZATION]."

05_10_2021,homeless,"[PERSON], all of these grants are continuing grants for the continuum of care. So they all go to the sub-recipients that we work with in the community for various subsections of the homeless population. And with this particular grant, as I questioned the other grants, is there more than one organization that would be a recipient of these funds?"
06_01_2015,affordable housing,"4a-1, 2, 3.  thank you mayor I think I'll have the privilege of potentially reading the longest amendment on city council history I'd like to move uh move to amend the committee report for the assistance agreement of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to modify all sections with references to lot z and additional clarifications  Homeowner developer sponsor sponsor rental rehabilitation program agreement modifications are article 1 shall read as follows the total forgivable loan amount provided by the city pursuant to this agreement is 409402 dollars and 20 cents  The loan bears no interest and shall be forgiven entirely provided the property remains as it was originally intended for affordable housing pursuant to this agreement and other default occurs. The home fund shall be used for the A, rehabilitation of the property located at FAC0 at FAC1 in Exhibit B.  Article 2, Section 2.1E shall read as follows."
06_01_2015,affordable housing,"So I currently, I completely understand concerns being raised by citizens after the action of [ORGANIZATION]. I received quite a few emails and contacts, much of which was based on old or simply fabricated information, not on accurate information. While we deal with a tremendous number of challenges with affordable housing, my sole goal as mayor is to try to make sure we conduct."
06_01_2015,homeless,and I think we would definitely have the votes on the floor to lay this over. thank you for the discussion all over PERSON0 yeah one last thing your honor um if the city staff could also provide any information for the city laying fiber optic cable in these areas as well so the question is while we're moving homeless would we also be making those improvements
05_31_2022,homeless,"Two-thirds of offenders had history of mental health issues. Nearly all were men and nearly all had made threats or said or done things that raised concern in people around them. Seventy-five percent had experienced a major stress event.  such as a death, divorce, or homeless, or lost their job, or kick out of school."
05_16_2016,homelessness,"And [ORGANIZATION] is someone who worked with us in [LOCATION]. Many of you may recall the work that we did at [ORGANIZATION]  that really was an attempt to take individuals that were facing particular challenges having to do with even dealing with incarceration and homelessness and really providing an opportunity and a path to employment. And [PERSON]'s story, which you will not necessarily be able to hear all of [TIME], is one that was one of those individuals who I would ask certainly to share if he would like to, as his experience."
05_16_2016,homelessness,"Thank you. And then our last recognition, which I'm going to ask [ORGANIZATION] to actually not only give, but say a little bit about, is our volunteers and our partnership that really is, I think, captures this work that we've been doing [ORGANIZATION] in addressing chronic homelessness among veterans. In order for that achievement that was really a national recognition for our city and as an organization and for the work of many people in this community to occur, it took the cooperation of a lot of partners."
05_16_2016,homelessness,Thank you. [PERSON] came to the table first when we started working on [ORGANIZATION]' homelessness. They were there right away even though we weren't really sure what we could share or what we could do when we started.
05_16_2016,homelessness,"but they stuck with us, they got all the permissions they needed, and we would not have made the functional end of veteran homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] without them, so thank you. PERSON0? Well, thank you for this honor."
05_16_2016,homeless; homelessness,"And our partnership with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] has made a difference in [ORGANIZATION]. As [ORGANIZATION] implied, we moved beyond the red tape of bureaucracy and what can we share and what can't we share. And we really...  were able to align the veterans that we work with who are homeless to agree to let us release their name to the city so we could rapidly rehouse veterans that faced homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2016,homeless,"I don't believe we'll ever be without individuals who are homeless, but the effort that this city is making, we will rapidly rehouse them. Thank you all. And again, thank you to [ORGANIZATION] and to you, Mayor."
02_20_2018,homeless,"You could put 80,000 people to work in [ORGANIZATION]. This would help lower your unemployment rate, your homeless rate, your poverty rate, and your crime rate because people would be working. This would help raise more revenue for [ORGANIZATION] so your budget would be balanced."
04_04_2016,housing crisis,"So I appreciate the question. The program is kind of a genesis from some of the issues that we've been facing in our community, from increasing property tax rate to the housing crisis to the foreclosure crisis that hit our community and still is lingering on. In a nutshell, the program is pretty simple."
04_06_2015,homelessness,My topic is homelessness people in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Here at the [ORGANIZATION] Rescue Mission. There are women's crisis centers.
04_06_2015,homeless,"Some don't even have family here in the area. And the [INSTITUTION] used for our warming center is only for [ORGANIZATION]. homeless people living under the bridges, sleeping, some sleeping in the churches that are being used for warming centers."
04_06_2015,homelessness,"You can call the individuals directly to let them know as well. And also just wanted to note that [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] we'll have our DATE2 ROCSTAT meeting.

03_02_2015,affordable housing,"I just wanted to also thank council members who were able to participate in [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing discussion.

We learned and discussed a lot of best practices, things that were happening around the country."
05_18_2015,homelessness,"And I think it's kind of fitting that on [TIME] when the [INSTITUTION] is being recognized for their excellent work, we also want to point out that they are one of our key partners in the work that we do through [ORGANIZATION]. And I'm going to ask [ORGANIZATION] to say a little bit about the work that we've done with the [INSTITUTION]. We've recently started initiatives that start at the federal level of [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] and DATE2 where we're going to work to eliminate homelessness in our midst."
06_05_2023,homeless,"This would help reduce the crime in [ORGANIZATION] and homeless and hungry. And if you use my system, if 16 million followers of [ORGANIZATION] get 35 cents a week for [ORGANIZATION], that would bring in $1,291,200 to help reduce poverty, homeless and hungry and crime at the same time. And consequently, put money in the poverty fund, and if the government would give the poor people back the $95 and $250."
06_05_2023,homeless,"They took from the snack. This would help reduce poverty, homeless, hunger and crime. In the book of [ORGANIZATION], third chapter, it says if a man can't take his own home, how can he take care of the church?"

04_17_2023,homelessness,"what I'm going to speak about [TIME] confronting the abandoned crisis. I live [ORGANIZATION] fighting poverty and homelessness. During my career, I have encountered veterans who once fought for our country, now defeated and some from PTSD, drug and alcohol addiction, and hopelessness and despair."
04_17_2023,homeless,"Like most people, I had no comprehension of the magnitude of the problem of homeless abandonment. until I saw men, women, and children, yes children, who live on the streets for [ORGANIZATION]. The decay of precious life had a life of its own and the ideal survivor had a shallow success rate."
04_17_2023,homeless,"Digest this for one moment. Abandoned citizens die homeless in the streets [ORGANIZATION], but it doesn't make the [TIME] news. Ever wonder why?"
04_17_2023,homeless,"7. Mental health for settlers. 8. [TIME] daycare service so women can go to work or school that the government paid for. Let's stop referring to our brothers and sisters, our children, and our veterans as the homeless."
04_17_2023,homelessness,"They are indeed the bandits. It's time for followers of [ORGANIZATION] to stand up and speak up about this garbage and say we're not going to put up with this garbage anymore. If 16 million followers of [ORGANIZATION] give 35 cents a week for [ORGANIZATION], that would bring in $291,600,000, enough money to help reduce homelessness and poverty and keep on doing this."
04_17_2023,homeless; homelessness,"It does not require a cost match, and it is from [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION].

05_20_2024,homeless,"In many parts of [ORGANIZATION], there are sometimes more job seekers than there are jobs paying $15 a month, leaving workers seeking better wages but few are my solution to solve this problem. Increase the minimum wage all over [ORGANIZATION]. This would lower the homeless rate, this would lower the poverty rate, this would lower the crime rate, it would increase the high school and college rate at the same time."
