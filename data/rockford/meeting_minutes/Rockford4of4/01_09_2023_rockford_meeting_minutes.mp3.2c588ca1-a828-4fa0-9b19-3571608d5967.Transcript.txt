Moving on to unfinished business, committee reports laid over. We don't have anything from the Planning and Development Committee. So move on to codes and regulations committee. We'll go to Alderman Bonney. Thank you, honorable Madam President Pro Tem. Codes and Regulation Committee has one item under unfinished business. Committee recommends approval of an amendment to the City of Rockford Code of Ordinances to allow hens at single-family homes in the City of Rockford. The legal director shall prepare the appropriate ordinance. This is laid over from December 19th, 2022, and I believe we are approving it as amended in committee? Correct. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Bonnie. We'll open discussion on this item alderwoman Hoffman Thank you. I'm really opposed to this whole ordinance But if it has a chance of passing Then I think we need to hold it over and look at it because I have been looking at some of the ordinances of the communities that don't seem to have a lot of problems and and they're much tougher than our ordinance. I looked at Naperville, and I believe our regulation is that we only have to be six feet from property line, 20 feet from a structure. In Naperville, they require 30 feet from buildings or property lines and must be 200 feet from any occupied residence other than the owners. Also, the property must have a barrier of six feet high on 75% of the property, meaning, of course, not in front of the house, but all the way around the yard so as to block the view from the neighbors so that they don't have to put up with the chickens in the chicken coop. Stronger rules concerning construction materials and some of the other suggestions. That were made by speaker Martin quirk I think we should take into consideration because once this goes out then it's hard to go back and use code if we didn't Make any regulation so we need to nail this down if we are going to go ahead with this Let me see. I had some other things on there too, but just one second. I Oh, I couldn't find it in our ordinance, but there should be no rolling coops. There are people on next door that are talking about the fact that when they get their chickens, they're going to get the coops that can roll around and move it around their yard, and that will be a nightmare for code. Okay. And let's see, also I don't know if it's in our ordinance, but we shouldn't have the chickens in homes. There are people that are saying that they're going to bring the chickens in the house and make them as pets. So I just think the ordinance needs a lot more work if there's any consideration of passing it. Alderman Rose? So our ordinance does address those things, but let's remember too that this is a pilot. And that the pilot is for one year, that if we do have issues moving forward, that they get addressed in the pilot. I've heard everything from supposed that they're going to attract coyotes and that those coyotes are going to go after little kids. I've heard that Noah's Ark is going to show up and all the animals, including alligators, are going to go after these chickens. I've heard, you know, tons of stuff. This is simply a pilot program. In fact, I... I'd just like to call the question because I think we've debated this for way too long. And so I'm calling the question to move this item forward. So call in question, you want to cut all conversation? We have to take a vote on that? Yes, there would need to be a vote on that. So clerk, will you please call the roll? So there's been a motion made to call the question that effectively would require, that requires a vote, but it would stop any further debate on the item. Okay. And we'll go right to a vote on that. One more vote after this, correct? Correct. We have no more discussion. There will be no more discussion. That's correct. So if you want to call the question, you need to take a vote. Well, we need a second on the motion to call the question and then a vote. Is there a second on that motion to call the question? Alderman, yep. So we have a second by Alderman Quinones. So now a vote on calling the question. Okay. Clerk, will you please call the roll on the call to question, please? Durkee. No. Logerman. Aye. Toonberg. No. No. Frost. No. Tarina. No. Prunty. Wilkins. No. Hoffman. No. Rose. No. Beach. No. Quinones. No. Meeks. No. McNeely. No. Bonnie. No. Five ayes, nine noes. So we'll continue discussion on this item. Does anyone have more discussion on this item? Alderman Frost. Thank you. I commend Alderman Rose for putting in a lot of time and trying this. It's been discussed now a couple of times, and it's... I do like the idea of a pilot program. I just had a concern about if and when the pilot program ends, grandfathering in individuals or residents that already have theirs. Because my concern is if it isn't a success and we want to, I don't want to say kill the chicken program, but not allow folks to have hens at their homes. It's probably based on some sort of issues that we have with the pilot People and so that's why I'm concerned About grandfathering in those that those 30 that have it and so that's my own. That's my concern Have some comment but just a point of clarification as far as the question that Alderman frost is raising if you look at the committee report and Think it was our some of our understanding that when we were amending it that we were amending it to include the dropping of that Or to to include that if the pilot program were to end after one year Nobody's grandfathered in but the committee report doesn't really say that No, I believe that the apps of the the motion was to allow folks who had um approved during the pilot period would be grandfathered in so long as the property ownership does not change hands or The permit is not otherwise revoked for non-compliance I believe that was the motion from Alderman Rose the amendment to the committee report. It's a previous council meeting Okay, so So there would be Somewhat to Alderman Frost concern then so if there were problems with some of these Assuming we even have 30 in the first year of a pilot program if they were serious enough infractions to be shut down Then they would they wouldn't be grandfathered in is that correct? Mr. Meyer correct the permits are not property rights and so if they're you know, they're I subject to compliance with our code of ordinances. So if we have issues with individual permit holders and they're violating our ordinance, they'd be subject to revocation. And certainly during the pilot program, we want to make sure this is successful. So I would imagine that we'll be pretty vigilant on those. Keep in mind also that the item is going to come back before council to for an extension Council this is an ordinance and a program passed by council if council changes its mind it next year when this comes up you could also alter the ordinance to revoke even the previously permitted locations as well So I think that's a valid concern and I think now that we've been refreshed on what the motion actually was, that that makes sense. I feel like the repackaging of this as a pilot program really is hard to, would be hard to say no to. I mean, to me it's really sort of a no harm, no foul situation now where at the end of a year, any of these op any op any of these operations that have been granted permits that haven't been have not followed the ordinance won't be around to be grandfathered in if we do decide not to continue it and if we do decide to continue it we can strengthen it as alderman hoffman is suggesting we could also i assume limit the number you know essentially create a second extended as a pilot program by just raising the cap to say 50. I feel like in the comments that I've received, both many from outside my ward and some from in, that they really unfortunately break down on generational lines and our older residents don't want anything to do with this and it's younger families who would like to, this is a lifestyle thing that they would like to give a try and again, I think as a pilot program, that makes, that, Makes sense. I mean we're not committed to it. It isn't a forever thing You know nothing really is because we could always repeal it as well but again, I think as a as a pilot it requires us to proactively assess it and come back to it and And affirm that it is operating. It's not a problem. It's not consuming all of our Code enforcement staff time I did have I did want to read I A note I received from a resident of my ward, Vince Tarara, who wanted to speak tonight but wasn't able to come to be here. He said he would, I would respectfully request to be permitted to keep chickens at my residence. There are many benefits of raising chickens, which include fresh eggs, especially during this difficult economy. Pest control, chickens are omnivores and are often used to replace harmful pesticides. Foul fertilizer one of the best sources of nitrogen to be used in our garden Please accept this letter as my request to keep and raise chickens at my residence located with in your ward And I guess you know lastly I am thinking about this You know, I tried to think about it some of the people who called from outside my ward are close longtime friends of mine who are opposed to it and And I thought about, you know, so if it were my own backyard, well, I've had pit bulls next door to me that have charged through my wooden fence on repeated occasions. I have dog walkers in Maplewood subdivision who have called about pit bulls menacing them while they're walking their dogs. Don't understand I would sooner see us ban pit bulls than not give Chickens a one-year chip the chicken project a one-year chance to hatch, you know, like we're like judging it we're like prejudging it as a failure before we even give it a try and You know in all seriousness, I think pit bulls are far greater threat to our way of our our peaceful existence in the neighborhood than chickens probably will be and so I support it as a pilot. Alderman McNeely. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had the opportunity to speak on this at least once and I'm glad that I'm able to speak tonight regarding it. I still think that for inner city that chickens are Regardless of whatever what other cities have it Would not be appropriate for a number of reasons. I know the alderman that put this forth Commented that there were he received several comments or heard several comments about different things happens When you have the chickens whether in the backyard or whatever and I did my research and found there are a number of cities like you said before that do have it but the participation is not that high and they do have various complaints they do sell i've seen on online people can buy chicken coops and put in the backyard supposed to be appropriate for the backyard however I still think that I didn't get the opportunity to talk to real estate association here. I still think that that affects the property value. I think right now is not the time to introduce something that's going to curtail the amount of real estate sales within the city. So I hope the alderman is pleased that you at least get a... TIME PERIOD IN WHICH TO TRY THIS OUT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF AT THE UNIVERSITY IF THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING OR NOT. I KNOW THAT IT'S BEING PUSHED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND IF THIS IS PART OF A PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY, MAYBE THE UNIVERSITY CAN HELP US WITH THIS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM. THANK YOU. Thank you. Alderman Quinones. Yes, I just want to say a few things here. I want to thank Alderman Rose for bringing this ordinance up. We could have tried it for one year to see how it works. As a matter of fact, I was looking forward to get all 30 permits in my ward, but I want to thank them again. Any further discussion on this item? Alderman Durkee. I haven't spoken on this publicly before, so I didn't get a chance to speak. Reason I would be in opposition of this is in this sort of is suggested by alderman Hoffman's Notation of the Naperville ordinance people buy a property that's designated are one they buy it with certain expectations that would go on in that property and use of that property and we have a lot of city lots and a lot a lot of congestion a lot of close houses and I'm disinclined to believe that most people who would move in would favor moving in next door to an existing Chicken coop, especially when the lots are rather small So because of that I think people we offer certain expectations when people want to buy and use property especially our one in Rockford, we're already seeing that erosion with group housing and scattered throughout the city and I'm disinclined to continue that I probably would be favorable to a lot to voting and for an ordinance that allows a certain square footage or acreage of a lot but consider but this particular ordinance I can't support for that reason any other discussions I know further discussion clerk we please call the roll turkey no logan Toberg frost Tarina I Prunty Wilkins Hoffman Rose Beach Quinones Meeks McNeely Bonnie five eyes nine nose Item does not pass We'll be going to finance a personal finance a personnel committee not have any items. So we'll go to officers reports Have any officers reports? Other women meets. Thank you so much really quick.

I had the I pleasure of going to this business and I really think that this is really what it's all about with video gaming to get those businesses that are trying to grow and expand and that is exactly what this owner is doing so I thank everyone for the support thus far that is all other woman Hoffman Thank You chairman I just want to announce that tomorrow night, Rolling Green will be hosting a neighborhood meeting. We will have someone from Alignment Rockford to talk about early childhood. HOOD DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL HAVE SOMEONE FROM OUR WATER COMPANY AND WE WILL HAVE SOMEONE SPEAKING ABOUT THE PROCESS OF CODE.
