 Director Myers, you had a statement. A couple of things. The first is we have a number of items up for approval. Just want to let everybody know that there will be some lag between approval tonight and then our ability through finance and legal to logistically be able to get these prepared. So it'll take about three to five days to have the licenses prepared, assuming all 40 some are approved tonight. That'll be about, so by the end of the week as they
 come available we'll make sure to reach out to everyone individually let them know that they can pick those up we will be ready tomorrow though in the morning for folks to come and pay their their uh their fees um so we can start the process of preparing those liquor licenses
