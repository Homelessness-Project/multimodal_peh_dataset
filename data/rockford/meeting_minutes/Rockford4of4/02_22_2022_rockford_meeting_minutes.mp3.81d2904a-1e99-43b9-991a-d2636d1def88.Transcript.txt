 You did? Yeah. Awesome. All right. Do I have to say it in an Irish accent or something? Yeah. Whereas, the Irish Marching Society of Rockford is strictly a not-for-profit organization chartered in 1976 and was established to preserve and promote Irish heritage within our community. And whereas, the Irish Marching Society continues to preserve, promote, and educate Irish and Celtic culture in the greater Rockford community.
 And whereas, Irish Marching Society's 46th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade will be held on Saturday, March 12, 2022 at 3 p.m., beginning on 7th Street and 5th Avenue and ending at the Prairie Street Brewhouse at 200 Prairie Street. The Paddy Fest will be held at the Brewhouse following the parade from 4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. Good luck getting them out at 7.30 p.m.
 Now, therefore, I, Thomas P. McNamara, as mayor of the city of Rockford, do hereby proclaim the week of March 6, 2022, to be Irish Marching Society Week. Would you like to share a few words with us? I would. I would. Don't give the Irishman the mic. That's the thing. Well, as you know, um...
 The Irish have a deep, you know, the story of the Irish people is mirrored with many other stories that are like that from many other cultures that have come to this country to make something of themselves and to make our land a great melting pot. But in that melting pot, we want to keep the flavors distinct.
 and salient so that it's really, you know, it enriches all our lives. And that's what the Irish are trying to do, remembering our heritage. We want to share that with everyone. And we ask everyone to come out in March. You know, all families are welcome. All nationalities are welcome. Everyone is welcome to come in March in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. It's the kickoff.
 to all the parades this year. It's the kickoff to spring. It means so much to so many people, this celebration. And as the COVID starts to lift, we really just want to say this is just our opportunity to really shout and show some green and decorate the cars and come on out and have a great time. This year, we do plan to do Operation Emerald Wind. I'm sorry, Emerald Water.
 Right, Emerald Wind is the band that's playing, sorry. Okay. Emerald Water, and we're going to try to put that green color to the river. It'll be a show, so come on about 5, 515-ish, you'll be standing on the bridge, on the State Street Bridge, and you'll see it all pass by. So we can't dam our river forever like Chicago, but anyway. But we're going to do it. Also the Irish are dedicating this parade.
 Tom's father and and our mayor John McNamara, so come on out Just appreciate all the work that you guys do all throughout the year 46 years of this parade is really amazing and a ton of Work, so thank you Fantastic thank you
 For a second I got really nervous. I thought he was going to ask me to dance. All right. All right. We're going to move on quickly. We'll go to petitions and communications. And I believe we do have petitions and finance and personnel. Alderman Frost. Yes, Your Honor, we do.
 First, the Community and Economic Development Department is seeking City Council approval for a memorandum of understanding for existing Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund RLF grant monies and pending Brownfields RLF grant supplemental funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. And then, Your Honor, we'd like to refer the...
 above reference items to the february 28 2022 finance of personnel committee for consideration of acceptance of an application an award of the us epa brownfields revolving loan fund supplemental funding the grand award if accepted and will provide funds that can be loaned to private and public entities to perform eligible environmental cleanup work on impacted brownfield sites uh your honor i think that was actually a memorandum um
 from Robert Willamy regarding the acceptance of the application and award for the US EPA Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund grant supplemental funding, which will also be referred to the Finance and Personnel Committee. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you. Thank you. So next up we'll have public speakers. We want to remind our public speakers that you have three minutes to address a council.
 You will hear this obnoxious cell phone ring, and that would be to close up your comments. Our first public speaker this evening is Mr. John Tack Brantley. Good evening, Mayor McNamara, all the residents and our citizens of Rockville, Illinois, that's watching us tonight.
 The day I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I should fear no evil for you thy Lord is with me. Your rod and your staff that comfort me. You pare a table before me in the presence of my enemy. You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflow. Surely gracious and love will follow me. All the days of my life I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. In 1955, Rosie Parker refused to give her seat on the bus which started the Civil Rights Movement.
 Mr. Wilson, um, Carl G. Wilson, um, uh, wound up getting back history month from a week to being a whole month. Ronald Reagan was so jealous of the other president's birthday in the month of February that he had changed to where all the president's birthday is in the month of February. Those that stick out the most is, um, Lincoln, um,
 George Washington and Ronald Reagan and also we actually mentioned this
 Ulysses Grant because he's from Illinois. This month, Black History Month, we are going, we did a quiz boat at the UAW Sports Factory, which turned out to be very interesting, teaching our kids our history. What's blowing me here in Rockford is that in Chicago, from the third grade all the way through high school, we learned our history all year round.
 Only two schools here in Rockford even practice teaching our kids our history through all the grade levels all year round. That's Jackson Childhood School and Pastor, I mean, Minister Henry Kiki, what's the April, what is it called, Kiki?
 Keekeburg School is the only two schools. On this Thursday, we're taking two school buses that we were blessed with. The kids get credit towards their school grade. We're going to the Underground Railroad on my birthday. Mind you, my birthday is February 24th during Black History Month.
 So I was born doing Black History Month, so I have a deep passion. And like my mom told me when I was shot five times back in the 70s and I survived and three other people passed away, she said the Lord got something here that he got something for you to do.
 and I found what my calling was, is right here in Rockford. This here is Sunday, Saturday, Patrick, the coordinator for the Midwest Village Museum has invited us to come out
 to the Midwest Village Museum to check out the artifacts for Black History Month. That's very interesting. But what I've also noticed is that the Discovery Center had an event for Black History Month, but they charged $10 to get in for Black History Month. Also wanna mention the fact that we have set- Thank you, Mr. Bray. Our next public speaker is Reverend Earl Dotson, Sr.

Yeah, just a reminder, tomorrow is the last day to submit letters to the State Board.
 for recommendations on the closing of services to Mercy Health on Rockton. And just encouraging Rockford citizens to send those letters to the state. I believe there's been a few posts online on the city website. But I think it's just absolutely...
 the most probably disgusting and gross misconduct of a hospital system to, um, pick on an area that needs so much services and, um, just continue to break those promises to the community. And, um, they said that they were going to stay for 10 years. Um, it's been six. Um, they said they were going to invest millions of dollars into that facility. They haven't. And, um,
 I encourage people to write letters, although I think it's something that will need a miracle to change. However, I think that everyone should have a say in this and let it be known at the state level that these kind of things should not be happening, especially to low income areas and especially to areas that need healthcare in them.
 thank you alderman rose any other uh reports alderman canones yes i'd like to thank uh me and the navy club would like to thank todd cagnoli and alderman logoman for attending her meeting on her upcoming anniversary this summer thank you and just clarifying uh uh meeting tomorrow about auburn street corridor that's 10 a.m to noon is that right okay wonderful any other officers okay

I place these eight items before you. Thank you. So we have eight items before us. Is there any discussion on those items? Alderman Beach. Alderman Beach.
 Your Honor, thank you. Just a question here. Several of these reports have annual price adjustments for CPI. What happens if that number goes down from what it is today? Thank you. Does this go in reverse? I mean, if we pay more, if it goes up, should we not pay less if it goes down?
 CPI adjustments and contracts are limited on an annual basis to only what CPI increased for the year. So, let's say CPI was 2%, a vendor could request up to a 2% price increase going into the next year of the contract.
 Obviously, we've had situations where we've had negative CPI, thankfully not all that often, but in that event, we did not reduce the contract rates based on CPI. It is a limiter only on the amount of the increase that we'll allow. So do I understand if it's a negative, it stays the way it is? Yes. Okay. Thank you.
