Good evening. We will call to order the City of Radford Special City Council meeting held on Monday, June 26, 2023. Clerk, could you please call the roll? Logerman. Toomer. Here. Frost. Here. Tarina. Prenti. Wilkins. Here. Hoffman. Rose. Present. Beach. Here. Ferrios. Here. Meeks. Bonnie. Here. 12 present. Excellent. So we have... Item number two is appointments laid over the first one is for Mary Cassiopeia its Community Action Agency board This has not come up until July 5th. Obviously, we don't meet until July 10th So if someone wanted to do that, we would have to suspend the rules on that item second item is up for your Discussion and appointment and that is appointment of Jeff Bailey as a 13th Ward alderman to fill the vacancy left behind by alderwoman Linda McNeely the term of this appointment will run until the next Municipal election that appointment is up for passage. Is there any discussion on that item alderman Logan? Thank you mayor I'd move for a simple layover for item number two until the next council meeting We have a motion we have a second to lay over a This appointment is there a discussion other woman Wilkins. Thank you your honor I would just like to know the reasoning for the layover alderman Logan. Thank you. Just more time to review Thank you all the woman Torino. Oh, thank you your honor I Think that we've had a month to review this feels political to me. I don't think we have any reason to hold it over For any reason honestly, we've all known who the choices were I know earlier first of all, let me say this I I'm grateful to all the individuals that were put forward. I appreciated the resumes, I read all of them. I do feel it was a fair process. Know that we're sort of hearing that it wasn't but many individuals were considered many were interviewed by the mayor Many spoke to all the aldermen. It was a very fair process to get it down to Jeff Bailey So I just want to say that and I want to say thank you to all the individuals that do hard work in this community that did want to step into the shoes of McNeely to fulfill the role of that ward, but I I think we've had plenty of time to consider this candidate to consider any candidate so to be laying it over right now is It's political and I'm just gonna say it. Thank you. Thank you and other woman Wilkins. I cut you off. I'm sorry if I did I was just gonna ask him a follow-up because he stated he wanted to review what what are you reviewing? I JUST WANT TO REVIEW CREDENTIALS. THERE'S BEEN MANY DIFFERENT APPLICANTS FOR THE POSITION. I'D LIKE ONE WEEK TO REVIEW. THANK YOU. FIRST, ALDERWOMAN WILKINSON, DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? I HATE TO CUT YOU OFF AGAIN. YOU'RE DONE. ALDERWOMAN PRUNTI, DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED? YES, I DID. I do appreciate everyone who has applied. I think that one of the concerns that we had was that the 13th Ward did not have representation, and we were laying over the... Avon project in part because there was no Representation I think that tonight we have an opportunity to address that and so to lay it over It just seems like we're putting other things including the Avon Street project Behind and I knew that that I know that they had a deadline. So I think that we should um Not lay it over. I think that we should move forward the 13th Ward deserves representation as well as We have a project that we said we laid that project over because we were looking to have representation For the 13th Ward Other discussion Meeks and then Ben I'm very shocked because I Very similar to what April just said We have been holding off projects because of this seat not being filled and we have known of the candidates that were presented and There is no excuse for not voting on this tonight My question is if this does this need just the two or do we all need needs a simple majority I simple majority and then is there going to be a delay for some of the projects that we've held off on because of the one week delay that to aldermen need to make a decision that we've known for a month about I can't answer that question it seems like there's multiple standards for that but I don't know that thank you Alderman Bonnie sure um Procedural question. I thought a motion to lay over to the next meeting was non-debatable. It is it is by rule for Committee reports only this is not a committee report. It's an appointment and if approved tonight when would the candidate be actually sworn in. We follow the same process that we have for the last three that we've done from Alderwoman Ginger Hanley, who replaced Alderman Beck, to Alderman Gasparini, that replaced Alderman Mogaman when he did his tour of service, to Alderman Barrio. So we would approve this evening, which we've always done since I've been mayor, and then the next council meeting they'd be sworn in. So that would be July 10th unless the special council meeting is called between now and then Okay, are there any plans to call a special council meeting between now and then I do not have any plans to call a special Council me. Thank you any other discussion on the item before us. So we have one item unless you want to make it to But we have one item before us clerk. Would you please call the roll? This is a motion to lay over No, Alderman Tuber, sorry. Thanks. I just wanted to be clear. So there is a motion on the floor for a layover. If it fails, then we will be voting on the candidate tonight. Yes. Correct. Yes. Thank you. Any other discussion? Clerk, could you please call the roll? Logeman. Aye. Tuber. Aye. Frost. Tarina.

THANK YOU, ALDERMAN FROST. COUNSEL, WE GOT TWO ITEMS BEFORE US. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ON THOSE TWO ITEMS? ALDERWOMAN MEKS. I JUST HAVE A REALLY QUICK GENERAL QUESTION. WHEN THESE COMPANIES PUT THEIR BIDS FORWARD, IS THIS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OR PRIVATE? Director Haggard. Bid opening is a public, anyone is welcome to come to a bid opening. That for a bid the prices are read at the opening. So as long as the any other qualifying requirements are met so if they don't have EEO forms or acknowledge bid addenda something of that nature the bid is disqualified and would not be read. Thank you so much. You're welcome. We also post our bid tabulations on the city's website after the opening Awesome. Thank you so much any other discussion on those two items seeing no discussion clerk. Will you please call the roll Logan? tumor frost Terina fronty Wilkins Hoffman Rose Beach adios meeks Bonnie.
