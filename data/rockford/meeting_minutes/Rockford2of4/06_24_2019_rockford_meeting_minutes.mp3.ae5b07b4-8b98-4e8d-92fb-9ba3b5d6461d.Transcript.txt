 alderman thompson kelly thank you your honor i'll make this quick because it's late i have received some phone calls in regards to animal services with dead animals in the streets and stray dogs uh the where my couple of my constituents has told me they've called animal services and they told them that they're not picking up dead animals and they're not doing service calls um and i know we're not paying them
 I've also received a couple phone calls from some county board members wanting to know what we're doing as far as animal services in the community. I did speak with Todd in regards to where we are with coming up with a contract for animal services and they're working on it. I just want to bring it to your attention that we need to do something quick.
 It is summertime. We are having a lot of strays. We are having dead animals in the streets. And we don't want our residents calling and they're being told that they're not going to get any services. Yeah, so do you mind if I respond a little bit to you? Please do. So obviously anyone who's driving around our streets understands the concern that you bring forward regarding animal control. I would say we are working on an agreement. I just also, out of curiosity,
 I would say we also have a number of things going on, such as the Board of Elections, and I think we shouldn't just look at these items in silos. I think we should look at them collectively. When they owe us potentially $6 million from the Board of Elections,
 There's other avenues to make sure that I understand that they don't simply have a checkbook that they can cut us a $6 million check. There's other ways that we can make this right to all the taxpayers. Secondly, I did communicate with the chairman over the weekend or last Thursday it was, Thursday or Friday I should say, regarding animal control issues.
 There was a memo, my understanding, that came out from the head of Winnebago County Animal Services to the chairman and to the county board stating that they will no longer pick up dead wildlife and no longer pick up dogs, or they'll only pick up dogs and cats, I believe, as dead animals, I believe.
 To my knowledge, we were not made aware of that prior to that memo coming out. And in that memo, it pretty much says that Winnebago County Animal Service is picking up the deceased animals was about 10% of their phone calls, about 1,000 to 1,200 phone calls. And so it seems to me that they just push those back onto the cities, not just the city of Rockford, but all the cities and villages without a lot of notice. Okay.
 We'll continue to monitor it. It's obviously a deep concern. Thank you 30 people of the 30 27 have made arrangements. They're just going through the paperwork So we'll be down to three people those 27 Should be moved out by the 27th of
 June and as far as the three people that will be left We have approached HUD and we've asked if we could put them temporarily in Rockford housing until they can they do not want to stay with Rockford housing They want vouchers so we've asked if we can move them until they find some place to go but very shortly
 We should have everybody moved out of Brewington Oaks. Thank you Alderman Hoffman. Alderman Irvins? Yeah. I just had a question in regards to the animal removal. What would be the recommendation for a constituent if they had a dead deer in their backyard? So I would say at this point unfortunately they'd have to call our Public Works Department, you know?
 Mr. Cagnone? I believe the question was related to private properties. Oh, in your yard? Well, I meanâ€” That would be on the resident. I'm sorry. I thought you said in the street. Okay. In the street, it would be our Public Works Department. Getting in contact with Public Works? Yeah. Okay. Any other officers report? Seeing none, we'll continue to move forward. We have motions and resolutions.
