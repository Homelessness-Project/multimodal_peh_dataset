We'll then move to public speakers. Just so our public speakers are aware, you will have three minutes. When you hear the buzzer, you will be asked to stop speaking after those three minutes.
 Okay.
 Our first public speaker is John Tack Brantley. Good evening, Nightshake. Good evening to all the persons that are citizens of Rockford, but most of all, the people that are watching us today. I want to take this time out to thank all the individuals that called in Rockford Housing Authority about my van getting towed and getting on housing authority case. Housing authority rectified that situation. But I'm also speaking on, we're forming a coalition. This coalition is going to consist of me and Tommy Ninks. The reason why we formed this coalition is last week my son was arrested driving by being black. They was at a funeral on a Wednesday, and while they was at that funeral the police was there. The police followed them to the graveyard. When they left the graveyard, instead of him pulling over, he ran from the police. And then when they called him, they said he had a gun on him. He didn't have a gun, but yet they posted on the internet that he had a gun. I was in court from 1.30 to 4 o'clock listening to the different cases and listening to the state's attorney. Our coalition, the reason why we formed this coalition, is to have this weekend another youth had got shot. So instead of sitting by waiting for the Peace and Justice Center or waiting for these fly-by-night organizations to stop the violence that's going on in the streets, we're going to form this coalition with these common names. We're also getting, um, Gina Meeks, the Alderman Person there, we got three different churches that's going to be a part of this coalition. We even got a security firm that's going to be security for us there. What we're going to do, we're going to gather up all these youth that's in this one clique, meet with them. After we meet with this clique, we're going to meet with the adversary of the clique who they're going up against. And we're not just meeting to be meeting. We're meeting to come up with a resolution. And like I always say, unless you walk a mile in our shoe, you don't know what we've been through. The people that are in our coalition, if you don't have a doctorate or a Ph.D. in these streets, you're just an educated fool. And they are not going to listen to no bourgeoisie decepticon that got on the shirt and tie and talking proper. No. But they will listen to Brother John. They will listen to Tommy Neese. We've got people that's going to be on our coalition that the people that they â€“ All the parents I've talked to is overwhelmed and enthused about us doing this. It's sad when the parents tell me they have to keep their kid in the house because their kid is afraid to go outside because they're not only afraid of the clique they're going up against, but they're also afraid because they've got a zero on their back with the 5-0. I'm also asking Colin Reed, the chief of police, that our coalition want to seriously have a meet with their gang unit. And when we meet with their gang unit, we're not just meeting to be meeting. We need to talk about a resolution. Those youth, stop it. Those youth that don't want to cooperate, those youth that don't want to put their guns away, then I'm with 5-0 about putting them away. We are going to bring a ceasefire. I haven't done this since 1970. I'm the last of the original Nandinka warriors in the bandage of the Black Panther Party. And we are going to bring a ceasefire here to this community. Thank you for allowing me to speak. Thank you. Our next speaker is Carrie Phipps. Hello, I am Carrie Phipps. I brought a petition with over 1,000 signatures from the community for financial transparency and stricter code enforcement from Carly Rice, from Ms. Carly's. We are asking for the immediate closure of Ms. Carly's. First and foremost, she is operating illegally with no permit and doing it flagrantly. She is showing no respect for the law, city, or citizens. She hasn't followed the SUP given generously to her since the day it was granted. It was never enforced, so she feels emboldened to do whatever she wants. This is showing other organizations that permits don't matter and won't be enforced. Ms. Carley's is not a registered nonprofit, which she continues to lie about. They are under investigation by the Attorney General and told not to solicit. However, she continues to almost daily with no consequences. Ms. Carly has not been transparent with the millions of dollars she has raised. Taxes have been misrepresented. No reconciliation of expenses and no audit in any year done. There are no social workers, counselors, or licensed professionals employed and on-site. Ms. Carley doesn't work with other organizations and degrades them. She thinks she's the only place that can help, which is dangerous. Poverty porn is something this organization does constantly. In one instance, she filmed a long-time volunteer having a seizure on the ground in front of his coworkers, some crying, and she posted it on Facebook. They show pictures of very vulnerable people and children, all for clicks on social media and money donations. It's disgusting and wrong to exploit these people. Thank you. Our next speaker is Beth Hoer. Thank you. It's Hoyer, but it looks like you are, so that's okay. I'm used to that. Hi. Thank you for allowing me to be here, and thank you for all that you do for our city. As I stand here before, it's great news. I'm going to brag about one of my students. I'm a teacher of 44 years. I'm a music director and currently at Auburn High School in the CAPA program. There's a young man named DeAndre Hemby. We call him Dre. He's the drummer in Teddy Swim's band. And if you all are, you probably have heard his main song, The Lose Control, which is the number one chart on Billboard. She was my student in 2013. This is our daughter by choice, Hannah Haven, who is going to read a note written from his mother who is in Atlanta so could not be here tonight. She'll be here obviously for the performance. They're coming to Hard Rock September 20th. My request, I'm going to put out a proclamation, but I'm requesting if there's any other a way that you can advise me or help me make a celebration for Dre when he comes to town. It's his choice. They were set to go to Pittsburgh along with Aerosmith. As we know, or if you're following music at all, Steve Tyler had a problem with his voice. He's done. So Dre stepped in and said, I want to go home. Let me bring back to Rockford. This is a young man as he is climbing that stairway to stardom, he never, I have numerous interviews that he always states, I'm from Rockford, Illinois. Love the town. Started to play there. And then he went to Atlanta. He played with gospel groups. He played wherever he could, and here he arrived with this band who is now 70th in the world. They just came back from their second world tour, and now they're touring across the United States. And Dre said, I'm going to come home. So if there's something we can do just to say thank you to this young man. We've had Fred VanVleet, and he's acknowledged this guy works just as hard, and he's done it. So thank you. Hannah's going to just mention. Hello again. DeAndre was my classmate in Auburn High School 2013. I'm here to speak on Delia, his mother's behalf. She said to the members of Rockford City Council, thank you so much for your consideration in this proclamation of DeAndre Hemby. DeAndre was gifted to grow up in Rockford and attend Auburn School. DeAndre's musical ability was discovered at a very early age and as his mother I would get multiple calls from his teachers at Westview and Barber schools Letting me know that he broke all the pencils as he used them to play drums on his desk His music teachers at Auburn High School helped develop his skills even more. Thank you to miss Beth Hoyer for supporting DeAndre's gift. I Rockford will always be home for DeAndre, and when he tours the world, people ask him where he's from. He does not say Chicago. He says with pride, I am from Rockford, Illinois. I'm so glad Teddy Swims is coming to the Hard Rock Casino because it gives DeAndre the opportunity to bring it home. Thank you again for your consideration. Thank you. Our next speaker is Dale Costello. Is Dale present? Okay. So we will go to our next speaker, which is Prophet Youssef. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. In the book of Proverbs, the 19th chapter, the 21st, it says, Listen to advice and accept an instruction, and in the end you will be wise. What I want to speak about tonight, why veterans commit suicide. There are 15 reasons, and I have the solution to solve this problem in the United States. The first cause is hopelessness. The second cause is despair. Hopelessness and despair is the mother of suicide. The third cause is relationship problems. The fourth cause is drug addiction. The fifth cause is alcohol addiction. The sixth cause is mental illness. The seventh cause is unemployment. The eighth cause is financial problems. The ninth cause is homelessness. The tenth cause is health problems. The eleventh cause is poverty. The twelfth cause is legal trouble. The thirteenth cause is sleep deprivation. The fourteenth cause is battery. We have too many deployments in a combat zone. The 15 calls veterans who have guns in their home that are loaded and not put in a safe. A 2010 study of the Israelites Defense Force found that suicide dropped by 50%. When in 2006, troops were banned from the then common practice of bringing their rifles home at the end of the day. And more than 60% of United States veterans commit suicide at home with a personally owned firearm. Veterans experience a mental health crisis. I want you to call the Veterans Crisis Line. It's open 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 1-800-273-8255 and select option one for a veteran staff. I was in the Navy 19 years, 11 months, 29 days, 1 hour, 10 minutes, 15 seconds. I did three tours in that hell hole. in Vietnam. I want to, I didn't want to tell my great niece who retired from the Air Force with 20 years of service, Donna and Benita Hervey and my good friend Mayor Morrissey this for a long time. And I'm gonna get it off my chest tonight. I don't like you, I love you, and you can't do nothing about it. And happy birthday, my good friend. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to my good friends, happy birthday to you. Thank you for allowing me to speak. That was under time, good job.

Like, I can't not say anything about it because they just there was there was an exceptional week last week for our city and just these grand openings and celebrations. And I drove past today. It was a full parking lot midday. Just I just wanted to congratulate Gino. Thank you. and every single person on their team that was like a tremendous, Dan Fisher, from Dan Fisher, Gino, all these individuals that have just put, Rick Niels, I keep naming people that come to my head, but there's so many people involved in the creation from legislators to investors, city council, everyone involved in making this. casino what it is. It's really exciting. It's just the residents are so happy. People are just excited that there's something to do, something new, something fresh. And it really offers a lot of variety from art and memorabilia to if you wanna have some cocktails, a good dinner, gamble, entertainment. I mean it really offers something for everybody. So I'm just so excited about that. So I just wanted to acknowledge everyone and their exceptional work to make that, to bring a world class facility to Rockford is really amazing. So congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go to Alderman Wilkins and then we'll go to Alderman Bailey. Thank you, Your Honor. On August 24th, the third annual back-to-school bash was held along Kent Street, and I'd just like to personally thank everyone that attended, everyone that had anything to do with the planning. It was a great turnout. We did exactly what we intended to do, which was provide the community with resources and supplies that were needed. So I just wanted to say a big shout-out to the community and everyone that made the event possible. It was great. Thank you. Thank you Alderman Bailey. Yeah, I want to thank the Department of Public Works for cleaning up an area where Park Fest was held this Sunday it was a great event had over 2,000 people and I Wish we see more of these events on the west side in our community. Thank you. Thank you Alderwoman Prenti. Are you ready? Okay I did want a second Alderwoman Torrinas Mention of the hard rock. I think it's really important to note that Not many cities our size actually have a hard rock I in fact, maybe a handful. I don't know. I don't know that number but I Like she said, I think there's a little bit of something there for everyone. If you're interested in historic memorabilia, it's like a little miniature museum. If you're interested in entertainment, you know music especially they probably have something there for you if if they don't i would recommend you contacting them they probably will look at that um there's also um the work that they do and it was really interesting to see in the presentation last week from the seminal tribe the community giving that Hard Rock does. And so I would encourage stakeholders in our community if they are in need to reach out to them, they are very much minded in giving back. And I think that one of the key ways that they are giving back is through that Rockford Promise Scholarship that we have here in our great city and one of the examples of how to fund education here in a city like ours. It's just such an amazing thing. It was great to be a part of last week with the governor and the mayor and the county board members and aldermen there. And it's just, I think, also a testament of what happens when government works together And what can happen there with that? So I think alderwoman Meeks had an item to mention. Thank you I agree with you both a hundred percent. I just I kind of have a comment or a question That I hope someone can answer after this is all done. I don't understand Why we are continuing to vote no for developments such as residential developments I do understand that There was a housing study that made it very clear in the city of rockford that we need an excessive amount of housing And it just feels like we keep presenting opportunities to bring housing to the community and it keeps getting rejected So I just don't quite understand what the meaning of Originally the Zoning Board of Appeals recommendation for denial for us to reverse it and then ultimately deny it again So I'm just I'm just confused and I hope that someone who's on the opposing side can share some details that I must have Not paid attention to or noticed prior. Thank you so much any other officers reports All right, seeing none. Well, we'll move forward with most motions and resolutions under planning and development committee. I I HAVE TWO ITEMS. ITEM ONE, COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS APPROVAL AND AUTHORIZATION FOR THE APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE IF AWARDED OF THE FLOOD HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM GRANT BY THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THE APPLICATION SEEKS FUNDS TO PURCHASE SIX PROPERTIES IN THE KEITH CREE CORRIDOR. THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE 18 MONTHS AT A COST OF $1,590,000. and $179. The application seeks 100% grant reimbursement. Item 2, committee recommends approval and authorization for the application and acceptance, if awarded, of the 2024 USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forestry Grant in the amount of up to $500,000. The grant provides funding assistance to improve urban forests within disadvantaged areas of communities. The funding source is the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service allocation from the Inflation Reduction Act administered by the Morton Arbitorium. The grant comes as a $0 cost match with a grant term expiration of approximately three years from the date of award. Thank you for reading in those two items. Are there any questions on those? Alderman Beach. Thank you, Your Honor. On number one, when we divide six into that million five, It's about two hundred and some thousand dollars each. Is that what we're purchasing the properties for or are there acquisition costs? Connected with that or is there something else that goes along with that money? Yeah, yeah, that's that's all in so it would be acquisition and then the cost of demolishing and restoring that property to Grass or whatever we would restore it to and any relocation costs that would be be if any there's residents living in that building okay well i appreciate that the committee reported says to purchase sex properties and so i guess that's all wrapped up into it then right yeah this is very similar uh the same program we did with the strip mall along charles street 23 23 thank you very much any other questions on items one and two seeing none clerk turkey all right Logan in timber Tarina I front II all right Wilkins are rose Beach Barrios all right Meeks.
