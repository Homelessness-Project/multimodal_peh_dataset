The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"do you have any concrete evidence of people being “shipped” en masse from [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON] (anecdotally talking to people in related organizations doesn’t count)? that is an extraordinary claim. some people might be moving to/encouraged to move to [PERSON] under the promise of increased job opportunities & social safety nets, but [PERSON]’s population is steadily decreasing and you just seem to be fear mongering.",6
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"Be careful you are not endorsing enabling.  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] actually help people get shelter and make people accountable.  The result of handing out tents, blankets, clothing, and food on the go is incremental dumping in already stressed neighborhoods. I pulled five contractor bags of bedding off the porch of an abandoned house behind my home [ORGANIZATION] (the city does not provide this clean up).  It is sad that people are sleeping outside, but I got to ask why are they rejecting the shelter and other 

Miss ORG2's is a grift that projects a very inaccurate picture of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. They claim to just hand out stuff until people are ready, which is enabling those who don't want to be accountable and have resisted the many services in [ORGANIZATION] so they can continue the [STREET] lifestyle.  Not to mention their exploitative social media posts that pay for their personal living expenses, building code fines, and lawyers because they chose to live at the shelter rather than using one of the many vacant buildings in the city.",2
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"I would agree with this but for one thing.  ""The role of citizens in ending homelessness **in their own communities**..."" 

It's easy to say we want to end homelessness, and if we just had the [ORGANIZATION] homeless population to deal with then we'd be fine.  This GPE2 has an [ORGANIZATION] homelessness response.  Literally hundreds of thousands of state and federal grant dollars a year to combat homelessness.  But we keep getting busses of ""problem"" homeless people shipped to us from other cities (looking at you, [PERSON]).  If it were just [ORGANIZATION] citizens battling homelessness, the problem would be solved already.  

This is actually the main reason I am opposed to a [PERSON]-[ORGANIZATION] train rail.  This isn't speculation, we KNOW this is happening.  Talk to one of the GPE2's [ORGANIZATION] people that respond to homeless complaints, they can verify.  And while it would be nice to hop on a train to [PERSON] for a bag of [ORGANIZATION]'s popcorn, we would be flooded with the homeless from every municipality that's on that line.  [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], every city and village on the ORG2 line (the logical one to extend) would say ""Good luck with that guy, [ORGANIZATION]"" and consider their jobs done.",2
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"The [ORGANIZATION] did a good investigation about the practice DATE0. Based on the map legend, [ORGANIZATION] receives about .1% of the bussed homeless in the [PERSON]. [PERSON]

Ideally the practice sends homeless closer to family who can help them, but it's not perfect. The [ORGANIZATION] study also didn't track unofficial bussing which is what [ORGANIZATION] has historically been accused of. (The study was based on [ORGANIZATION] requests of data kept by the originating cities.)",5
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"Eh, the railway thing seems misguided. To oppose something so beneficial because homeless people would use it is... Well... Dumb. 

You already say busloads of homeless people are sent to [ORGANIZATION]. If that's the case, a train isn't inherently going to make it worse, just more efficient.",12

The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"I think you are misinformed on the train thing. The project will only go through [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and GPE2. Also,  it's a little ridiculous to ""oppose"" 300 million in investment that has already been secured.",3
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"Even if there is homeless people coming to [ORGANIZATION], so what? Theyre people, they need shelter too. If you say you want to end homelessness but ONLY in your area, thats not ending homelessness, thats just making it so YOU dont have to see homeless people. If we have enough money and grants we should be opening our shelters to others and acting as a haven",3
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"thank you so much for sharing! is there any evidence of this occurring post-covid after a lot of long-distance bus travel was scaled back? i agree that [ORGANIZATION] is already operating on such limited funding for social welfare programs, but i think the total number of houseless  people bussed into [ORGANIZATION]  is too small to justify opposing new public transportation infrastructure that would create new jobs and benefit thousands. i know that’s not your concern that you presented, just replying to the above commenter",3
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"I'm curious to know how you define ""efficiency"" in this context without including ""moving more people"".  

I also take a bit of an issue with your depiction of my concern being homeless people ""using"" the train.  I don't have an issue with that.  I have an issue with cities who are given MILLIONS of dollars to combat their homeless problems deciding that the appropriate [STREET] to use that money is by buying bus tickets to other places.",2
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"Because they don't have as good of a homeless program as [ORGANIZATION] does.  [ORGANIZATION] was recognized [ORGANIZATION] as having ""functionally 0 homeless"" and instead of asking us about our processes, other cities just said ""Great, let's send homeless people there.""",6
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"We don't have the money, space or workers to become much of a haven. I don't think the train will cause a problem, but cities need to work together so each of them is taking care of their own people and only moving them when it makes more sense (like when someone in [ORGANIZATION] has family in [PERSON].)

My experience has been that [PERSON] organizations are good at coordinating on homelessness with other cities in GPE2 and [PERSON]. That's better for the homeless than encouraging other cities to not develop their own successful programs.",3
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"No, that's not it at all and that's absolutely misconstruing my concern.  Homeless funds are limited.  We can take care of OUR homeless because our grant distributions are based on our population.  [ORGANIZATION] gets tens of millions of dollars and their response is to ship people to places with fewer resources.  Look up ORG0 Continuum of Care funding and you'll be appalled at how much money they get and that this is their solution.  

I don't oppose helping the homeless.  They are people as well and people need help. I oppose ""helping"" them by making them someone else's responsibility to help when you're given literally all of the resources to help them yourselves.",2
The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,"I haven't seen any similar, more recent investigations (definitely interested if you come across one.) I know that tracking homeless generally suffered during [ORGANIZATION] of covid and that there was decreased contact with them across the board, so bussing must've dropped during that time.",2

What PERSON0 Taught This Mid-Sized City About Ending Homelessness,32,"I feel like there is a substantial difference between wanting to know more about an extremely difficult to research topic out of my field and complaing about the work.  I did not say anything about how those actions are taken *or* the writing in the article.

I will actively state that it is entirely suspect that they did not ask any unhoused people about their experiences, they entirely fail to discuss how they define almost any of the terms,  or provide any data. It could easily be entirely fictitious. I want [ORGANIZATION] to be better and that doesn't happen through puff pieces so I want to make sure it isn't bullshit.

I bring that up here in a lower comment because I think if I brought accusations up higher I  the post it would distract from the things I want to know.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"It had ben DATE0 and I was all stressed out thinking about how it will only get busier as [ORGANIZATION] hits and especially once school lets out.Most of the time I am a very optimistic person who is always telling everyone else that as long as we keep doing the work, the food will come. And I know it’s true, but I have my moments where the burden feels heavy and I get overly worried. I am human. So, there I was about to throw myself a pity party and then a volunteer ran over to me and informed me the person that had been in a car accident half a block away was someone I cared about greatly. Someone’s all of us here care for. It was a person who I was worried was dodging me because he had relapsed after having DATE2 clean and accomplishing so much. I knew he was filled with shame, but we just wanted him to know we are here for him and would never give up on him. Turns out the person driving had gone blue and hit a pole. As soon as his girlfriend was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, he kind of stumbled down to our door and as soon as I saw that it was him, I walked to him and asked if I could hug him. He grabbed me so hard and began to wail up towards the sky in pain. I knew that scream. It is the -my God what have I done- scream. I just held him back, tightly, for as long as he needed. [ORGANIZATION] rubbed his shoulder to reinforce that he wasn’t alone and I could literally see his muscles relaxing after who knows how long. I was surprised how long he cried…I was grateful he was letting those painful yet freeing tears flow. Once [ORGANIZATION] and I got him calm enough to make words, he said he needed to get to his girlfriend, but we knew he has heart problems and pneumonia, so we had him sit down ina chair and calm down. We had an important job to do. So I picked up right where our last conversation left off and I asked him: Is this enough of a sign for you that it’s time to ask for help?? There is nothing I could say to him that he hasn’t said to someone else, as he’s been very involved in the recovery world and has helped so many other people. So, after I said that, I just sat with him and held his hand until he was ready to talk. And eventually he did. I called my contact at the hospital and had them let his girlfriend know that he was okay and would be there soon. He was much more comfortable after that. [ORGANIZATION] made a plan! We got him some clean clothes and some good deodorant and he went up to the hospital to talk with her about the plan. It’s awful that they had to lose their car and have this near-death No sooner than this man left did a meek young woman show. Up at the gate right as we were closing up and switching to night ministry. [ORGANIZATION] and I both looked at each other because we were both exhausted after such a ling day and we were silently deciding who would go talk to her. But after another glance her [STREET], we saw that something was not right and we both approached her slowly. , but at least a good thing came from it! They have a plan and we can help them succeed! Much like the man who just left, she seemed unable to make words. So, I asked her: Can I give you a hug?? And she rapidly shook her head up and down. Holy cow…she grabbed me even harder than the man had. She dug her nails into my arms so hard! [ORGANIZATION] joined in and we three-[STREET] hugged and let the small young woman cry. Eventually she told us she had just been assaulted by a very trusted and authoritative figure. From what we gathered, authorizes had already been involved, but she appeared to be in a sort of state of shock. Something we are not a stranger to around here. So, we listened. It was hard to make sense of everything she as saying because she was crying so hard. Im pretty sure she doesn’t even use drugs at all she just seemed to be beyond tired and really overwhelmed. We tried hard to make a safety plan with her and eventually succeeded, but she was insistent that she had to go to work first, or else she would lose her job. We talked to the young woman while [ORGANIZATION] missed two buses home. She became more coherent as she calmed down and we got more pieces of the puzzle. She promised us she would be safe in the meantime and that she would be back when the shift was over and we promised to be here from her no matter when or how she showed up. She thanked us over and over and hugged us and kept saying “I’m sorry, I didn’t know where to go.” And we told her over and over that we are here for exactly this reason! We told her about how we would help her with resources and stay by her side as she tackled hard and scary things coming up. As she walked down the sidewalk, headed to her job, head held up high, [ORGANIZATION] and I looked at each other and no words were needed. Instead, we said a little silent prayer and hugged one more time, hard, before we walked back to finish setting up front the night ministry. And I tell you what…my stress and worry was all gone and my faith was restored. We are here, doing what we are supposed to be doing. The food will come. Together, we are empowering those need, one sack lunch at a time.",7

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"I have sadly had to call to report elder abuse before. They told me they need first and last name, an address and telephone number for the victim, first and last name and name of the suspected abusers. I would urge anyone who is able to provide this information for any of [LOCATION]’s victims to contact adult protective services. 
Edited to add more information on who is covered 
“[PERSON] ([ORGANIZATION]) investigates reports of abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect of adults [ORGANIZATION] or older, and adults [LOCATION] with disabilities living the community. [ORGANIZATION] is locally coordinated through 36 provider agencies. Case workers from these 36 provider agencies are trained and certified by ORG2. Local [ORGANIZATION] caseworkers investigate allegations and coordinate client service referrals to mitigate risk and assure client health, welfare, and safety.”
“What is abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect?
Abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect of a person [ORGANIZATION] or older or adults with disabilities [LOCATION] is the least recognized form of family violence.
 *Abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect takes many forms, and in most cases victims are subjected to more than one type of mistreatment. During [DATE], financial exploitation was reported more frequently than any other type of maltreatment at 24.23% followed by self-neglect at 22.06% and emotional abuse at 16.68%.
Abandonment - means the desertion or willful forsaking of an eligible adult by an individual responsible for the care and custody of that eligible adult under circumstances in which a reasonable person would continue to provide care and custody. 
Confinement – restraining or isolating a person for other than medical reasons. 
Emotional abuse – verbal assaults, threats of abuse, harassment, or intimidation so as to compel the person to engage in conduct from which she or he has a right to abstain or to refrain from conduct in which the person has a right to engage. 
Financial exploitation – the misuse or withholding of a person’s resources to the disadvantage of the person and/or the profit or advantage of another person. 
Passive neglect – the failure by a caregiver to provide a person with the necessities of life including, but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter, or medical care, because of failure to understand the person’s needs, lack of awareness of services to help meet needs, or lack of capacity to care for the person. 
[ORGANIZATION] – causing the infliction of physical pain or injury to a person.
Self-Neglect - A condition that is the result of an eligible adult’s inability, due to physical or mental impairments, or both, or diminished capacity, to perform essential care tasks that substantially threaten their own health, including: providing essential food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and obtaining goods and services necessary to maintain physical health, mental health, emotional well-being, and general safety 
Sexual abuse – touching, fondling, or any other sexual activity with a person when the person is unable to understand, unwilling to consent, threatened, or physically forced. 
Willful deprivation – willfully denying assistance to a person who requires medication, medical care, shelter, food, therapeutic device, or other physical assistance, thereby exposing that person to the risk of harm.
The abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect could be.......
an intentional or unintentional action by anyone;
 caused by economic or emotional dependence of either the victim or the abuser; [PERSON]accepted by the family and society as a [STREET] of life.
The [ORGANIZATION]...
may be a family member (adult child, spouse, grandchild and other relative) or a non-relative caregiver;
 may lose control due to the stress associated with caregiving;
 may have an alcohol or substance abuse problem; and
 may be frustrated or isolated.
*Interventions must take into account, wherever possible, most persons do not to want to sever family ties.
The [PERSON]...
may suffer from some form of dementia or physical impairment, often suffering from multiple disabilities which make him/her dependent on others for care;
tend to be isolated;
 may suffer from more than one type of abuse;
 may be reluctant to admit his/her loved one is an abuser; and
 may be fearful of reporting abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation thinking it could lead to further harm, long-term care facility placement, or total abandonment.
*These characteristics make intervening more complicated and cases more difficult.”

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Her story changed in the comments. It’s now the “individual” that called her NOT the hospital which when she said that indicates she works with the hospital employees and she absolutely does NOT. Clearly another manipulation of the truth to sound legitimate.,8

Most things she writes about can be said in 2 sentences. She has to drag it on though. Provide details that she makes up so everyone will be waiting on baited breath to find out more about the poor individual she is “helping.” It’s odd that so many people dig their nails into her when hugging her.

There,  fixed it for her !",13
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"What a story. You guys !  [PERSON] !  So many questions, so many , many questions.

 What does   “went blue” mean.  

Why not go to the hospital to comfort the GF you are so worried about after a “near death” experience!!!! ILet me guess , trying to sober up first. 
How did he eventually get to the hospital?  With a heart issue and pneumonia did she let him walk there ? If so, why again did he not go right away to comfort his GF .  
I call bull  💩 on this story.  What kind of person doesn’t go to the hospital with their loved one after a near death experience? Instead they go here for an intervention, deodorant, and bed bug invested clothes . 

Who is her contact at the hospital?  My understanding of HIPPA is they can’t give her any information, so what is the need for a contact ?

What person gives you deodorant after a car accident .  Car accident = need for good deodorant 

The assaulted woman who already has authorities involved meanders down to this [STREET] for a hug before her shift starts.  It sounds like they didn’t know her , so what led her to go down there just for a hug ? She didn’t know where else to go??? Wait, if the authorities were involved there would of been counseling which would of involved lots of resources, none of which involved MC 

You notice she always uses the word shame , which she herself is incapable of.  Every person always hugs her soooooo tight the dig their nails into her arm.  Every damn time !",13
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"What the heck did I just read?!  So instead of taking the guy to the hospital for his girlfriend, first she must sit down and do an intervention?!  And he has pneumonia?!  I feel like I am reading one of those Choose Your Own Adventure books.  A man’s girlfriend is injured in a car accident and is now on [STREET] to hospital in ambulance, should Miss [ORGANIZATION] 1) bring guy to hospital to see his girlfriend immediately, 2) do an intervention first with the guy, sit/hold hands, and eventually go to hospital or 3) ask him to help make 1,000 sandwiches and then head to hospital.  

Then the Second Lady appears out of nowhere….must be walking past Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s on [STREET] to work lol, but first has to stop by to dig her nails into Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s arms during a giant 3-some hug.  What again did she help with here?!  And what the hell was the point of this micro fiction account?!

The takeaway from this post is to send Miss [ORGANIZATION] food and deodorant (only the good kind).  But instead of begging, she says ‘if we do the work, the food will come’.  It’s a spin off of [ORGANIZATION], ‘if you build it he will come’,",13

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"lol. I just found this post on FB. 

If you ever want to make sandwiches with me or volunteer on [ORGANIZATION], please let me know. Miss [PERSON]'s is fun [STREET] to help and I promise you, it will make your heart happy and you will see miracles happen. I know there is a lot going on with the fraud page and all, but [PERSON] ca[LOCATION] believe everything you read. [PERSON] has not been found guilty of any fraud charges. [PERSON] has her taxes in and we are awaiting the audit. I do not believe that [PERSON] [PERSON] misused funds from all the facts I have been given. I call the fraud page out on their behaviors, such as making fun of [PERSON], volunteers, and the homeless. This did in fact get me blocked from the page that I believe these “mean girls” are behind. I do know for a fact that these “mean girls” do exist because they were mean to me when I volunteered there. (If you want to have lunch or something with me, I tell you all about what happened to me.) 

I am waiting patiently for the audit and facts. I’ve been quiet about my time volunteering at Miss [PERSON] because I have been waiting for the right time to tell y’all how I fell about this situation. The Fraud at Miss [PERSON]’s page is a bunch of bullshit and driven by mean spirited individuals who, I feel, did not get there [STREET]. They are not waiting patiently for an audit to be done, instead they are attacking, manipulating, causing all kinds of chaos and drama to ensue. They now have pulled [PERSON]’s children into all of this chaos and drama, where they do not belong. Kids deserve to be kids and not have to deal with adult issues that have nothing to do with them, but the fact is the fraud page can not sit quietly and be patient like the rest of us. I believe they want to give their opinions more than they want facts. Ladies and Gentlemen, the world is already negative, filled with corruption, and enough hate to take each and everyone of us out. Do we really want to keep doing this to ourselves? I know I do[LOCATION]. I want to live, laugh, and love everyone and everything with my whole heart, even if it causes me some tears now and again. I want happiness and peace. I want us all to be able to come together and help one another out, by lifting each other, up, by believing in one other, and coming together to form a strong bond and sense of community. Do you want facts or opinions? Do you want negative or positive? Do you want love or hate? If you do[LOCATION] like what you are doing, then change it, only you have the power to control yourself and how you react to others. Change, I believe is a great thing to want to do. I want to make changes that will fulfill my heart and soul. I want to love unconditionally. I want to just breathe and believe! All of this is what I believe and have learned in [LOCATION] volunteering at Miss [PERSON]’s. [PERSON] [PERSON] has taught me this. DATE2 I am grateful for Miss [PERSON]’s and [PERSON] [PERSON]. I am grateful for her wanting better and doing better [ORGANIZATION] as an individual. For creating this tight knit family were we all fit in no matter what is going on with us at the moment in our [ORGANIZATION] struggles. She fills in the gaps. The gaps that no other organization can. 💜

What will you choose?",1
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Not worth the time. It’s from an ORG0 phone and you can change the background. If they don’t want to believe that they can google it. It’s right on the internet it can be done.,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"Dude, she is not my hero.  You go to the fraud page and see what has been said. Listen, I’m not disputing [ORGANIZATION] is in the wrong for not showing the audits. You do t know or if I am for or against her. You don’t know if I signed the petition or not. All I see now, at this point, is you are trying to create drama, chaos and whatever bullshit you want because you are impairment, mean spirited, and have nothing better to do than pick on [ORGANIZATION] and her old posts. 

Perhaps need to look at yourself and all your idiosyncrasies. Again, I thought this was all about an adit that [ORGANIZATION] didn’t do. Now, it seams to me that you are choosing to  attack, [ORGANIZATION] and manipulate others minds into your distorted thinking and theories.",1

I could say I never knew I had to file taxes. No one ever told me I was supposed to renew my drivers license. I didn’t know I was supposed to pay for the food I just got at the store, I didn’t realize those were price tags to pay. I mean come on. This is how she operates. It’s ridiculous!",6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"She already used a dead cat in her last novel.  She had to throw a couple humans into this novel since she's indiscreetly begging for food and ""good"" deodorant.  Animals don't need deodorant! 😂😂.  Seriously, she's going off the rails here!",9
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"[PERSON]! If any of that is true, it’s disgusting. Those are the types that usually hit or injure innocent people like us who are driving around with insurance and obey the laws.",9

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,I was thinking more like an ad-lib. “A volunteer <insert a verb> over to me and told me our <adjective> <noun> was just in a <unbelievable scenario>!!!!”,9
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Also “some good deodorant”-Geeze PERSON0. You know this one was written by [PERSON] though because it’s so “ling.” Also her referring to her “contact at the hospital” is so ridiculous.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"😂😂😂😂...I literally cannot stop laughing!

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Those words/lines that [ORGANIZATION] reiterated never came out of that man’s mouth.  [PERSON] story is so important since it helps paint the picture so people can see through the smoke and mirrors.,10
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Someone posted [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] takes in enough food and money to help 1000 people a day but she only helps a few (or something close to that) and that is her grift. Simple but yes! Makes a lot of sense.,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,She asked [PERSON] though.  Seems legit !,10

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27, By your logic [ORGANIZATION] could be faking the texts that she has plastered all over.,8
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Time to ignore this one!,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Mine are purple and I have a message thread with someone that has a background. Different phone types have different capabilities I imagine.,6

MEAN GIRLS & BOYS RULE! I think that we're the farthest thing from mean that she'll ever find.  We're just sick of her shit.  THIEVES AND LIARS should be locked up!

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"We need to report her to [ORGANIZATION].  We'll keep her pissed off.  Maybe she'll have a nervous breakdown from the constant pressure, and they can lock her in a padded room.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,"Oh for sure. I think if there is someone that can report on the behalf for some of the victims, it would give them at least a chance for them to tell someone they are not actually okay with her doing these things to them. It might not “do” anything in that the victim might say they consent but I think it’s worth giving them the chance to have a supported voice and also creates more of a paper trail of possible abuse.",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Yes !! Exactly,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 31---The Book of John,27,Hopefully she is excited to share that she’s finally done an audit and that she will start to comply with the [ORGANIZATION]. Doubtful,10

[ORGANIZATION] has been legal for [ORGANIZATION], and there has been no documented correlation between crime and cannabis.  [ORGANIZATION] and narcotics, are a totally different thing.  

The thing to remember about working with homeless people, is there is a segment that is resistant to help for various reasons.  These agencies cannot legally compel anyone to participate.  This segment is then held up as how the ""system"" is broken.  Actually, I've seen fewer homeless in my area [LOCATION].  The City is limited on what they can do about panhandlers, because of the law that allows it under free speech.  Don't assume these panhandlers are homeless.  I've seen one  woman who I know is an [ORGANIZATION] resident panhandling on [ORGANIZATION], I think the current city leadership has done a good job attracting new businesses to [ORGANIZATION].  The [INSTITUTION] and ancillary companies provide a lot of good paying jobs.",6
The fight to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION],24,"I disagree.  The casino will offer more types of gambling, and will entice more people.  The point being, this community really has the bar set low.  A casino is the best they can do?

What correlation are you looking for?  Drugs use is a problem in [ORGANIZATION].  Whether it be legal or illegal, is this the best your community can do? What exactly has improved since pot was legally sold in [ORGANIZATION]?  Where is the owner of the dispensary from? Have ANY of the forecasted financial benefits materialized?

The bigger question is why anyone would be resistant?  Maybe there's no incentive to be a productive member of this community.   No one is is panhandling to display their First Amendment rights.  They're there because the reward is better than the alternative of working in their mind.  If they can't work, who is helping them get to the resources they need?  It's not your cops trying to ""serve and protect"".  They drove right by and stopped at [ORGANIZATION], pretending like they didn't see.

What new businesses were attracted?  What's the unemployment rate in [ORGANIZATION]?

Miss Carly's Post 27- [PERSON],10,"DATE0 was such an incredible day. We got slammed with donations [PERSON] and best of all:

We sent two people to treatment. 

One of the people was sent to us from the hospital. They reached out because they were desperate to get him help, after overdosing, but kept hitting dead ends….but we were able to pay for his transportation to [ORGANIZATION] and our advocate on the ground in [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] him to multiple walk-in facilities before he finally secured a bed. 

Thank you, [ORGANIZATION], for caring so much about this young man. This is what we do. When we see people who are trying to save their own life, we rally around them and we don’t give up, no matter how many brick walls we hit. [ORGANIZATION] is always looking out for people who are coming out of overdose and who are ready to put on the work. He’s a godsend to the those who struggle with addiction in our community. 

The second person we sent really hit home for me…she is a trafficked woman who has been telling me she wants to get out for DATE2! 

Well, [PERSON] was [PERSON]. 

She was [TIME] late and I almost had the [ORGANIZATION] leave without her, but she finally showed! I couldn’t even sleep [TIME] a wink because I was so nervous about her showing! 

It was especially meaningful for me that this particular woman is the only woman left on these streets who I used to prostitute beside DATE5. 

When she left [TIME], she hugged me, hard, digging her nails into me. She cried so hard that she shook violently….i was worried she was going to back out. But she wiped the tears away and told me she is ready to “save her own life.” 

The things the women out here on the streets live through when they are out here long enough will make your skin crawl and give you nightmares. It’s bad. There are a some very sick people in the world. 

There simply aren’t words to explain to you how grateful I was to see this woman get into the [ORGANIZATION]. 

Th so you for helping us provide a [STREET] out to those who feel trapped and can’t seem to find a [STREET] off the streets. This who have burnt all their bridges and used up their chances or who perceive themselves to be hopeless. 

When they get in that car, they have a bag of clothes and some basic necessities and they have [ORGANIZATION]. 

In fact, these two insisted I take a before picture, so they could remember [DATE] and see how much they changed physically and they wanted me to post it, but I’m going to wait for the after to go right beside it! They are both determined to fight for their own life and I am so proud of both of them!! But if this doesn’t turn out or be the time…we will be here ready and waiting [ORGANIZATION] to give them another chance. 

No matter what.

On fraud page :


One of the biggest red flags for me was when a donor contacted me as a board member and was surprised and confused because [ORGANIZATION] had messaged them and asked for a donation for her family!!

  She wrote:

“I hate to ask you again… But I have a personal favor now. I am working on a deadline to get my portion of work done for the taxes. My pay has been cut because we hired four other people and there just isn't enough money until we get the taxes done and can start applying for grants. We hired someone to help with the grants and everything, so that's rad!

I'm horrible… I always put the people first and do this to myself. So, I'm really glad it's not gonna happen again. Ha ha!

My question to you is this… Do you think that you could help me out with a gift card to [ORGANIZATION]? I really need to work evenings because it's often so busy here in [ORGANIZATION]. But since my pay was cut, I brought really frugal foods that require a lot of time in the kitchen… Large chunks of cheap meat, dry rice etc... but I just don't not have enough [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION] right now. If I could order in [LOCATION] a week, I could crank this work out, but I can't afford it. I have to cook for [TIME] and it just takes a lot of time. I love doing it! It's one of my favorite things… But I really just have to focus and get this done. The problem is every time I order in for family it's at least $50. If not 80 just because we have food allergies and my son is vegetarian etc. it's just an adds up! But I am not going to make this deadline, unless I work nights.”

This is just a portion of her groveling message that [ORGANIZATION] wrote and that the donor shared with me.  Now at this time, for the first time since the inception of the nonprofit, [ORGANIZATION] didn’t have access to donation money because we had turned everything over to the bookkeeper. (Who has subsequently been fired).
     When I confronted [ORGANIZATION] about this, she became very defensive and said this donor had become like family to her and she felt it was okay to ask them. (Apparently she hadn’t told the donor that!)
    Now in what universe is it appropriate for an employee of a nonprofit to ask a donor for a personal gift??? Anywhere else, this would be cause for termination, but again, the remaining board members refused to act and I resigned. But it should be clear that this is not your typical nonprofit and the founder believes that rules do not apply to her. And as far as I am aware, [ORGANIZATION] never did get all of her receipts in order and she is back to having access to all the accounts. Also, to the best of my knowledge, there are no longer any other employees of the organization. And this is why I think it is imperative that an audit be done immediately.",10
Miss Carly's Post 27- [PERSON],10,"Before it gets deleted.  Here is comment from her.  Things that make you go hmmmmmm


[ORGANIZATION] some of them, but not all of them.

But food in security is a reality for many people who receive food stamps.

[ORGANIZATION]..JUST..[ORGANIZATION]! Honestly, all fraud and begging aside, the [ORGANIZATION] is NOT sustainable based on building issues alone.  She has not produced records that have been requested because she needs to keep that money hidden for personal living expenses and for property taxes.  When she was cut off from the non-stop cash flow of the [ORGANIZATION] while she employed 4 people (4 is a [ORGANIZATION]), she was begging for personal grocery money from a donor.  She would NEVER be able to pay her personal portion of real estate taxes.  

Now, everything is running smoothly again since she's the only one with access to the cash.  Donations are sure to drop off with all the bad press that she's getting.  Not enough to put her out of business yet, but [ORGANIZATION] closer to the goal.  [ORGANIZATION]'s post should leave people with NO QUESTION about what's going on there.

This is exactly what we've discussed here before, and the mindset that [ORGANIZATION] is the only [STREET] around that has food for people. Of course a few of the places close to her aren't open 24/7 but there are places nearby that have food available. Does anyone really need a sandwich at 2 am? Midnight? Probably not.

“l've never personally seen it so l don't want to post this, but l've heard from several business owners that she goes around and tells businesses that she's ""Miss [PERSON] and people give her things for free"" to get businesses to not charge her or to give her a deep discount. And it's for personal things like getting her hair or nails done, not things for the people she claims to serve. So instead of the supporting local businesses that donate to her, she hits them up for freebies for herself.
She thinks she shouldn't have to pay for anything because she's Miss [PERSON].
People that know her from before she became well known say she's always been a storyteller and always exaggerate, and not to believe anything that comes out of her mouth.”",11
Miss Carly's Post 27- [PERSON],10,"To be honest, that's pretty standard practice for a non-profit. They form relationships with donors and then when a specific need arrises, you have someone to ask.

Additionally, after watching her stories, posta and after she visited my husband's work, we were under the impression she had limited space and was basically doing this whole thing on her own with limited help. There was 7-8 people I remember between the front and back that I could see there. Aside from the overflowing donations, [ORGANIZATION] stated they don't turn anyone away and they did. Thank you, it was frustrating but I was more confused. After seeing the new coverage and finding this, I feel bad for the people that other people send there thinking they would get help.",6

""I got to teach a college class [TIME]!!  
  
The class is called: Sex, [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION] and it is offered at [ORGANIZATION]. The class is about human trafficking and Dr PERSON0, who teaches the class, had several people come speak to the class about human trafficking. She has an Ex pimp, A survivor of human trafficking, a judge, two state police officers from the human trafficking task force, two local police officers, Police Chief PERSON1 and they came to us last.  
  
[ORGANIZATION] said she wanted end with us because it sucks to learn about something so terrible and feel like you can’t do anything about it. Well, I’m pretty sure those students left feeling like they COULD and would make a difference! Just within [TIME] they were able to witness us passing out condoms and bottled water to two women who are currently being trafficked. They got to see, first hand, what it looks like to be boots on the ground and hear about and visualize how they might be part of the solution.  
  
Huge thanks to Dr [PERSON] for bringing her class for [TIME] as Miss PERSON4’s and thank you to our long time advocate and soon to be [ORGANIZATION] graduate, PERSON5! I am so glad he brought Dr PERSON0 to us because I am absolutely smitten with the woman! She is crazy intelligent and she works so hard at molding young minds and imparting the most balanced and relevant information to them because they are, after all, our hope and our future. [TIME] was their last class and she gave them the most inspiring, raw and real advice…I was in tears listening to her words.  
  
It was such an honor to talk to this class, but most of all, it was exciting and inspiring to meet all these young people who will make a difference in the world soon""",4

He is not part of [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] operations, though he does have to sign off on some organizational documents on occasion (as do all board members). [ORGANIZATION] is required, as ORG2 (ORG3), to have at least 1/3 of our board made up of residents of a low-income community or who are low-income themselves. We have built that into our organizational bylaws so that we are always thinking about the need to meet that requirement. The vast majority of [ORGANIZATION]'s work over [LOCATION] has been in [ORGANIZATION], so we have always emphasized having board members from our neighborhood to meet that requirement.

Miss Carly's Post 27- [PERSON],10,"I must have missed the part where she asked for a donation for her family. I agree, all donations should be documented somewhere. But for people who aren't familiar with non-profits, I think it's important to state that requests from staff or volunteers for donations for their personal use are prohibited, but asking a donor for something specific for someone being served by the organization (within reason) would not be prohibited. While Miss [PERSON]'s doesn't have grant funding, many non-profits do which might prevent them from purchasing something for a participant that a donor would pay for.

Miss Carly's Post 27- [PERSON],10,"After inpatient treatment, it's generally recommended clients complete an [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] program. And following that it's recommended they complete a continuing care program. The idea is that each program is a step down in the level of care until eventually they're on their own. Following these recommendations increases their success. It doesn't sound like many of the people she sends to treatment are engaged in any of those programs following inpatient treatment. At least, I've never heard her mention it. It's always inpatient treatment, and sober living. Sober living definitely helps, but on its own it's not enough. Now, there are recovery homes which are a bit different than sober living, as recovery homes often include programming such as [ORGANIZATION] and/or individual therapy, medication management, etc. For example, clients living at FAC0 (FAC1 recovery home) attend [ORGANIZATION] at FAC1. There is also a long term program at [ORGANIZATION] that I've had a few clients complete, and they've all had lasting recovery and are quite successful [ORGANIZATION]. I've always wondered why I've never heard [ORGANIZATION] talk about that program, since some of her people sometimes go to [ORGANIZATION]. Of course, that would mean she'd have to give up her power and control over them, so I guess I've answered my own question lol

Inpatient treatment locally is honestly just hard to get into without private insurance, and often includes long waiting lists and DATE1 call ins. But if you're willing to go outside of [ORGANIZATION], it's almost guaranteed you'll get a bed sooner rather than later, and sometimes DATE2.",8

Help with a homeless guy.,16,"x2 on this.  I'm always happy to  share food with people who need it.   Money sometimes goes to drugs or booze (and sometimes not) so I'm reticent to offer that usually.

I had a lady approach me in the parking lot at the FAC0 DATE0.  She asked for a dollar or two.   I told her I work here and I'm sorry she's having a hard time but I can't have her asking people for money.  She told me she had spent all she had at [ORGANIZATION] on FAC1 for baby formula.  I saw that's all that was in her bag so she wasn't lying to me.  I asked her where her house was.  She said up by [ORGANIZATION].   I said that's an awfully long walk, and told her I'd grab her some food.   I went inside, grabbed a leftover burger that had been sitting in the window for a bit (would've gone to a staffer for a snack) and packed up some chili, whatever soup we had left, and some other random food items that likely would have been tossed at the end of the shift.  You should have seen her eyes light up.  She was so thankful.  It was literally the smallest thing I could do for her and it meant so much to her.

Help with a homeless guy.,16,"Well you're somewhat correct. There aren't many people that would be considered ""literally homeless"" by federal standards. Those standards are by far too picky.

She posted a list of [ORGANIZATION] inventory dated [ORGANIZATION] ""Tobacco Red"" and ""Tobacco Green"". Also [LOCATION], red and green, and ""Roller"". Both POP (with sugar) and [ORGANIZATION] are highly addictive. Those 2 things are listed first in this article [[URL] so Sure-Assist has hit the nail on the head with this. She needs volunteers to unload the plethora of ORG0 boxes, she needs them to sort things, to clean for her, (we heard her on video say to a volunteer to go clean the bathroom) and to just have people to bark orders to. She feeds them, gives them a warm [STREET] to stay during [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE], gives them pop, cigarettes, food. Some of them basically live there during [ORGANIZATION]. I also heard her say in a video that many volunteers come in off the [STREET] and someone posted that [ORGANIZATION] admitted some aren't sober. There is so much wrong going on. This is not your average ORG1.",16
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,"I went downtown to [INSTITUTION] and asked for [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Neither were there, but I wasn't done. I saw a gentleman in a suit walking out and stopped him by asking his name. His name is [ORGANIZATION]. I let him know that I've called relentlessly with no response back. I explained what was going down at [ORGANIZATION] and told him about the videos I had about [ORGANIZATION] passing out needles still. He took me up to attorney [ORGANIZATION]'s office where we all three talked. I told a lot of what's going on and played the video I have of a prostitute telling me to go to [ORGANIZATION] if I wanted a needle and in the same video the prositute admitting to the drug use in the building. [ORGANIZATION] took a bunch of notes and my phone number, and she asked why more ppl aren't coming forward and why aren't ppl going to the police?
I told her to go to ORG1 and search Miss [ORGANIZATION] and also [ORGANIZATION] fraud at Miss [ORGANIZATION]. I told her she'll find proof from ex volunteers who were speaking out. I told her about all of the work ORG2 and ALL OF YOU have done to help reveal what's really going on. No audits, lying on her taxes, etc. I bitched about nothing happening with the code violations and how serious it is with kids involved. Told her about the volunteers that are in there... pedophiles...dealer... addicts.
She seemed to be pretty shocked by all of it and I know my video had to make an impression. [ORGANIZATION] had nothing good to say about [ORGANIZATION]. In fact,
she's described as a SHIT SHOW! Miss [ORGANIZATION] took my phone number. I did tell them that this has gone on for too long, and if they keep waiting to do things that something bad is going to happen.",14

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,"I don't remember this in the news. Back in [ORGANIZATION], the attempted abduction of [ORGANIZATION]. Anyone remember this? 

""DATE1 I viewed footage of my attempted abduction that surfaced. Prior to viewing it, some things have been on my mind that the video confirmed and I want to share with you. I looked like a prostitute standing in a dark area of a known prostitution [STREET]. Yes, I was standing in the front doorway of our home, but our home is a commercial building and in no [STREET] looks like a family resides in it.""",5

The latest video is of a ""very skinny woman"" from the neck down who **""Just [ORGANIZATION] had two black eyes...but [DATE] I hope she will feel pretty and loved!""** and [ORGANIZATION] got a bunch of body sprays so yeah, that'll fix everything. She's a homeless prostitute who is on drugs. Then someone commented this ...""I understand your mission and have donated many times but sometimes I have to think that you're enabling addicts. From experience you have to hit your lowest low to consider sobriety."" That lady gets it! [ORGANIZATION] is exploiting this woman at her worst.",12
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,"DATE0 it might be fun to make a list of all the companies who have donated time, money and items to [ORGANIZATION]. I saw an older post that [ORGANIZATION] had a fundraiser making ornaments. All proceeds went to [ORGANIZATION]. I saw a bank also. We know ORG2 and [PERSON] have donated pallets and pallets of water. Might be time to just send them a quick note and remind them where things stand now. I cringe every time I see a company donate to her.",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,"Knowing that [ORGANIZATION] knows she is supposed to fix up her current [STREET] before moving into the [ORGANIZATION], why do you think she's only done a few of the repairs and fixes to bring it up to code? Does she claim to not have the funds? Is she hoping the city will forget about the [ORGANIZATION] and just let her be? Is it just too overwhelming to think about? It's a monumental task to get the [ORGANIZATION] the [STREET] she wants it. The rubber roof, the rotting wood, the flooding, the painting, new ceilings, remodeling, showers. And she talked about how the walls are stained a bright yellow from all the nicotine from [ORGANIZATION]. You just can't paint the walls. You need to prepare them before the paint or the stains will show right through. I would have nightmares thinking about it all. Is she just hoping she'll get a ton of free work done? If so, why hasn't she prioritized that? Or is she going to hop in her white bronco and skip town one of [LOCATION] when she loses custody of her kids? Is she in good health, she seems to lumber around in her videos.",10

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,"Back to begging. 

""DONATION UPDATEWE ARE NOW ACCEPTING SPRING/SUMMER CLOTHING!! Everyone has been asking and I’m so happy to tell you that we are ready! We worked hard over [ORGANIZATION] to work through any excess warm clothing yet still keep a small amount tucked away. It’s always such a delicate balance to try and anticipate the needs of the most vulnerable folks and we tend to need [LOCATION] stuff [STREET] longer than people would think, due to it being so cold at [TIME] still. That being said, we can still use some coats and definitely hoodies. More than anything….we need blanklets and sleeping bags and tents during the springtime because so many people lose access to emergency cold weather shelter, be it an actual shelter or an other temporary solution they found. It’s a whole new ballgame when there is no snow on the ground! Our doantion room has essentially been cleared out DATE2 that it is open. If it wasnt for the fact that we are constantly stocking it, I dont know that we would make it through [ORGANIZATION]! Thank you to everyone that has been dropping off so much [DATE] appropriate clothing as well as household items, toys etc. It’s just the best thing to see people leave protected from the weather. Or, to see them build new homes and have HOPE when they leave here with a few plates, an old quilt, and some clothes and snacks for their kids. Piece by piece, they are able to make an empty apartment a real home! Here are the things people are needing most right now: \*\*TENTSBLANKETS/SLEEPING BAGSCLEANING SUPPLIES (can be used) [ORGANIZATION]/ANY LINENS\*\*FOOD FOR LUNCHES (chips, granola bars, cookies, pudding/jello cups, bannas, oranges, apples)SODA FOR THE [ORGANIZATION] ([PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], Sprite etc…they like it all!) HYGIENE ITEMS (shampoo, conditioner, deoderant, razors, bar soap, hair products for textured hair, etc) As always, the FOOD is true number one things we need. Our numbers only steadily climb as the weather warms and we need all the help we can get to feed 400 or more people DATE2. Its pretty amazing what we can do when we work togetherDonation drop off is Wednesday- [DATE], but if you have food to drop off and dont mind a quick hand off, I’m home after [TIME] all of the time, so youre welcome to drop off sicne we need it so badly. I know many of you go shopping after work, so please feel free. Here are our quick links, incase you prefer to donate that [STREET]: ORG1 Wish List: [[URL] to donate: [[URL] Provide home cooked, or restaurant/fast food delivery meal to the hungry volunteers who work so hard arounf here, many of them homeless themselves, choosing to serve their peers, or in transition: [[URL]",1

[ORGANIZATION] mainly wants cash or items that she can sell or use herself.  CASH is preferred!  I'll say it again and louder for those in the back.  [ORGANIZATION] steals donors' money and lives off of it.  She most likely gets every single benefit available to low or no income people.  SNAP, Medical Card, etc.  Does anyone know if she collects disability?  Doesn't she have some flesh eating disease or something gross like that.  I thought I read that it was a direct result of her shooting up with dirty needles. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",8

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,I will! Then I'm reaching out to the podcast! Going in the computer now!,9

""Pretty excited about this Girl Scout’s plans to convince her troop do a community garden takeover [ORGANIZATION]! It’s inspiring to see young people take challenges on and be inspired interested in making a difference in their community! Our garden has always been a huge hit in the area and has put so much green food in people’s tables. The neighborhood kiddos love the strawberries, blackberries and ground cherries we always plant, so I told them that was the only requirement to the takeover. Give her some love in the comments! I think even with this late start, she and her fellow girls outs can grow heaps of free, fresh and nutritious food for the people who live in the area. Fresh and affordable food is a luxury many of us take for granted. So many people we serve in particular shop at [ORGANIZATION] and ORG2 as their only grocery stores because it’s what’s accessible to them.Looking forward to a bountiful garden and lots of smiles and learning""",16
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,Exactly what I mean. If they have so much to do there they should not be sitting on Miss [PERSON] family’s couch. I can’t imagine not having a [STREET] for my kids to have privacy. They are exposed to people in their home [DATE] long. It is insane,14

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,The Mom is a huge supporter of [ORGANIZATION]. I doubt she will change her mind. I also think this troop is the same one that came and sold cookies where is work. Took advantage of seniors in a nursing home.,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,I didn't message or tag [ORGANIZATION].  She's a dedicated cult follower.  She even posted [ORGANIZATION]'s begging list along with a scan code ([ORGANIZATION])? On her personal page.  I'm not arguing with the brainwashed,7

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,Especially when it could all be done virtually.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] to the Volunteers and [DATE]'s,23,She's probably paying for it and just doesn't want anybody to know she's using  the communities donations.

This crazy bitch knows her furnace has ""combustibles leaking"" and the flue vent has condensation and is deteriorated? That's straight up [ORGANIZATION] or natural gas leaking and so deadly. The city of [ORGANIZATION] is letting this happen?

Also, improper piping on pressure relief valve on water heater? That's a bomb waiting to happen. Have you ever heard of water heaters blowing up and shooting straight thru the ceiling and roof??? The pressure relief valve being faulty is how this happens. HOLY SHIT.  

I do mechanical work like this for a living, and this is completely unacceptable, and the units need to be red tagged and disabled until fixed properly. That's what would happen to someone under those conditions.  Water heaters can produce carbon monoxide poisoning as well as furnaces. How the fuck does she think shes better than everyone and can put so many lives in danger.  

These are huge violations. Shame on the city of [ORGANIZATION] for not disabling the furnace and water heaters. They would do it to anybody else,  why does she get a pass? Fuck that.  

The electrical is a fire waiting to happen. Extension cords for refrigeration? The city inspector should have shut that down right then and there. What the fuck.

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",8

I am not sure how much more reasonable the city can be ?  She doesn’t address what she thinks a reasonable compromise is .

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,Okay well after going ahead and I'm doing some further reading investigating I have a pretty much seen that this isn't post against Miss [PERSON]'s the building and all of the problems that it has this is a personal attack against Mrs [PERSON] personally like her that's what I see that's what these posts say that's what every single one of them say really that are a negative and [ORGANIZATION] there's no positive like [PERSON] I'm sure that I'm just going to be hated but you know what I don't know her I don't know who she is never seen her talk to her a couple times but I don't know her but the second that you started calling her a liar and pulling up personal things that she said so what the hell is the difference between 19 and 25 people whose lives were saved thank [ORGANIZATION] they were saved in the first [STREET] that made you look awfully stupid I think but whatever that's just my opinion what everybody to know opinion is the word you use when you don't like things and you think you know things but you don't really know if you know things like if somebody told you and then you claim it to be a fact that's hearsay it's your opinion it's my opinion that's your opinion isn't a fact just because you say so then to sit here and call her a b**** and crazy and all the other things I'm not even going to repeat and have people complain about vulgarity and while you're doing that  and while you're doing that I mean  and while you're doing that  and while you're doing that [ORGANIZATION] wow people ask why doesn't she respond I sure as hell wouldn't you guys are terrible yes so there might be some things that aren't great but again I say 19 to 25 people whose lives were say personally by her so how many more that weren't and again I ask is the real problem her or is it the people that she's serving I'm not a big fan of the subject but remember [PERSON] and who his apostles were and who he sat with my opinion and let me make sure everybody knows again that my opinion is that there are several extremely rude opinionated people on here who are slandering and rebel rousers as far as I'm concerned I'm going to stop now because I'm about to start giving opinions that are just my opinion except for if I were to point out exactly what I'm talking about they be made facts as fax is the fact that if if you're calling somebody a b**** you're probably an a****** and if you don't know what you're talking about you probably shouldn't say it shouldn't say s*** I'll just what bothers me the most here is that this is just one example of all of the hate in the world and in the universe that is keeping everything so freaking bad I have let this get me all riled up and angry enough and I shouldn't even be reading this anymore and I'm I'm I can't and I'm not going to but you know what I should get taken down anyways she's doing some spam folder somewhere all this is isn't attack against a woman and under the guise of the building that she puts up so stop talking about her and talk about the building if that's what the problem is again you are pretty specific about all the things that are going wrong nothing about anything that's going right talking about a lot of volunteers how many you guys volunteered talking about a lot of things she shouldn't be doing but let me put this on another post because this is what,-5
"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,"OK so as for the majority of your follow-up questions, I made no reference to the contents. However, I'm would say that if those are concerns and she isn't complying then sure there's a problem but those things are not my issue. My issue was clearly to express my distaste for the [STREET] that everybody is attacking her and what they're saying how they're saying it I was clear about the fact that I don't know her and I don't know about any of these things no sack lunches and hygiene products aren't worth someone's life. And again I don't know the statistics how many people have died there? How many people have died from overdoses starvation and the elements? As far as the smart-ass it wants to talk about how I write if that's all you've got to respond to it then fuck you yes I've heard of since PERSON0 paragraphs and punctuation but I was on a rant and I don't care. Again I was commenting on people's vulgarity and their ganging up on somebody and saying horrible things be they true or not that's all I would have defended anybody in that position all I say is I thought this was against a [STREET] and when I read on it turned against being about the problems at the [STREET] in turned into attacks on a specific person I don't know again I'll say like I said before I don't have any of the evidence or proof for anything besides what I've read and I read a whole bunch of people saying bitches and fucks and ranting on this one person who is regardless of her method helping people I don't know as far as personalizing it I don't think I said anything to you specifically so if it doesn't apply to you then why do you feel the need to respond I'm not sure",-1

(Not exact quote). 
Also, saying we pay for sober living makes it appear that they pay for sober living permanently and that’s not the case.

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,"I believe half of what she said. If companies want to help her have at it .  They don’t want to do research and donate money or services to a building of hers go for it .  A simple google search should give them pause.  More garbage cans will make zero difference, I regularly walk the bike path and in spite of garbage cans and dog waste bags people throw their trash and don’t clean up after their dogs .   Allowing her volunteers to be actively using is an example of hard core enabling and she of all people should know better .Honestly I hate to say it , but maybe nothing will ever get resolved unless or until something bad goes down.",10
"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,"Thanks for the recap.  

I watched the video, and the comment about picking up the blankets made me actually say fuck you bitch.   There are blankets and tents dumped all over that area from the same few people.  She has supported many encampments in the area over [ORGANIZATION], and she never does or pays for the clean up.  It is either the city or the property owner on the hook.  I walked from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] via FAC1, and the whole area was filled with garbage.  The problem isn't lack of trash cans, it's her handing out shit that creates trash. 

[PERSON] how the volunteer had the full size shampoo right next to the travel size and claimed the volunteer didn't know where things were at?

And she continues to dig herself into a deeper hole showing all the electronics bought with donations, and saying what is spent on [ORGANIZATION] and cigarettes, like $500 per rehab trip.  I liked how she spent $200 on a sanitizer for a $10 tube of drugstore lipstick.  How about just not accepting used make-up?  And if they can ask for food donations, why aren't cleaning supplies, and paper products on the donation list?  

I don't believe [ORGANIZATION] had a meeting offering her support, more like a come to [ORGANIZATION].  And funny how the board now needs to approve her post, and she can't say what spouts out of her mouth.",8
"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 15- The Megathread, Glory, and the Building",30,"The winky emojis when she’s answering questions that are hard are my favorite. Like she’s speaking in code or something. Also, people should message [ORGANIZATION] ministries and ask if what she said is true. Like, verbatim what she said. You will get a response. The pastor who runs it is transparent. Tell her the concerns you have. She will respond. She also won’t trash or share your name with anyone. She’s discreet. Or you can do it anonymously. If they did agree to meet with her to help, she’ll give you the reasons why. She won’t know the reasons not to unless we let her know.",4

1) Didn’t PERSON0 agree with the stipulations the city gave her in order to continue her [ORGANIZATION]. I believe the answer is yes , so why after being given [ORGANIZATION] to comply do you think she shouldn’t have to ?

2)Do you think because she hands out lunches, hygiene products, sends some people to rehab she shouldn’t be subjected to the same guidelines and protocols every other [ORGANIZATION] who does the same service has to follow.?

3) Why would you think we have some prejudice against a segment of society most of us are passionate about protecting?  You said we should volunteer down there. I have indicated I have volunteered, as have other commenters .  This is why we have concerns . 

4) When  exactly should people speak up about our concerns?  Should we just sit back and speak up after something horrible happens .  Are sack lunches and hygiene products a fair trade if someone gets hurt or killed down there ?",8

You seem to grasp the concepts and logic that I’ve been pushing for. Its clear that many people are emotionally heated in this debate, and emotions aren’t going to solve the problem. 
Its been [ORGANIZATION] since I’ve been on FB, but I would think that by being the creator you could remain anonymous. A fake email address is all it would take iirc, but feel free to correct me on that. You seem to grasp the concepts and logic that I’ve been pushing for. Your profile picture can be a [STREET] view of [ORGANIZATION]’s buildings. I suspect you’ll have to moderate the claims and comments pretty heavily.

Keep the FB post contents strictly on objective facts ie: [ORGANIZATION] hasn’t complied with ORG2 these are the infractions x,y,z. [ORGANIZATION] hasn’t complied with audit requirements, where are you donations going to? [ORGANIZATION] stated on Form 990 that she hasn’t received in kind donations, if you or someone you know has donated supplies, show us a receipt.

Now she is stating she doesn’t have a receipt when people send things, there’s a value to everything and I can tell you from my experience she was not tracking the things and the oversight of her spending from the supposed “board” is not a thing. She is not forthcoming on her spending to the board and for them, they know what she tells them which I can say is not much. It’s a very big con she has and it’s still running without [ORGANIZATION] who has spoke out on the misappropriation of funds as well as them firing PERSON1 the business admin who exposed the fraud. Now she has some different folks on the board (from [ORGANIZATION]) that she can con until they realize it and are gone as well. With so much turnover you can see how it’s easy to manipulate.

Think about a regular NFP, with [TIME] of operation, that follows the laws tracking ALL things. They have a designated individual(s) for receiving donations and such that gets documented and reported. 

[ORGANIZATION] operates [ORGANIZATION] which means the majority of things and money coming in are received by HER or some random person and there is [LOCATION] oversight to reporting these items correctly. I can tell you she doesn’t track all the things based on seeing it. There is a HUGE lack of documentation and that was why someone was hired and in doing this it was discovered she is misappropriating funds as well and now that bookkeeper has been fired for exposing her. If she hired someone to work a set number of [TIME], to be the only one receiving and tracking all the things, then there would be accountability because the control around that needs to be completely removed from [ORGANIZATION], she’s a dishonest person and she is capitalizing on peoples generosity and naivety. It’s quite brilliant really, she has everything provided for her and her family (ie: clothes, food, multiple gaming systems, crafts, circuit, books like a library, toys, exotic animals, furniture, everything) while claiming only a small fraction of the incoming items and monetary donations coming in. 

Again, someone who is constantly saying we need this and we need that and we buy this and we buy that when there is not the numbers she states to support the needs she claims, again, I’ve seen this.

I wouldn’t advise going directly at her, she can steer the narrative on her own pages anyway she wants. You want to indirectly influence her support by creating your own followers and reaching a larger fan base than her. You get followers by producing and posting substantiated claims, proof and maintaining your own credibility. Transparency is a large part of that. If you get enough people asking questions regarding her NFP, they’re going to start demanding answers from her before she gets another dime.",4

PERSON1 replied privately

Then PERSON2 response 

PERSON3 PERSON4 I get what you’re saying and trust me….not only do they have dirty laundry but plenty of that dirty laundry is directly a part of the situation we are in. Their actions caused us major setbacks and even worse [ORGANIZATION] we have tried so hard to avoid a mudslinging circus…. The thing that brings me comfort is that we have plenty of evidence and records and eventually everything will come into light. I do feel bad for the people who are following them and attacking us because I think they are going to be very ashamed of themselves, ultimately, but it was their choice to do so so they have to deal with those feelings. 

I fear some will not ever admit they made a mistake or feel any shame because I have noticed a common thread… many of these people don’t want to be reasoned with…they don’t want to believe anything other than what they believe. some people like a good conspiracy theory and even worse….a witch hunt. It’s so sad, but this is nothing new, it’s happened since the dawn of civilization and it’s only intensified due to the relative anonymity of social media. It seems like people think there are no consequences to their words on social media. They don’t seem to care who it hurts and what it does to families and businesses and innocent people caught in the crossfire. They CHOOSE to believe these things because it’s juicy news and exciting and drama filled and makes them feel better about their own life. Bad news has always sold papers. It is sad that these individuals choose to attack us after all we have done for the community. Just supremely sad. It’s hard to stomach, for sure. I tend to chock that up to the fact that hurt people tend to hurt people and that at least helps me sleep at [TIME]. It’s such an unfortunate chain reaction of ugliness and so many innocent people will suffer greatly if we ever were to close our doors. 

…. But I know one cliché that I have seen come true over and over: 

What’s done in the dark will come to light.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 39- Why [ORGANIZATION]?,30,"Speaking of the [ORGANIZATION] rehab , doesn’t sound like old [ORGANIZATION] is doing so well out there 

Miss [PERSON]’s love you [PERSON],I’m having a hard time here,my insurance is cancelled and I can’t get into any sober living facilities for [ORGANIZATION], I don’t want to come back to the cold, but I, don’t have the money to do shit right now so I’m stuck at this [STREET] that’s like a cult,man, I’m just hoping for a miracle, I love and miss you!!!!

Another post from [ORGANIZATION] Personal page : 

PERSON2 I’m living in a church where you have to buy your own food,I can’t get food stamps because of something in GPE1,I obviously don’t know my [STREET] around,or anyone, and these people seem a little ‘cultish’ ,I’m very uncomfortable here,so much so that’s why I’m thinking about coming back, ain’t that fucked up?

I mean the audacity of them to expect this able bodied man to buy his own food, giving him a [STREET] to stay isn’t enough I guess !!!!  He can’t get food stamps !!! Apparently, he has no interest in a [LOCATION]  This is why they “love” her so much.  She enables some of them to have zero accountability.  It’s just endless rehab, sober living and free stuff .  Now he is out there and has no capacity or desire to take care of himself.  This is what [PERSON] is creating.",7

I’m curious to know where the over [ORGANIZATION] is that was designated for the new building repairs that were never done. She keeps directing it back to the old building repairs which is something different and regarding the city lawsuit. It’s great that they decided after [ORGANIZATION] to fix their HVAC. Still a lot of remaining things to repair but really is that relevant since she’s selling it? Where it the building half a million at that needs to be refunded to the donors?,7

The owner of [ORGANIZATION] art deli even talked shit about her in a post. She has burned so many bridges yet somehow tries to convince people that this is a good ole “witch hunt”.

You could easily post from your laptop. Stop with all the lies. PERSON1 is the guy who has all those criminal charges, right? Last count was 6 I think. She's acting like a cornered rat.

It's hard but I have to remember how long these things take to wiggle their [STREET] through the legal system. Her name is mud in [ORGANIZATION] with so many places/people that formerly worshipped her. There will no longer be lunches and awards with the Mayor. The [PERSON] and [LOCATION] have been notified. [PERSON] of businesses. The money may never be recovered but I'm thinking she won't be holding any more huge fundraisers again. We've done good.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 39- Why [ORGANIZATION]?,30,"I would hope they are out scouting for good lawyers. it was disgusting how [ORGANIZATION] trashed some of her most dedicated volunteers.

[PERSON] said...""It is important to us that you know that a majority of the code violations from the city have been completed for some time now and that others will no longer be an issue as the family has now moved out of FAC0. It is our understanding that once the repairs to the HVAC and plumbing at FAC0 are completed, most, if not all, of the code violations will have been addressed and rectified.""

[PERSON] also said they get very few cash donations and what they do get goes towards operating expenses. I think those words will come back to haunt her. What about those [ORGANIZATION] recurring donations? What about those 2 checks [ORGANIZATION] got and posted proudly, around $30,000 IIRC. The birthday fundraiser that raised around $10,000. The hospital check? Posting all that crap is just a narcissists [STREET] of saying LOOK AT ME. PEOPLE LOVE ME! PEOPLE SEND ME MONEY. [ORGANIZATION] is her own worst enemy.",9

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 39- Why [ORGANIZATION]?,30,"Doesn’t sound as though he’s “hardworking” from his statements. He doesn’t even want to get a job…
This is exactly why the problems she’s creating need to stop. These folks are capable of getting jobs and being independent but why do that if [ORGANIZATION] can ask for everything for free for them? She is destroying the area and creating even more dependency out there from people who once were probably working and living paycheck to paycheck to now not working at all and getting their “things” from her. If they have to go to her [STREET] and move some things around and sweep the floor but get their furniture and food and clothes from the generous donors for free then why work? And yes, I said from the donors, [ORGANIZATION] doesn’t pay for anything or use the money she gets [DATE] to buy things for people. She relies solely on all the donors to provide it so that the money is kept for herself and the board to get paid back his loan. That’s why she is always showing her bare shelves to people. Now since she can’t “ask” for anything. Give me, give me, give me, I have found and created so many more people that are dependent on me now since I’m not following any laws or accountability around a thing. It’s a free for all and it’s a mess. Close this crap down!",8

Seriously, it sounds like she's committed literal tax fraud and embezzlement, she's handing out drugs, committed numerous labor violations and not complied with the city with building codes, she basically took someone else's kid...when a bunch of us have seen her NOT give a shit about her own even before she was ""Miss"" [ORGANIZATION], she's allowed her own children to be around registered sex offenders and convicted pedophiles, and I'm sure there's something I'm forgetting. It boggles my mind why she gets to see her own kids at all, much less get guardianship of someone else's... especially since it seems she's publicly high on a [ORGANIZATION] basis. I mean, shit, she's doing all of this out in the open and there has been zero accountability. Are the judges on drugs, too? Because this is insane. No child should be in that environment. 
Is someone from the city or law enforcement ever going to do their job? Most of [ORGANIZATION] knows she's a horrible person now...the only people left defending her are literal prostitutes and druggies enabled by her, and a group of folks that are incredibly naive and, often, just plain stupid. I'm sure there are still a handful of well-meaning people who didn't get the memo, but they usually catch on quick after meeting her. The city doesn't have to worry about making [ORGANIZATION] look bad...she did it herself. I just really wish someone would grow some balls and do their job.",17

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"Oh no!  How heartbreaking for her daughter 💔.  The outright audacity of [ORGANIZATION] to say ""bring cash next time."" YET, she had no problem eating the pizza and serving it to her family.  I'm sure the volunteers took the rest home with them as well.  [TIME], she complains about the quality of shaving cream and deodorant and then THIS!   She STOLE that $500 gift card.  I'm sure that it's just one of many that she's stolen.  How anyone (her cult) can defend these criminal offenses is beyond me.  I am educated and spent [ORGANIZATION] in the criminal justice system.  Yes, I know.  This is not the same as catching a shoplifter, etc, but is there really an end in sight?  A long term prison sentence is called for here. Ever heard of PERSON1?  I believe she has a sister.  Let's call her PERSON2. [PERSON]😡",14
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"It's completely unethical to accept a $500 gift card as the leader of a non-profit from a donor.  If the donor was insistent, it could be accepted and then turned over to the non-profit - and then documented CLEARLY!. (Not sure who is that insistent on giving $500 to [ORGANIZATION]. It's likely she didn't really try to turn it down).  

The pizza donation is equally weird. It could have been saved until [ORGANIZATION] and heated up for the volunteers (or eaten cold). No need for [ORGANIZATION]'s family to take one. It's also pretty ballsy to take it in front of the donors rather than pretend it's going to volunteers and then just sneak it to her family later.

I posted this so people are aware that [ORGANIZATION] does have an open investigation around her, as well as the city litigation.  It also shows how her narrative has people believing that shutting her down would hurt the community, but there is no data or evidence of who and how many is is helping, but a ton of evidence of how is getting funding and how it is being spent.  

**I will say it again:  Nobody was asking [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON3 to move into a commercial building and open it up 24x7 to hand out condoms, make-up, needles and junk food.**  She made friends with a few crack hoe's from the bar behind her, and the homeless old timers who got kicked out the shelters, and spun it like the ""system"" failed these people and they fell through the cracks.

I have to clear it with the board and our attorneys first though. 

That’s what so many elope don’t understand. I can’t do and say whatever I want 😉

…at least mot when it comes to any matters that have legal implications.

The only thing they did say was that we can no longer allow people to bring home cooked food to feed our volunteers, which is a real bummer because it makes the volunteers and the people who provide it so happy! 

They DID give us a workaround though! We can still allow people who volunteer here to bring food for other volunteers and that is actually the case with all of the people who are currently bringing in home cooked food, so we don’t even have to change anything! We just can’t have new people being home cooked food anymore unless they are also volunteering. 

Oh and we have to move the surplus peanut butter and jelly we had stored in the new building’s food storage area over to the current building which is no big deal. 

The inspectors were so kind! They said the allegations they were called here for were so far from what they found here. They didn’t tell me exactly what they were, but they seemed to get a kick out of how inaccurate they were.",7

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"She used to be an atheist, found religion and did a video about that. I bet she's had at least one pastor, [ORGANIZATION] tell her she's be great at giving sermons to people. The 💩 will hit the fan and she'll need a new schtick. She's going to start a real ministry someday. That's my prediction.",11
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,DATE0 on a video she asked [ORGANIZATION] to fill the sugar container up front.  The same [ORGANIZATION] that takes things home to sort because she is too busy doing other things on [LOCATION] she is there. Does she even change her own TP roll?,11

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"""It’s going to take the community to get the word out and shut down donations.""

Yes! I think the bragging about the [ORGANIZATION] was just disgusting. I think someone is going to the next city meeting with the results of the [[ORGANIZATION]) petition too. Hopefully it'll be up to 1000 by then.",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,I wonder if anybody can sit in at [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] date with the city.,1
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"I think there's at least one hidden account. She took in over a million dollars DATE0, and [ORGANIZATION] needs to stop with the *a lot of our money goes out to operating expenses* crap. Also, operating expenses doesn't include her 3 [STREET] cases. <insert stupid winky face here> Or am I wrong, does [PERSON] and donated money pay for her legal case with [ORGANIZATION]?",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"I wondered about her animals and that bird being in close proximity to the food.  You know, the cats the donors feed and use the litter that they pay for.  Where are they when she has her slaves whipping out those sandwiches?",6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,It’s probably coming later with her photo with the inspector. They obviously need to come at the right time to be able to see what’s going on. DATE0 when there is meal train food and then also them handing out lunches outside. I don’t know. Maybe they have a fridge out there now.,9
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,Because she's flapping her lips 💋 and LYING! I wish her dentures would fall out while she's yapping and talk back to her and tell her to STOP LYING! The plate of teeth is probably wondering what they ever did to deserve landing in THAT mouth! [PERSON],8
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,[ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION] 🐙🐙,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"To be fair....the city has to follow the rules, unlike [ORGANIZATION].  When she was issued the [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] it was done in good faith, and they had to give her a chance to follow through. . Then [PERSON] happened, and the [STREET] a lot of things happened changed.  After that, the city responded to concerned citizens' complaints, issued the building owner [PERSON], and MIss [ORGANIZATION]'s Inc the building code citations and fines.  [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] signed a document acknowledging the code violations in **DATE1 or DATE2**, and again did not follow through on the repairs, so the city took them to [STREET] in **DATE3.**  [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] have managed to stretch out the [STREET]'s decision.    Would love to pull the [STREET] transcripts and paperwork on this.

I do find it odd that the city has not condemned the property and pulled the [ORGANIZATION] yet.  My guess is that the ""clock is stopped"" on that due to the [STREET] case.  The city does not have the jurisdiction regarding her wire fraud and the treatment of her children, and I'm not sure if they pass on information to the law enforcement agencies that can prosecute her for these type of things. We will never know.",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"Yes, I believe so. Direct sources of said stuff are important and so it’s good there’s multiple of those but it’s tricky because each layer of this mess is dealt with by a different entity. Very complicated.",6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"He got sucked into the [ORGANIZATION] pity party theory that it’s just a bunch of old ladies being abhorrent. That she has no idea why anyone would do such a thing. That it’s the city, that it’s the old ladies, it can’t possibly be true when hundreds of people are speaking up. She has also admitted she hasn’t done her audits so what’s being told it the TRUTH. I bet he’d be surprised to know it’s a man or woman leading the charge who has [ORGANIZATION] been involved and not ex volunteers, people have no reason to lie. Why would anyone put their name out there and lie? She thinks people are trying to get rid of her, well it’s true in the sense that she should not be running a [ORGANIZATION]. No one wants homeless and addicts to stop getting the help they need but people aren’t seeing that she isn’t helping them but keeping them dependent. A legitimate organization would have employees and people trained with degrees to help in these situations. She doesn’t know what she’s doing. The ex volunteers are corroborating things and providing context but they are not the ones who started this investigation, she’d like to think that it’s them but it’s not. It’s pretty crazy to see the hundreds speaking out.",3

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,I have also had an appointment there at one point and it’s expensive. This just tells me she’s getting her glasses for free for her and her family as well. How nice for her to not have to pay for that either.,6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,I'm shocked that post and accusation is still up. How has no one in her [STREET] told her to take it down? I'm looking forward to hearing what [ORGANIZATION] has to say about the accusations.,6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,It’s a load of bs. The drugs inside are from her and the people using them in the building.,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"This woman says [ORGANIZATION] is buying a house and moving?! 

[PERSON] writes:
PERSON2 they are buying a house and moving out of the building so the sup codes won't apply

PERSON2 writes:
PERSON3 I will believe it when I see it, but that doesn’t take care of the audit.  This doesn’t go away with a move.

[LOCATION] page writes:
PERSON3 the [ORGANIZATION] for them being able to live there wouldn’t matter but they can’t operate Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s either without making the repairs that were brought to them. The building is not structurally safe for living or working in. Also, the building next door would need an inspection and from what I have been told from the pipes bursting the [STREET] should be condemned as the roof is going to collapse and mold throughout. So now you have 2 buildings that can’t be used that need extensive repairs. And moving where? How can she afford to buy a house, that’s interesting [PERSON]? How will she operate her [DATE] a day grift then? [PERSON]",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"Is she buying a house with her ill-gotten gains?  No problem.  They'll seize that and sell it to pay back taxes and whatever else she owes.  I'm pretty sure that the [ORGANIZATION] can put a lien on her ""current residence"" for the $27,000 in fines she hasn't paid.  How will they ever sell either building? Code violations, collapsing roof, mold, etc.  Even if she pays cash for a house, what will she use to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and upkeep?  If she intends to live off the proceeds of her grift for the rest of her life, good luck with that.  Especially since she's probably going to be vacationing in [ORGANIZATION] Hotel or FAC0 somewhere. I don't know how she's managed to keep her mouth shut [ORGANIZATION], but it's been nice not hearing that god-awful voice and watching her wave to people like a [LOCATION] waves goodbye to [PERSON].",4

She's not supposed to be handing out food to people at [TIME], at 2: a.m., but she does. I wonder if that is some kind of health code violation. All that food sitting out for [TIME] and [TIME].",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"Can you imagine the [ORGANIZATION] or another food pantry [STREET] proclaiming to all their followers how proud they are to pass an inspection by the health dept?

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"I appreciate people’s perspective on that, however, I want to be clear. I personally don’t care if she feeds the entire city, I welcome it.

[PERSON] said people have shown up for sack lunches [ORGANIZATION], but their arrival times depend on the bus schedules, or they ate elsewhere and will come by later for a sack lunch.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"What about all of [ORGANIZATION] donations that have been written off by donors?  How could the [ORGANIZATION] possibly find the donors and make them file amended returns?  Donors have unknowingly filed fraudulent tax returns, which have most likely reduced their tax amount due.

I asked about using [PERSON]e and found out the [ORGANIZATION] requires a special permit for MDs to prescribe it, and getting  a referral was impossible.  During my tapering I got dope sick, and DATE2 was very bad. I managed by reading medical literature on what to do.  The point is that I wouldn't suggest how to scam a limited medical resource.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,Will do!  I wonder whose page she is begging from.  She's not stopping.  She's out there somewhere.  I see she's making accusations of cyberstalking and people coming to her door wanting to fight her.  She's becoming unhinged,4
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 28- PIZZA!,29,"Yes, she will recycle this scam in the future. Everyone loves the story of a repentant sinner.  Now she has different sins to repent for, and in theory should have the skills to cover her tracks.  I'm guessing she saw a variation of this grift in [ORGANIZATION], and found her opportunity when they moved to FAC0 based on two prostitutes that hung out in the bar behind her, and a few old timers that were squatters in her hood.  I live in her hood, the [STREET] shit she talked about was [STREET] blown up.

She has that one garage door pulled up in the alley for donations, and the door next to it they can't open because the ceiling has caved in.

Imagine that you are in poverty, going through the most vulnerable moments of your life, out of nowhere, a bunch of photographers show up and ask you to participate in a photoshoot, what can you do? You can’t say no to them, they are essentially your patrons and your financial situation entirely depends on them, and thus, you cannot risk angering them. So you are basically forced to take part in these photoshoots that only project the fake stereotypes of poverty onto you instead of documenting what you actually go through [ORGANIZATION], how would you feel? Photographers and charity organisations are able to exploit their advantageous position to force people into participating in shots which perpetuate stereotypes, this is extremely disrespectful to poor people and takes away their dignity, and thus is a form of dehumanisation.",15

Excuse me then have  the security take the stuff out to her. She has the sheer audacity to say she has [ORGANIZATION] of experience , well get in line MC a lot of people have [ORGANIZATION] of experience with domestic violence. She then proceeds to respond to someone that she would only send someone she trusted for God sake you just literally asked [ORGANIZATION] strangers on the Internet to go help this woman.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.  The most common form of sex trafficking is your own parents or family selling you for their benefit.  I’ve specialized in fostering teens for [ORGANIZATION], both officially and unofficially and every kid I provided a home to had been trafficked by their biological relatives.  Are there pimps in [ORGANIZATION]?  Yes.  Do they traffick women?  Yes.  But it’s still not the most common form of sex trafficking.  Also, the vast majority of sex trafficking victims don’t even know they have been trafficked.  They just think it’s normal.",7
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,"I’m sure she’ll have some contrived answer as to why her stories about being a prostitute vs. being trafficked or pimped don’t add up. I’m also sure she’ll be the misunderstood victim in that story. She spins it around on everyone else like a true narcissist. She can’t be the problem. It’s the big bad city, she can’t be the problem, it’s the [ORGANIZATION] people who are out to get her. She can’t be the problem etc. etc. Cue the violins for poor [ORGANIZATION].",9
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,"I would like to talk about the clear unbalanced power dynamic that is a blind spot for most people. Often times [ORGANIZATION] says she “asks” people if they would like to share their story with [ORGANIZATION], and have their picture taken and blasted on social media. If someone is telling you that they are the only one that can help you, they are the only one that can save you, then gives you things that you otherwise wouldn’t have, that would compel most people to feel indebted. They would want to please the savior. So even if they say yes, I’m sure it’s out of obligation and a sense that maybe they would disappoint the savior and the carrot that has been dangled, would be snatched away. Remember, [ORGANIZATION] says herself that these people have been through trauma. She is playing on their trauma so she can benefit. Sometimes on [ORGANIZATION] live she puts them on the spot too. If you are dealing with people who have experienced great trauma, then you put their safety and mental health at the forefront. [ORGANIZATION] does not. In her recent post she once again shares details of a woman who escaped traffickers. That’s dangerous. She tells us how the woman almost fell into trying to help others but realized that was not good for her. That’s not mine or anyone else’s business. That is that woman’s business. This woman is trying to turn her life around but [ORGANIZATION] is putting it out there where she is located, that she is getting away from abusers etc. once again, all of that is dangerous.",5

100% correct and we've talked about this. If all comments are turned off on the ORG0 ORG1 page, I doubt there would be as many donations because the donors [ORGANIZATION] to see their names being used for good and they need the acknowledgement and pats on the back and need everyone to see what they are doing. There is no reason for someone to post that they sent 20 pairs of socks or 3 boxes of pudding cups other than to just get the adoration. It's rather sad.

Then DATE0 before the closing her child in murdered and she goes into a grief come (whatever that is ) . Then someone texts her about this tragedy, yea text doesn’t call.  How about the young gentleman who was going to start a lawn care business, in spite of having no license or  vehicle.  How much money, lawn mowers, weed wackers were donated . How did people think he was getting these lawn care items from  point A to point B. ?  My guess is stuff was returned to the stores and he got little if any of the money. Haven’t heard  another word about him ,  then there is [ORGANIZATION] whose family came all the [STREET] from the “big bad  city “ , and once they met the mighty [ORGANIZATION] were  literally skipping out singing DATE1 carols , while he rots on the streets of [PERSON].

Let’s  face it a lot of them will never admit they could be wrong. [STREET] too much invested .  The businesses who donate are doing it for a tax write off and free advertisement.

Knowing [ORGANIZATION] has worked in mental health (lmao), surely she knows this is dangerous.  Then there is the followers. Oh I hope the breast pump i dropped off works for her!!!!

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,"This woman better be careful because if she slips up and has a relapse then [ORGANIZATION] will try to “take” her baby because the baby deserves better and they now have a relationship and she has bonded with her and blah, blah, blah… I can see that one coming a mile away!! That woman needs to use legitimate services and stay away from that [STREET] before she gets sucked in and is an active user again like a lot of her volunteers. Being in a [STREET] that is full of drugs is not ideal for someone trying to stay clean. It almost sets them up for failure so she can then be their savior and human trafficker. Such a scary situation for all involved. 

I’m also wondering why PERSON1 knowingly is involved in the fraudulent operation. She has been told and is still there so when it goes down it’s going to drag her down as well. Felonies follow you forever and she could loose her business and good name! There are plenty of other places she can volunteer her services to help others but seems odd that she remains still BUT there’s a lot of inside information coming this [STREET] so maybe that’s why she remains. If she’s a plant then in that case, good for her! It must be hard for [ORGANIZATION] to know who’s there legitimately and who is there to gather information because there are several now. She has tried to stop her volunteers from talking by threatening them that they can no longer be there volunteering there if they talk about what’s going on there BUT they continue to talk. Who’s the human trafficker now?",12
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,A fraction of them will if they are “things” but if gift cards and money are received then she will be keeping the majority of that.

She also asks what else do you need and starts handing out things that people didn’t need or ask for. Very irresponsible behavior on her part just distributing things in excess when it’s not what they asked for so she can get rid of it and look like she needs millions in donations. I’ve watched [ORGANIZATION]’s volunteers (not [ORGANIZATION]) pile donations into peoples cars and it’s things they didn’t even ask for or want. It’s careless and it’s a HUGE waste of people’s money and things that have been donated. These resources would be better off at one of the other donation centers where they actually have legitimate support, processes, and accountability around the things done there. [ORGANIZATION] operates as a free for all with the donations/money and there is no checks and balances. The current 2 “board members” returned after she begged them to do so and they know there’s fraud there because they quit when it was discovered so those are her best options currently to keep things hush, hush and also report things to the proper authorities since they know already what’s going on.

[ORGANIZATION] circumvented the process by applying for guardianship someone said previously and at this point most people don’t realize [ORGANIZATION] has been called and reports made multiple times regarding all 3 of those kids but [ORGANIZATION] is a liar and a manipulator so when they show up announced she has all her things in [STREET] and she presents herself like on her [ORGANIZATION] fake and staged.,9

I always thought it was in such poor taste of [ORGANIZATION] to post pictures of the baby...showing off all of the fun things they were able to do with her, all of the milestones they were experiencing with her...while her biological parents were out there, hurting, missing those milestones, and wanting her back. For someone who preaches about believing in second chances and is open about her own struggles with addiction while taking care of her children, she sure doesn't seem very empathetic to the biological parents. Or the trauma of adoption. Because even in the very best of adoptions, adoption is still traumatic.",6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 16- The Con Man's Playbook and Sex Trafficking,28,Where it all started...Several people called her out. it was probably easier to just delete the whole post than just the comments she didn't like because we've all be told she only deletes abusive/hateful comments.

I believe in the first one she said they were Mexican and the second she said African. I think she got called out on those bc they didn’t add up. Anytime a Caucasian woman who is known to lie has a wild incredible story about abduction that involves People of color I can’t help but question it. So easy to believe for some though.

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I tried watching a couple of her live feeds but my cringe level pegged off-scale high and had to abort the video.,23
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Her use of volunteers has always concerned me on many levels.  The first trading labor for a hot meal and other things.  The other is she projects anyone who hangs out as a volunteer, [ORGANIZATION] was the worst of this example.  Also, if one of those racks of peanut butter that have been there for [ORGANIZATION] falls on someone's head????  Where is [ORGANIZATION] when the wages are tobacco and frozen pizza? 

The pictures of kids with toys is my other concern.  The kids can't consent. The parents may or may not be present, but hey look where the kids hang out.",17
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"The volunteering has bothered me for quite a while like you said, these people cannot even feed let  alone house themselves yet they’re down there donating their time which could be better spent looking for a job. Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with [ORGANIZATION] and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all [PERSON] saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.  They don’t have the facilities for that and not one person, [PERSON] or her homeless volunteers are trained to do that .  Especially to someone in a wheelchair who probably has a multitude of medical issues and if not properly handled could be seriously injured. Not to mention there were pictures of this person being cleaned up outside !!! For all the world to see.",18
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Yes, lots to think about for sure!!
She’s using them… has them working for her, feeds them, and then talks about how they sleep on the streets at [TIME] and then they come back [ORGANIZATION]. She is dangerous! How is this solving the problem they have by using them day in and out to do the work but they get no wage and little benefits and no real housing? She posted someone died (not the first) in a windowsill [LOCATION], someone that she didn’t really help because they still were on the streets. So very sad and she used the horrible incident to pump donations in because she is the only one who can save their lives. One of her recent live videos she asked what clean (sober) meant to the addict she was filming, and he said no drugs and no alcohol. So that would mean [ORGANIZATION] herself is not clean, that’s what her volunteers have said. The non-addict ones that are no longer there because they were a liability to her operation and at risk of exposing her. I believe that’s why [PERSON] and PERSON2 are no longer there as they were a liability to her fraud. [ORGANIZATION] never finished her own treatment as she was kicked out but somehow she should be helping other addicts, among the other services she keeps piling on? She has also claimed she has had mental illness problems her whole life and somehow people think it’s safe for someone like this to run this kind of operation with zero oversight? She herself needs help… 

And on top of all that, it’s the community that is feeding the volunteers now too since they have a “meal train” to feed volunteers DATE2… oh, and you can also donate money to that too, I’m shocked... 
So let me get this straight since she has all the avenues of collecting donations/money covered… buy from her [ORGANIZATION] list, set up [ORGANIZATION] reoccurring donations, donate to her link, donate to bring food DATE2 on a meal train link, donate money on a meal train link, just show up with money, drinks, and food whenever you want because she’s always “desperately” posting. Reminds me of her need to get her “next fix”. She continues to exploit people in her posts and profit off of people who need real solutions from actual services with people who have been trained for this. I pray that something bad doesn’t happen there where someone gets really hurt (it probably already has). Does she even have insurance on that building and the people inside? How would she even get insurance on such a [STREET] that has so many code violations that one shouldn’t work or live there according to the city’s official statements??",15
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[ORGANIZATION] tsk. Who needs the police? It’s dangerous to post pictures of trafficked women or women escaping domestic violence. It’s disgusting that she places these women and their children in danger. I have spoken to many in law enforcement and [INSTITUTION] and they say that they avoid [ORGANIZATION] like the plague. She has to legitimatize herself so she drops their names to do that. No law enforcement officer would risk an abuser or trafficker seeing a picture of the person they are trafficking/abusing on [ORGANIZATION]’s Facebook page to get donations from chumps who clearly have no discernment of dangerous situations. The comments are always praising Jesus [ORGANIZATION]. Anyone who says “ why are you putting these people in danger?” Gets blocked and comments deleted quickly. She doesn’t want people questioning her tactics.,16
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,It’s also highly egocentric of people to randomly put “ I sent 8 packages of ramen and some random socks and chips [ORGANIZATION]” total whackos,12

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,There are other normies that left beside [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. I’m sure they all figured out the [ORGANIZATION] and didn’t want the liability and/or dealing with [ORGANIZATION] being a slave driver.,10

I think she is posting these stories in hopes that when the city does get to shut her down, it will make the city look like they are taking away a community treasure, and people will be so upset they will blow up the phone lines at [ORGANIZATION]. The City can't leverage social media the [STREET] she can.  The City needs to make it very clear [PERSON]'s lack of compliance with everything and all the chances she had over a period of four [ORGANIZATION].  The [PERSON] excuse needs to be shot down, and it needs to be pointed out what an [ORGANIZATION] is, and why their claim of having a duty to do moree during [PERSON] is BS.  They also need to point out how she endangers her family with unsavory characters in the home [ORGANIZATION].   I don't know if the city can comment on the fraud and exploitation, but hopefully the local media has been paying attention and can add that into any reporting.  

The [TIME] was quite the story.  

* I’m so proud of our volunteers and our staff! When a woman is fleeing domestic violence or human trafficking, we need to act fast. This woman came to us after she was rescued by the fire dept and we had a safe house secured, an Uber out front, she was fed, and had a suitcase full of everything she needs for [ORGANIZATION]…all within [TIME]! 

So who is the staff?  Was this woman involved in trafficking or [ORGANIZATION], and she rolled trafficking in  for good measure?  Was she brought there by ORG2, or came on her own after she was rescued, and ORG2 was rolled in there to look like she is a resource for them? Can she just leave a job or children for [PERSON] at a safe house in a different city?  What will be her resources and who will provide them long term?   A prime example of how she twists things to make them seem different than they are.  Why not just say, we helped a woman get to a safe house quickly?  But she adds all these other things that may or may not be relevant, and will make people who are good hearted believe something very different.",8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[DATE] she saved a slave.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,The new post is something to behold,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"In the new post, she describes a young man, as a slave. A SLAVE. Like [ORGANIZATION]? She throws this word around a lot. Here is the post, of course it’s a book:

“There is this sort I have seen many times that I always secretly liked. It said: “SHOOT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD FENTANYL DEALER.”

Like many of us, I have lost one too many people to fentanyl poisoning. But over [ORGANIZATION] I have been thinking About what this shirt says. I hate violence, so I certainly wouldn't want anyone to shoot anyone, but I had all these really big and complicated feelings about loosing so many friends. 

But then this skinny young man started to talk to me [TIME] when he was coming to get food. I was always kind to him because he was kind and respectful to me. I knew what he was doing on the streets because I had driven by the corner he works on the bad side of town many times. I hoped like I do for everyone who seems to be suffering that he‘d hit a wall at some point and asks or help, and that day came, but what came out of his mouth shocked me to the core. 

He was a slave. 

The existence he described can only be described as such, with living arrangements and treatment worse than that of a dog. His keepers, can only be described as unhinged and sadistic. 

It shook me up pretty good because I wondered how many pleading glances I had missed keeping myself so concerned with the women who want out. And kind of routinely feeding them men and meeting their most basic of needs not being sensitive to the possibility that they need me to offer escape.  

One thing I have to remind myself of from time-to-time and that I think you all should be aware of is that these young “thugs,” or “gang members” that are on the streets, the kind of people who look like they are definitely up to no good…not all of them are in this role by choice. 

EXACTLY like trafficked women are lured in, brutalized, and broken down until they are submissive…pretty much the exact same process is used in creating “soldiers” who are then dispersed around an area to sell drugs, be look outs and are involved with all levels of organized crime. 

Not only are they afraid to be beat down, or even killed, but there are always security measures taken beyond that to ensure your total obedience.…pets, childhood friends, mothers, children, even dear old grannies can be un-alived with a phone call. 

Am I saying that these young men are innocent and should not face any consequences? NO. 

But I am saying that they were once an innocent and they may have been turned into what you see by grooming, brute force, and or psychological torment.

 We know environment plays a huge role, but what I have to remind myself is that the person I am taking to, that I am trying not to judge for their lifestyle, may be screaming inside…they may want out with every fiber of their being, but are too afraid to run away because…who would have them after what they have done and who they have become? 

I remember feeling just that [STREET] as a women wanting out of trafficking and over [PERSON] what I have learned that without a shadow of doubt, so many young and not young men feel the exact same [STREET] I did. 

…and I have to look at them differently now. I have to have empathy.

 And I think if we can all try to remember that these individuals, these dangerous looking criminals, are human beings and that maybe THEY are the ones who need rescuing for a change. If we can be open to that, then we are closer to a world where these people are granted the time and space and [ORGANIZATION] to heal. 

Step one is not judging, educating ourselves and having empathy ❤️”",6

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I can sum up each and every video and save you the pain. HELLO. EVERYONE!!! I am [PERSON] and you are not. Just busy saving lives all up in here. Little PERSON1 and PERSON2 hop on up her and  sing my praises on how I saved you single handily. Here is my [ORGANIZATION] link and list of donations needed. But remember cash is king !!!!,20
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Well I do have the ability to watch the most awful boring tv shows in the world, so we have the right person for the job here!!",12
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I've worked at one nonprofit and volunteered for several others and the main staff who is there doing the main work [ORGANIZATION] is always on the payroll. Volunteers help out sometimes, but not on the [PERSON] stuff. And the original post suggests things a [ORGANIZATION] or someone with training, and a paycheck, should be doing. That's crazy.",16
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,You mentioned all of the peanut butter so I’m sure you saw all of the jelly too. Why isn’t she using those donations for sandwiches instead of begging constantly??,11
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"But remember, [ORGANIZATION] is a nurse/doctor tending to severe wounds on people. She’s a social worker/psychologist/psychologist/ who can best diagnosis and treat mentally ill people. Shall I go on?",11
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,What the what?? She has a meal train to feed volunteers instead of them eating what she feeds the rest of the people coming in at [TIME]? Make this make sense.,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I would love one know if and who is insuring that building with all its code violations. Not to mention the liability with that kind of foot traffic. Does the insurance company even know what they are insuring?
 
We as a community have to do better. Donors need to do research and question things before blindly handing money and donations out.  .  City leaders , police, and media needs to step it up.  This town will be a laughingstock when this blows up.",14
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,🎯,1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"We've mentioned this many times, it's one of the reasons her Facebook page is so successful. It gives people who donate a forum to tout their good deeds. There is NO reason for someone to comment on what they have sent and donated other than to just put themselves on a pedestal and brag. It's disgusting to read.",12
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And the special lotions, makeup, wigs ect… it’s important to make the trafficked woman more attractive to their abusers .",9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Oh boy !!! What did you say lol.  This is why this forum is helping. You can’t question anything on her page or even on your own social media. If you do she comes after you!with  threats of lawsuits or blocks you.  Which is a red flag all on its own, among the 100 other red flags.",10
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Hang out here, we're more fun.  You can still read her FB by opening an incognito window at this link, and not logging in.  

[[PERSON])",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Well dang, I give you kudos for trying!!!",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She's deleted me, too! I was her roommate in treatment [ORGANIZATION], and she's a slob. I commented on the video she showed with food and garbage all over the floors, and I commented on the filth. She didn't like that coming from me because I used to make her clean her side of the room. 
She's told me things she's done in her past that helped her come up... and got caught... and therefore, she had chosen treatment over jail. This is by far the most lucrative, long-standing of all scams.
My commenting on her being [ORGANIZATION] and my comments on other things have got me blocked as well. An honest person would leave all comments up because their conscience is clear. She has these people on auto-pay DATE1 or DATE2!!!!  She's not allowing us to plant seeds of doubt.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Oh, yes, lots of them left. Those 2 were the most recent ones. Next up, it will be [ORGANIZATION]… I’m sure she’s not a stupid gal and once she starts connecting the dots she will bail as well. PERSON1 preys on the good hearted people who only want to think the best of people and who don’t question her. Once you ask questions you are gone. lol",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,What happened to the Code Enforcement Officer and [ORGANIZATION] officer that were involved with her back in [ORGANIZATION]?,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,She has a program now ?,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Pastor PERSON0 creeps me out.,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I’ve never heard of a program from her. In my opinion, [ORGANIZATION] was more structured than [ORGANIZATION] was. And now [ORGANIZATION] has it all back. Doing whatever. There is no program like real business would have. That’s why she doesn’t get grants. She would have to report. She can get away with a lot when it’s just donors.",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Even though she doesn’t show a face. It’s all yuck again showing any part of this woman when she is freaking leaving her abusers. And by the [STREET] now her traffickers know who helped her. Pretty sure they will be able to tell who it is.   Another situation ripe for retaliation.  Did this person know her picture was being taken?  Did she sign a release??  Oh sure while I am running for my life be sure to post it on social media.,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Once again she has no idea of the services [ORGANIZATION] already has in [STREET] for [ORGANIZATION] trafficking that can actually get someone into a safe house and get them relocated to a safe location.,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And, her body was still on the picture.  I am sure someone knew who this person was.  After reading it over and over, I am leaning towards the [INSTITUTION] not being who brought her there.  She plays on words.",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,And now she is admitting to having fentanyl dealers in her home…the home with kids.  Just peachy!!!,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Without calling the police once guys. She is the [ORGANIZATION] this city needs. 🦇 but seriously there is no [STREET] a drug dealer is coming to her for a lousy sandwich and a bag of chips. I’m guessing he was making a delivery,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And what he told her shocked her to the core!!! She lived on skid row, her mom was murdered, she herself was trafficked, she has been on and out of jail. But this story shocked her lol ok .  So dramatic.",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,And another new post with 400 new clippers from [ORGANIZATION]. WTH are homeless people going to do with clippers??? Where are they going to use them?? Just one more thing for [ORGANIZATION] to sell for $$.  ORG2 knows [ORGANIZATION] won't be using one.,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Yes, add this to the never ending list of people she claims to save… the men are slaves, really she’s using “slavery” now and she must save them too?!?!?!? DISGUSTING!! Everyone is a victim, she’s a victim, [ORGANIZATION]’s a victim, [PERSON] is a victim, PERSON2 on the curb is a victim, PERSON3 pulling up ODing with his friend is a victim. The whole city is a victim!! This has nothing to do with judging people, there are real victims out there but how she always posts that we have to not judge them is sickening as I have seen her JUDGING and HEARD her treating people like horse shit!!
Hopefully she doesn’t put the traumatized women they trafficked at the same donation table as the slave she’s saving now as she puts them both to work for her as their new slave driver…",8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Maybe it’s getting to the point that too many cease and desist letters would need to be sent out, so they gave up, but good question!!  Or maybe that lawyer wasn’t getting paid??",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It's ridiculous. If she did that to me, I'd refer her to my lawyer. It's not libel if it's true.",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Did that really happen, or was it an empty threat?  I k[LOCATION] they had an attorney on the board at the beginning, but they left.  I think this attorney was also on the [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] at that time, and left that committee DATE0.  I can't imagine any attorney in this city working for them [LOCATION].  

We should also ask what happened to the ORG1 officer and ORG2 officers that were helping her out in the beginning, and why they were so willing to turn a blind eye to the shenanigans.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I need to watch that movie now!,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"PERSON0 Don't you keep receipts or log them in for tax purposes? 

Some health departments give 
condoms  out for free.  I assume [ORGANIZATION] doesn't?

People aw asking questions?",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Another interesting thing I noticed is when some of the donors ask if their package was received (and specify what was in it), [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] will say they have no [STREET] of knowing if they received a donation since they receive so many packages! BUT they should be recording all of these [ORGANIZATION] packages as IN KIND revenue on their financials.  It would likely include a description of the item, likely the donor, and the value of what was sent.  So, they should be able to tell if something was received- if they were doing things properly.",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It’s the best [STREET] she knows how to get a reaction.  Thought it was interesting she showed the peanut butter, since a Redditor mentioned all those containers of peanut butter just sitting there [ORGANIZATION].  Let’s keep our fingers crossed the city cracks down on her DATE1!!! And if she really does buy groceries from [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION], that shelf should have food on it.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"So these are grants she got ?? I am confused, because hasn’t she repeatedly said she is 100% funded by donations??   That is close to 27 grand right there.",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"What does “occupancy” mean under expenses? Why does it say she has 3 employees but then she is the only one listed being paid as a current officer? It also says “non-officer” salaries, are those the 3 “employees”? Anyone know?",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I know she had a few [ORGANIZATION] that were unrestricted funds, so she could spend it however she wanted. So more free money that no one tracks I suppose?? 😒",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I’ll be shocked if anything happens as it should. Between getting dropped by legal representation multiple times, asking for a new judge (you know, one that sees it their [STREET]), and all the excuses they make with ZERO accountability it will just be another delay… [ORGANIZATION] has mastered the art of living off of everyone else for her entire life… she knows how to work the system and most regular people (like donors) have no idea since they are not criminals like her… I spoke to someone who donated to her [ORGANIZATION] and last and they will NOT be doing so again. They did it because it was easy to just drop off stuff in the alley and other places are harder to contact because they are [TIME] and such (not a living establishment too), with no one clamoring for the things that come in the door immediately. 

I think if we continue to educate and shed light to what’s really going on there it will eventually dry up. People want to just believe in miracles and that people have the right intentions. 

So, anytime anyone on here sees a company out around town or if you are friends via [ORGANIZATION] or other social media platforms, I urge you to share what you know and encourage them to do some digging before turning over to her organization. Everyone here can make a difference in this and spread the word, ORG1 posts, show how everything contradicts, and even tell people that kids live there which so many are shocked by when they find out!",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"There was a motion for discovery [ORGANIZATION].  Hopefully, the city can introduce the search warrant code enforcement served, and they found boxes of used syringes.",2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"The police, mayor and media have all been contacted regarding this. Yet here we are .  It’s not just the few of us here with concerns. This has been an issue that several people have spoken out about for [ORGANIZATION].",12
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"If this is soooo bothersome to you, don't read the posts. It's that simple. Obviously this person has donated lots of time researching this and is looking for people to help with information. Maybe once this person has enough evidence, they WILL do something about it.",12
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I am actually glad you posted this.  A big issue has been EVIDENCE.  Those that see things need to take pictures and print things.  If anyone is reading this that has evidence, let me know.  [ORGANIZATION] 👌✌️👍👏",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,If you have no interest in this discussion then move on. No need to comment. Did [PERSON] put you up to this?,10
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Thanks! Public awareness is key and the more information we get out there then we can prevent our community members from being taken advantage of! And that’s good to know, I’ve contacted via website but didn’t know there was an office to visit close by as well.",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Here is the thing. It took awhile to build a case against [ORGANIZATION]. Who is to say they aren’t building one against [ORGANIZATION]. She needs to stop before it’s too late.,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Go work on your [ORGANIZATION] page.,-1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And ironically she just saved someone from human trafficking [TIME] after this post went up.  Also note [ORGANIZATION], the volunteer has fought addiction and poverty, is there helping the victim.  I see two victims in that shot.",12
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I can sum up the comments.......WE CAN'T HEAR YOU! ...THERE'S NO SOUND!!!...READ YOUR COMMENTS...YOU MUST HAVE MUTED YOUR SCREEN...,11
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,What’s ironic is [ORGANIZATION] she had that huge rant about how the waitresses were treated at [ORGANIZATION].  How would she have felt if they also weren’t even being paid!?,14
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Sorry I lost my head  for [TIME] and thought maybe trained professionals should be dealing with some of this lol,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,You forgot PERSON0! She's an angel.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I mean I’ve seen every episode of [ORGANIZATION]. I could volunteer to help with the wounds.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,First it was she needs a lot of donations to feed the homeless and needy. Now she added she wants food and donations for the volunteers too. POP! They love POP! Send POP! One of the worst things to drink.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Oh yes.  I could find the sign up sheet if you’re interested?,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Something I noticed on [ORGANIZATION], a lot of companies giving out donations [ORGANIZATION], I didn't see [ORGANIZATION]'s name often. The most recent was a dairy [STREET] donating milk. Maybe they need to be made aware? I saw a large donation from a [STREET] on FAC0 (sorry, forgot the name of the [STREET]) but it didn't go to [ORGANIZATION]. People can ask for updates on any of the news station pages, [ORGANIZATION] can't delete those posts. They probably won't get answered but the information will be at least put out there. Every person who donated a part of that approx $200,000 deserves an update.",11
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,100%,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,It’s so stinking weird that soccer moms love donating that crap.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Which, she says are withheld as a form of control, but whatever she hands out doesn't get withheld by the abuser?",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I asked if the [INSTITUTION] brought the person there, or if they came on their own. Deleted. Then I asked about the [ORGANIZATION] celebration contradiction. Deleted. Also asked for recent stats about the number of people they served sandwiches to, and why was she begging for donations when we can clearly see jars and jars of peanut butter in a video. Deleted and blocked.",11
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,How did you find out about these posts?  Was she even trying to be clean at treatment?  I think her life has been one scam after another.,1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I doubt [ORGANIZATION] will go anywhere. She’s on the board and she thinks [PERSON] does no wrong!  Deer in the headlights.,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Is that the guy [ORGANIZATION] that was in the news for sexual abuse?,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I don’t know.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,and graduates! And does the human trafficking advocate/psychotherapist (s) not want their names known? Reputable organizations will give credit to people/professionals. Maybe they request to remain anonymous........for some reason.,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,🤣😂🤣,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Exactly, none of this squares.  I'll say it again, for someone who claims to have been involved in that life, she has very little concern of retaliation. Especially when she is so willing to open the door to her home with her children there at any time, for anyone, for any reason. She doesn't realize how easy it is to figure out who these clients are and what legal and personal data is online with just a bit of digging.",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Unless her “backstory” is NOT entirely true… she wouldn’t post these things if she was living that life or maybe she is just that stupid!,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I wondered that as well.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,The streets don't work like that!  Even a petty dealer wouldn't admit what he's got. They know her method of operation and wouldn't want to be her next story! She's so full of sh it.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"His captors are “sadistic, and unhinged” but she doesn’t judge and everyone who has ever been the victim of [ORGANIZATION] or domestic violence that is a woman needs to forgive bc those poor men. She is awful. Anything for a buck. I don’t even believe she is helping people anymore. I think she is just trying to see what she can get away with in [ORGANIZATION]",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And she’s in panic mode on her story:

“We need condoms [PERSON]… I thought we had a case of 1,000… it was “jail” toothpaste! Oh no!! If anyone can drop some off [TIME], I know the women will be…”

“Jail”
Freudian slip? Foreshadowing?",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Looked them up on [ORGANIZATION], they go for over $20.  How to unload these quickly for cash???  Or will they be used to lure low income people in (so she can take pictures)?",6

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,😅... !,1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And how does he get from the “bad” side of town to her [STREET].  One would think slaves  aren’t allowed freedom to just meander the streets.  I would think his whereabouts would be closely monitored by those who enslave him.  I hate how she uses these phrases for everyone. It dilutes what real victims suffering. Sorry,  I will not be emphatic to the guy who is selling poison that kills people",10
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Was that the officer that was in her early social media posts that was caught up in a sexual harassment scandal that was all over the news?

Edit to include name PERSON0 was who was there frequently",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"That’s awesome!  And even if there wasn’t a receipt, the items should be logged with an approximate value (which is easy to determine on [ORGANIZATION]).  So, look up applesauce in their records  (4 boxes of 18 ct), and they should get an idea as to whether it was received.  [ORGANIZATION] had a nice [STREET] of trying to dodge the core issue here, this [ORGANIZATION] isn’t operating like a [ORGANIZATION] should operate.",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,No logging.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,They did a “unboxing” once that was so laughable. She acted like she was an influencer being sent products to try.,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Recording package donations!!!  [ORGANIZATION]. Not done,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Since [ORGANIZATION] receives so many packages, why is she always always always begging for donations? That makes no sense. We know there aren't 500-1000 people wanting food DATE0. The whole operation makes no sense. And speaking of [ORGANIZATION] and people asking if their packages were received, I think it has more to do with them wanting recognition for sending something since people can easily track their [ORGANIZATION] packages on the internet. Which goes back to people posting what they send just to brag about it. Is it really that important for someone to know if [ORGANIZATION] got their potato chips? There is no doubt all those [ORGANIZATION] packages are being properly recorded. It's disgusting. Rant over...",4

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I’m assuming [ORGANIZATION] is one and the other is whoever is her current should I say (slave) person she has do all the work for no pay.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Exactly, it’s not something she would have to prove.  It’s the government funding she wants to avoid.",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I agree.  I honestly don’t see the powers that be doing anything.  Hopefully people will wake up and donate to legitimate organizations.  You can see by the pile of donations in her last picture people are still buying her song and dance. Personally, I have no sympathy for the donors.  There is plenty of information out there that is showing why this isn’t legitimate organization.  The only [STREET] this will stop is if/when something horrible happens down there that she can’t cover up.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,A decent judge wouldn't have time for these shenanigans. Hopefully this time they have some balls.,2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,They just got another [STREET] date [ORGANIZATION]. Nothing was said about taking the needles.,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Remember [PERSON] and his book a million little pieces? He had every one fooled. Even people who had far better resources to research than we do!  Stuff takes time sadly,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Sometimes, having a paper trail can do you in just as NOT having a paper trail also can do you in. I picture forensic accountants going over [ORGANIZATION] figures and saying HOLY SHIT. She’s been scamming people for [ORGANIZATION].",5

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And if you could drop off some great smelling candles, that would be swell!",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,There is no update on that building. It’s sitting there rotting. It was never planned out what would make using that building feasible.  She thought she was gonna get a free pass once again by the city. After all she is busy saving lives. Rules and regulations are for the common folk.  I think donations are drying up. More people than we know are on to her,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I think it was maybe $400,000 instead.",9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"I believe the total donation for the new building was near $400,000",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Well if they know it’s from [ORGANIZATION] I am sure they let them keep it. I mean it’s [ORGANIZATION] after all.,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Damn she is super sensitive.  She is not used to being questioned.  Eventually she will have to answer to people.,10

She was clean during treatment but focused on guys. 
She started a relationship with some guy who was also in treatment with us ( the guy she's with now is [ORGANIZATION] compared the loser she moved in with) and moved into ORG1 housing with him after she got kicked out of FAC0. (FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION], to be specific).
Being her roommate,  she told me a lot about herself. Including her last scam that ended in her either going to treatment or jail. 
One thing is for sure, she seems to get better each time she !",2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Once the law and police get involved, people tend to jump ship very quickly. I think [ORGANIZATION] will be one of those…if she’s smart.",8

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Exactly!,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I think you are right.  You scratch my back and I will scratch yours.,3

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She doesn't have a car and she says she drives to the bad side of town?  Where is the bad side of town?   

I live four blocks from her, I'm on foot DATE0 along the river, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON].  There are no drug selling slaves.  Just like the homeless people are hiding in the bushes on the railroad tracks.   It is BS.

If she is so tight with [ORGANIZATION], report the situation and let them investigate.  She should know how that works since it happened to her when they took the boxes of used dug needles from her home.",7

Yes, [ORGANIZATION] typically includes an invoice or packing slip with their packages.

[ORGANIZATION] is saying half of their packages don't have a receipt?????????",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,lol you know they aren’t logging the donations or counting it towards income ow however it should be counted.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She always puts out a plug for the business who donates, so people are trying to drum up business and she will plaster it out there for them to get some extra sales for that company! You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.
Most recent post on [ORGANIZATION] who sells [PERSON] for all the kids who show up there with trauma. I hope she slips some to her own kids that are living in trauma [ORGANIZATION]! 

In the picture what in the world is behind them in the garage?! It looks like an episode of hoarders…",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Oh but her fans wanted it. They were practically salivating over this opportunity to see the queen live !,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,They are not getting recorded by Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"On the [ORGANIZATION] video, you get a snapshot of the food shelves.  There appear to be at least 4 large shelves the size of the one she took a snapshot of.  I wonder why she didn’t take a picture of the entire food aisle.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,So foundation grants.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,So I can just say my house is an outreach center and right everything off? 👀👀,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"If the donors can use [ORGANIZATION], they can use ORG1. I ORG1d Miss [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] and there is a link to Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s reviews. ORG2 is the FIRST thing that comes up and the first thing you see is ""A conversation on Miss [ORGANIZATION], do you think she's legit?"" so the info is there, I don't feel one bit sorry for all those donors either.",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,That’s a really good example!,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[ORGANIZATION] more like 15 min. But she didn’t want to brag.,13
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Just open that wallet [ORGANIZATION]!!!,10
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[ORGANIZATION] saved her and reached her to Miss [PERSON]. They will be bringing the pimp in [ORGANIZATION] for the next big sob story.,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Check your email. They may have sent you an application,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,For her own personal use.,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,She needs the candles to cover up the smell from all the animal shit and piss.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I AM HERE FOR IT!!!!  Sorry for yelling but I can't wait for [ORGANIZATION]!,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Can you sit through an entire Facebook live?!,1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Have the law or police been involved yet? She's blocked me from her page, and I'm nosey. Lol",2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Off topic but it’s another example of [ORGANIZATION] not keeping her lies straight. In a live feed, I believe from [ORGANIZATION], she said she didn’t arrive to the Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s DATE1 until [TIME] because her and her family celebrated off site [TIME]. But this was just posted….

……..burst! And then at the end, so many people stayed and cleaned out entire building spotless and even helped me wrap the last of my family's gifts since we celebrate DATE1 DATE2. It couldn't have gone any better!",8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,That is true. PERSON0 was there for [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION].,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Read on....,1
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,According to her. She does call the police on people. I remember a while ago she had some long post about a kid that was volunteering that trusted her enough to tell her he had a warrant. She called the police on him that night “for his own good” it was the “Mama bear” in her. I guess it just depends on who you are and whether she feels like calling the police. I don’t believe a word she says. I think she’s a pathological liar that needs extensive help from professionals.,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"There is a lot of corruption in [ORGANIZATION]. Elected officials prop up these “community leaders” without doing any research. Or maybe they know about them and the positive outweighs the negative to them. The local media is complicit. It’s sad that they are allowed to take advantage of kind citizens, citizens who think they are being helpful.",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"That is good point, last I heard slavery is illegal.  If she cares so damn much call the police and report what the hell she knows and save this poor victim.  It’s insane if she literally is letting someone be abused under her damn nose and not reporting it ! Instead she is using this “story” to solicit funds and make herself look good. Anyone with an ounce of compassion would report this !!",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"And she makes it sound like there are big-time [ORGANIZATION] in FAC0! These girls have their boyfriends following behind them just as desperate as her for a hit, hungry, homeless, painful feet form beating the streets following behind her.... This isn't [ORGANIZATION]! We have low life [STREET] bullies, not [ORGANIZATION]. She exaggerates to tickle her audiences ears, and they start writing checks to be recognized as saviors!",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I thought that was odd. My packages always has an invoice,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,It also says they can return everything without sender knowing. [ORGANIZATION] is making bank at this too.,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Oh I know, at least they weren’t before 😬",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"That’s where they pile donations. Don’t worry, the pile will go quick. I heard the say they send a lot to [ORGANIZATION].",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"and 400, yes FOUR HUNDRED [ORGANIZATION] shavers for men to trim their beards. Followed by a long story....I wonder what companies or donators like the ORG1 guy would do if someone contacted them about the truth. Dismiss it? Think it's someone with sour grapes? They should take note, their brand could suffer down the [STREET].",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It was nice he donated all those things for the kids , but when you use it as a forum to drum up business kind of makes you think twice about the reason behind it.   Did anyone notice her begging for candles for HER house ?  I mean just buy some damn candles, we all know you’re swimming in cash donations.  No  one will notice if you take a couple hundred and stock up on candles .  [ORGANIZATION] dead zombies will be sending them [ORGANIZATION] and then commenting about it .",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Just like [ORGANIZATION]’s dogs!!,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Don’t worry, there will be a photo of all the food she bought at the store coming soon after reading this stuff 😂",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Yes!,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Only if you have a sad story.  Or if your an angel!,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Yup. Thy are grown. No sympathy if you don’t do your research.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,🤣 I'm so dead! So true!!,2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Why would [ORGANIZATION] save a trafficked woman? Wouldn’t that be something the police would be involved in ?,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Miss [PERSON] IS the [ORGANIZATION]! She provides the ""trafficked"" girls with clothing, name brand purses, perfume, wigs,  cigarettes, and femine products to help them ""feel fresh after a nights work.""  She fills their little tummy's, and off they go with a new crack pipe and/or needle. 
She's the human traffiker!  
And it's hard work to keep some of these folks clean long enough to make the videos and stories that pay her.",2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"
She has volunteered scrub that up.",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Hope it actually happens .,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Not really yet.  She is pretty untouchable.,2
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"You’re right, she did say that and now she has contradicted herself… [ORGANIZATION]!",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Good catch.  My first thought was ‘whose money bought her family’s presents’. 😬,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She never wants the police called down there. She says it “counts against her” with the city!! Sadly, im waiting for something very serious to happen, then maybe something will change",7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,The whole thing is making my skin crawl!,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,That makes me wonder how bad some of the donations are.  Is it cheaper to send it to [ORGANIZATION] than say to rent a very large dumpster?,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Correction: HINDRED … how can you take the time to caps lock but misspell? Bizarre.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Yeah, makes me think I will never buy anything from [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION].",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,DATE0 it showed she spent $800 to a candle company,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Has she ever posted that she's done that? I mean, got off her butt, drove to the store and bought bread, drinks, etc. and then said she used some of the cash donations?",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It’s easy to get foundation money… and she had the celebrity status, being the famous savior she is… so I am sure that was enough.",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[ORGANIZATION] just gave [ORGANIZATION] a check for $5000.00! That is nauseating. That could buy a lot of food if she got off her butt and did some grocery shopping. But she won't. I'm disgusted.,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,You would think she would say police but she never does. It’s always the firemen.,9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It really makes no sense.  So who is this one fire person who believes in Miss [PERSON] still?  And is it possibly someone that is just reaching out to Miss [PERSON] on their own to help someone, and their profession is just ‘fire person’.  And Miss [PERSON] is trying to boost her importance by adding a little flare to the story.",9
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"Lovely, another fun job for the free volunteers!",5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Miss [ORGANIZATION]’s money or tangible donations that she takes.,8
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"They have a dumpster.  They used to have three of them in the alley.  They did build an enclosure after they bought the building, and it looks like it is on that parcel, not [DATE] FAC0.",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,What are you talking about?,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"It’s super awkward to use it as a [STREET] to get more business and extra awkward she uses it as a [STREET] to get a completely useless donation, that doesn’t help her “clientele “ at all .",3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Holy hell!!!!!  At approximately 30 a candle. That is 27 candles   And 30 is high end of candle cost. Must be nice. For someone who makes 40 some grand that is pretty extravagant,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[deleted],4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,What in thee fuck!?!,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She used to post about it...but it has been [ORGANIZATION]. She used to have posts that mentioned their food budget and going to [ORGANIZATION] and spending $2000. Hmmmm...wonder what her budget is now??

Edit - I just searched her FB page for ""budget"". Back in [LOCATION] - they ""desperately needed $1200 for DATE2 grocery budget""",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Much easier to apply for and much easier once you get the money.  It’s like comparing apples to oranges.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,I mean insurance king was friends with [ORGANIZATION].  So there is that ……. So now she has money for ham [PERSON] or no?? Or a box or 2 of condoms,4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Seems odd,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,So there used to be someone pretty high up in the [INSTITUTION] that helped her in the beginning. I wish they would come in and comment on this. I think she is careful not to say police because they have told her to knock it off.,7
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,It says she came to us after being saved by [INSTITUTION]. She insinuated the [INSTITUTION] brought her there but didn’t specifically say the brought her. Just a little sleight of hand maybe ?,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"But I think her salary is less now, around $45k, with the addition of a ‘remote’ business admin being hired to take on some of her and [ORGANIZATION]’s work.  How can she survive on $45k and completely free room/board, food expenses!?",6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,[ORGANIZATION] post … that’s what she wrote.,5
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Shit my bad that was the scentsy.,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Yes. Exactly a business expense,3
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"So I did some digging and [ORGANIZATION] is the one guy you want to stay far far away from. He's a criminal, spent time in jail (On [ORGANIZATION], he was convicted of two misdemeanors: carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct) and......this is so bizarre, made a fake sex tape with a fake penis and stunt double to try and scam people and get millions of dollars! ""So, [PERSON] then went on what must have been the most peculiar shopping trip of all time, to buy a fake willy for his money-making sex tape venture."" Why the heck would she want to be associated with his name?",4

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,Sorry I fell asleep half [STREET] through her post so I didn’t catch that 🤣,6
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,So [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] make $85 K between the 2 of them from this long con. If you go by this. Have they ever said what his salary is?,4

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"She seems like a compulsive spender.  I see the shelves and shelves of books, more books than I have owned in my life.  I see toys upon toys upon toys.  Plastic bins upon plastic bins.  When she buys one, she needs to buy ten.  Seems like an addiction.",4

Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,"No idea, but I don’t think he is on official payroll at least.  Maybe IT in some [STREET] though.",4
Miss Carly's Part 10- Human Trafficking,48,They are making more than 85K in compensation when you consider what is paid for operating the building they live in. Those are taxable fringe benefits.,4

A renovated showplace 16 and [DATE] so I don't have to [STREET] to [ORGANIZATION]",5
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"At [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] to come back, ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION]",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION]. trader [PERSON], whole foods, and sprouts too

edit: let's add ORG1, cava, maybe [ORGANIZATION]'s 😄 i could go on lol",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,More things for people to do. Not just things like flow. But things for the whole family that people will actually enjoy. Also pls a trader PERSON0 🙏🙏,1

What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"This is exactly what I was going to say. Not like a fave and busters style [STREET], a bar with good music where I can get a pint in a glass and pump quarters into classic game cabinets [TIME]. Like the emporium in [ORGANIZATION].",4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"My day job in [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], is that kind of vibe. Expensive af tho.",8
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Kind of insane that we don’t have one,4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION], that would be awesome. The problem? It's a flawed business model. Any bar will tell you that women [STREET] liquor sales, and this isn't the type of bar that women hang out in. And as much as I'd say I would go, my reality is that I have little kids and wouldn't be a very frequent customer since I can't get out of my house pretty much ever.

But fuck, it would be so cool. There was this [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] I visited [ORGANIZATION] that was just perfect. They had the old school cabinets, which was cool, but that wasn't even the best part. You could get your own booth, each one set up with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON]. You told them which system you wanted to play, you left a deposit, and they gave you a tupperware bin full of a bunch of games.

Oh, and the tvs around the bar? They played nothing but [PERSON]'s metal videos. Largely obsure shit like you'd see on the old Metal Mania on [LOCATION] classic. I never wanted to leave that [STREET]. I wanted to go back to [ORGANIZATION] just for that. But there was hardly anybody there, and the [STREET] was closed DATE2. Just a bunch of middle aged dudes. Unsustainable.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,yes please!!,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I thought we had one.,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,That will make a perfect venue for smaller concerts/ comedy groups!   Can’t wait!,7
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Also the old armory sounds like it'll be a art/event space as well.,7
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,[deleted],9
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20," If I remember correctly, the nearest [ORGANIZATION] is in [ORGANIZATION].
 The strip mall it's in looks like it hasn't been updated since [ORGANIZATION].
 I was there pricing some gaming related items before it began getting cold.
 But yeah.
 I definitely agree about a lot closer [ORGANIZATION] 🖥️👍",3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"We won't get either. There's only like 20 [ORGANIZATION] locations nationwide and [ORGANIZATION] has 2.


ORG1 only really goes places where they can compete with ORG2, which means the median income has to be pretty high.",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] was so good and authentic. I worked for the owner DATE0 and she was quite serious about her bagels. She also had made-from-scratch soups that were delicious. I’d love to have a real bagel restaurant here again. 

I feel like [ORGANIZATION] is like comparing a local bakery to ORG2; not the same thing and not nearly as good.",4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION] does bagels, iirc. Are you thinking a bagel-specific joint?",3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I have a buddy from high school who worked at [ORGANIZATION] during its final [DATE] - we were randomly lamenting this [ORGANIZATION]... We concluded that there is nowhere in [ORGANIZATION] to get a true lye-boiled  fresh bagel anymore.

I wish I had the money to start a bagel-cheddarwurst shop. Real bagels, real cheese, real good sausage...

Focus on one thing and do it to perfection, think ORG1 sausage rolls...

One can dream.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Also building off of this - a [ORGANIZATION] program. Cats are especially good at keeping rodent and pest populations down but they also breed like rabbits. It blows my mind that we don't already have a [ORGANIZATION]. Especially with the sheer amount of strays,4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I love this idea! There’s a couple of them in [ORGANIZATION] that my daughter raves about. There’s also [ORGANIZATION] with a similar concept.,4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"As a fellow crocheter, it's not selfish 😂 we need a lys",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Amen!  There was [ORGANIZATION], Purl Two, but the hours were just not great for people with first shift jobs.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION] might be that [STREET]. It’s a Yemeni coffee shop that’s opening soon. They will be open [TIME], too.",9
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,This would be so cool!  I so often find myself wishing [ORGANIZATION] were open later.,6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"In [ORGANIZATION], we had lots of local “coffee” shops that had what they now call “open mic” performances. Some of the best times of my life as a performer and fan (lucky me to have had several singer/song writer friends who also played). A back room with pinball/arcade games would make my day!",3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Cut a rug? I'm unfamiliar with the term lol,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I'm looking into an art collective to fill this gap myself. :),10
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,A comedy club would be a great addition to [ORGANIZATION]. The local bars that host are so hit and miss.,3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Would love an alternative to the [ORGANIZATION]. And a ORG1 retail store would be heaven.,3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Have you been to [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]? I would die happy if we had something like that.,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I'd be happy with a decent [STREET]-In nearby,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Like a [ORGANIZATION] old bakery outlet, right?",6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Bowling and arcade! Cool.,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,[ORGANIZATION] is maybe 20 steps from the bookstore. You are always welcome to bring your coffee into the bookstore.,12
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"You do realize [ORGANIZATION] is right next door to FAC0? And [ORGANIZATION] does book sales inside their coffee shop. [ORGANIZATION] also is downtown not far from FAC0. I think the solution to that one already exists, so it's not about finding something new, but more about supporting what already exists. 

There's also something called ORG2 in the works in [ORGANIZATION]. It'll be a ORG3 themed tavern, and if that does well, it'll open the door to other themed places like that opening outside of major cities.

Given that movie theaters as a whole are dying in favor of streaming services, I sadly don't think a [STREET] in would operate too terribly well anymore. I know FAC1 and FAC2 are a [STREET] but at least they're somewhat nearby. 

I think when it comes to [DATE] diner stuff, sadly, [PERSON] killed the [TIME] crowd in [PERSON]. I think people need a reason to be out that late again, rather than just opening another restaurant like that. I personally love how [ORGANIZATION] is open until [TIME] [ORGANIZATION], which doesn't fully fit [DATE], but it is nice to have a local [STREET] to go that isn't [PERSON]. (I love that [STREET] at [TIME], but it's sad it's our only option really.)",3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I'd love a [ORGANIZATION], and a second on the non-religious [INSTITUTION].",6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I was so excited when [ORGANIZATION] was getting an [ORGANIZATION] theater, only to find out that they bought the smallest [ORGANIZATION] screen. So I'm still driving to ORG1 and [PERSON] to get the true IMAX Experience.",7
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"FAC0 please!! 

One of the things I really miss about [ORGANIZATION].",3
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I heard [ORGANIZATION] is opening a couple test joints in [ORGANIZATION]. Maybe sooner in [ORGANIZATION] than you think?,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION] ORG1 in [ORGANIZATION] has an indoor range now. Thats [TIME] away option. But yes. We sure need more public ranges, specially outdoor ranges, that’s not over an hour [STREET] away. I occasionally shoot at the [PERSON] rifle club but my potential sponsors got a long list of people they’re sponsoring and I don’t know anyone in ORG2, which seems like great places to shoot at.",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I went there before [ORGANIZATION]. Really cool [STREET] but you're right it is [STREET] to expensive. I'm sorry but those prices are more for downtown [ORGANIZATION] not [PERSON]. I know they are trying to gentrify [PERSON] but I can't see a [STREET] like that surviving with as much as they charge for the activities. I will say the pretzel was the best pretzel I've ever had with those homemade sauces.,6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Really been looking to try this [STREET]!,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,There isn’t a dedicated [STREET]. Just small installments in a few gyms. I’d love something like ORG0 out here.,7
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I hope they show movies too,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Right next to FAC0? That's great! That [STREET] has been closed for [ORGANIZATION]!,5
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I could be wrong, but [ORGANIZATION] bought [ORGANIZATION], closed them, and forbids any other grocer from moving into those locations.  :/  I'm unsure if the ORG2 location was closed before or after...",7
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"We miss it, too. And [ORGANIZATION] is the ORG1 of bakery/kitchens, even though they have a few items I can afford and can eat.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Yes. We used to have one called [ORGANIZATION]. Think [PERSON] but downscaled.,5
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,[deleted],1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,There used to be TNR through the county- not sure if they paused during [PERSON] and never started again? I’ve tried to get strays neutered in my neighborhood and everywhere is swamped and/or make you take ownership of the cats! It’s kind of nuts. I know there are a few orgs that will do a discounted rate but you usually have to [STREET] pretty far. Anyway. I agree- we need TNR back.,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I'm super stoked for [ORGANIZATION], not gonna lie.",4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Then you're too young to get in!  lol.,5
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,[PERSON] for dancing,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Yes, many of times! I was basically describing [ORGANIZATION] and glad someone picked up on it. I didn't know how familiar people are with the [STREET] and the ORG1 music venue that opened downtown. Didn't want any confusion between the two. I wish I could go all the time because it's top notch! Driving there all the time or taking the train after awhile becomes too much. I can see [ORGANIZATION] pulling it off if we can get enough people behind it to bring the magic that is cinema.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Yes, that would be fantastic! I'm all for an indoor or outdoor movie theater! I go to FAC0 a couple times a year and enjoy it very much, but definitely one in town would be grand.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,They have all kinds of groceries,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I've done so. I'm not trying to undermine your business or anything. I was just thinking, what if [ORGANIZATION] had something like that, but it was *ours*? Nothing too close, because I never liked how ORG1 and ORG2 ended up hawking things like [PERSON] and [PERSON] or what have you.",0
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"The [TIME] [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] does business. There's also been a resurgence in interest in [STREET]-ins precisely because of [ORGANIZATION], and because of the nostalgia factor. [ORGANIZATION] in [PERSON] may be a normal theater, but it does really well because their prices aren't insane. It's all about the business model.

ORG2 has been ""in the works"" for [ORGANIZATION]. I don't think it's actually going to exist. 

I haven't been to ORG3 in [LOCATION]. When did they start selling books?",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Yeah.... My friends have a lot of horror stories about [ORGANIZATION]. Some of which would be alleviated by, [ORGANIZATION], not being the only full-service [INSTITUTION] in the area. Remedies is good, but mostly women, children, and DV from my understanding.",4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"[ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] is where I go—it has heated leather recliners, never a crowd, super cheap prices. I was going to [ORGANIZATION] before I found [ORGANIZATION] was renovated.",4
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,I got to [ORGANIZATION] for the FAC0 theatre and the new regular screens.,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,There’s no true imax in [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] are our closest since [ORGANIZATION] closed theirs.,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I understand wholeheartedly. We're owned by the same company that owns [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, etc etc so yeah. I personally wouldn't go if my employee discount wasn't halfway decent. I'd lose an entire paycheck.",9
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,Come in during [ORGANIZATION]! The weekends get really busy. We're working out a lot of the kinks of only being open for [LOCATION] but it's a really fun environment (and the pinball machines are free - for now),5
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,This is how food deserts get started and then [ORGANIZATION] swoops in.,6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"That's what I've heard, but I've never seen a press release or anything that said that.",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I think that's part of the colony adoption, rather than a [ORGANIZATION]. Still very useful.",2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,facts 😂😂😂😂,1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"Are you so opposed to walking 20 steps for coffee that you want to sell out to [ORGANIZATION]? (If you want an indie option, it already exists, you just have to support two smalls businesses and walk a few steps).",6
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"The books on their shelves are for sale. At least they were when I lived in midtown [ORGANIZATION]. 

[ORGANIZATION] is considered a major city over [PERSON]. They're similar, but [ORGANIZATION] has a much more vibrant night life and bar life that allows for [DATE] diners. Plus the sheer amount of universities in [ORGANIZATION] also help with that. 

We have to consider [PERSON] is barely considered a city per capita. Yes, we are large, and the communities around us are often lumped into us, but we are not [ORGANIZATION]. We have to take the steps to get to that level.",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I've always wanted to try duck pin bowling, how much is it up there?",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"I already said that I have brought coffee from both [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 into your store. You've probably seen me do it and didn't notice. 

I said something *like* ORG2 I like the [STREET] it is set up, but I don't actually go there anymore. I'm just never near the mall. I remember liking the layout of the store. I don't go to ORG3 because I don't want to think of the people that I used to go there with, so I don't know what their book selection is like.",1
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,The last time I was in FAC0 I barely even noticed those shelves. I guess that's my issue. I would love it if they had a larger selection. Maybe the next time I'm in midtown I'll stop by.,2
What kind of establishment would you like to see come to [ORGANIZATION]?,20,"iirc $15 a person? I don't work on the gaming side so I'm not 100% sure. The cross training is next to non-existent so we're figuring things out as we go.

It's not that different from regular bowling. Same rules, smaller bowling ball, and smaller pins.",2
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"She doesn’t seem to realize the more she posts, the more people can see the discrepancies in her stories.  The more people question things , the more she doubles down. She seems to be spiraling, it’s clear she can’t handle any pushback and instead keeps pushing her white savior narrative.  We would all love to see those looong lines of the downtrodden waiting for their sandwich. we would like to know how many people do you send a rehab, and of those that you send how many complete rehab, and of those who complete rehab, how many go to aftercare. And how much does aftercare cost, how long are they in aftercare because again [ORGANIZATION] says one thing [ORGANIZATION] makes it sound like it's [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] they can be in aftercare. everyone would like to know and honestly deserves to know what the hell is going on with that building. Has any progress been made? Have you fixed any of the things you were cited for? Can you answer why [PERSON]says they're only sending the most desperate cases to rehab, but [ORGANIZATION] makes it sounds like she's sending her usual amount of people to rehab [LOCATION], see all these are the things that she's getting caught in lies and she just won't address it. She just moves onto her next story . she's the one that put herself out there, she's the one that begs constantly for money and has gotten probably well over $1 million DATE2. Now people have questions and they should have questions but they'll never get an answer, or at least not an honest answer. You know the old adage if you see something say something? Well, we’re seeing something and we’re saying something hopefully this isn’t falling on deaf ears.",25

[ORGANIZATION] next.",15
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I’ve been enjoying all these posts and I’m glad people are starting to notice and talk about it. I am a social worker. Lived in [ORGANIZATION] a long time. Some of my longtime friends also became social workers, in [ORGANIZATION]. I can tell you all of us side eyed her from [ORGANIZATION]. There are a lot of people like this in our profession. You see it in the veterans world a lot. It never ends well. People get hurt. 

Our field actually started like Miss [PERSON]’s. It was [PERSON] who started this [LOCATION]. So Miss [PERSON] has clearly never even researched social work as a profession. 

The reason why most agencies don’t operate like Miss [PERSON] is because people get hurt. There need to be boundaries and we have a code of ethics that is all about not hurting anyone. It’s not healthy for her or her family to never be off, if that’s even true. It’s not healthy to put her “clients” on social media like that. It’s not healthy to have all volunteers, this work is hard and the workers need to be trained and paid. 

Miss [PERSON] is woefully unaware of what is available especially to seniors. During the pandemic, there was extra funding available for seniors. I commented on these posts, trying to link them. No one ever responded.",17
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"It is no lie that the Mayor cares for the less fortunate in [ORGANIZATION], as well as the city staff that have been helping people for [ORGANIZATION], and who's work is a model for other cities' housing services.  They don't get to post on social media about their work.  They have to meet the requirements to get grant funding, and account for what they spend.

I think the media has figured out what she is.  She is a good story teller, but not so good that she can keep track of how the story details always change.  I've noticed the down turn in her FB traffic too.  Maybe people are reporting the posts where she puts links to donate and [ORGANIZATION] as a scam.

I feel sorry for her family that has their holiday, and [LOCATION], consumed by her need for attention.  And then she has the gall to brag about giving toys to the kids with trauma.",13
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Her live video [TIME] does some more name dropping, [ORGANIZATION] and the mayor were at the event she went to.  Then she talks about a doctor there who spoke, and this doctor also helps ‘her’ people get off heroin by giving them suboxone.  A church dropped off around 1,000 sandwiches, other people brought [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] chips, chili, and there were 3 huge totes of [ORGANIZATION] gifts from a church.  Then, she mentioned she has brain farts and can’t remember people’s names since she has had too many overdoses. She talks about how you can’t see all her homeless people out and about since they are so resourceful and know how to hide.  [PERSON], abandoned houses, railroad tracks.  Basically you can’t see them in her area since they are tucked away.  

So, she helped us understand she never gives people suboxone, a doctor prescribes it.  You can’t see her 1,000 people since they tuck themselves away.  And, now I know partly why ORG2 had 20,000 less pounds of food per month donated than [LOCATION].",11

We were talking about [ORGANIZATION] and he told me that [PERSON] is routinely in the store trying to return items without receipts. [ORGANIZATION] now only gives her store credit and they cannot restrict what she spends it on. So she gets gift cards with hundreds of dollars in them. [ORGANIZATION] has a limit on how much she can return, so she goes to other [ORGANIZATION]s or has her “volunteers” do it for her. The store managers all talk about her and know exactly what she is doing.",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I find it odd that she tells the [ORGANIZATION] community not to give money to people who are unhoused and asking for it, instead she’s says, give them a blessing bag, buy them food, a gift card. Yet she actively begs for money because she is the great white hope and only she knows how to help people. It’s also disturbing that she paints every unhoused person as “drug addicts”, her words not mine, but then talks about ending stigmas. Like which one is it?",6

Many people are clearly getting tired of her act. I don’t hear many positive things about her. Especially from those that grew up here. That being said, she is going to keep providing cover for grifters like [ORGANIZATION] so she is not going anywhere. She learned this in [ORGANIZATION] when she played both sides in regards to the PERSON1 uprising here. She is pretty good at playing the game actually.",3

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Right! And any city official that stops by is doing so for recon not as support, they can’t just show up empty handed to “look” lol. I like how she twisted that 1% of truth to make it seem as though they support her when they do not. There was a time they did, [ORGANIZATION], before she was “made” in her con. Those officials certainly must feel like fools now but they are doing the right thing it’s just a slow process. 

As for [ORGANIZATION], I saw her wanting to volunteer her services elsewhere in a comment on [ORGANIZATION]. This is a [STREET] where the processes are being followed legitimately and posted on frequently and also was on the front page of [ORGANIZATION]. 

As for the line of people, the numbers always change. She was saying she feeds 1000 and another volunteer challenged her that they were only making 3,000 in [DATE] so how is that possible? Of course that person no longer is there helping either, which is the [STREET] it works when you are a “normie” (not an addict), you realize shits crazy and not legit and you high tail it outta there! 

Cue the post where we see all of her “volunteers” in line for food as a photo op to say look at all these people to counter our claims. 🤣

She already got the city post outta the [STREET] to counter our talks about all her city violations.
She reads this she goes right to work deciding.. how can I make myself look legitimate after that?? We are keeping her very busy and thousands are reading this! 
Nice job everyone in educating the public and bringing light to all the constant inconsistencies!!",18
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"she's the one that put herself out there  -  THIS

Nobody asked her to do this out of her home - there is no reason to do it from the home - she keeps adding to her list of services and then begs to fund them, hoping the cash will end up in her lap.  I don't know how they can budget for something like sober living when there are no limits to how many and how long people go.",13
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"My random thoughts...[ORGANIZATION] would lose most of her donations if she had to leave [ORGANIZATION]. Of all the social media sites I follow, [ORGANIZATION] seems to have the most ignorant and hateful followers. Just read the ORG1 and ORG2 [ORGANIZATION] pages, especially when a political post is posted. It's full of hatred, tons of emojis, horrid grammar and spelling. No facts or links to back up opinions. [ORGANIZATION] capitalizes on that. ORG3 doesn't allow the long winded posts so she won't go there. [PERSON] is SO user unfriendly. [ORGANIZATION] has the most intelligent people, by far. I follow a lot of subreddits and there is a plethora of good truthful information here. If you try to follow any of [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] posts, they are filled with typos, and I'm surprised someone who uses [ORGANIZATION] for their fundraising means doesn't find someone to, at the very least, proofread her posts.",10

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Thank you for your clarity in pointing out how unhealthy this is. We are all concerned, not only for the children in her care but for those people she has made dependent on her benevolence. I have been concerned for [ORGANIZATION]. No one person and her “rag tag” volunteers can manage this influx of sex traffickers, addicts, trafficked woman, violent felons and child molesters all co - mingling among themselves and the general public. This has tragedy written all over it.",7

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Do you think it is true that agencies send people to her?  I can only imagine what ever she does undermines any progress.  There was a guy living outdoors [ORGANIZATION] who passed away.  I am almost certain that she was supplying him, and he believed that her blankets would sustain him, rather than accepting shelter.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Has she ever publicly stated she won't accept grant money? Ever give a reason if the answer is no. IF the answer is no, that is a HUGE RED FLAG.",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Tucked away? I thought they were all down there volunteering and the others were standing in line 24/7 .  They sure pop out of the woodwork when she needs someone to put on camera. Like this last guy with the cig hanging out of his hand. You know that shows how “raw” and real her mission is. Another thing I don’t understand is I was under the impression these sandwiches had to be made under certain conditions.  But often we hear people are dropping off sandwiches they prepared themselves.  Sounds like a great [STREET] to give someone salmonella. If you notice the [ORGANIZATION] rescue mission. Those volunteers are wearing gloves, hair nets ect .  I am assuming this church or the [ORGANIZATION] person dropping off hundreds or thousands of sandwiches aren’t getting tthem from subway at $10 a pop.",9
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I don’t buy it… with the drugs in and out of there, she’s using drugs, [ORGANIZATION], and [LOCATION] as well on [ORGANIZATION] and others…",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Her statements that people are living in the bushes along the railroad tracks are [ORGANIZATION].  Over [ORGANIZATION], there have been a handful of people in those areas, but nobody has been there since [LOCATION], there were about six people camped on FAC0 then.  The railroad clear cut all the brush along the tracks from [ORGANIZATION] to FAC1.  Yes, there are a few people sleeping rough in her area, but the number is less than a dozen. 

I wonder how many of the toys she got will be returned after DATE2. There is no [STREET] she is going to have [PERSON] of children with trauma go through her doors in [LOCATION].",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"This just comes across as very gossipy. I hope we can keep things factual on here, Is there anyone else that can confirm this? Pics? Interviews with store managers. This would be a huge story if it is true.",3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Same goes for her life story.  In one breath, she says she grew up in skid row.  But then under another breath she says she became homeless on skid row after her mom was killed.  I know she didn’t grow up on skid row, but which lie does she believe anymore.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Is there any scam she is  not doing ? It’s more and more information coming out.  It seems like half or more of [ORGANIZATION] is on to her .  It would be nice if the media would cover this.  I mean it’s all outlined here. It wouldn’t take much effort on their part to do some digging and at least question things .,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,My theory is she started asking for [ORGANIZATION] donations because she can take those back to [ORGANIZATION].,8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"[ORGANIZATION] does have some pretty recognizable brand names.  And we know people donate ‘new’, just go to the recent picture of suitcases for people going to treatment.  I guess the moral of the story is if you donate to [ORGANIZATION], rip the tags off first!!!

Thank you for your comment and welcome to the conversation!",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yup! Just unreal… the community needs to know this kind of stuff! She is such a scammer and continues to live off of peoples good will. So sad thinking people work hard for things and turn them over to her and she pockets the money and returns the items… Her social media is so fake, she truly is a disgusting person in real life!",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"My god , these videos go on and on .  I have watched [ORGANIZATION] series that were shorter.",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yup, I figured that was Mr. [PERSON] she was talking about! When you have so few players in this little soap opera, it’s easy to follow.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"That cart was outside in the rain to attract people inside for that live video.  It was her fishing lure.  She is a fisher of men, but in a [STREET] very different than [ORGANIZATION].",4
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"As an interesting side note on [ORGANIZATION], I noticed [ORGANIZATION] that she provided some info on why she followed [ORGANIZATION]’s posts.  Her son, [PERSON] died homeless on the streets of [ORGANIZATION] of a fentanyl overdose.  Ironically, I remembered who this guy was when I started my research.  His family is one that [ORGANIZATION] raised money for since his wife was ‘dying’ and they needed to get to [ORGANIZATION].  I had indicated [LOCATION] that [ORGANIZATION] had raised money for someone to move, and their felony records continued once moving.  She was arrested for things like begging, drugs, fake ID’s, the list goes on.  So it was pretty obvious it was a scam of a fundraiser, not sure whose fault, [ORGANIZATION], the husband/wife, or if everyone profited.  But it shows you can’t just hand money to addicts like that.  The wife went to jail on/off, and the husband died.  [ORGANIZATION] didn’t save anyone, once again.",7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yeah I try to just abbreviate the names, when it’s one of her people.  I have no idea who [ORGANIZATION] is, so I just abbreviate then 👍",4

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,I think the [ORGANIZATION] was there to get his story sussed out for when the city closes her ass.,12
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"She really has gotten herself into quite the pickle. In order to solicit the amount of donations she professes to need. She needs to keep posting, and she needs to post more and more outlandish stories. But the more outlandish her stories are the more people question things , and then the more people question things the more she posts . it’s this vicious merry go ride she can’t get off of.  But ultimately she, and only she put herself in this position. This could’ve all been avoided with just a little transparency and answering questions .  And yes, the “normies”  never at last long because they have something to lose when this all blows up .",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Oh I agree.  [ORGANIZATION] is gonna be texting all her clients that have no phones (since they can’t call 911)…and saying WE NEED A LINE!!!!,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Her home where small children live. That poor father must be beside himself [ORGANIZATION]. Praying that [PERSON]’s not [DATE] he gets the call that somethings happened.,12
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,If you notice [ORGANIZATION] always says “we pay for their sober living” clearing sounds as if it’s paid for endlessly. That is not the case. The deposit and [ORGANIZATION] is paid. Clearly her description is to get more funds in to go to her family.,8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,She definitely depends on her [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]aid drinker to blindly stick up for her or be nasty to anyone who questions anything.,9

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yeah, I'll agree the local media comment sections are a cesspool of hateful morons. I had to unfollow all that nonsense. But if you look at it closer, it's mostly a handful of the same idiots commenting everywhere. I don't even want to imagine what their lives are like that they spend [DATE] online spewing all that stuff. I mean, shit, I've been dealing with a chronic illness for [ORGANIZATION] and I'm not usually in the best headspace, but I didn't turn into someone like that.",7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,I have a question about [ORGANIZATION]. Can she remove negative comments from her feed? I know that you can from ORG1 because I’ve seen it happen.,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Isn’t it [ORGANIZATION] ???? Oh wait they only have a couple paltry ramen noodles left,6

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,The guy is completely unhinged. [ORGANIZATION] still mentions how he helped her out in the beginning. All of the scammers know one another.,3

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Never heard of him either!!,1
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yes she doesn’t even seem to know the latest resource for addiction. The village of [ORGANIZATION] will pay for anyone to get substance abuse treatment, even if they don’t live there. Why not use that? 

Every social worker is only as good as their resource list.",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yes , the [ORGANIZATION] she must of self diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.  How did she know he had Alzheimer’s as she stated he was dropped off by someone. Maybe a police officer. lol ok sure .  Then she sends this man off to some [INSTITUTION] that he remembers in his state of confusion.  I mean why call an agency that could actually help him. God knows where he ended up , if this story is actually true.   Again her mindless followers just gobble this garbage up. No one questions if sending a man with dementia off on his own is a good idea ?? Oh wait, it’s literally against the law to question anything.",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"It’s nice to see people see the truth. Grassroots and mutual aid can be a beautiful thing. In [ORGANIZATION], there is an amazing network of volunteers helping refugees. They work with existing services and they are most definitely filling in the gaps. There are people crossing boundaries there too, the difference is that the group has rules and people in charge enforce them. It appears to be run by people with social service experience. [ORGANIZATION] is not this. It’s a cult.",9
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Only if they are really desperate and have no other choice. I met someone at a conference who is high up in the [LOCATION] distribution chain. She mentioned [ORGANIZATION] (state wide conference for [ORGANIZATION]) and I asked her if she knew miss PERSON0. Her face said it all. I just said I know.,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Maybe for clothes, hygiene items and a lunch. But for actual services no [STREET]!!!!",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,She will not apply for grants because every step of the funds are required to be tracked. She can’t steal with that. Or get her mortgage and utilities paid for [DATE] which is actually in [ORGANIZATION]’s name,10
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I doubt she would or could put the work involved to earn one. Anything worth it would require a lot more experience and capital to pull off. Not to mention all the reporting, etc. Grants are a lot of work.",7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,She has stated before that people who volunteer have to take a food safety course and pay for it themselves. For her to give out sandwiches that are made by the general public should be enough to get her shut down as a public health issue.,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"If there’s tags she will return them! Lol 
She was spotted returning close to $400 in clothing at [ORGANIZATION] with tags on them still, stating oh these don’t fit me. She wanted the money obviously and it was from people donating clothing items…",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I recall reading something like this before, without the store name…so it’s been floating around.",7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Some of it might be that if the media did do its job and really dig into [ORGANIZATION], they’d find out it’s a lot worse than we think and they be accused of not doing their jobs. It’s been going on for a long time according to these comments, yet the media has done very little reporting on [ORGANIZATION].",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Even if she didn’t buy them?  I don’t really know how that works at all when it’s through her [ORGANIZATION] wish list!,4

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Sure hope all the donors to that particular scam are reading this. You literally could have burned your money .  Again not only did she not save anyone, it’s just another example of more harm than good being done.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,I saw that too and wondered about the same details.  [PERSON] how there is no accountability,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Can’t post about [ORGANIZATION], she’ll block you so fast. Then you can’t see her silent videos anymore.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Correct! She muscles her [STREET] into things that no one wants her a part of and then she can say look at me and all the good I do.,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"I thought it was a show meant to provide cover for politicians that are not seriously addressing the fent problem here. Don’t get me wrong, plenty of the people present care about the issue deeply. Many just don’t get that a major part of the problem is the folks they are asking to help. Folks have been begging for help and just not being listened to. The reality is that many of the politicians present, especially [ORGANIZATION] literally do not act on what they think is right, they act on doing what they think will get them re-elected.

Honestly, it’s pretty horrifying when you realize how little of a fuck they actually give. Especially considering what some of them do in their free time….",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,I don’t have Facebook,3

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"She won't ever give an update, you are 100% spot on with transparency. Many people gave their hard earned money to her for that building that still isn't being used [ORGANIZATION]. They deserve answers. Update about the [STREET] case too. And the fines, are they being paid? Crickets. Show all the tax forms for this Non/not for profit. Either you get a lot of cash (almost 40K) DATE1, or you don't get a lot of cash donations which is what was posted back in DATE2 by [ORGANIZATION]. All she has is her Facebook page to promote her cause. You can bet her page is monitored closely, all it would take is one person to say...you all should head to [[URL]]([URL]) and search for ""Rockford"" to get the true story. It would get deleted in a matter of minutes I bet. And yes to the FIVE HUNDRED gift cards, they can't be all gone. They are meant to be handed out. I wish they were traceable.",10

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Its definitely not a safe [STREET] for any child. I hope the father can soon get custody. And sadly at this rate it looks like [ORGANIZATION] and the system are failing those kids. Just hope it doesn’t turn into one of those cases where something bad has to happen in order for people to WAKE up… but sadly thats where this seems to be headed.,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,YES !!!! Another embellishment of her good work. How much good. will [ORGANIZATION] do and who’s is paying for [PERSON] ??,9
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,So it is [ORGANIZATION] of sober living!???!  Who the hell is going to be helped by [PERSON] of expenses!?!,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Not sure where you got that information. In my experience she pays for [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION] are needed until the person is able to afford their own living.

Edited for spelling",2
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,How can we get her ORG0 shut down for scam/fraud?,4
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Yes, and if you really make her mad, she can block you so you can’t comment again, or read her page.",4

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,[ORGANIZATION] used to own part of the [ORGANIZATION] - with Dr. [PERSON]?? I never realized that. How does this guy make money? Seriously?!?!,3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Also [ORGANIZATION] used to participate in his DATE0 challenges where they went to various gyms in the community to work out. It was back when [PERSON] was pushing his weight loss methods because that PERSON2 kid lost over 100 lbs thanks to [PERSON]. Or so he claimed.,3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,He totally is. The gym I used to go to was a big supporter of him for a long time… not anymore. They even removed his fridge. I was shocked because the owners of the gym are shady.,2
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Just breathe 815 is his kids charity. He added me on [ORGANIZATION] but he is unhinged in his rants,3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Her being a self credentialed medical expert, social worker, or whatever she needs to be to fit the narrative drives me bat shit crazy.  This is why she is so dangerous.  Rational people know their limits and get the right kind of help. Just because I had a hip replacement, doesn't make me an [ORGANIZATION] specialist, and her claimed life experiences doesn't make her a social worker.",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,This is what’s needed here. People with actual experience explaining how it should be done and how dangerous her methods are .,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Sometimes words are[LOCATION] necessary 😜,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"She states she relies solely on the donations of the community. I don’t believe she’s accepted any grants as you have to provide financials and there’s oversight and her stuff is fabricated and she only reports what she wants to report. Real easy to leave out a few thousand here and few thousand there when you do it yourself. Also, she’s requested multiple times for gift cards which you can’t track as well. As well as her [ORGANIZATION] donations, meal train so no food has to be provided by her, [ORGANIZATION] list for the people she enables as well as her household and [ORGANIZATION] gifts… the avenues for donations are all covered. How convenient! 🙄",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,That is my thoughts!!! PERSON0,6

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"At this point, I can only hope that there’s some behind-the-scenes research and digging that is going on by the media.

PERSON1 we do provide everything that people need when going to treatment (clothing, toiletries, new socks/underwear, shoes, etc).

There have been a few people that have said they have been “turned away” and I have reached out to several of them but have not heard back. 

If someone comes to Miss PERSON2’s and there is something that we can help them with we most certainly will. 

Please remember DATE2 are [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and [PERSON]. People can come shop on [ORGANIZATION] and talk about going to treatment or get resources for housing or other needs.

A legitimate [STREET] would have paid professionals doing this work, not free addicts.  Does she pay the addicts with cash, drugs, cigarettes, or all of the above !?!?",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"For [ORGANIZATION] she has been helping people into sober living, she has paid [LOCATION]. This must have changed recently. I know several people who have had their living paid for until they get jobs and are stable.",4
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Correct, she does not pay for continuing sober living. Not to say that she may or may not have had a one off situation but the general practice is what [ORGANIZATION] states and NOT continuing.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,Be careful. He reposts things he has done from [ORGANIZATION] and presents them as though they were done [LOCATION]. We should talk about all of the schemers in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] is another one.,5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 9- Name dropping and reading 'between' the lines,27,"Honestly from [ORGANIZATION].  I am biased tho bc I knew some of her lying behavior from mutual friends and I witnessed the PERSON0 FB incident which made it clear she was looking for clout and attention. To be fair, she may have been right about the [PERSON], I wouldn’t known and I support people calling out “me too” even if it’s messy. But one of the comments from the waitress always stuck with me-she said “PERSON2, you were here [TIME] and everything was fine, what happened?”

I would not call this social work and legally she can’t call herself that. I would say this is one of the worst examples I have ever seen of someone using “social work” to grift people and simultaneously fuck them up and be sloppy. I have seen a lot of veterans lie about their service and start advocacy and outreach groups. I worked for a vet like that. He took over a small agency on the south side and used the grant money to pay for his meals (not business like grub hub) and suits. But he never got involved with the clients so they were safe and handled appropriately. That staff did a lot of grassroots work with the homeless in the area who were not our clients. Linking them with services. We had a rotating schedule to feed them [LOCATION] and we fed them out of our own pockets. They ate the same food that we did. No one ever got on FB and asked for handouts lol. 

Anyone in the field who hears about a direct service [STREET] that doesn’t use grants, doesn’t pay people, and doesn’t follow mandated reporting is going to immediately see the red flags. 

From what I heard from insiders who work for the big players in social services in [ORGANIZATION], some worked with her because there was nothing. Like she said the hospital reached out to her to get people to rehab. Well if that’s true, the hospital must have been utterly up a creek without a paddle and forced to d/c. This happens regardless of the quality of hospital or the staff. It’s due to payer issues. 

Sorry for the long rant I could go on forever lol.",7

I'd argue that she's probably too unstable to be around her kids, especially if she's using again. It always felt like she used them for attention or as a PR prop and it was disgusting. They deserve a present parent who makes them feel safe and cared about and heard. If something did happen to them, who would they tell and who would do anything about it? If it's true that [ORGANIZATION] has been assaulted in the past, how fucked up is it that she's putting her own children around literal sex offenders, so it can happen to them, too?!

She blasted them on FB and bragged about the other company she used, during [TIME] mind you. I thought that was super crappy of her.

If [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] page turned commenting off, you can bet the donations would go [STREET] down.

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"there is so much research available proving that harm reduction from providing condoms, clean needles etc. is effective in increasing public health and doesn’t “enable” addicts and/or victims of trafficking. Public initiatives to disperse condoms were one of the primary ways the AIDS epidemic was mitigated. Religious-oriented organizations simply don’t provide these resources. You are free to donate as you wish, but your weird obsession with tearing down a clearly popular and visible resource in the community isn’t helping anyone. Miss [PERSON] is not perfect and certainly should be subject to skepticism, but let me know when you start your own flawless community organization!",41
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"As someone who has direct experience with homeless people and addicts I can say that the work she does is definitely helping people. I can't say anything about financials. I don't work for her, I rarely donate, I have volunteered twice, and I know people that have utilized her services. 

I feel it's worth putting the knowledge I do have, out there as I'm not seeing many people mention some of these specifics.

1. Homeless people and addicts are usually viewed as ""less than,"" even when trying to get into facilities that are supposed to help them. From the people thst work there to the CEOs that establish protocol, the person who is struggling is VERY often either treated like shit or given hoops to jump through that are damn near impossible. PERSON0 speaks about this in a recent post about needing IDs and a phone to get into facilities. 

The people that I know that have been helped by her have been grateful to be ""met where they are at,"" with absolutely no shame whether they make it or not and are encouraged to keep trying. These people are you and me, they are someone's son/daughter/husband/mother/best friend etc. who just can't seem to get their footing back in normal society. I say this from experience, until you have really witnessed it or lived it, you cannot understand how difficult it is to get a job, keep a job, stay clean, or find housing.

2. You talk about a [STREET] that you consider comparable, [PERSON]'s [STREET] (and I am fully aware of others: [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, etc.) As another person mentioned, there are rules and regulations that make getting help difficult. It may not meet someone where they are at. The Christianity aspect being one.

Sure, they could get in, but what about when they get kicked out because some counselor has an attitude [ORGANIZATION] and says they are being aggressive when really their emotions are completely raw from withdrawing? Back to the streets. Perhaps they try again to go there in [LOCATION] or 2. This time they use once and are told to leave. This cycle can continue for all of the shelters/programs etc. Eventually the person feels too ashamed to go anywhere feeling like a total failure or is blacklisted with nowhere else to go.

3. Harm reduction is HUGE. It keeps people alive long enough to give them a [ORGANIZATION] to get recovery.

4. Referencing what some have said about the buildings and her living situation and such: if you go back to the beginning, she just lived there in a sketchy neighborhood on a drug addled [STREET] with hookers. She offered a meal once and an idea seemed to be born. Due to the connections of people she already had from growing up in the area, people shared her first post and it just started to grow. In my personal opinion, it grew [STREET] too fast for anyone to manage, let alone an addict with DATE2 off hard drugs. 

Systems were not put into [STREET], positions were not made, they seem to just keep trying to catch up with what's in front of them. Adding storage, buying buildings, needing more as popularity grows. It's a hot mess there, but my personal opinion is that the intention is still to serve, while having no model to go off of. First meals, then clothing, then donations, then volunteers, then treatment, then meals for volunteers, gifts for kids in poor families, etc. I have seen the thousands of sandwiches and the backpacks full of treatment supplies and the free phones and the donation room jam packed and bustling. 

5. My final thought for now is that I greatly appreciate that she brings humanity and thus support to a group of people that are often rejected by society. When the ""worshippers"" of facebook make comments cheering someone on to go to treatment. That person gets to hear about that when they would normally be completely isolated with no support. It also opens the non-homeless/addicted/trafficked person's eyes to see these people out in their world and be a bit kinder. 

I think that's all I have. I appreciate the openness in which you are presenting your questions, so I felt my reply would be heard.",10
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Her husband also has a state-of-the-art [ORGANIZATION] machine. Wonder how that was paid for? I agree with most of what you said, not the needle stuff though. Users are going to get high if they want to and all we can do is prevent them from doing it unsafely and offer education and support. But if they don't want help after all of that and tell you they're going to shoot up anyways, why not offer a clean needle to prevent transmission of diseases/bacteria's?",3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,Her kids are NOT okay- saw one of them recently and am still struggling with the changes I’ve noticed in [ORGANIZATION]. Wanted to call [ORGANIZATION] but I’m sure they’re already involved..,3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"I don't think you understand what it's like to be an addict or trafficked. She does. She understands that if you get someone intl treatment and they already smoke cigarettes that providing them that small vice will help them in the long run to quit hard drugs like heroin, cocaine and [LOCATION]. It's incredibly difficult to quit smoking regular nicotine cigarettes on their own. Having to do that while quitting hard drugs can make quitting the hard drugs impossible. When my own mother had to go inpatient for alcoholism to get her kids back they tried to force her to quit smoking and she refused because she couldn't do both at the same time.

She isn't taking away resources because people chose where to donate too. Anyone can encourage others to donate to other charities instead. She can't even take everything people want to donate all the time. She does feed people, she gets people into drug treatment by earning their trust and making them believe they can get clean and stay clean. You can't force addicts to work with counselors if they aren't ready to. That just continues to leave them on the streets with no one they can trust.

She administers and teaches others how to administer narcan. She feeds people, she gets people into drug treatment, she helps people access services when they might not know where to start or how to access those services.

[ORGANIZATION] aren't ruining people's lives the [STREET] hard drugs are. 

Clean needles help prevent the spread of disease, condoms help prevent the spread of disease. She helps keep these people alive while building trust so that she can get them into treatment.

What's the goal here? You are absolutely free to donate to [ORGANIZATION] or any other local charity if you want or advocate for those same charities.

Do you even know if maybe [ORGANIZATION] might also be working with ORG1 to help close gaps and prevent people from slipping through the cracks.",14
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Uhh Miss [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] sucks but trafficking is a huge problem in [ORGANIZATION] (worst in the state) and supplying houseless folks with resources does help tremendously.

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,I’m curious what she’s listed under. When I searched on the [ORGANIZATION] website for tax exempt organizations it says “Your search did not return any results” She is listed through [ORGANIZATION] as a not for profit corporation. My understanding is you can be a ORG1 but that doesn’t automatically make you tax exempt unless you’ve applied for 501c3 status.,5
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"I know a social worker who has volunteered for her, and she never said anything to me about how she volunteers with Ms. [PERSON] until I said she should. I remember I went to drop off some burgers because there was a post about how they had run out of sack lunches. I was confused and taken aback when one of the volunteers asked ME if I wanted food. It left a good impression on me. I also know a lot of other people who swear by her and have given time and resources to her organization. I trust their judgment far more than I trust yours.

You're worried about her reducing the amount of money that other organizations have access to, and you've made it clear that [ORGANIZATION] is a favorite of yours. That's not how charity works, philosophically speaking. Do you think that the people who run FAC0 get mad when people donate time or money to ORG1, ORG2, or [PERSON]? They most certainly do not. You seem to have what a professor of mine called the ""my [LOCATION]"" mentality. Everyone is so wrapped up in what bowl they see as theirs that they forget that it all comes from the same box.",11
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,So if she doesn’t hand them out. They over dose on a dirty needle. A clean needle keeps them safe from diseases and other health problems that clog up our healthcare system. So I don’t see your point because it’s fucking stupid. Also I don’t care for [ORGANIZATION].,3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,Yes,11
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,I wouldn’t but if it’s not illegal what can you do?,1
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,I don’t know about miss [PERSON]. Had an annoying encounter with them recently but I support clean needles for addicts and condoms for people who can’t afford them. Or do we just let them get sick from dirty needles and burden our healthcare system.,15
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"[ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]?


A big part of being homeless in [ORGANIZATION] was just trying to find a [STREET] to exist without being expected to pay money. [PERSON] was great for this. They made you get a case manager but that was super easy and quick and genuinely helped you with things. I frequently got shaving stuff and clothes. They would give you a tote to store stuff. The food was always perfectly acceptable and there was no extortion with making you sit through church stuff. Of course they had the church stuff but it was after the food and if you didn't want to listen you didn't have to. You could read or anything else quiet.

[ORGANIZATION] treated it's men like criminals. The hours they made you keep made it impossible to get or hold a job. The security people that were supposed to guard your stuff frequently stole. I had a friend who was working overnights at ORG2 but the head guy named [ORGANIZATION] didn't believe him for some reason so he had to sleep outside. You woke at [TIME] and had to be back at the shelter at [TIME] if you were late at all you were locked out. The people in charge would constantly threaten you with being kicked out and really relished the small amount of power they had. They forced you to come back at [DATE] DATE0 a week to listen to the [STREET] that PERSON1 went for being a pedo.

It was horrible. Fuck that [STREET]. I went to jail afterwards and it was legit an upgrade.

And full disclosure I was in active heroin addiction so of course that colors my experiences. I am [PERSON] now though.

EDIT: There were several places that helped me out. ORG3 gave me free coffee and breakfast. The [PERSON] church by the disaster house was incredible to me. And people at both hospitals were great. They were so much nicer than I deserved.",10
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"I have never heard of that term. It actually makes sense.  I wonder what really did happen earlier in her life.  I wonder is she has some truth mixed in with lies.  Was her mom really murdered while she was sitting in jail?  Did she really live in a cardboard box on skid row for [ORGANIZATION]?  I am guessing she did abuse drugs, that I can sense is true.  But how much is truth and how much isn’t?",3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Thank u, this is the type of thing I want to open people’s minds to.  One of the videos recently showed these items placed in a bin near the children’s toys.",7

kinda sullies the ""charity"" part of her business model doesn't it? gives me the impression all that effort isn't coming from a good intention and the shady stuff doesn't help her case either. not sure why people would support an organization like that",3

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,Ms. [PERSON] is also a pretty splitting figure. [ORGANIZATION] claims to have all these resources but it doesn’t.,4
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"You seem to really be not understanding that a lot of folks simply will not be able to meet the requirements needed to go through with some of the other agencies. The “take what works and leave what doesn’t” approach is the key to harm reduction. 

I encourage you to read up on harm reduction and its goals of meeting “folks where they are at”. It’s meant to keep folks alive until/if they are ready for more traditional programs. 

Did you know Miss [PERSON] is far from the only person/group using a harm reduction/mutual aid approach? There are networks in [ORGANIZATION] that have existed for [ORGANIZATION]. Especially in the housing projects, these are kept very low key to prevent police incursion. [ORGANIZATION] is also using this model. [ORGANIZATION] actually has a higher overdose rate than [PERSON] and like I said earlier has the worst trafficking problem in the state. It would horrify most if they knew how entrenched it is and just who exactly is using these women (and trans folks and some young men). Think rich white powerful men.

I say all of this out of respect to be clear.",6

Those other organizations you listed, I sure would think there is information out there that is readily available if anyone asked.

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"It is a result of scarcity mentality. There is enough need to go around. I also get annoyed with the social media aspect of [ORGANIZATION] but it works for their model. I don't think that she is enabling anyone but giving an option, meeting people where they are. Not everyone who has needs wants to access a religiously oriented service provider, like ORG1. Not everyone who has needs requires the services provided by ORG2 either. Choice is a good thing.",4
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Well said. Ultimately, [ORGANIZATION] is a mildly effective, mildly mismanaged charity that isn’t big enough to prevent others from operating.

Would I hand out needles at my house?  No, but that's an odd metric to go by.   I wouldn't offer pregnancy ultrasounds or info on housing at my house either.

Better question is, if she's not handing them out, where can addicts get clean needles / condoms /etc otherwise?   If the answer is ""nowhere"" then at least she's providing a unique service to those in need.",4

You can message me if you prefer.",2
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"The state passed legislation [ORGANIZATION] to allow the purchase of needles without an Rx at any pharmacy.  They then created a program to permit needle exchanges.  These permitted exchanges  need to operate with complimentary services and have medical staff present.  

[ORGANIZATION] is in no [STREET] a permitted exchange location.  She had a lengthy video where she stated that she exchanged needles at [TIME].  My questions are:  What happens to the needles she collects. Are these needles handled safely?  Are there [PERSON] of people needing needles in the middle of the [TIME]?  Where are her kids when these people are showing up at [TIME]?

[LOCATION] is also pretty easy to get, I believe there are a few free venting machines around town.  

We will disagree on the effectiveness of harm reduction when it comes to drug use.  I consider it enabling.

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,Ok,3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,It sure is a unique service when children are exposed.  I don’t think comparing needles to ultrasounds and housing is a good example.  A better example would be selling drugs out of the house.  The point is it’s a danger to kids.,1

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Yeah of course! And in the end I had to get reasonable-ness beaten into me by life. [ORGANIZATION] was the biggest part of that for me. I had some warrants that I was running from and by the time they caught me I was done. Well, more specifically I wanted to be done. Really wanted to be done with everything. No weed no alcohol not even diphenhydramine. All of those things eventually led me to the needle and I had fought that for the longest time.

So I got picked up and sat in jail in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] waiting for extradition. I didn't think they were coming after the second night but they came and I sat in jail in my home county for [LOCATION] and got drug [STREET] and went to rehab. The jail was good because I had really gotten all of the drugs out of me. I wasn't having dreams about using or anything so when I got to rehab I wanted to listen.

What would serve the community more, remodeling FAC0 so it has a shiny new entrance or giving a school or two an upgrade so people can get off the [STREET] and away from dealers?

Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"Trafficked can mean many things, it’s often very subtle but involves coercion. I could really expand on this but it’s difficult to talk about. It is indeed a huge problem in [ORGANIZATION]. I legit get scared talking about it on public forums.

According to the ORG0:

“Human trafficking, also known as trafficking in persons, is a crime that involves compelling or coercing a person to provide labor or services, or to engage in commercial sex acts. The coercion can be subtle or overt, physical or psychological.”",3
Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,44,"It’s literally not true that the people addicts use/abuse during their active addiction are minimized and thought to be AH. There are resources for the loved ones of addicts, but you have to be willing to reach out and use them, much like an addict has to for their own recovery. It’s terrible you’ve had such a history with addicts, but addiction IS a disease. These people are not “junkies”. They’re human beings that literally have a disease. Now that is not an excuse for the addict’s bad behavior, but your jaded view of addicts is unhelpful. We don’t have to agree to disagree over the effectiveness of harm reduction because there’s actual studies and statistics that proves they work, and that they’re not “enabling” addicts. 

That being said, and while harm reduction IS effective, that does not mean everyone is on here defending [ORGANIZATION] and her “needle program”. She has no business exchanging needles if she lacks the proper pieces that need to be in [STREET] to be able to exchange needles legally. What she was doing was illegal, and in fact, NOT harm reduction. She was actually causing more harm by illegally exchanging needles that who knows if they met the proper standards and policies. That is reckless and harmful and could have caused a whole host of problems, with the most severe being death. That’s on top of the fact that she has minor children in her home and should not be running a needle exchange in the [STREET] in which they need to be kept safe.",2

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 6- blankets, [ORGANIZATION] service , and [STREET] hearings coming up",39,"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

Here are some links on the work the city does.

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 6- blankets, [ORGANIZATION] service , and [STREET] hearings coming up",39,"Thanks for your response!  I took your advice and did indeed “check” myself,  I reread your comment where you indicated she deals with things other organizations don’t want to deal with.  My response indicated there is other places that offer services. Your most recent response to me lists such organizations, which validated my response.  Is there enough services? Probably not , but that is not unique to [ORGANIZATION].  No city has endless funds to solve or manage every issue.  As far as the needle exchange she had no authority to do that and was recently shut down.   Yes she gives out sandwiches, but no where near the amount she says. She does get some people in rehab in [ORGANIZATION] , which in itself is suspect.  Almost every other [STREET] has a waiting list. Why not share with other organizations this rehab, so even more people could be helped?  Her housing is getting a few people in a hotel for [LOCATION] every once in a while. [ORGANIZATION] rescue mission offers beds also.  They also offer hot meals.  [ORGANIZATION] offers breakfast and lunch along with laundry service among many other things. So like I said, she isn’t offering things no one else wants to deal with .I certainly appreciate your blind loyalty to her “mission” and you have every right to that.  Others have a right to question the validity of her over the top claims. Checks and balances are a good thing.

"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 6- blankets, [ORGANIZATION] service , and [STREET] hearings coming up",39,"Thank you for your response. I have personally been inside Miss [PERSON]'s and have seen first hand the work that she provides for the homeless, addicted and mental ill. I definitely did not do an inventory of the food she hangs out on a [DATE] basis. So I'm not gonna speak on that at all. I did visually see her speak to an individual that was gonna go AWOL on probation, while helping a handicap women in a wheel chair with her adolescent child get some clothes and food, at the same time help another individual get into drug rehab. All within [TIME]. She and her facility are trying to help where she can. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted at these posts tearing down an organization that is here to help. 
Before I go out of my [STREET] to ridicule someone in any fashion, I need to look at myself and ask ""have I done everything to help this individual with their mission?""  Because if I have not done that, all I'm doing is judging.  And then the next question is why? Am I ashamed of my lack of cooperation in this mission? Am I projecting my own bullshit into someone else?
 And for me, there's only one ultimate judge. And it ain't me and it definitely ain't you. 

When I was there she told me she was raided by the police. And no citations were given, they found nothing illegal. She also said they have been audited several times. Again, no fines. With the needle exchange, she told us it takes a special certification and the city wasn't handing any out. (That is another question for [ORGANIZATION]) However, they had to stop that program.  Again, no citations were handed out. 
Let me ask you a person question, if I may. 
If you saw [PERSON] out to dinner with her family would you say hello or would you come on here and ridicule her? [PERSON] on her, say things like, how dare she eat in a restaurant! How dare she [STREET] a car and not take the bus or public transportation! How dare she wear clean clothes!

One only has to simply look at all the ‘professional’ women volunteers that have left (and spoken up) to know something is sketchy.  If she didn’t help ‘anyone’, she wouldn’t have lasted this long.  But she helps a few here and there, but the rest is smoke and mirrors.  I have done all the work for you to figure this out.  But if you are still not convinced, please transfer your entire checking account to her 😁.  I really don’t care!  I have already donated some of my money elsewhere 👍",4
"Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] 6- blankets, [ORGANIZATION] service , and [STREET] hearings coming up",39,"Really? The is what she told you. Well of course it is. Now let me direct you to her financials she just posted where she asked for a one time audit waiver. So she has only done [ORGANIZATION] of financials which one of those were part of the several times?  We know it wasn’t DATE1. Her  home was raided several times perhaps you can get those police reports and let us all see !!!  My guess is it’s all public record.  

If you bothered to read any of these posts I have clearly stated I volunteered down there and you will notice other volunteers have posted what they saw first hand.  So I don’t  need to ask myself if I helped this organization.  

Now the needle exchange, so the city isn’t giving out certification, so she just said what the hell. I will just do it anyway.  Because the rules don’t apply to her .

As far as you comment about would I ridicule her if she was out for dinner. That literally has nothing to do with this conversation.  A family minding their own business and enjoying their dinner is a far cry from someone soliciting millions of unaccounted for or loosely accounted for donations.  

Oh, and I just want to ask you real quick what you think of that great video she posted DATE2 of one of her volunteers seizing on the floor yes, that’s right she literally videotaped a volunteer having a seizure on the floor. Now don’t bother to go find it because of course she’s deleted it after several people threw a fit , isn’t she such an angel and doing so much good for our community? 

You don’t need to bother to respond to me because I’m not gonna do this little back-and-forth with you . You do you and I’ll do me and I will not feel one bit bad about exposing what the hell is going on down there.",4

She can put on a show for anyone, that’s what she does. She has zero education and certification to be “helping” addicts, homeless, mentally ill, sex offenders, traffickers, and trafficked… oh and now migrants. No one is saying that she doesn’t feed and give some basis essentials out. That is the cover for a larger operation… What is happening is that she is bringing in millions, check her tax records that are being referred to and are public record as well, and that’s just what she has reported. There is nothing and no one holding her accountable and tracking the things that come in. The city is suing her for non-compliance, again public record. She stated in an interview as well that she had to create programs to tie a receipt to, cooking the books, again public post and you can watch it and the city state the [STREET] isn’t safe as well to work or live in. If you continue to look into things you will find that the story’s she posts contradict each other and are all just too good to be true. Are some people helped? 1 out of the 20 in her numbers. The stories and the numbers just aren’t factual. The number she states she feeds… not true and she’s been told that and ignores it. She’s been asked questions about the financials and then the normies (non addicts) are dismissed as if we just were supposed to go along with what she is doing and watch her taking advantage of folks.

She posted she did this back in [ORGANIZATION] which hello folks are back as evidence to her escalating desperate posts and videos. The person she presents herself as on FB is not real. Anyone who is sober can see this almost immediately when you meet and speak to her. She thrives on utilizing people she can control and make into her flying moneys, the narcissist [STREET].

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"It is curious that so many of the people going to her rehab and sober living can go away for [ORGANIZATION] with no income.  Nobody has a job, has to arrange medical leave and can leave on short notice? Nobody has a partner or children that will need help?  

If someone is truly homeless in [ORGANIZATION], the city's [ORGANIZATION] program will get them sheltered, and then work through the other issues with a case worker.  Is it perfect and is it easy? No, but they are effective and aren't isolating people at a facility 100 miles away.  The city is also utilizing programs that will provide long term help.  This is in addition to the homeless prevention programs. 

I will say it again.  For someone who claims to have been victimized so much, she ignores the dangers of not having boundaries when it comes to her family safety.  She has a strange fascination with sex offenders.  

There are scores of vacant buildings in that area that could have been used, instead of a live-work arrangement.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",0

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"This....the ""homeless"" guy could have called 911 from where he found the other guy. Very rare that someone doesn't have a phone [ORGANIZATION].  My guess is they were using together and he drove there so he could ditch before being questioned.  The guy who OD was in the passenger seat.  He either put himself there, or had is 6'2"" 260 pound body pulled across the center arm rest.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"She is a narcissist.  I have no idea how her followers can’t see that.  I wonder if the driver was high or had a warrant…and that’s why they went to her instead of to the hospital.  She needs to tell these people to dial 911.  Not run to [ORGANIZATION].  There is a system in [STREET] that works better than her system.  They have cell phones.  Even 90+% of homeless people have cell phones.

I encourage everyone to go to [ORGANIZATION] mugshots and search for miss [ORGANIZATION].",8
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"I use cannabis [ORGANIZATION], and I think I'm a pretty modest person. I'm not blazing blunts in public, and function well enough to take care of my home by myself.  

I've heard the term ""dry drunk"" used to describe a person in recovery who's personality and behavior didn't improve. They use  sobriety to justify their [ORGANIZATION]. Someone commented why they just didn't go straight to the [LOCATION]. She said it was 8 blocks away and too far with a dying g person. [ORGANIZATION] is not eight blocks from her. That part of town is pretty much a straight shot to [ORGANIZATION], with very little traffic, so wherever they started from was not much further from her to make a difference, maybe two very short blocks.",6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"Since I moved here,  I've lobbied the city to make improvements in my neighborhood.  The city has since spent millions fixing our streets and sidewalks, and making other improvements.  The city also demo'd quite a few blighted properties.  This work cost me nothing but my time to meet with people and send emails. I also pick up litter in my neighborhood DATE0, since that isn't a service the city provides.  Do these help the homeless and drug addicts, no.  But it helps the whole community look better, and have more pride where they live. 

I also was a care taker for someone during [PERSON] for DATE1 who couldn't live without help, and his family was in another state.   I also help a neighbor who has cognitive deficits with food, hygiene items, pet food and meds.  I volunteer with a couple of groups.  You will never see me posting about this IRL because I don't do it for recognition.",13
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"A lot of us volunteer and donate without advertising it. I know a lot of people who do the same and even a couple who actually work for local nonprofits, and all of them would donate to anyone else besides [ORGANIZATION]. 

Helping oneself to someone's social security checks and handing out heroin to junkies, if it's true, is not something I'd want to donate to and us not supporting her doesn't mean we aren't contributing our time and money to something else. [ORGANIZATION] isn't the end-all-be-all. This argument where if you're skeptical about her operation you're a lazy, shit person who just likes to complain is absolute bullshit.",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,I’ve lived here all my life. Never felt the need to brag about what I’ve done over [ORGANIZATION] for the city. I don’t need praise like some people.,4

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"The story here is there is a scam artist using other peoples' stories to make money.  The stories are embellished to make career criminals look like poor lost souls.  She inflates the number of people she serves, and how many homeless and sex workers there are in the area.  I live near her, and have been doing community advocacy for [ORGANIZATION]. Everyone I network with knows her hustle. 

What she projects is not what things are like in that area. Yes, there are a handful of people sleeping rough at times. but not [PERSON].  The area does not have dozens of women walking the streets, maybe a few in the bars at closing time.  Nobody was begging her to open her home in [TIME] to hand out needles and makeup.",26
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"Well those stories involve fraud, drinking, providing drugs to clients, and I just think it’s best if you read them yourself.  Go to [ORGANIZATION] and search Miss PERSON0.",14

I have known [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] in the rooms of [ORGANIZATION]. All of these erroneous claims really hurt to read and there is mild backing behind them.

I heard trough the grapevine that she was charged [ORGANIZATION] for having a nuciense property because of the needle exchange.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,So that’s a no. Keep shouting into the wind.,-5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,Murder - not as far fetched as thought.  It’s been said that she’s had made sure those seeking help are doped enough to get treatment.  When she takes things into her own hands by doping others it’s just a matter of time that someone dies in her hands.  If it hasn’t happened already.,10
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,U are totally right!  I didn’t catch that at first.  It’s the driver that was probably using and didn’t want to get in trouble.  There was probably no heroic homeless guy.  She is helping the driver get off free since he/she is probably high on something.  [ORGANIZATION]!,4
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,She should just get a job at the hospital as many times as she has saved people with CPR we could use the help.,7
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,Just naming her “nonprofit” after herself immediately sounded  alarm bells for me that she’s likely narcissistic.,3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,She also said he couldn’t [STREET] them to hospital because the don’t have a license.   Well they didn’t have a license when they drove them to miss [ORGANIZATION]’s either.  I am sure the benevolent homeless person was doing drugs with the guys with a [ORGANIZATION] in the car !!!!  But somehow this turns into the typical “look at me”  “ do you see my angel wings ? “post and how we have to feel for the parent who put their child in mortal danger. Because you know those addicts are always the victim. [ORGANIZATION]!,6
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"You have it exactly right!  Each post is a beautifully written fictional tale.  Seriously, anyone reading this, search her Facebook page and look up [ORGANIZATION].  Read how she tells her story.  [ORGANIZATION] has a constant criminal history.  Look up his record.  It goes back [ORGANIZATION].  Going back to post 4, recall a prior volunteer mentioned the bulk of the Facebook posts were lies.  Now you can see one happening before your own eyes!  The reason for this….money.",13

[PERSON] may have pieced together a few bits of info that is questionable, some disgruntled ex employees and those in the community who have had a bad experience, but you're not the authorities so stop being an arm chair judge. She's late on her taxes and has code violations. It's not like there's dead bodies piling up or some other fascinating crime.  And IF there is a crime taking [STREET], you're still not the authorities. I see a bunch of people convicting a person of a crime in public opinion and all over [ORGANIZATION], yet I've never seen a smoking gun proving guilt of anything.  It's code violations. [PERSON] got [ORGANIZATION] energy but it's all public opinion. Why don't we all wait to see what the city does. Also, do y'all not have a life? Sure do spend more time than necessary doing the city's job with the code violations. 😂 Also, no evidence is no evidence. If [PERSON] left the ""evidence"" before she left then there is no evidence.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"Because it keeps showing up, over and over.  Still under the guise of “I have no dog in the fight, I’m just a curious objective observer!”  But really they’ve always been coming from an angle of proving that [ORGANIZATION] is up to something nefarious, not objective at all.   Personally I’d receive it better if they didn’t pretend that they were just curious, and admitted they had it out for her. Just as some have a hard time swallowing what [ORGANIZATION] puts out there because the truthfulness is questionable, [ORGANIZATION]s posts are hard to swallow when they have garbage tags like “will the real pimp please stand up.” Hard to pretend to be objective like that.

This is coming from someone who’s [ORGANIZATION] said, I don’t think she’s 100% legit.  I’ve supported her, I will continue to do so, but I’m not stupid enough to think she’s an angel nor jaded enough as [ORGANIZATION] to think she’s a devil.  I think, in the grand scheme of things, she does more good than bad. That’s good enough for me because it’s more than I’m willing to do, and if she’s not doing everything by the book, so be it.  At least I’m honest about where I’m coming from, unlike [ORGANIZATION].  That’s why their posts are garbage, downvote all you want.",-5

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"I agree that's fucked up, but murder requires intent to kill. She'd have to be injecting them herself with lethal doses on purpose or something like that. They could get her for dealing drugs, though, if this is true.",5
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"The person needs to test positive for the drug they are wanting recovery from. They MUST fail or they won't be accepted. That's a fact. She wouldn't have to give them a drink or dose of anything to an addict bc the addict will do it themselves willingly, so that's a morbid thought created in your mind.

Please research this stuff before making these unfounded and outrageously false comments. That's just not right especially since it's a requirement to enter treatment while under the influence. It's the same everywhere, even [ORGANIZATION]. I just took someone to detox in [ORGANIZATION] who drank 2 tall boys and used all other party favors right before I drove them to detox and then transferred to an impatient treatment program. They have [ORGANIZATION] now. 

It's hard to believe any of these claims about her when there's so many things included that are from people's wild imaginations, flat out misinformation or people are simply unaware of how the system works.

And I can’t believe all of her followers praise her instead of saying, ‘these people need to go to the hospital!  The hospital is [TIME] away.  [ORGANIZATION] is close by.  Can someone sue her or the city if they die during this [ORGANIZATION] service she advertises?  

Or, even let’s go the next step, with the fentanyl that is often responsible for the overdoses, what if her kids get their hands on some?  This entire thing is just so dangerous.  These people are in her house with their product.  I can’t wrap my head around all of the dangers that are going on.",5

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,I know for a fact that she has doped up a person that had been clean for a short period of time to try to get them in for treatment and when she didn’t get them in that person lost the sobriety she had and had to regain momentum. You can’t safely dope anyone with risk.  My comment was was within reason,3
Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"What did people ever do in [ORGANIZATION] before [ORGANIZATION]?  Nobody drank or did drugs?  I know of another situation where one of her guys went to her instead of calling 911, and she drove with the guy to the OD location before she called 911.  There were at least four other people there, and all of them had phones.  She warned she was calling 911 at the OD location so people could leave before first responders showed up.  

Remember the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" when [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]'s when she ODs?  People that go to her, when the hospital is the same distance, don'want to be identified or asked questions. 

And just like that... [ORGANIZATION] is a self credentialed social worker/recovery expert/enterprise creator, and is also whatever she needs to be to fit the narrative.

Miss [ORGANIZATION] 5- the volunteers and the clients,35,"I'm not saying that doping up anyone is a good thing, however when anyone is admitted to treatment they have to be under the influence. I drop people off for treatment frequently and it's the same everywhere. [PERSON] if she doped that person up or not but you [PERSON] it was for treatment for someone who needed it otherwise why would they go?  Everyone I've ever taken to treatment has had to be under the influence every time. It doesn't matter what city: [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, GPE7... I've taken people all over and some of them DID lose their sober time to get in.  It sounds like you don't know how admission to treatment works. If the person wants to continue doing whatever it is to stay sober and not go to treatment that's fine but if you wanna get admitted you must test positive and that's a fact. I understand that you're upset that the person lost sobriety [ORGANIZATION] and wasn't admitted but there's all kinds of reasons why someone wouldn't get a bed. 

You're basically arguing about the admission rules which no one has control over, especially Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s. I'm sorry that happened to your friend but they're not the first and won't be the last. It's simply NOT her fault that those are the rules. It's the same for [PERSON] too.",1

Why would they accept someone to detox from something that's not in their system?  Some [ORGANIZATION]s are out of the system [ORGANIZATION] like alcohol and some drugs. They wouldn't be admitted especially not for a state bed, if the person didn't fail. They wouldn't need detox! They might need inpatient treatment but they wouldn't go to detox.

They can take my recovery suggestions or not but after taking about 20 people to detox bc they needed a ride etc I know how the admission process works.. You really shouldn't be accusing others of illegal and harmful activity without proof. I never once said that I was providing addictive things to addicts bc I personally haven't. I also have [ORGANIZATION] of sobriety, worked in a hospital, treatment center and those addicted in the community.

City of [ORGANIZATION] attempting to shut down Miss [PERSON]'s,54,"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

City of [ORGANIZATION] attempting to shut down Miss [PERSON]'s,54,"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",4

Thinking about moving back,14,"Don’t make a mistake we have been hit by the same housing boom.  But it’s still a [ORGANIZATION] at its core.  If you’re buying a house in certain parts of the city, you can still buy a house (and I’m going to use that as Broadly as possible), and you only pay 25 grand.  But you’ll get what you paid for.  I bought my house over by FAC0 in DATE0 for 110 K, I’m about to list it for 225.  But 225 for a four bedroom, 1600 square-foot house on a 1/4 acre lot is still cheaper than almost anywhere I can think of from a housing perspective.

You think [PERSON] could use more events?,26,Yes! I miss [PERSON]. I won tickets to see The Offspring DATE0 they put it on. It was a good time. I also miss [PERSON]’s apple fritter booth.

You think [PERSON] could use more events?,26,"I desperately miss waterfront. I was involved in the diy music scene for a long time ([ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], hipster house) and I miss having such a strong community in this realm. I grow tired of stroll on state and [ORGANIZATION] market being the main regular events in town.

If anyone has ever wondered why we stopped getting regular *large* concerts in town other than the handful of comedians and [ORGANIZATION] at the FAC0, it's a contractual thing. Most touring acts have to sign contracts that they will not perform within a specific distance and time frame at ""competing"" venues. Due to our location in regards to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and our lack of large venues other than the FAC0 and FAC1, performers are more likely to pass on GPE4 to get shows in these other cities that will turn out bigger numbers. 

After living downtown for [LOCATION], I kinda hate the lackluster events that happen there. [PERSON] is great but unfortunately has a few questionable locations (ORG2 owner [PERSON] is a disgusting piece of shit that takes advantage of his female tenants sexually and is a glorified slumlord).

Young at heart festival in [ORGANIZATION] has stopped because people acted like idiots.  I'm not sure if [ORGANIZATION] was stopped because of the same thing, or if it was a money issue, but I know people acted stupid there as well.",9
You think [PERSON] could use more events?,26,"I personally think there's more events than ever. Sure, it was down during [ORGANIZATION] and there's a few things that don't exist anymore, but I am really impressed with how many keep appearing. There's all sorts of cool stuff that wasn't here [LOCATION]. Beer festivals, food trucks, markets. 


Stroll on [ORGANIZATION] is an incredible accomplishment that takes DATE2 round planning and coordination along with many [PERSON] of learning from mistakes and improving. I'm one of people that puts on the Dasher Dash 5k that kicks off [PERSON] and it's mind boggling how much goes into the whole event. It's unfair to compare anything else in the area to that.


One thing I would say is that I have found the local governing bodies to be supportive of people that want to create and host events. The park district is [ORGANIZATION] to work with and have a bunch of different parks to choose from. It's easy and relatively inexpensive to get a permit and they have a long list of food trucks approved to serve at the parks. I used to think it sucked that there weren't many/any bicycle races in the area and now I'm part of a small group of people that puts on about 6 of them a DATE2. Most are at park district properties and I love working with them.

[ORGANIZATION] isn't perfect but you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere that is. [ORGANIZATION] is a wonderful [STREET] to live.",23
Considering a move to [ORGANIZATION] area,21,"1) I've gotten involved in stuff here. It's big enough to have some stuff going on, but not as big as a city like [ORGANIZATION] where everything is crowded / expensive / long waits. You go to events like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and see people you know. But it's not, like, a creepy small town where everyone knows everyone's business, either.

When I first moved here in [ORGANIZATION], I lived near a cafe in the east branch of the library that hosted regular poetry slams and open mics. I befriended the cafe owner and got involved in the poetry and comedy scenes. In [LOCATION] I became the host of the [ORGANIZATION] poetry slam. We've struggled during the pandemic, but [ORGANIZATION] when [PERSON] rolls around and I get to see my regulars perform and we all go get dinner afterward, it just warms my heart to see everyone together again. There are similar scenes for comedy / theater / music / board games / improv / minor league baseball / whatever you're into. There might only be one or two groups in the city for your interests, but if you go regularly, you'll become part of that community by default. Basically you get out of a [STREET] what you put into it.

The downtown area's good too. I am a single woman in [PERSON], and I'll happily [STREET] downtown and walk up and down FAC1 on a [ORGANIZATION] night, stop and watch the people playing cornhole outside [ORGANIZATION], wander into ORG2 and check out if the dance floor's hopping, and not think much of it. I grew up in the wealthier northwest suburbs where there wasn't much of a downtown, or rather many tiny downtowns, so it's nice to have more of a central [STREET] to go on [ORGANIZATION]. I know there are murders here and such, but I've never felt like I was going to be murdered. To be fair I live on the east edge of FAC1 near [PERSON]. (BTW I don't know what your budget is but there are some nice lots around GPE2 and [PERSON] where I see new houses going up, in FAC2 or whatever it's called). But I dated a guy on the west side for awhile and he was never really worried about it either. The shooters are a tiny minority that are mostly interested in shooting each other.

2) I hate how much other people grumble about it. My family has it in their head that it's a terrible [STREET] even though they've never even lived here. The local government can also be kind of conservative for GPE4. For instance it was DATE8 that the mayor officially declared it DATE9. Nothing crazy, we're still a blue state, but if you're from the [PERSON] you might experience a little culture shock. And I have heard from some people who are minorities that the police often treat them more harshly, but I don't know if it's possible to get away from that if you live in [PERSON]. There is currently a robust conflict going on between a dedicated group of protesters and [LOCATION] concerning some events [LOCATION]0 which you can research further if you like.

3) I was part of a really great improv group before the pandemic, but it dissolved when we couldn't meet up in person anymore, and it doesn't look like anyone's willing to take the lead in putting it back together. We'll see if improv ever returns to [ORGANIZATION]; improv groups have a [STREET] of popping up quickly and falling apart equally quickly. I also wish there were more coffee shops that were open late and businesses that were open on [LOCATION]1. I just want one branch of the library I can visit on [LOCATION]2, damnit; the closest is [PERSON] and I don't even have a library card there.

4) If you like nature, [ORGANIZATION] is probably the [STREET] to go. It's enormous, but the main hike around the lake is [TIME]. And if you're introverts, you might like [ORGANIZATION], a local book and record shop.",17

Places you must go.

2. I don’t really hate much, I guess the internet selection is not that great but for everyday use it’s fine. While crime can be high, there are plenty of safe places to live, and like someone mentioned earlier, nowhere is perfect

3. Honestly after being stuck inside forever due to FAC0, there isn’t much that I can complain about. Other than places I miss from [ORGANIZATION], I would say [PERSON] has everything that I’ve needed (reliable mechanics, variety of grocery stores, restaurants with gluten free options, etc.)

4. Some neat places to check out would be FAC1, FAC2, [ORGANIZATION] is a neat restaurant, [ORGANIZATION] is up in [PERSON] and that [STREET] is a local favorite of mine.

Considering a move to [ORGANIZATION] area,21,"This city is a diamond in the rough if you ask me. There's a lot of effort from the city as well as the residents to make this [STREET] a wonderful home for all. There's no shortage of things to do, lots of wonderful small businesses downtown. If youre looking for a good investment opportunity, then this is also a great [STREET]. Property is cheap around here, but several equity companies have invested millions of dollars improving the value of certain parts of the city. 

Unfortunately crime is a very real issue. Gun violence is very common. It's generally limited to the lower income areas but not exclusive. Robberies are also quite common. People [STREET] like complete ass out here, and the roads are fuckin terrible. 

I've lived here for the better part of [DATE], moved from a small country town near by. Overall this city catches a really bad rap because of the crime. People in the surrounding areas all come here to shop but generally talk bad about [ORGANIZATION]. The community has been reclaiming it's city the entire time I've been here and it's been quite liberating to be a part of. They've added murals all over downtown, tons of flowers, have removed several abandon buildings as well as bought some others for community projects.

The restaurant scene is improving, either off of old, family-owned places or new ones ([ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, FAC5, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON]); IMO we have a large immigrant population that influences parts of our city. It is progressing, although not as quickly as some people hope. There is [ORGANIZATION] in the works, one of the dilapidated buildings downtown has turned into a hotel, new art murals are going on the side of downtown buildings DATE2. I think it's [ORGANIZATION] bought a house here after living in downtown [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION].

A lot of people you see begging for money are probably not homeless though, just panhandling. 

As someone has said previously, it can be pretty blue collar, especially in the surrounding cities/towns & there are a [ORGANIZATION] of bars. But, I'm a bartender so it's proven to be a lucrative business to me. The music scene is lacking, but improving a little.

\-What do you love about [ORGANIZATION]/general area?

Good food scene if you're willing to put in the time and not just eat chain restaurants. Great parks, city and county, and [PERSON]. Lots of outdoor opportunities.

[ORGANIZATION] isn't that bad. Just suck it up and learn how to enjoy it with [LOCATION] outdoor activities (snowshoe, fatbiking, etc).

Decent enough bike infrastructure, could be better but doable. 

Cheap and good housing stock. Just choose your neighborhoods carefully.

Proximity to FAC0 for international travel! Also GPE2, [PERSON], GPE4 in general.

\-What do you hate about [ORGANIZATION]/general area?

[ORGANIZATION]. The taxes on homeowners here are ridiculous and make up about 45% - 50% of our mortgage payment.

Apathy. Never seen a more apathetic town anywhere I've lived. People like to talk shit about [ORGANIZATION], then do nothing about it.

What's one thing [ORGANIZATION]/general area lacks that you wish it had? (be it a store, restaurant, services, so on)

Korean food! [ORGANIZATION] food. Better vegan/vegetarian options.

What's one or two places we absolutely must visit when we're there DATE2? We're spending DATE3 in [PERSON] and then have [PERSON] left to dawdle in [ORGANIZATION]/general area, and some of which will be spent looking at homes for sale.

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8.

I’m confused as to why people haven’t talked about this more…. Isn’t it true that on an average home the property taxes are $750/ month? And that’s money that isn’t going into equity. Money just being lost [DATE]. [PERSON] has one of the highest tax rates in the country, but [ORGANIZATION] is double the average [PERSON] tax rate. It’s my understanding that because of the lack of a strong business tax base for the city to draw upon, they are struggling to pay pensions, and hike up property taxes to pay the debt. I’m an outsider considering a move to [ORGANIZATION] so I really hope I’m wrong. What has other people’s experience been?",2

We took a 9,000 mile [STREET] trip [ORGANIZATION] in search of greener pastures, and found that some cities with a meager population of 100,000 felt too big/busy for us, but a large part of that had to do with that [LOCATION], built right on the [STREET]'s edge architecture that I imagine the [ORGANIZATION] didn't/doesn't embrace. I know [ORGANIZATION] has a bigger population, but from the photos and videos I've seen of it, it feels [STREET] more spaced out, which my claustrophobic idiot self appreciates.",4
Considering a move to [ORGANIZATION] area,21,"I appreciate your input! Thanks so much.

I asked a friend who used to live in [ORGANIZATION] if she had any experience with [PERSON]. She had... not very nice things to say, including ""I would highly advise you not to move there,"" and when I asked why, she just said ""'cause it's gross."" So I immediately struck that one from the record. Parts of everywhere are ""gross""—that doesn't automatically make it a bad [STREET] to live.

Part of our research process was looking at crime statistics. Nowhere is without it and places where it's super low, we can't afford to buy. So when it boils down to ""would I rather be a victim of a robbery of some kind or a violent crime?"", the choice is pretty clear. I understand one of the big crime complaints for [PERSON] is shootings, but it sounds like steer clear of certain areas, mind your own business, and don't get involved with the gangs, and you *should* be okay, right?",4

The job market is pretty meh here too, as far as I can tell. If we can bring in more automation, we might be able to bring back some of the old manufacturing might this town once bristled with. We already have some decent basic manufacturing capability in the area, so the basic supply lines and support should already be here.

I think the positives for [LOCATION] outweigh the negatives. If it was a generic brand casino I think it would struggle, but the name recognition is huge and people travel to visit their different locations. Is it a huge amount of people? No, but it will help our area and put money in our economy. It’s a draw, and anything is better than nothing. 

I saw someone comment above about a company like [ORGANIZATION] moving here, hopefully to the west side. We need to be realistic. Any business or this size would be huge for our area but it would[LOCATION] go west of town—highway access is[LOCATION] readily available unless located close to 20, the work force unfortunately does[LOCATION] support this type of business, and it does[LOCATION] have the nearby amenities a large workforce would want near the workplace.",5

I think the process starts with growing education to sell to business that [PERSON] is here, and ready. [PERSON] only like [TIME] further from GPE4 than [PERSON], but we have GPE6 and GPE7 going the opposite [STREET]. We should have no excuses to be behind [PERSON] IMO lol.

I would never leave my bike open and unlocked where i live now on the north side of [PERSON] so why would I do any differently in another city? It's not a small town.

Unlike other commenters, I think [ORGANIZATION] has some fantastic outdoor activities available. FAC0 is a gem of a state park - great trails for biking/hiking and a nice lake for kayaking or fishing. The river affords tons of fun in [ORGANIZATION]. Also, it's [TIME] to [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON], which are about as pretty as it gets within 2 hrs of a global city in the LOC2.

There are some fine options for dining and entertainment as well, although there of course aren't as many as you would find in a larger city. If you need novelty DATE1, you might look elsewhere.

1. I live on the east side and it's not that bad. I have gone walking alone at [TIME] as a woman around the wetland path behind the [ORGANIZATION] fire station and not been bothered at all.
2. I don't have a house, but they seem to be pretty cheap. I pay $1000 / month rent for a two bedroom apartment with a garage and a laundry machine. Only thing is, I've known a couple people who bought older houses in the area (I'm talking [ORGANIZATION]) and weren't prepared to deal with unexpected maintenance problems, stuff like water in the basement, cracks in the foundation, etc. You sound like a reasonably competent home buyer though, just make sure to get a good home inspection.
3. Definitely safer on the east side. Biking to work, you may have trouble finding sidewalks and crosswalks depending where you are. There's a big bike path that runs down [ORGANIZATION] from FAC0 to FAC1 though, so that's nice.
4. FAC2 is about the same but a bit more redneck-y.
5. Sure, there's stuff I like, but that probably varies based on what you like to do. I host a poetry slam here [LOCATION]. There are some nice theater companies here like [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. There are comedy shows. There's FAC3 in [DATE] and ORG2 in [LOCATION]. There's trivia on DATE4 at [PERSON]. There's a branch of the ORG3 at [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] where I go to Zumba classes. There is a nice board game shop called [ORGANIZATION], with [ORGANIZATION] and FAC5 next door. There's a group of people who meet up at [PERSON] and look at chess problems. There's a branch of the library near me with a little cafe called ORG7. Mostly what I like about [ORGANIZATION] is the size. It's big enough that there are things going on you can go to, but small enough that you don't have to worry about finding a [STREET] to park, or being crowded, or waiting for a table at a restaurant. If you go to an open mic, you see the same 11 people you see at every open mic, and you say hi and sit down. It's a communal feel you would never get in a bigger city.",8

Other than property taxes, everything else is pretty reasonable compared to other places. No kids here, so can't comment on schools. As a cyclist, biking and walking to work might be questionable depending on where you'd work. I could personally bike anywhere in the city, but I'm used to riding in traffic and without infrastructure. Check out [[URL] for bike stuff, advocacy, etc. 

Lots of great city and county parks here! Close to [ORGANIZATION] for more outdoor adventures. Lots of hiking and kayaking with [TIME] or less. Lots of urban biking, mountain biking, country biking, and mountain biking locally and within [TIME] [STREET]. 

Good restaurants if you look hard enough. Some fun shows here and there at [ORGANIZATION] (great theater!). 

People like to talk shit about [PERSON], but they are probably young and lived here all their lives and are jaded.

Lots of excellent pizzerias!  Many people I know that have left the area mention how they can't find places as good wherever they've landed.  We also have several good Asian restaurants and a local fast food chain called [ORGANIZATION] is pretty popular with the locals.  

The main downside is [ORGANIZATION] can be fierce.  We broke our all-time lowest temperature record by four degrees [PERSON] and [PERSON] icing has been worse than DATE5.

It sounds like a [STREET] where I would fit in well. One huge factor my husband and I are discussing is the status of the [PERSON] economy and where it is going in the future. I'm sure the property taxes are affected by this, as well as the income tax. The income tax has gone up in [ORGANIZATION], and could continue to climb.

Downtown is improving and when I'm in town I look forward to going out on FAC0 down near the river. It's absolutely not a bustling town but it has some good bars and restaurants, and most of the interesting things are downtown. 

For recreation there is the sports factory downtown, rock cut, a bike path along the river and another on [PERSON], sledding at FAC1 and disc golf at FAC2, outdoor education and hiking at [PERSON], concerts at the [PERSON], and a surprisingly robust live music scene from the ORG2 basement to shows at the metro center, and you might catch ORG3 players coming back from injury on the ice at FAC5 with [LOCATION].

Best downtown neighborhoods in [ORGANIZATION]?,4,"I'd be a little cautious looking for housing in the downtown area. While there are some nice pockets, there are also some very not nice pockets. The two apartment complexes downtown that would be in decent areas are FAC0 and 321 Lofts. I have never lived in them nor have I known anyone who has, but the locations are nice and you would be within walking distance of a lot of downtown attractions. There are also lofts above FAC1 but I've heard those are really pricey.

In general, conditions do get nicer the further northeast you go, away from downtown. If you want to stay near the downtown area, the neighborhoods north of FAC2, near [PERSON] and around [PERSON] and FAC5 are fairly nice without being super expensive. It's mostly residential but you might be able to find a house for rent. While you won't be able to walk to downtown, you'll be a [TIME] [STREET] away.

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 21- Newspapers can't die,46,"I understand that, but that whole process is questionable. If they were actively in addiction and [ORGANIZATION] exploited that to obtain their child, imagine how that would prevent them even further from getting help. She sure was quick to give up on them once she got that child. Spoke very unkindly of them. But we’re supposed to forgive and forget the people that have wronged us? Open our hearts and homes to murderers, pedophiles, rapists, pimps etc? Pretty hypocritical if you ask me.",11
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 21- Newspapers can't die,46,"I saw a FB post [ORGANIZATION] with the bio-grandma and two girls.  It looked like they are living in a care facility. I don't think [ORGANIZATION]'s dad is their dad, but I know he has another baby momma.  When the baby was born they were squatting in an abandoned house on FAC0, and I would see them walking around with her pushing a trash can on a janitorial type cart wearing very short shorts and a sports bra.  I remember them taking a cat statue from my yard, and when I called them out they threw it at me and it broke. 

The last time I looked at the [STREET] records, the bio-parents filed something with the [STREET].  How sad for this little girl to be yanked around.",10
Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 21- Newspapers can't die,46,So she does or does NOT have a baby that she's taking care of?  I did hear from an active drug addict that [ORGANIZATION] has the baby at the foot of her bed in a bassinet that she's been caring for. That's crazy...,6

Miss [ORGANIZATION]'s Post 21- Newspapers can't die,46,"That part doesn’t bother me. What bothers me is that [ORGANIZATION] constantly tells other people that they are enabling homeless people(what [ORGANIZATION] calls addicts, she just lumps all homeless people together and perpetuates the stigma that all homeless people are addicts) by giving them a few bucks. Yet she consistently enables bad behavior and GIVES them all kinds of shit. Like they don’t sell it?? Such a hypocrite and fraud. She’s the ONLY one that can help them. The people that donate just eat that shit up so long as she continues to mention their name when they give. I suppose that’s what [PERSON] would do. Help only when credit is given.

[ORGANIZATION] she posted how they did a big clean up of the area.  As far as I know, this [ORGANIZATION] officer still has her job, and people are still camping in this location.

It was around DATE2. I can’t really judge her sobriety without k[LOCATION]ing if she drank it, but I can confirm that there’s no [STREET] to put in separate payments on [ORGANIZATION]. She she either was paying for like $400 in the charity’s groceries or the charity possibly paid for alcohol. I’m not sure. Either [STREET] I remember being treated like we were doing something wrong by delivering groceries that she ordered.
