CP and RRM actually help people get shelter and make people accountable.  The result of handing out tents, blankets, clothing, and food on the go is incremental dumping in already stressed neighborhoods. I pulled five contractor bags of bedding off the porch of an abandoned house behind my home last November (the city does not provide this clean up).  It is sad that people are sleeping outside, but I got to ask why are they rejecting the shelter and other 

Miss Carly's is a grift that projects a very inaccurate picture of homelessness in Rockford. They claim to just hand out stuff until people are ready, which is enabling those who don't want to be accountable and have resisted the many services in Rockford so they can continue the street lifestyle.  Not to mention their exploitative social media posts that pay for their personal living expenses, building code fines, and lawyers because they chose to live at the shelter rather than using one of the many vacant buildings in the city.",2,2023-06-16 20:06:08 UTC

""The role of citizens in ending homelessness **in their own communities**..."" 

It's easy to say we want to end homelessness, and if we just had the Rockford homeless population to deal with then we'd be fine.  This City has an INCREDIBLE homelessness response.  Literally hundreds of thousands of state and federal grant dollars a year to combat homelessness.  But we keep getting busses of ""problem"" homeless people shipped to us from other cities (looking at you, Chicago).  If it were just Rockford citizens battling homelessness, the problem would be solved already.  

This is actually the main reason I am opposed to a Chicago-Rockford train rail.  This isn't speculation, we KNOW this is happening.  Talk to one of the City's Human Services people that respond to homeless complaints, they can verify.  And while it would be nice to hop on a train to Chicago for a bag of Garrett's popcorn, we would be flooded with the homeless from every municipality that's on that line.  Chicago, Arlington Heights, Palatine, Crystal Lake, every city and village on the UPNW line (the logical one to extend) would say ""Good luck with that guy, Rockford"" and consider their jobs done.",2,2023-06-16 16:02:32 UTC

I don't think the train will cause a problem, but cities need to work together so each of them is taking care of their own people and only moving them when it makes more sense (like when someone in Chicago has family in Rockford.)

My experience has been that Rockford organizations are good at coordinating on homelessness with other cities in IL and WI. That's better for the homeless than encouraging other cities to not develop their own successful programs.",3,2023-06-16 19:42:59 UTC

Look up HUD Continuum of Care funding and you'll be appalled at how much money they get and that this is their solution.

And I know it’s true, but I have my moments where the burden feels heavy and I get overly worried. I am human. So, there I was about to throw myself a pity party and then a volunteer ran over to me and informed me the person that had been in a car accident half a block away was someone I cared about greatly. Someone’s all of us here care for. It was a person who I was worried was dodging me because he had relapsed after having two years clean and accomplishing so much. I knew he was filled with shame, but we just wanted him to know we are here for him and would never give up on him. Turns out the person driving had gone blue and hit a pole. As soon as his girlfriend was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, he kind of stumbled down to our door and as soon as I saw that it was him, I walked to him and asked if I could hug him. He grabbed me so hard and began to wail up towards the sky in pain. I knew that scream. It is the -my God what have I done- scream. I just held him back, tightly, for as long as he needed. Cassandra rubbed his shoulder to reinforce that he wasn’t alone and I could literally see his muscles relaxing after who knows how long. I was surprised how long he cried…I was grateful he was letting those painful yet freeing tears flow. Once Cassandra and I got him calm enough to make words, he said he needed to get to his girlfriend, but we knew he has heart problems and pneumonia, so we had him sit down ina chair and calm down. We had an important job to do. So I picked up right where our last conversation left off and I asked him: Is this enough of a sign for you that it’s time to ask for help?? There is nothing I could say to him that he hasn’t said to someone else, as he’s been very involved in the recovery world and has helped so many other people. So, after I said that, I just sat with him and held his hand until he was ready to talk. And eventually he did. I called my contact at the hospital and had them let his girlfriend know that he was okay and would be there soon. He was much more comfortable after that. Then….….we made a plan! We got him some clean clothes and some good deodorant and he went up to the hospital to talk with her about the plan. It’s awful that they had to lose their car and have this near-death No sooner than this man left did a meek young woman show. Up at the gate right as we were closing up and switching to night ministry. Cassandra and I both looked at each other because we were both exhausted after such a ling day and we were silently deciding who would go talk to her. But after another glance her way, we saw that something was not right and we both approached her slowly. , but at least a good thing came from it! They have a plan and we can help them succeed! Much like the man who just left, she seemed unable to make words. So, I asked her: Can I give you a hug?? And she rapidly shook her head up and down. Holy cow…she grabbed me even harder than the man had. She dug her nails into my arms so hard! Cassandra joined in and we three-way hugged and let the small young woman cry. Eventually she told us she had just been assaulted by a very trusted and authoritative figure. From what we gathered, authorizes had already been involved, but she appeared to be in a sort of state of shock. Something we are not a stranger to around here. So, we listened. It was hard to make sense of everything she as saying because she was crying so hard. Im pretty sure she doesn’t even use drugs at all she just seemed to be beyond tired and really overwhelmed. We tried hard to make a safety plan with her and eventually succeeded, but she was insistent that she had to go to work first, or else she would lose her job. We talked to the young woman while Cassandra missed two buses home. She became more coherent as she calmed down and we got more pieces of the puzzle. She promised us she would be safe in the meantime and that she would be back when the shift was over and we promised to be here from her no matter when or how she showed up. She thanked us over and over and hugged us and kept saying “I’m sorry, I didn’t know where to go.” And we told her over and over that we are here for exactly this reason! We told her about how we would help her with resources and stay by her side as she tackled hard and scary things coming up. As she walked down the sidewalk, headed to her job, head held up high, Cassandra and I looked at each other and no words were needed. Instead, we said a little silent prayer and hugged one more time, hard, before we walked back to finish setting up front the night ministry. And I tell you what…my stress and worry was all gone and my faith was restored. We are here, doing what we are supposed to be doing. The food will come. Together, we are empowering those need, one sack lunch at a time.",7,2024-05-22 02:31:42 UTC

You’ve got this! I remember so vividly when we were sending our loved one to treatment feeling so many different feelings. There was always hope but there was also a lot of doubt. Would they stay? Would they get clean? Will people really love and care about them? Can’t we just help them get clean ourselves?

They told me they need first and last name, an address and telephone number for the victim, first and last name and name of the suspected abusers. I would urge anyone who is able to provide this information for any of Carly’s victims to contact adult protective services. 
Edited to add more information on who is covered 
“The Adult Protective Services Program (APS) investigates reports of abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect of adults age 60 or older, and adults age 18-59 with disabilities living the community. APS is locally coordinated through 36 provider agencies. Case workers from these 36 provider agencies are trained and certified by the Illinois Departments on Aging. Local APS caseworkers investigate allegations and coordinate client service referrals to mitigate risk and assure client health, welfare, and safety.”
“What is abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect?
Abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect of a person age 60 or older or adults with disabilities age 18-59 is the least recognized form of family violence.
 *Abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect takes many forms, and in most cases victims are subjected to more than one type of mistreatment. During Fiscal Year 2022, financial exploitation was reported more frequently than any other type of maltreatment at 24.23% followed by self-neglect at 22.06% and emotional abuse at 16.68%.
Abandonment - means the desertion or willful forsaking of an eligible adult by an individual responsible for the care and custody of that eligible adult under circumstances in which a reasonable person would continue to provide care and custody. 
Confinement – restraining or isolating a person for other than medical reasons. 
Emotional abuse – verbal assaults, threats of abuse, harassment, or intimidation so as to compel the person to engage in conduct from which she or he has a right to abstain or to refrain from conduct in which the person has a right to engage. 
Financial exploitation – the misuse or withholding of a person’s resources to the disadvantage of the person and/or the profit or advantage of another person. 
Passive neglect – the failure by a caregiver to provide a person with the necessities of life including, but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter, or medical care, because of failure to understand the person’s needs, lack of awareness of services to help meet needs, or lack of capacity to care for the person. 
Physical Abuse – causing the infliction of physical pain or injury to a person.
Self-Neglect - A condition that is the result of an eligible adult’s inability, due to physical or mental impairments, or both, or diminished capacity, to perform essential care tasks that substantially threaten their own health, including: providing essential food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and obtaining goods and services necessary to maintain physical health, mental health, emotional well-being, and general safety 
Sexual abuse – touching, fondling, or any other sexual activity with a person when the person is unable to understand, unwilling to consent, threatened, or physically forced. 
Willful deprivation – willfully denying assistance to a person who requires medication, medical care, shelter, food, therapeutic device, or other physical assistance, thereby exposing that person to the risk of harm.
The abuse, neglect, exploitation and self-neglect could be.......
an intentional or unintentional action by anyone;
 caused by economic or emotional dependence of either the victim or the abuser; and/or
 accepted by the family and society as a way of life.
The Abuser...
may be a family member (adult child, spouse, grandchild and other relative) or a non-relative caregiver;
 may lose control due to the stress associated with caregiving;
 may have an alcohol or substance abuse problem; and
 may be frustrated or isolated.
*Interventions must take into account, wherever possible, most persons do not to want to sever family ties.
The Victim...
may suffer from some form of dementia or physical impairment, often suffering from multiple disabilities which make him/her dependent on others for care;
tend to be isolated;
 may suffer from more than one type of abuse;
 may be reluctant to admit his/her loved one is an abuser; and
 may be fearful of reporting abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation thinking it could lead to further harm, long-term care facility placement, or total abandonment.
*These characteristics make intervening more complicated and cases more difficult.”

 What does   “went blue” mean.  

Why not go to the hospital to comfort the GF you are so worried about after a “near death” experience!!!! ILet me guess , trying to sober up first. 
How did he eventually get to the hospital?  With a heart issue and pneumonia did she let him walk there ? If so, why again did he not go right away to comfort his GF .  
I call bull  💩 on this story.  What kind of person doesn’t go to the hospital with their loved one after a near death experience? Instead they go here for an intervention, deodorant, and bed bug invested clothes . 

Who is her contact at the hospital?  My understanding of HIPPA is they can’t give her any information, so what is the need for a contact ?

What person gives you deodorant after a car accident .  Car accident = need for good deodorant 

The assaulted woman who already has authorities involved meanders down to this place for a hug before her shift starts.  It sounds like they didn’t know her , so what led her to go down there just for a hug ? She didn’t know where else to go??? Wait, if the authorities were involved there would of been counseling which would of involved lots of resources, none of which involved MC 

You notice she always uses the word shame , which she herself is incapable of.  Every person always hugs her soooooo tight the dig their nails into her arm.  Every damn time !",13,2024-05-22 10:42:25 UTC

If you ever want to make sandwiches with me or volunteer on community days, please let me know. Miss Carly's is fun place to help and I promise you, it will make your heart happy and you will see miracles happen. I know there is a lot going on with the fraud page and all, but ya can’t believe everything you read. Carly has not been found guilty of any fraud charges. Carly has her taxes in and we are awaiting the audit. I do not believe that Carly Rice misused funds from all the facts I have been given. I call the fraud page out on their behaviors, such as making fun of Carly, volunteers, and the homeless. This did in fact get me blocked from the page that I believe these “mean girls” are behind. I do know for a fact that these “mean girls” do exist because they were mean to me when I volunteered there. (If you want to have lunch or something with me, I tell you all about what happened to me.) 

I am waiting patiently for the audit and facts. I’ve been quiet about my time volunteering at Miss Cary’s because I have been waiting for the right time to tell y’all how I fell about this situation. The Fraud at Miss Carly’s page is a bunch of bullshit and driven by mean spirited individuals who, I feel, did not get there way. They are not waiting patiently for an audit to be done, instead they are attacking, manipulating, causing all kinds of chaos and drama to ensue. They now have pulled Carly’s children into all of this chaos and drama, where they do not belong. Kids deserve to be kids and not have to deal with adult issues that have nothing to do with them, but the fact is the fraud page can not sit quietly and be patient like the rest of us. I believe they want to give their opinions more than they want facts. Ladies and Gentlemen, the world is already negative, filled with corruption, and enough hate to take each and everyone of us out. Do we really want to keep doing this to ourselves? I know I don’t. I want to live, laugh, and love everyone and everything with my whole heart, even if it causes me some tears now and again. I want happiness and peace. I want us all to be able to come together and help one another out, by lifting each other, up, by believing in one other, and coming together to form a strong bond and sense of community. Do you want facts or opinions? Do you want negative or positive? Do you want love or hate? If you don’t like what you are doing, then change it, only you have the power to control yourself and how you react to others. Change, I believe is a great thing to want to do. I want to make changes that will fulfill my heart and soul. I want to love unconditionally. I want to just breathe and believe! All of this is what I believe and have learned in my 3 years volunteering at Miss Carly’s. Carly Rice has taught me this. Today I am grateful for Miss Carly’s and Carly Rice. I am grateful for her wanting better and doing better each day as an individual. For creating this tight knit family were we all fit in no matter what is going on with us at the moment in our daily struggles. She fills in the gaps. The gaps that no other organization can. 💜

The casino will most likely take existing gamblers from the slot parlors.

Cannabis has been legal for a few years, and there has been no documented correlation between crime and cannabis.  Crack and narcotics, are a totally different thing.  

The thing to remember about working with homeless people, is there is a segment that is resistant to help for various reasons.  These agencies cannot legally compel anyone to participate.  This segment is then held up as how the ""system"" is broken.  Actually, I've seen fewer homeless in my area the last few years.  The City is limited on what they can do about panhandlers, because of the law that allows it under free speech.  Don't assume these panhandlers are homeless.  I've seen one  woman who I know is an RHA resident panhandling on Church St.

The fight to end homelessness in Rockford,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/t7fp6c/the_fight_to_end_homelessness_in_rockford/,2022-03-05 18:32:40 UTC,"I disagree.  The casino will offer more types of gambling, and will entice more people.  The point being, this community really has the bar set low.  A casino is the best they can do?

What correlation are you looking for?  Drugs use is a problem in Rockford.  Whether it be legal or illegal, is this the best your community can do? What exactly has improved since pot was legally sold in Rockford?  Where is the owner of the dispensary from? Have ANY of the forecasted financial benefits materialized?

The bigger question is why anyone would be resistant?  Maybe there's no incentive to be a productive member of this community.   No one is is panhandling to display their First Amendment rights.  They're there because the reward is better than the alternative of working in their mind.  If they can't work, who is helping them get to the resources they need?  It's not your cops trying to ""serve and protect"".  They drove right by and stopped at Starbucks, pretending like they didn't see.

What new businesses were attracted?  What's the unemployment rate in Rockford?  

Give it up. Your leadership has failed you.  Just change the batter.

We sent two people to treatment. 

One of the people was sent to us from the hospital. They reached out because they were desperate to get him help, after overdosing, but kept hitting dead ends….but we were able to pay for his transportation to Chicago and our advocate on the ground in Chicago drive him to multiple walk-in facilities before he finally secured a bed. 

Thank you, Chris, for caring so much about this young man. This is what we do. When we see people who are trying to save their own life, we rally around them and we don’t give up, no matter how many brick walls we hit. Chris is always looking out for people who are coming out of overdose and who are ready to put on the work. He’s a godsend to the those who struggle with addiction in our community. 

The second person we sent really hit home for me…she is a trafficked woman who has been telling me she wants to get out for FIVE YEARS! 

Well, today was the day. 

She was 20 minutes late and I almost had the Uber leave without her, but she finally showed! I couldn’t even sleep last night a wink because I was so nervous about her showing! 

It was especially meaningful for me that this particular woman is the only woman left on these streets who I used to prostitute beside 11 years ago. 

When she left early this morning, she hugged me, hard, digging her nails into me. She cried so hard that she shook violently….i was worried she was going to back out. But she wiped the tears away and told me she is ready to “save her own life.” 

The things the women out here on the streets live through when they are out here long enough will make your skin crawl and give you nightmares. It’s bad. There are a some very sick people in the world. 

There simply aren’t words to explain to you how grateful I was to see this woman get into the Uber. 

Th so you for helping us provide a way out to those who feel trapped and can’t seem to find a way off the streets. This who have burnt all their bridges and used up their chances or who perceive themselves to be hopeless. 

When they get in that car, they have a bag of clothes and some basic necessities and they have HOPE. 

In fact, these two insisted I take a before picture, so they could remember this day and see how much they changed physically and they wanted me to post it, but I’m going to wait for the after to go right beside it! They are both determined to fight for their own life and I am so proud of both of them!! But if this doesn’t turn out or be the time…we will be here ready and waiting ALWAYS to give them another chance. 

No matter what. 

Thank you for helping up change peoples lives, one sack lunch at a time ❤️ 


So this fake freckled dummy just admitted that she pays to send people to Chicago to wander around hoping to get into a treatment center. These poor people don’t stand a chance.",12,2024-04-27 05:07:18 UTC

I want to introduce you to my own personal Batman. His name is Jeff Neece. Not only did he get 3 of the men we serve jobs this week, but he also saved one of my favorite old, frail men from a really dangerous man who had strong-armed his way into his apartment, set up residence and had been beating and strangling the poor guy for the past week. 

We were quite prepared to pull some vigilante moves because we are protective of our most vulnerable friends, but the only thing that ended up getting pulled were the weeds at District 2 Police station while a nervous Kathleen Combs did some renegade landscaping with our dear old guy safely tucked in the police station. 

The man was promptly arrested thanks to a pretty rad officer. 

This man is sick. Who hurts defenseless old men? He has a lengthy history of domestic violence and strangulations. Hopefully he can get some help, but for now, one sweet, quiet, elderly man is safe and has a fridge full of groceries, to boot (Kathleen had to kill some time and he had nothing). Jeff also changed all of the locks just to be safe.

On fraud page :


One of the biggest red flags for me was when a donor contacted me as a board member and was surprised and confused because Carly had messaged them and asked for a donation for her family!!

  She wrote:

“I hate to ask you again… But I have a personal favor now. I am working on a deadline to get my portion of work done for the taxes. My pay has been cut because we hired four other people and there just isn't enough money until we get the taxes done and can start applying for grants. We hired someone to help with the grants and everything, so that's rad!

I'm horrible… I always put the people first and do this to myself. So, I'm really glad it's not gonna happen again. Ha ha!

My question to you is this… Do you think that you could help me out with a gift card to DoorDash? I really need to work evenings because it's often so busy here in the day. But since my pay was cut, I brought really frugal foods that require a lot of time in the kitchen… Large chunks of cheap meat, dry rice etc... but I just don't not have enough hours in the day right now. If I could order in a couple nights a week, I could crank this work out, but I can't afford it. I have to cook for five every night and it just takes a lot of time. I love doing it! It's one of my favorite things… But I really just have to focus and get this done. The problem is every time I order in for family it's at least $50. If not 80 just because we have food allergies and my son is vegetarian etc. it's just an adds up! But I am not going to make this deadline, unless I work nights.”

This is just a portion of her groveling message that Carly wrote and that the donor shared with me.  Now at this time, for the first time since the inception of the nonprofit, Carly didn’t have access to donation money because we had turned everything over to the bookkeeper. (Who has subsequently been fired).
     When I confronted Carly about this, she became very defensive and said this donor had become like family to her and she felt it was okay to ask them. (Apparently she hadn’t told the donor that!)
    Now in what universe is it appropriate for an employee of a nonprofit to ask a donor for a personal gift??? Anywhere else, this would be cause for termination, but again, the remaining board members refused to act and I resigned. But it should be clear that this is not your typical nonprofit and the founder believes that rules do not apply to her. And as far as I am aware, Carly never did get all of her receipts in order and she is back to having access to all the accounts. Also, to the best of my knowledge, there are no longer any other employees of the organization. And this is why I think it is imperative that an audit be done immediately.",10,2024-04-27 00:38:04 UTC

WOW..JUST..WOW! Honestly, all fraud and begging aside, the NFP is NOT sustainable based on building issues alone.  She has not produced records that have been requested because she needs to keep that money hidden for personal living expenses and for property taxes.  When she was cut off from the non-stop cash flow of the NFP while she employed 4 people (4 is a LIE), she was begging for personal grocery money from a donor.  She would NEVER be able to pay her personal portion of real estate taxes.  

Now, everything is running smoothly again since she's the only one with access to the cash.  Donations are sure to drop off with all the bad press that she's getting.  Not enough to put her out of business yet, but one day closer to the goal.  Glory's post should leave people with NO QUESTION about what's going on there.  It's stated clearly and concisely.  It's disgusting and a black eye to every donation that she's ever taken in.  If she is shut down, they won't be able to pay taxes or buy groceries.  It's time to raise the white flag, Miss Carly!

This is exactly what we've discussed here before, and the mindset that MC is the only place around that has food for people.

So instead of the supporting local businesses that donate to her, she hits them up for freebies for herself.

We don't spend any money there either, since we always bring a cooler of food and go for places with breakfast included.
We did it a few weeks ago and stayed at the Riverview Inn and Suites and I was FLOORED at how nice the place was for the very low price! I am so mad at myself for it taking pictures of the magnificent lobby!!

""I got to teach a college class last night!!  
  
The class is called: Sex, Slavery, and Society and it is offered at Rockford University. The class is about human trafficking and Dr Dibley, who teaches the class, had several people come speak to the class about human trafficking. She has an Ex pimp, A survivor of human trafficking, a judge, two state police officers from the human trafficking task force, two local police officers, Police Chief Carla Redd and they came to us last.  
  
De Dibley said she wanted end with us because it sucks to learn about something so terrible and feel like you can’t do anything about it. Well, I’m pretty sure those students left feeling like they COULD and would make a difference! Just within the first 10 minutes they were able to witness us passing out condoms and bottled water to two women who are currently being trafficked. They got to see, first hand, what it looks like to be boots on the ground and hear about and visualize how they might be part of the solution.  
  
Huge thanks to Dr Genevieve Dibley for bringing her class for a night as Miss Carly’s and thank you to our long time advocate and soon to be Rockford University graduate, Elijah Lowry! I am so glad he brought Dr Dibley to us because I am absolutely smitten with the woman! She is crazy intelligent and she works so hard at molding young minds and imparting the most balanced and relevant information to them because they are, after all, our hope and our future. Last night was their last class and she gave them the most inspiring, raw and real advice…I was in tears listening to her words.  
  
It was such an honor to talk to this class, but most of all, it was exciting and inspiring to meet all these young people who will make a difference in the world soon""",4,2024-05-02 02:03:05 UTC

“Yes, Barb, Jacob is our board president. ""Director"" means that he's a member of the board. He's been on ZION's board for a number of years, pre-dating the controversy around Miss Carly's. He is not part of ZION's day-to-day operations, though he does have to sign off on some organizational documents on occasion (as do all board members). ZION is required, as a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO), to have at least 1/3 of our board made up of residents of a low-income community or who are low-income themselves. We have built that into our organizational bylaws so that we are always thinking about the need to meet that requirement. The vast majority of ZION's work over our last 40+ years has been in the Midtown District, so we have always emphasized having board members from our neighborhood to meet that requirement. That was why we asked him to join our board years ago.

So this Chris was hoping to find a bed for him before he changed his mind. 

Many of the facilities she takes people to in the city (Haymarket or Southwood Interventions, for example) only take walk-ins. So you have to be there early for the assessment, or you most likely won't get a bed. Then it's back to the drawing board the next morning. 

You can typically get an assessment at Rosecrance fairly quickly, but can wait weeks to months for an actual bed following the assessment. Especially if you don't have private insurance. If you require detox, you might do detox first, then wait weeks for an inpatient bed.",9,2024-04-28 03:29:10 UTC

And following that it's recommended they complete a continuing care program. The idea is that each program is a step down in the level of care until eventually they're on their own. Following these recommendations increases their success. It doesn't sound like many of the people she sends to treatment are engaged in any of those programs following inpatient treatment. At least, I've never heard her mention it. It's always inpatient treatment, and sober living. Sober living definitely helps, but on its own it's not enough. Now, there are recovery homes which are a bit different than sober living, as recovery homes often include programming such as IOP and/or individual therapy, medication management, etc. For example, clients living at Greendale (Rosecrance recovery home) attend IOP at Rosecrance. There is also a long term program at Haymarket that I've had a few clients complete, and they've all had lasting recovery and are quite successful today. I've always wondered why I've never heard MC talk about that program, since some of her people sometimes go to Haymarket. Of course, that would mean she'd have to give up her power and control over them, so I guess I've answered my own question lol

Inpatient treatment locally is honestly just hard to get into without private insurance, and often includes long waiting lists and daily call ins. But if you're willing to go outside of Rockford, it's almost guaranteed you'll get a bed sooner rather than later, and sometimes the same day.",8,2024-04-28 13:41:24 UTC

I'm always happy to  share food with people who need it.   Money sometimes goes to drugs or booze (and sometimes not) so I'm reticent to offer that usually.

I had a lady approach me in the parking lot at the Olympic last year.  She asked for a dollar or two.   I told her I work here and I'm sorry she's having a hard time but I can't have her asking people for money.  She told me she had spent all she had at the Dollar General on Riverside for baby formula.  I saw that's all that was in her bag so she wasn't lying to me.  I asked her where her house was.  She said up by the Discovery Center.   I said that's an awfully long walk, and told her I'd grab her some food.   I went inside, grabbed a leftover burger that had been sitting in the window for a bit (would've gone to a staffer for a snack) and packed up some chili, whatever soup we had left, and some other random food items that likely would have been tossed at the end of the shift.  You should have seen her eyes light up.  She was so thankful.  It was literally the smallest thing I could do for her and it meant so much to her.

I believe that she purposely writes that way because she knows it will ellicit the responses that she gets from the willfully ignorant.  I'll no longer refer to them as brainwashed.  I personally know many of her cult members.  They have been told.  They will fight me to the death about her true character.  Many donate to her, make sleeping mats, and provide other"" life or death"" donations to her.  She has given them a purpose.  To blindly accept that she is a savior to all continues to allow them to serve their purpose.  None have ever been there as long-term volunteers.  They just believe her.

It’s a good day! I have to run a couple errands**,** but I’ll be in the back from 2pm-4pm, if you want to say hi! Also, we have a couple really exciting things happening soon! A podcast is flying me to Memphis to talk about the work we do! And me and Mr Jacob are flying to another state to check out this treatment center that sounds like a dream come true! It is a two year program and provides mental health services, as well as dental and medical and even job training…you have no idea how ridiculously excited and hopeful I am! More on that soon!

Just recently in a video she talked about how the volunteers love pop because they get tired of water, that they don't like water that much. They like the powder you put into water more. She posted a list of weekly inventory dated 3/10/24 that included ""Tobacco Red"" and ""Tobacco Green"". Also Tubes, red and green, and ""Roller"". Both POP (with sugar) and CIGARETTES are highly addictive. Those 2 things are listed first in this article [https://michaelshouse.com/drug-addiction/most-addictive-drugs-world/](https://michaelshouse.com/drug-addiction/most-addictive-drugs-world/) so Sure-Assist has hit the nail on the head with this. She needs volunteers to unload the plethora of Amazon boxes, she needs them to sort things, to clean for her, (we heard her on video say to a volunteer to go clean the bathroom) and to just have people to bark orders to. She feeds them, gives them a warm place to stay during the day in the winter, gives them pop, cigarettes, food. Some of them basically live there during the day. I also heard her say in a video that many volunteers come in off the street and someone posted that MC admitted some aren't sober. There is so much wrong going on. This is not your average NFP.",16,2024-04-12 14:08:58 UTC

Neither were there, but I wasn't done. I saw a gentleman in a suit walking out and stopped him by asking his name. His name is Nelson Sjostrom. I let him know that I've called relentlessly with no response back. I explained what was going down at Carly's and told him about the videos I had about Carly passing out needles still. He took me up to attorney Erin's office where we all three talked. I told a lot of what's going on and played the video I have of a prostitute telling me to go to Carly if I wanted a needle and in the same video the prositute admitting to the drug use in the building. Erin took a bunch of notes and my phone number, and she asked why more ppl aren't coming forward and why aren't ppl going to the police?
I told her to go to Reddit and search Miss Carly's and also ScamAlert fraud at Miss Carly's. I told her she'll find proof from ex volunteers who were speaking out. I told her about all of the work Sure Assistance and ALL OF YOU have done to help reveal what's really going on. No audits, lying on her taxes, etc. I bitched about nothing happening with the code violations and how serious it is with kids involved. Told her about the volunteers that are in there... pedophiles...dealer... addicts.
She seemed to be pretty shocked by all of it and I know my video had to make an impression. N.S. had nothing good to say about Carly. In fact,
she's described as a SHIT SHOW! Miss Erin took my phone number. I did tell them that this has gone on for too long, and if they keep waiting to do things that something bad is going to happen.",14,2024-04-15 19:18:23 UTC

""DONATION UPDATEWE ARE NOW ACCEPTING SPRING/SUMMER CLOTHING!! Everyone has been asking and I’m so happy to tell you that we are ready! We worked hard over the past couple weeks to work through any excess warm clothing yet still keep a small amount tucked away. It’s always such a delicate balance to try and anticipate the needs of the most vulnerable folks and we tend to need winter stuff way longer than people would think, due to it being so cold at night still. That being said, we can still use some coats and definitely hoodies. More than anything….we need blanklets and sleeping bags and tents during the springtime because so many people lose access to emergency cold weather shelter, be it an actual shelter or an other temporary solution they found. It’s a whole new ballgame when there is no snow on the ground! Our doantion room has essentially been cleared out every day that it is open. If it wasnt for the fact that we are constantly stocking it, I dont know that we would make it through a whole day! Thank you to everyone that has been dropping off so much seasonally appropriate clothing as well as household items, toys etc. It’s just the best thing to see people leave protected from the weather. Or, to see them build new homes and have HOPE when they leave here with a few plates, an old quilt, and some clothes and snacks for their kids. Piece by piece, they are able to make an empty apartment a real home! Here are the things people are needing most right now: \*\*TENTSBLANKETS/SLEEPING BAGSCLEANING SUPPLIES (can be used) CAT FOOD/DOG FOODSHEETS/BEDDING/TOWELS/ANY LINENS\*\*FOOD FOR LUNCHES (chips, granola bars, cookies, pudding/jello cups, bannas, oranges, apples)SODA FOR THE CREW (Mountian Dew, Coke, Sprite etc…they like it all!) HYGIENE ITEMS (shampoo, conditioner, deoderant, razors, bar soap, hair products for textured hair, etc) As always, the FOOD is true number one things we need. Our numbers only steadily climb as the weather warms and we need all the help we can get to feed 400 or more people every day. Its pretty amazing what we can do when we work togetherDonation drop off is Wednesday- Saturday 10am-4:30pm, but if you have food to drop off and dont mind a quick hand off, I’m home after hours all of the time, so youre welcome to drop off sicne we need it so badly.

What do people think she should have done when the woman who she says is a drug user/prostitute/battered woman showed up with 2 black eyes?

""Pretty excited about this Girl Scout’s plans to convince her troop do a community garden takeover this year! It’s inspiring to see young people take challenges on and be inspired interested in making a difference in their community! Our garden has always been a huge hit in the area and has put so much green food in people’s tables. The neighborhood kiddos love the strawberries, blackberries and ground cherries we always plant, so I told them that was the only requirement to the takeover. Give her some love in the comments! I think even with this late start, she and her fellow girls outs can grow heaps of free, fresh and nutritious food for the people who live in the area. Fresh and affordable food is a luxury many of us take for granted. So many people we serve in particular shop at Dollar General and Dollar Tree as their only grocery stores because it’s what’s accessible to them.Looking forward to a bountiful garden and lots of smiles and learning""",16,2024-04-12 15:22:44 UTC

This crazy bitch knows her furnace has ""combustibles leaking"" and the flue vent has condensation and is deteriorated? That's straight up CO or natural gas leaking and so deadly. The city of rockford is letting this happen?

Also, improper piping on pressure relief valve on water heater? That's a bomb waiting to happen. Have you ever heard of water heaters blowing up and shooting straight thru the ceiling and roof??? The pressure relief valve being faulty is how this happens. HOLY SHIT.  

I do mechanical work like this for a living, and this is completely unacceptable, and the units need to be red tagged and disabled until fixed properly. That's what would happen to someone under those conditions.  Water heaters can produce carbon monoxide poisoning as well as furnaces. How the fuck does she think shes better than everyone and can put so many lives in danger.  

These are huge violations. Shame on the city of rockford for not disabling the furnace and water heaters. They would do it to anybody else,  why does she get a pass? Fuck that.  

The electrical is a fire waiting to happen. Extension cords for refrigeration? The city inspector should have shut that down right then and there. What the fuck.

Miss Carly addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss Carly volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  Carly addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets today while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  Recall a few years ago when Carly had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at Carly’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss Carly addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her place is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is the Rockford register Star may turn out to be a blessing for her, per Carly (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals monthly.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since Covid and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",8,2024-02-15 23:42:04 UTC

Cate Adelman yeah. I have talked about it on several occasions recently in live videos. The problem is it stirs the pot and we just really want the city to work with us and be reasonable…and to be quite honest…what I have to say would ruffle feathers/make people mad at the city….so I am holding my tongue in hopes we can come to some sort of a reasonable compromise 😉

I am not sure how much more reasonable the city can be ?  She doesn’t address what she thinks a reasonable compromise is . At this point it’s been years and she AGREED to do what they asked .  She is holding her tongue because people would get mad at city, honestly that ship has sailed.  But this is an example of the message her followers are getting.",6,2024-02-14 13:32:14 UTC

I must have missed the Sure-Assistance quotes in the article. Its just as likely RRstar was following up on the SUP story they previously reported on back in 2019, prior to MC’s upcoming court dates because the issue is still relevant and was highly contested back in 19.   

But no, OP’s gotta take credit for inspiring the RRstar article. Thats a tactic right out of MC playbook, right? Taking credit for things you didn’t do. 

As for your investigative reporting, I’m glad you’ve toned it down to mostly objective FACTS. Some of those structural and mechanical issues with her building are down right egregious. It sounds like she’s got a steam powered pipe bomb for a boiler/water heater which is super dangerous. The city is already going after her and Jacob for these issues in court, I hope they’re able to revoke the SUP and occupancy permit at some point. If these issues are a clear and present danger now, there is no reason for them to wait until court to revoke. It only opens the city up to liability for not enforcing. Unfortunately that won’t stop MC from being able to operate her NFP. She’ll likely use that defeat as a call to action for her supporters to help find her a new place to live/operate, she could even apply pressure to the City to give her some TIF money to remediate the building issues. 

Have you given any thought to condensing your allegations/proof into a single post and cross posting your synopsis to r/nonprofit, r/scams, or r/illinois? You might gain some more insight into how much operational leeway NFP’s are given, or what actions to take to report her to the appropriate channels. At the very least you would get more eyes on the issue because r/rockford is “such a small sub”. Classic gaslighting btw, yet another MC tactic. 

Any more thoughts on creating a Citizens against MC NFP facebook group to reach more of her audience? Seems like an easy step to get these allegations into the eyes and minds of those who donate to her. 

I don’t know who Glory is or what she does but she should probably sit down with an attorney. Her testimony is only good so long as she doesn’t sucked into the mess you’ve created here. 

Its not what your saying, well it kinda is, but its more how your saying it and who your saying it too, if you haven’t figured that out yet.

I wonder how much money she’ll rake in today….


ETA: I originally recommended r/fraud thinking that was a legit sub, but its been removed from reddit. I’ve changed it to r/scams which is legit and an appropriate place to post this issue.",3,2024-02-15 16:04:45 UTC

Please excuse my sarcasm and my bad dry jokes my humor I love to go sense of humor and a bad bad joke set LOL but I am indeed just trying to keep this light because I really don't know what the problem is I have lived in Rockford for no about 8 years and I just recently heard about Miss Carly's and maybe mid 2023 and I haven't heard anything but very good things about the establishment and her in general but again I mentioned personal experiencing I don't have to go into detail cuz it doesn't really matter but I I was helped greatly by Miss Carly and never having met her in my entire life nor had she met me and I know that putting this down here but I bet you're wrong and I'm pretty transparent if anybody wants to know they can ask very easy to send somebody in private message but you know I'm not going to throw it out there it doesn't matter if I'm just going to say it's not I'm guessing it's probably not what you think unless you somehow or never mind whoever you I'm speaking of generally like whoever it is that has these issues and problems against Miss Carly personally or Miss Carly's and in general I'm just curious I'd like to know why you taking such an interest in doing this and I wonder if it was you that had something to do with shut getting there needle exchange and shut down or any of the other things that help people that aren't perfect or that do things that you don't like I don't know I think that what my problem is more than anything else doesn't matter who it is or where it is or who these people are who you are who any thing related to whatever it is take what is is it your job to do this I just am wondering like again I'm going to say I'm just so curious as to what made you dislike the place so much that you're going to sit there and you're going to as far as I know slender I don't know that any of this is true I'd like to see your proof but I guess again I don't know anything about this and I'm just my anger is in the fact of that it's things like this that have the world set to where it is right now thank God you can't quit feeling things for Christ's sake hey come leave people alone is what I mean keep feeling it's the one way or another about things you don't like maybe your life would be a little bit happier but definitely like my mom would say leave people the f alone right I say quit feeling others just say let you I also noticed that you put down all of those things that must have took some time to get all that information and everything I sure hope that you're right about all of them and I'll end right now because I'm getting so irritated and going on and thinking about this but I noticed there wasn't anything I put out as far as how many meals have been served how many homeless people have been housed how many people have gotten to go to rehabilitation services that otherwise wouldn't have . How many rides have been given how many people have closed that didn't have clothes hygiene supplies that didn't have supplies if this place gets shut down are you going to help the people or you know complain more that there's people on the corners asking for money while you're complaining to get the places to help them shut down.

Also, saying we pay for sober living makes it appear that they pay for sober living permanently and that’s not the case. I believe it’s only a week or 2 and they have to get a job so that statement is very misleading to people and a difference between a few hundred dollars and thousands of dollars in peoples minds I would think.",11,2024-02-16 03:57:19 UTC

If companies want to help her have at it .  They don’t want to do research and donate money or services to a building of hers go for it .  A simple google search should give them pause.  More garbage cans will make zero difference, I regularly walk the bike path and in spite of garbage cans and dog waste bags people throw their trash and don’t clean up after their dogs .   Allowing her volunteers to be actively using is an example of hard core enabling and she of all people should know better .Honestly I hate to say it , but maybe nothing will ever get resolved unless or until something bad goes down.",10,2024-02-16 00:26:48 UTC

I watched the video, and the comment about picking up the blankets made me actually say fuck you bitch.   There are blankets and tents dumped all over that area from the same few people.  She has supported many encampments in the area over the years, and she never does or pays for the clean up.  It is either the city or the property owner on the hook.  I walked from Kishwuakee to 11th Street yesterday via Railroad, and the whole area was filled with garbage.  The problem isn't lack of trash cans, it's her handing out shit that creates trash. 

Funny how the volunteer had the full size shampoo right next to the travel size and claimed the volunteer didn't know where things were at?

And she continues to dig herself into a deeper hole showing all the electronics bought with donations, and saying what is spent on Uber and cigarettes, like $500 per rehab trip.  I liked how she spent $200 on a sanitizer for a $10 tube of drugstore lipstick.  How about just not accepting used make-up?  And if they can ask for food donations, why aren't cleaning supplies, and paper products on the donation list?  

I don't believe Rockford Urban Ministries had a meeting offering her support, more like a come to Jesus.  And funny how the board now needs to approve her post, and she can't say what spouts out of her mouth.",8,2024-02-16 01:23:51 UTC

1) Didn’t Carly agree with the stipulations the city gave her in order to continue her NFP. I believe the answer is yes , so why after being given years to comply do you think she shouldn’t have to ?

2)Do you think because she hands out lunches, hygiene products, sends some people to rehab she shouldn’t be subjected to the same guidelines and protocols every other NFP who does the same service has to follow.?

3) Why would you think we have some prejudice against a segment of society most of us are passionate about protecting?  You said we should volunteer down there. I have indicated I have volunteered, as have other commenters .  This is why we have concerns . 

4) When  exactly should people speak up about our concerns?  Should we just sit back and speak up after something horrible happens .  Are sack lunches and hygiene products a fair trade if someone gets hurt or killed down there ?",8,2024-02-15 18:20:24 UTC

The city has taken her to court due to the non compliance from the SUP she received from them in 2019. She agreed in 2019 to the conditions and requirements of the SUP and making the fixes to the building that are in the report. They took her on good faith that she would comply as she stated she would but then she had no intention of doing so. She was able to deflect for years and it’s all coming out how she neglected to abide by the requirements and how she admits she didn’t think she would have to in the RRStar article that was online last week. It will be printed in the Sunday paper (thats their plan) coming up for any of you who want to pick it up to read it that way.

Wouldn’t make any sense to have so much money and donations or all kinds for a couple hours a day a few days a week so that’s why she posts that it’s all the time 24/7/365. Inflating your numbers is how you launder money. So when people say why does it matter if it’s 30 or 300 lunches, it does because when you are falsely claiming that you help 10 times the amount of people you really are then people keep sending things and money and she has reoccurring monthly donations as well. Now she is stating she doesn’t have a receipt when people send things, there’s a value to everything and I can tell you from my experience she was not tracking the things and the oversight of her spending from the supposed “board” is not a thing. She is not forthcoming on her spending to the board and for them, they know what she tells them which I can say is not much. It’s a very big con she has and it’s still running without Glory who has spoke out on the misappropriation of funds as well as them firing Kerri the business admin who exposed the fraud. Now she has some different folks on the board (from the past years) that she can con until they realize it and are gone as well. With so much turnover you can see how it’s easy to manipulate. She got greedy and continues to shoot herself in the foot/leg- no pun intended. The “code” she thinks she has with her volunteers is knowledge to many who are and have been inside her operation.",5,2024-02-16 13:35:36 UTC

Not every person who has sex for money is human trafficked. Some are just pure prostitutes. If you do your homework on human sex trafficking, those victims are FORCED to have sex for money. They will most definitely not be running to a place like Carly’s to get make up and shit.  They do not get to run around freely like that. I’ve talked to some of the girls that Carly claims are trafficked girls and they were not or at not trafficked. They said they chose to sell their bodies. And that there is a BIG difference in that vs trafficking. I feel, and they said so too, that Caley uses the “trafficked women” term to rope in more money.

Why after years and years of this, people aren’t logically questioning this 24!hr need. Rockford isn’t that big of a town and she isn’t the only organization serving.

Think about a regular NFP, with hours of operation, that follows the laws tracking ALL things. They have a designated individual(s) for receiving donations and such that gets documented and reported. 

Carly operates 24/7/365 which means the majority of things and money coming in are received by HER or some random person and there is ZERO oversight to reporting these items correctly. I can tell you she doesn’t track all the things based on seeing it. There is a HUGE lack of documentation and that was why someone was hired and in doing this it was discovered she is misappropriating funds as well and now that bookkeeper has been fired for exposing her. If she hired someone to work a set number of hours, to be the only one receiving and tracking all the things, then there would be accountability because the control around that needs to be completely removed from Carly, she’s a dishonest person and she is capitalizing on peoples generosity and naivety. It’s quite brilliant really, she has everything provided for her and her family (ie: clothes, food, multiple gaming systems, crafts, circuit, books like a library, toys, exotic animals, furniture, everything) while claiming only a small fraction of the incoming items and monetary donations coming in. 

Again, someone who is constantly saying we need this and we need that and we buy this and we buy that when there is not the numbers she states to support the needs she claims, again, I’ve seen this. It is a tactic fraudulent people/organizations use to hide the money. They create more need for things and money than is actually needed to be able to line their pockets.",9,2024-02-16 20:11:23 UTC

Page replied privately

Then Carly response 

Butterball Clark I get what you’re saying and trust me….not only do they have dirty laundry but plenty of that dirty laundry is directly a part of the situation we are in. Their actions caused us major setbacks and even worse problems….but we have tried so hard to avoid a mudslinging circus…. The thing that brings me comfort is that we have plenty of evidence and records and eventually everything will come into light. I do feel bad for the people who are following them and attacking us because I think they are going to be very ashamed of themselves, ultimately, but it was their choice to do so so they have to deal with those feelings. 

I fear some will not ever admit they made a mistake or feel any shame because I have noticed a common thread… many of these people don’t want to be reasoned with…they don’t want to believe anything other than what they believe. some people like a good conspiracy theory and even worse….a witch hunt. It’s so sad, but this is nothing new, it’s happened since the dawn of civilization and it’s only intensified due to the relative anonymity of social media. It seems like people think there are no consequences to their words on social media. They don’t seem to care who it hurts and what it does to families and businesses and innocent people caught in the crossfire. They CHOOSE to believe these things because it’s juicy news and exciting and drama filled and makes them feel better about their own life. Bad news has always sold papers. It is sad that these individuals choose to attack us after all we have done for the community. Just supremely sad. It’s hard to stomach, for sure. I tend to chock that up to the fact that hurt people tend to hurt people and that at least helps me sleep at night. It’s such an unfortunate chain reaction of ugliness and so many innocent people will suffer greatly if we ever were to close our doors. 

…. But I know one cliché that I have seen come true over and over: 

What’s done in the dark will come to light.

Another post from Jason Personal page : 

Ash Rootes I’m living in a church where you have to buy your own food,I can’t get food stamps because of something in Illinois,I obviously don’t know my way around,or anyone, and these people seem a little ‘cultish’ ,I’m very uncomfortable here,so much so that’s why I’m thinking about coming back, ain’t that fucked up?

I mean the audacity of them to expect this able bodied man to buy his own food, giving him a place to stay isn’t enough I guess !!!!  He can’t get food stamps !!! Apparently, he has no interest in a J.O.B.  This is why they “love” her so much.  She enables some of them to have zero accountability.  It’s just endless rehab, sober living and free stuff .

She came up with some nasty words to call them but I can't recall but the internet is forever. She can delete all she wants but it won't do any good. 

Liz said...""It is important to us that you know that a majority of the code violations from the city have been completed for some time now and that others will no longer be an issue as the family has now moved out of 1125. It is our understanding that once the repairs to the HVAC and plumbing at 1125 are completed, most, if not all, of the code violations will have been addressed and rectified.""

Liz also said they get very few cash donations and what they do get goes towards operating expenses. I think those words will come back to haunt her. What about those monthly recurring donations? What about those 2 checks Carly got and posted proudly, around $30,000 IIRC. The birthday fundraiser that raised around $10,000. The hospital check?

This is exactly why the problems she’s creating need to stop. These folks are capable of getting jobs and being independent but why do that if Carly can ask for everything for free for them? She is destroying the area and creating even more dependency out there from people who once were probably working and living paycheck to paycheck to now not working at all and getting their “things” from her. If they have to go to her place and move some things around and sweep the floor but get their furniture and food and clothes from the generous donors for free then why work? And yes, I said from the donors, Carly doesn’t pay for anything or use the money she gets every month to buy things for people. She relies solely on all the donors to provide it so that the money is kept for herself and the board to get paid back his loan. That’s why she is always showing her bare shelves to people. Now since she can’t “ask” for anything. Give me, give me, give me, I have found and created so many more people that are dependent on me now since I’m not following any laws or accountability around a thing.

The pizza donation is equally weird. It could have been saved until the next day and heated up for the volunteers (or eaten cold). No need for Carly's family to take one.

An Octopus if you will; Tax fraud, theft, building code violations, needles and drugs, food, cat litter, etc.  A TASK FORCE needs to be created with at least one person from each department to address the ""tentacle"" of the Octopus that is relative to what they do in said dept.  Weekly meetings should include information that has been gathered, violations that are occurring, and a plan of action to shut her down.  Instead, most city depts have no idea what's going on. There is ZERO communication among the ones that do know, so Miss Muppet carries on, as usual.  Then, make a nice big binder for the big guns (AG, IRS, Rockford PD, Etc) with the findings.  The people in this group have done an outstanding job of information gathering and reporting.  The public is waking up.  I don't see that a task force would be a long-term endeavor.

When she was issued the SUP in 2019 it was done in good faith, and they had to give her a chance to follow through. . Then COVID happened, and the way a lot of things happened changed.  After that, the city responded to concerned citizens' complaints, issued the building owner Jacob, and MIss Carly's Inc the building code citations and fines.  Jacob and Carly signed a document acknowledging the code violations in **September or October 2022**, and again did not follow through on the repairs, so the city took them to court in **January 2023.**  Carly and Jacob have managed to stretch out the court's decision.    Would love to pull the court transcripts and paperwork on this.

I do find it odd that the city has not condemned the property and pulled the SUP yet.  My guess is that the ""clock is stopped"" on that due to the court case.  The city does not have the jurisdiction regarding her wire fraud and the treatment of her children, and I'm not sure if they pass on information to the law enforcement agencies that can prosecute her for these type of things.

Imagine that you are in poverty, going through the most vulnerable moments of your life, out of nowhere, a bunch of photographers show up and ask you to participate in a photoshoot, what can you do? You can’t say no to them, they are essentially your patrons and your financial situation entirely depends on them, and thus, you cannot risk angering them. So you are basically forced to take part in these photoshoots that only project the fake stereotypes of poverty onto you instead of documenting what you actually go through every day, how would you feel? Photographers and charity organisations are able to exploit their advantageous position to force people into participating in shots which perpetuate stereotypes, this is extremely disrespectful to poor people and takes away their dignity, and thus is a form of dehumanisation.",15,2024-02-22 10:33:06 UTC

The most common form of sex trafficking is your own parents or family selling you for their benefit.  I’ve specialized in fostering teens for years, both officially and unofficially and every kid I provided a home to had been trafficked by their biological relatives.  Are there pimps in Rockford?  Yes.  Do they traffick women?  Yes.  But it’s still not the most common form of sex trafficking.  Also, the vast majority of sex trafficking victims don’t even know they have been trafficked.

Often times Carly says she “asks” people if they would like to share their story with Facebook, and have their picture taken and blasted on social media. If someone is telling you that they are the only one that can help you, they are the only one that can save you, then gives you things that you otherwise wouldn’t have, that would compel most people to feel indebted. They would want to please the savior. So even if they say yes, I’m sure it’s out of obligation and a sense that maybe they would disappoint the savior and the carrot that has been dangled, would be snatched away. Remember, Carly says herself that these people have been through trauma. She is playing on their trauma so she can benefit. Sometimes on Facebook live she puts them on the spot too. If you are dealing with people who have experienced great trauma, then you put their safety and mental health at the forefront. Carly does not. In her recent post she once again shares details of a woman who escaped traffickers. That’s dangerous. She tells us how the woman almost fell into trying to help others but realized that was not good for her. That’s not mine or anyone else’s business. That is that woman’s business. This woman is trying to turn her life around but Carly is putting it out there where she is located, that she is getting away from abusers etc. once again, all of that is dangerous.",5,2024-02-21 05:16:43 UTC

100% correct and we've talked about this. If all comments are turned off on the MC Facebook page, I doubt there would be as many donations because the donors NEED to see their names being used for good and they need the acknowledgement and pats on the back and need everyone to see what they are doing. There is no reason for someone to post that they sent 20 pairs of socks or 3 boxes of pudding cups other than to just get the adoration. It's rather sad. Also, it was mentioned awhile back about Facebook and how she can control the narrative there by blocking and deleting. It's the perfect marriage.",8,2024-02-20 22:28:23 UTC

How about the young gentleman who was going to start a lawn care business, in spite of having no license or  vehicle.  How much money, lawn mowers, weed wackers were donated . How did people think he was getting these lawn care items from  point A to point B. ?  My guess is stuff was returned to the stores and he got little if any of the money. Haven’t heard  another word about him ,  then there is Dennis whose family came all the way from the “big bad  city “ , and once they met the mighty Oz were  literally skipping out singing Christmas carols , while he rots on the streets of Rockford. Again not another word about him .  As far as the followers , yes it has been mentioned time and time again how they need everyone to see how wonderful they are after donating some ramen noodles. Let’s  face it a lot of them will never admit they could be wrong. Way too much invested .  The businesses who donate are doing it for a tax write off and free advertisement.

She wouldn’t be talking about this stuff if she wasn’t hiding the truth.

That woman needs to use legitimate services and stay away from that place before she gets sucked in and is an active user again like a lot of her volunteers. Being in a place that is full of drugs is not ideal for someone trying to stay clean. It almost sets them up for failure so she can then be their savior and human trafficker. Such a scary situation for all involved. 

I’m also wondering why Liz knowingly is involved in the fraudulent operation. She has been told and is still there so when it goes down it’s going to drag her down as well. Felonies follow you forever and she could loose her business and good name! There are plenty of other places she can volunteer her services to help others but seems odd that she remains still BUT there’s a lot of inside information coming this way so maybe that’s why she remains. If she’s a plant then in that case, good for her! It must be hard for Carly to know who’s there legitimately and who is there to gather information because there are several now. She has tried to stop her volunteers from talking by threatening them that they can no longer be there volunteering there if they talk about what’s going on there BUT they continue to talk. Who’s the human trafficker now?",12,2024-02-21 12:57:15 UTC

I’ve watched Carly’s volunteers (not Carly) pile donations into peoples cars and it’s things they didn’t even ask for or want. It’s careless and it’s a HUGE waste of people’s money and things that have been donated. These resources would be better off at one of the other donation centers where they actually have legitimate support, processes, and accountability around the things done there. Carly operates as a free for all with the donations/money and there is no checks and balances.

Hope he gets his daughter back if he should have her. Carly circumvented the process by applying for guardianship someone said previously and at this point most people don’t realize DCFS has been called and reports made multiple times regarding all 3 of those kids but Carly is a liar and a manipulator so when they show up announced she has all her things in place and she presents herself like on her SM fake and staged.,9,2024-02-22 13:20:18 UTC

She was vocal in the comments about how the baby was better off with her. And it sounded like she was engaged in visits as well. However, I haven't seen her comment in quite some time, so it is unclear what her involvement or point of view is these days. 

I always thought it was in such poor taste of Carly to post pictures of the baby...showing off all of the fun things they were able to do with her, all of the milestones they were experiencing with her...while her biological parents were out there, hurting, missing those milestones, and wanting her back. For someone who preaches about believing in second chances and is open about her own struggles with addiction while taking care of her children, she sure doesn't seem very empathetic to the biological parents. Or the trauma of adoption. Because even in the very best of adoptions, adoption is still traumatic.",6,2024-02-24 01:22:12 UTC

I think Zion pulled video of the second attempted abduction bc people were questioning her. Who knows what was on that video. We only have Carly doing a Facebook post describing what happened.

Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with Mary and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all Carly saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.  They don’t have the facilities for that and not one person, Carly or her homeless volunteers are trained to do that .

She’s using them… has them working for her, feeds them, and then talks about how they sleep on the streets at night and then they come back the next day. She is dangerous! How is this solving the problem they have by using them day in and out to do the work but they get no wage and little benefits and no real housing? She posted someone died (not the first) in a windowsill a few weeks ago, someone that she didn’t really help because they still were on the streets. So very sad and she used the horrible incident to pump donations in because she is the only one who can save their lives. One of her recent live videos she asked what clean (sober) meant to the addict she was filming, and he said no drugs and no alcohol. So that would mean Carly herself is not clean, that’s what her volunteers have said. The non-addict ones that are no longer there because they were a liability to her operation and at risk of exposing her. I believe that’s why Glory and Dena are no longer there as they were a liability to her fraud. Carly never finished her own treatment as she was kicked out but somehow she should be helping other addicts, among the other services she keeps piling on? She has also claimed she has had mental illness problems her whole life and somehow people think it’s safe for someone like this to run this kind of operation with zero oversight? She herself needs help… 

And on top of all that, it’s the community that is feeding the volunteers now too since they have a “meal train” to feed volunteers daily… oh, and you can also donate money to that too, I’m shocked... 
So let me get this straight since she has all the avenues of collecting donations/money covered… buy from her Amazon list, set up monthly reoccurring donations, donate to her link, donate to bring food daily on a meal train link, donate money on a meal train link, just show up with money, drinks, and food whenever you want because she’s always “desperately” posting. Reminds me of her need to get her “next fix”. She continues to exploit people in her posts and profit off of people who need real solutions from actual services with people who have been trained for this. I pray that something bad doesn’t happen there where someone gets really hurt (it probably already has). Does she even have insurance on that building and the people inside? How would she even get insurance on such a place that has so many code violations that one shouldn’t work or live there according to the city’s official statements??",15,2023-12-29 22:06:13 UTC

It’s dangerous to post pictures of trafficked women or women escaping domestic violence. It’s disgusting that she places these women and their children in danger. I have spoken to many in law enforcement and fire department and they say that they avoid Carly like the plague. She has to legitimatize herself so she drops their names to do that. No law enforcement officer would risk an abuser or trafficker seeing a picture of the person they are trafficking/abusing on Carly’s Facebook page to get donations from chumps who clearly have no discernment of dangerous situations. The comments are always praising Jesus Carly. Anyone who says “ why are you putting these people in danger?” Gets blocked and comments deleted quickly.

Every holiday, whatever she does is ""TRADITION"" !!!!!  Implying she has been doing this for years.  Tradition is Santa coming on Christmas Eve, Tradition is having ham for dinner. If you go back, she has done something different every year, except put her family first on Christmas Day.  I'm still shaking my head from the video the other day saying she came in the door on Christmas day with people waiting for her inside.  No freaking boundaries !!!!! 

I think she is posting these stories in hopes that when the city does get to shut her down, it will make the city look like they are taking away a community treasure, and people will be so upset they will blow up the phone lines at City Hall. The City can't leverage social media the way she can.  The City needs to make it very clear MC's lack of compliance with everything and all the chances she had over a period of four years.  The COVID excuse needs to be shot down, and it needs to be pointed out what an SUP is, and why their claim of having a duty to do moree during Covid is BS.  They also need to point out how she endangers her family with unsavory characters in the home everyday.   I don't know if the city can comment on the fraud and exploitation, but hopefully the local media has been paying attention and can add that into any reporting.  

The 30 minute miracle was quite the story.  

* I’m so proud of our volunteers and our staff! When a woman is fleeing domestic violence or human trafficking, we need to act fast. This woman came to us after she was rescued by the fire dept and we had a safe house secured, an Uber out front, she was fed, and had a suitcase full of everything she needs for the next couple weeks…all within 30 MINUTES! 

So who is the staff?  Was this woman involved in trafficking or DV, and she rolled trafficking in  for good measure?  Was she brought there by FD, or came on her own after she was rescued, and FD was rolled in there to look like she is a resource for them? Can she just leave a job or children for a few weeks at a safe house in a different city?  What will be her resources and who will provide them long term?   A prime example of how she twists things to make them seem different than they are.  Why not just say, we helped a woman get to a safe house quickly?  But she adds all these other things that may or may not be relevant, and will make people who are good hearted believe something very different.",8,2023-12-30 13:26:22 UTC

A SLAVE. Like WTF? She throws this word around a lot. Here is the post, of course it’s a book:

“There is this sort I have seen many times that I always secretly liked. It said: “SHOOT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD FENTANYL DEALER.”

Like many of us, I have lost one too many people to fentanyl poisoning. But over the last few months I have been thinking About what this shirt says. I hate violence, so I certainly wouldn't want anyone to shoot anyone, but I had all these really big and complicated feelings about loosing so many friends. 

But then this skinny young man started to talk to me late at night when he was coming to get food. I was always kind to him because he was kind and respectful to me. I knew what he was doing on the streets because I had driven by the corner he works on the bad side of town many times. I hoped like I do for everyone who seems to be suffering that he‘d hit a wall at some point and asks or help, and that day came, but what came out of his mouth shocked me to the core. 

He was a slave. 

The existence he described can only be described as such, with living arrangements and treatment worse than that of a dog. His keepers, can only be described as unhinged and sadistic. 

It shook me up pretty good because I wondered how many pleading glances I had missed keeping myself so concerned with the women who want out. And kind of routinely feeding them men and meeting their most basic of needs not being sensitive to the possibility that they need me to offer escape.  

One thing I have to remind myself of from time-to-time and that I think you all should be aware of is that these young “thugs,” or “gang members” that are on the streets, the kind of people who look like they are definitely up to no good…not all of them are in this role by choice. 

EXACTLY like trafficked women are lured in, brutalized, and broken down until they are submissive…pretty much the exact same process is used in creating “soldiers” who are then dispersed around an area to sell drugs, be look outs and are involved with all levels of organized crime. 

Not only are they afraid to be beat down, or even killed, but there are always security measures taken beyond that to ensure your total obedience.…pets, childhood friends, mothers, children, even dear old grannies can be un-alived with a phone call. 

Am I saying that these young men are innocent and should not face any consequences? NO. 

But I am saying that they were once an innocent and they may have been turned into what you see by grooming, brute force, and or psychological torment.

 We know environment plays a huge role, but what I have to remind myself is that the person I am taking to, that I am trying not to judge for their lifestyle, may be screaming inside…they may want out with every fiber of their being, but are too afraid to run away because…who would have them after what they have done and who they have become? 

I remember feeling just that way as a women wanting out of trafficking and over the past few years what I have learned that without a shadow of doubt, so many young and not young men feel the exact same way I did. 

…and I have to look at them differently now. I have to have empathy.

 And I think if we can all try to remember that these individuals, these dangerous looking criminals, are human beings and that maybe THEY are the ones who need rescuing for a change. If we can be open to that, then we are closer to a world where these people are granted the time and space and GRACE to heal. 

Step one is not judging, educating ourselves and having empathy ❤️”",6,2024-01-01 18:43:20 UTC

Between getting dropped by legal representation multiple times, asking for a new judge (you know, one that sees it their way), and all the excuses they make with ZERO accountability it will just be another delay… Carly has mastered the art of living off of everyone else for her entire life… she knows how to work the system and most regular people (like donors) have no idea since they are not criminals like her… I spoke to someone who donated to her this past Christmas and last and they will NOT be doing so again. They did it because it was easy to just drop off stuff in the alley and other places are harder to contact because they are normal business hours and such (not a living establishment too), with no one clamoring for the things that come in the door immediately. 

I think if we continue to educate and shed light to what’s really going on there it will eventually dry up. People want to just believe in miracles and that people have the right intentions. 

So, anytime anyone on here sees a company out around town or if you are friends via fb or other social media platforms, I urge you to share what you know and encourage them to do some digging before turning over to her organization.

And Katie's Cup does book sales inside their coffee shop. Inzombia also is downtown not far from Maze. I think the solution to that one already exists, so it's not about finding something new, but more about supporting what already exists. 

There's also something called Griffin & Gargoyle in the works in Lake Geneva. It'll be a DND themed tavern, and if that does well, it'll open the door to other themed places like that opening outside of major cities.

Given that movie theaters as a whole are dying in favor of streaming services, I sadly don't think a drive in would operate too terribly well anymore. I know McHenry and Dixon are a drive but at least they're somewhat nearby. 

I think when it comes to the 24hr diner stuff, sadly, COVID killed the late night crowd in Rockford. I think people need a reason to be out that late again, rather than just opening another restaurant like that. I personally love how Disco Chicken is open until midnight almost every day, which doesn't fully fit the 24hr, but it is nice to have a local place to go that isn't Spring Garden.

Can you answer why Dena  says they're only sending the most desperate cases to rehab, but Carly makes it sounds like she's sending her usual amount of people to rehab every day, see all these are the things that she's getting caught in lies and she just won't address it. She just moves onto her next story . she's the one that put herself out there, she's the one that begs constantly for money and has gotten probably well over $1 million just last year.

I am a social worker. Lived in Rockford a long time. Some of my longtime friends also became social workers, in Rockford. I can tell you all of us side eyed her from day one. There are a lot of people like this in our profession. You see it in the veterans world a lot. It never ends well. People get hurt. 

Our field actually started like Miss Carly’s. It was Jane Adams who started this over 100 years ago. So Miss Carly has clearly never even researched social work as a profession. 

The reason why most agencies don’t operate like Miss Carly is because people get hurt. There need to be boundaries and we have a code of ethics that is all about not hurting anyone. It’s not healthy for her or her family to never be off, if that’s even true. It’s not healthy to put her “clients” on social media like that. It’s not healthy to have all volunteers, this work is hard and the workers need to be trained and paid. 

Miss Carly is woefully unaware of what is available especially to seniors. During the pandemic, there was extra funding available for seniors. I commented on these posts, trying to link them. No one ever responded.",17,2023-12-23 20:14:01 UTC

I think the media has figured out what she is.  She is a good story teller, but not so good that she can keep track of how the story details always change.  I've noticed the down turn in her FB traffic too.  Maybe people are reporting the posts where she puts links to donate and Amazon as a scam.

And any city official that stops by is doing so for recon not as support, they can’t just show up empty handed to “look” lol.

Those officials certainly must feel like fools now but they are doing the right thing it’s just a slow process. 

As for Glory, I saw her wanting to volunteer her services elsewhere in a comment on the “Liam Foundation”. This is a place where the processes are being followed legitimately and posted on frequently and also was on the front page of the RRStar the other day. 

As for the line of people, the numbers always change. She was saying she feeds 1000 and another volunteer challenged her that they were only making 3,000 in a week so how is that possible? Of course that person no longer is there helping either, which is the way it works when you are a “normie” (not an addict), you realize shits crazy and not legit and you high tail it outta there! 

Cue the post where we see all of her “volunteers” in line for food as a photo op to say look at all these people to counter our claims. 🤣

She already got the city post outta the way to counter our talks about all her city violations.

Instagram is SO user unfriendly. Reddit has the most intelligent people, by far. I follow a lot of subreddits and there is a plethora of good truthful information here.

Her son, Jordan died homeless on the streets of Florida of a fentanyl overdose.  Ironically, I remembered who this guy was when I started my research.  His family is one that Carly raised money for since his wife was ‘dying’ and they needed to get to Florida.  I had indicated a few weeks ago that Carly had raised money for someone to move, and their felony records continued once moving.  She was arrested for things like begging, drugs, fake ID’s, the list goes on.  So it was pretty obvious it was a scam of a fundraiser, not sure whose fault, Carly, the husband/wife, or if everyone profited.  But it shows you can’t just hand money to addicts like that.  The wife went to jail on/off, and the husband died.  Carly didn’t save anyone, once again.",7,2023-12-24 00:04:55 UTC

Erin Chapman we do provide everything that people need when going to treatment (clothing, toiletries, new socks/underwear, shoes, etc). We also pay for their transportation to treatment and back, along with their first week and deposit in sober living. We also help them get an ID and start the process of finding a job and so much more. 

There have been a few people that have said they have been “turned away” and I have reached out to several of them but have not heard back. 

If someone comes to Miss Carly’s and there is something that we can help them with we most certainly will. 

Please remember our Community days are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. People can come shop on those days and talk about going to treatment or get resources for housing or other needs.

I am biased tho bc I knew some of her lying behavior from mutual friends and I witnessed the Irish Rose FB incident which made it clear she was looking for clout and attention. To be fair, she may have been right about the Rose, I wouldn’t known and I support people calling out “me too” even if it’s messy. But one of the comments from the waitress always stuck with me-she said “Carly, you were here last night and everything was fine, what happened?”

I would not call this social work and legally she can’t call herself that. I would say this is one of the worst examples I have ever seen of someone using “social work” to grift people and simultaneously fuck them up and be sloppy. I have seen a lot of veterans lie about their service and start advocacy and outreach groups. I worked for a vet like that. He took over a small agency on the south side and used the grant money to pay for his meals (not business like grub hub) and suits. But he never got involved with the clients so they were safe and handled appropriately. That staff did a lot of grassroots work with the homeless in the area who were not our clients. Linking them with services. We had a rotating schedule to feed them every day and we fed them out of our own pockets. They ate the same food that we did. No one ever got on FB and asked for handouts lol. 

Anyone in the field who hears about a direct service place that doesn’t use grants, doesn’t pay people, and doesn’t follow mandated reporting is going to immediately see the red flags. 

From what I heard from insiders who work for the big players in social services in Rockford, some worked with her because there was nothing. Like she said the hospital reached out to her to get people to rehab. Well if that’s true, the hospital must have been utterly up a creek without a paddle and forced to d/c. This happens regardless of the quality of hospital or the staff. It’s due to payer issues. 

Sorry for the long rant I could go on forever lol.",7,2023-12-26 02:08:07 UTC

I can't say anything about financials. I don't work for her, I rarely donate, I have volunteered twice, and I know people that have utilized her services. 

I feel it's worth putting the knowledge I do have, out there as I'm not seeing many people mention some of these specifics.

1. Homeless people and addicts are usually viewed as ""less than,"" even when trying to get into facilities that are supposed to help them. From the people thst work there to the CEOs that establish protocol, the person who is struggling is VERY often either treated like shit or given hoops to jump through that are damn near impossible. Carly speaks about this in a recent post about needing IDs and a phone to get into facilities. 

The people that I know that have been helped by her have been grateful to be ""met where they are at,"" with absolutely no shame whether they make it or not and are encouraged to keep trying. These people are you and me, they are someone's son/daughter/husband/mother/best friend etc. who just can't seem to get their footing back in normal society. I say this from experience, until you have really witnessed it or lived it, you cannot understand how difficult it is to get a job, keep a job, stay clean, or find housing.

2. You talk about a place that you consider comparable, Carpenter's place (and I am fully aware of others: the Rescue Mission, Rosecrance, Mulberry Center, Stepping Stones, etc.) As another person mentioned, there are rules and regulations that make getting help difficult. It may not meet someone where they are at. The Christianity aspect being one.

Sure, they could get in, but what about when they get kicked out because some counselor has an attitude that day and says they are being aggressive when really their emotions are completely raw from withdrawing? Back to the streets. Perhaps they try again to go there in a month or 2. This time they use once and are told to leave. This cycle can continue for all of the shelters/programs etc. Eventually the person feels too ashamed to go anywhere feeling like a total failure or is blacklisted with nowhere else to go.

3. Harm reduction is HUGE. It keeps people alive long enough to give them a CHANCE to get recovery.

4. Referencing what some have said about the buildings and her living situation and such: if you go back to the beginning, she just lived there in a sketchy neighborhood on a drug addled street with hookers. She offered a meal once and an idea seemed to be born. Due to the connections of people she already had from growing up in the area, people shared her first post and it just started to grow. In my personal opinion, it grew way too fast for anyone to manage, let alone an addict with a couple years off hard drugs. 

Systems were not put into place, positions were not made, they seem to just keep trying to catch up with what's in front of them. Adding storage, buying buildings, needing more as popularity grows. It's a hot mess there, but my personal opinion is that the intention is still to serve, while having no model to go off of. First meals, then clothing, then donations, then volunteers, then treatment, then meals for volunteers, gifts for kids in poor families, etc. I have seen the thousands of sandwiches and the backpacks full of treatment supplies and the free phones and the donation room jam packed and bustling. 

5. My final thought for now is that I greatly appreciate that she brings humanity and thus support to a group of people that are often rejected by society. When the ""worshippers"" of facebook make comments cheering someone on to go to treatment. That person gets to hear about that when they would normally be completely isolated with no support. It also opens the non-homeless/addicted/trafficked person's eyes to see these people out in their world and be a bit kinder. 

I think that's all I have. I appreciate the openness in which you are presenting your questions, so I felt my reply would be heard.",10,2023-10-30 06:34:04 UTC

She does. She understands that if you get someone intl treatment and they already smoke cigarettes that providing them that small vice will help them in the long run to quit hard drugs like heroin, cocaine and meth. It's incredibly difficult to quit smoking regular nicotine cigarettes on their own. Having to do that while quitting hard drugs can make quitting the hard drugs impossible. When my own mother had to go inpatient for alcoholism to get her kids back they tried to force her to quit smoking and she refused because she couldn't do both at the same time.

She isn't taking away resources because people chose where to donate too. Anyone can encourage others to donate to other charities instead. She can't even take everything people want to donate all the time. She does feed people, she gets people into drug treatment by earning their trust and making them believe they can get clean and stay clean. You can't force addicts to work with counselors if they aren't ready to. That just continues to leave them on the streets with no one they can trust.

She administers and teaches others how to administer narcan. She feeds people, she gets people into drug treatment, she helps people access services when they might not know where to start or how to access those services.

Cigarettes aren't ruining people's lives the way hard drugs are. 

Clean needles help prevent the spread of disease, condoms help prevent the spread of disease. She helps keep these people alive while building trust so that she can get them into treatment.

What's the goal here? You are absolutely free to donate to carpenters place or any other local charity if you want or advocate for those same charities.

A big part of being homeless in Rockford was just trying to find a place to exist without being expected to pay money. Carpenter's was great for this. They made you get a case manager but that was super easy and quick and genuinely helped you with things. I frequently got shaving stuff and clothes. They would give you a tote to store stuff. The food was always perfectly acceptable and there was no extortion with making you sit through church stuff. Of course they had the church stuff but it was after the food and if you didn't want to listen you didn't have to. You could read or anything else quiet.

RRR treated it's men like criminals. The hours they made you keep made it impossible to get or hold a job. The security people that were supposed to guard your stuff frequently stole. I had a friend who was working overnights at McDonald's but the head guy named Lugene didn't believe him for some reason so he had to sleep outside. You woke at 5am and had to be back at the shelter at 4pm if you were late at all you were locked out. The people in charge would constantly threaten you with being kicked out and really relished the small amount of power they had. They forced you to come back at 1130 three days a week to listen to the place that Josh Duggar went for being a pedo.

It was horrible. Fuck that place. I went to jail afterwards and it was legit an upgrade.

And full disclosure I was in active heroin addiction so of course that colors my experiences. I am almost 8 years sober now though.

EDIT: There were several places that helped me out. Magpie gave me free coffee and breakfast. The Lutheran church by the disaster house was incredible to me. And people at both hospitals were great. They were so much nicer than I deserved.",10,2023-11-24 22:07:26 UTC

The “take what works and leave what doesn’t” approach is the key to harm reduction. 

I encourage you to read up on harm reduction and its goals of meeting “folks where they are at”. It’s meant to keep folks alive until/if they are ready for more traditional programs. 

Did you know Miss Carly is far from the only person/group using a harm reduction/mutual aid approach? There are networks in Rockford that have existed for generations. Especially in the housing projects, these are kept very low key to prevent police incursion. Winnebago County Health Department is also using this model. Rockford actually has a higher overdose rate than Chicago and like I said earlier has the worst trafficking problem in the state. It would horrify most if they knew how entrenched it is and just who exactly is using these women (and trans folks and some young men). Think rich white powerful men.

The Diocese of Rockford has at least one school that could be used to house the homeless, and they still have access to enough money to convert them. They remodeled and expanded one of their churches instead. What would serve the community more, remodeling Holy Family so it has a shiny new entrance or giving a school or two an upgrade so people can get off the street and away from dealers?

Now that is not an excuse for the addict’s bad behavior, but your jaded view of addicts is unhelpful.

That being said, and while harm reduction IS effective, that does not mean everyone is on here defending MC and her “needle program”. She has no business exchanging needles if she lacks the proper pieces that need to be in place to be able to exchange needles legally. What she was doing was illegal, and in fact, NOT harm reduction. She was actually causing more harm by illegally exchanging needles that who knows if they met the proper standards and policies. That is reckless and harmful and could have caused a whole host of problems, with the most severe being death.

What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during Covid because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that MC would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with Housing First that Rockford is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  MC rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in winter.  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

Here are some links on the work the city does.

I took your advice and did indeed “check” myself,  I reread your comment where you indicated she deals with things other organizations don’t want to deal with.  My response indicated there is other places that offer services. Your most recent response to me lists such organizations, which validated my response.  Is there enough services? Probably not , but that is not unique to Rockford.  No city has endless funds to solve or manage every issue.  As far as the needle exchange she had no authority to do that and was recently shut down.   Yes she gives out sandwiches, but no where near the amount she says. She does get some people in rehab in a day , which in itself is suspect.  Almost every other place has a waiting list. Why not share with other organizations this rehab, so even more people could be helped?  Her housing is getting a few people in a hotel for a couple nights every once in a while. Rockford rescue mission offers beds also.  They also offer hot meals.  Carpenters Place offers breakfast and lunch along with laundry service among many other things. So like I said, she isn’t offering things no one else wants to deal with .I certainly appreciate your blind loyalty to her “mission” and you have every right to that.  Others have a right to question the validity of her over the top claims. Checks and balances are a good thing. Before you roll out the comment to volunteer, myself and others on this thread did volunteer.  We have valid  concerns on some of the activities going on down there .

I have personally been inside Miss Carly's and have seen first hand the work that she provides for the homeless, addicted and mental ill. I definitely did not do an inventory of the food she hangs out on a daily basis. So I'm not gonna speak on that at all. I did visually see her speak to an individual that was gonna go AWOL on probation, while helping a handicap women in a wheel chair with her adolescent child get some clothes and food, at the same time help another individual get into drug rehab. All within 30 minutes. She and her facility are trying to help where she can. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted at these posts tearing down an organization that is here to help. 
Before I go out of my way to ridicule someone in any fashion, I need to look at myself and ask ""have I done everything to help this individual with their mission?""  Because if I have not done that, all I'm doing is judging.  And then the next question is why? Am I ashamed of my lack of cooperation in this mission? Am I projecting my own bullshit into someone else?
 And for me, there's only one ultimate judge. And it ain't me and it definitely ain't you. 

When I was there she told me she was raided by the police. And no citations were given, they found nothing illegal. She also said they have been audited several times. Again, no fines. With the needle exchange, she told us it takes a special certification and the city wasn't handing any out. (That is another question for a different day) However, they had to stop that program.  Again, no citations were handed out. 
Let me ask you a person question, if I may. 
If you saw Carly out to dinner with her family would you say hello or would you come on here and ridicule her? Slam on her, say things like, how dare she eat in a restaurant! How dare she drive a car and not take the bus or public transportation! How dare she wear clean clothes!

The is what she told you. Well of course it is. Now let me direct you to her financials she just posted where she asked for a one time audit waiver. So she has only done 3 years of financials which one of those were part of the several times?  We know it wasn’t 2022. Her  home was raided several times perhaps you can get those police reports and let us all see !!!  My guess is it’s all public record.  

If you bothered to read any of these posts I have clearly stated I volunteered down there and you will notice other volunteers have posted what they saw first hand.  So I don’t  need to ask myself if I helped this organization.  

Now the needle exchange, so the city isn’t giving out certification, so she just said what the hell. I will just do it anyway.  Because the rules don’t apply to her .

As far as you comment about would I ridicule her if she was out for dinner. That literally has nothing to do with this conversation.  A family minding their own business and enjoying their dinner is a far cry from someone soliciting millions of unaccounted for or loosely accounted for donations.  

Oh, and I just want to ask you real quick what you think of that great video she posted yesterday of one of her volunteers seizing on the floor yes, that’s right she literally videotaped a volunteer having a seizure on the floor. Now don’t bother to go find it because of course she’s deleted it after several people threw a fit , isn’t she such an angel and doing so much good for our community?

Nobody has a job, has to arrange medical leave and can leave on short notice? Nobody has a partner or children that will need help?  

If someone is truly homeless in Rockford, the city's Housing First program will get them sheltered, and then work through the other issues with a case worker.  Is it perfect and is it easy? No, but they are effective and aren't isolating people at a facility 100 miles away.  The city is also utilizing programs that will provide long term help.  This is in addition to the homeless prevention programs. 

I will say it again.  For someone who claims to have been victimized so much, she ignores the dangers of not having boundaries when it comes to her family safety.  She has a strange fascination with sex offenders.  

There are scores of vacant buildings in that area that could have been used, instead of a live-work arrangement.

Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss Carly's bc they know she has Narcan and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either way, but some of the comments are petty AF. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",0,2024-03-23 21:24:31 UTC

I also have 12 years of sobriety, worked in a hospital, treatment center and those addicted in the community.  I not only have first hand knowledge of the process, but also have first hand accounts of people  in the recovery community who share their experience, strength and hope when dealing with their addictions. 

Are you in the recovery community?",1,2024-04-05 17:52:16 UTC

Nope voted all that shit out, because were either worried about noise or extra crime.  And then what did you get? Nothing, all that tax revenue goes to Joliet, and you still got crime, and its getting worse.  The downtown is a complete shithole. When I left anything East of Lincoln Middle School was fairly decent and pretty safe. And for sure anything East of Alpine. Now you have drugs and homeless folks all the way out to the Clock Tower, the smart money has already fled Rockford, only people left are bag holders. High property taxes, you get nothing in return, low house prices, its just a shitty place. I suggest LEAVE.",-5,2021-05-18 13:53:21 UTC

During my 4 years in the Air Force there wasn't anything I wanted to come to Rockford for other than friends and family. I leave Rockford again, likely for good, next month and I really can't think of anything I'll truly miss, again other than friends. But I'll only be 1.5 hours away in Milwaukee, so I can always visit or more likely they will visit.

On the flip side of that, there are two restaurants I miss from the Shreveport/Bossier area I was stationed in. And just generally miss the good Cajun food in Louisiana.

I'm one of the least nostalgic people though, maybe I'm the wrong person to ask.",3,2021-05-18 14:18:38 UTC

Not like what you think matters anyway. Your ignorance of the United States system is astounding. The American tax payer hasn't ""foot the bill"" for anything in a long long time. We've out spent the tax haul for 20 years.

New York has $62.7 billion available to pay $249.4 billion worth of bills which breaks down to a burden of $63,100 per taxpayer. In Chicago, each taxpayer would have to pay $37,100 in future taxes without anything in return while Honolulu has the third-highest burden at $26,400. Some cities are run better than others with Irvine, California and Washington D.C. notable examples. The former has a surplus of $4,100 per taxpayer while D.C. has a surplus of $3,500.

RHSD/Community Action administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people yearly. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. RHSD literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at night to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in Rockford's Human Services Department does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a way that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

The city also offers things like meals to Ms Carly's whenever possible. The laws in place limit what type of assistance the city can provide and from where.

City of Rockford attempting to shut down Miss Carly's,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/jbo44f/city_of_rockford_attempting_to_shut_down_miss/,2020-10-15 14:02:19 UTC,"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for a few months, or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for couple of months.  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in place, and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",4,2020-10-17 06:51:14 UTC

Lol, okay buddy. I'll let you know when I've gone. I've already left once before with the military. Just came back because Illinois pays tuition for veterans. Staying with the folks saving money. I've already got solid leads on jobs in Springfield and Chicago area. I'm looking more to move out of the state completely though.

But yeah, I'm not okay with discrimination, so personally I would not work for nor support Carpenters Place. I know far too many GLBTQIA+ and Trans individuals that have struggled in Rockford because of discrimination from places like this.

But it’s still a Rockford at its core.  If you’re buying a house in certain parts of the city, you can still buy a house (and I’m going to use that as Broadly as possible), and you only pay 25 grand.  But you’ll get what you paid for.  I bought my house over by Mauhnahteesee in 2017 for 110 K, I’m about to list it for 225.  But 225 for a four bedroom, 1600 square-foot house on a 1/4 acre lot is still cheaper than almost anywhere I can think of from a housing perspective. 
if you are familiar with Rockford than you know your search can or should be spread out to include Machesney Park, Loves, Park, Rockton, Roscoe, Belvidere, Belvidere, North, Winnebago Pecatonica, Stillman, Valley Davis Junction  etc etc.  You will get a better quality of home, without the gloriousness that is city of Rockford taxes :)

I was involved in the diy music scene for a long time (ELB, disastr house, hipster house) and I miss having such a strong community in this realm. I grow tired of stroll on state and Friday market being the main regular events in town.

If anyone has ever wondered why we stopped getting regular *large* concerts in town other than the handful of comedians and Joe Bonermassa at the Coronado, it's a contractual thing. Most touring acts have to sign contracts that they will not perform within a specific distance and time frame at ""competing"" venues. Due to our location in regards to Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee, St Louis and our lack of large venues other than the Coronado and Metro Center, performers are more likely to pass on Rockford to get shows in these other cities that will turn out bigger numbers. 

After living downtown for four years, I kinda hate the lackluster events that happen there. Art Scene is great but unfortunately has a few questionable locations (Test Site owner Bjorn Hullberg is a disgusting piece of shit that takes advantage of his female tenants sexually and is a glorified slumlord). 

Music in the park at the Sinnissippi band shell is one of the few regular events that I love. Juneteenth is a fucking blast.",4,2024-04-04 21:51:48 UTC

Sure, it was down during peak covid years and there's a few things that don't exist anymore, but I am really impressed with how many keep appearing. There's all sorts of cool stuff that wasn't here 10 years ago. Beer festivals, food trucks, markets. 


Stroll on State is an incredible accomplishment that takes year round planning and coordination along with many years of learning from mistakes and improving. I'm one of people that puts on the Dasher Dash 5k that kicks off that day and it's mind boggling how much goes into the whole event. It's unfair to compare anything else in the area to that.


One thing I would say is that I have found the local governing bodies to be supportive of people that want to create and host events. The park district is WONDERFUL to work with and have a bunch of different parks to choose from. It's easy and relatively inexpensive to get a permit and they have a long list of food trucks approved to serve at the parks. I used to think it sucked that there weren't many/any bicycle races in the area and now I'm part of a small group of people that puts on about 6 of them a year. Most are at park district properties and I love working with them.

The unions could have met the diversity requirements requested by the developers but the developer did that to split the vote over the PLA. I could go on all day about Coleman but will spare the sub.

Considering a move to Rockford area,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/odpfhh/considering_a_move_to_rockford_area/,2021-07-04 17:50:28 UTC,"1) I've gotten involved in stuff here. It's big enough to have some stuff going on, but not as big as a city like Chicago where everything is crowded / expensive / long waits. You go to events like Rockford City Market and Stroll on State and see people you know. But it's not, like, a creepy small town where everyone knows everyone's business, either.

When I first moved here in 2012, I lived near a cafe in the east branch of the library that hosted regular poetry slams and open mics. I befriended the cafe owner and got involved in the poetry and comedy scenes. In 2015 I became the host of the monthly poetry slam. We've struggled during the pandemic, but every month when the third Tuesday rolls around and I get to see my regulars perform and we all go get dinner afterward, it just warms my heart to see everyone together again. There are similar scenes for comedy / theater / music / board games / improv / minor league baseball / whatever you're into. There might only be one or two groups in the city for your interests, but if you go regularly, you'll become part of that community by default. Basically you get out of a place what you put into it.

The downtown area's good too. I am a single woman in my thirties, and I'll happily drive downtown and walk up and down State Street on a Saturday night, stop and watch the people playing cornhole outside CJs, wander into The Office and check out if the dance floor's hopping, and not think much of it. I grew up in the wealthier northwest suburbs where there wasn't much of a downtown, or rather many tiny downtowns, so it's nice to have more of a central place to go on weekends. I know there are murders here and such, but I've never felt like I was going to be murdered. To be fair I live on the east edge of State Street near Belvidere. (BTW I don't know what your budget is but there are some nice lots around Guilford and Bienterra where I see new houses going up, in the Villas of Tuscany or whatever it's called). But I dated a guy on the west side for awhile and he was never really worried about it either. The shooters are a tiny minority that are mostly interested in shooting each other.

2) I hate how much other people grumble about it. My family has it in their head that it's a terrible place even though they've never even lived here. The local government can also be kind of conservative for Illinois. For instance it was only a couple years ago that the mayor officially declared it pride month. Nothing crazy, we're still a blue state, but if you're from the PNW you might experience a little culture shock. And I have heard from some people who are minorities that the police often treat them more harshly, but I don't know if it's possible to get away from that if you live in America. There is currently a robust conflict going on between a dedicated group of protesters and city hall concerning some events last May which you can research further if you like.

3) I was part of a really great improv group before the pandemic, but it dissolved when we couldn't meet up in person anymore, and it doesn't look like anyone's willing to take the lead in putting it back together. We'll see if improv ever returns to Rockford; improv groups have a way of popping up quickly and falling apart equally quickly. I also wish there were more coffee shops that were open late and businesses that were open on Sundays. I just want one branch of the library I can visit on a Sunday, damnit; the closest is Belvidere and I don't even have a library card there.

4) If you like nature, Rock Cut is probably the place to go. It's enormous, but the main hike around the lake is about two hours. And if you're introverts, you might like Toad Hall, a local book and record shop.",17,2021-07-04 19:01:39 UTC

To answer your questions:
1. I live a little North of Rockford but I enjoy the slower pace of life compared to the busy city. I also love that even though Rockford isn’t the biggest city, you are about an hour away from Chicago, Milwaukee, and Madison which are great places to visit. 

2. I don’t really hate much, I guess the internet selection is not that great but for everyday use it’s fine. While crime can be high, there are plenty of safe places to live, and like someone mentioned earlier, nowhere is perfect

3. Honestly after being stuck inside forever due to Covid, there isn’t much that I can complain about. Other than places I miss from California, I would say Rockford has everything that I’ve needed (reliable mechanics, variety of grocery stores, restaurants with gluten free options, etc.)

4. Some neat places to check out would be Rockcut Part, Sinnissippi Park, Olympic Tavern is a neat restaurant, Dairy Haus Ice Cream is up in Rockton and that place is a local favorite of mine.

There's a lot of effort from the city as well as the residents to make this place a wonderful home for all. There's no shortage of things to do, lots of wonderful small businesses downtown. If youre looking for a good investment opportunity, then this is also a great place. Property is cheap around here, but several equity companies have invested millions of dollars improving the value of certain parts of the city. 

Unfortunately crime is a very real issue. Gun violence is very common. It's generally limited to the lower income areas but not exclusive. Robberies are also quite common. People drive like complete ass out here, and the roads are fuckin terrible. 

I've lived here for the better part of 4 years, moved from a small country town near by. Overall this city catches a really bad rap because of the crime. People in the surrounding areas all come here to shop but generally talk bad about Rockford. The community has been reclaiming it's city the entire time I've been here and it's been quite liberating to be a part of. They've added murals all over downtown, tons of flowers, have removed several abandon buildings as well as bought some others for community projects. This place has all the love of the Midwest, all the excitement of a city without all the traffic, and everything you could ever need as far as shopping and entertainment.

I have never understood the disdain people have for living here...I'm 30 now & have never had any serious concerns about Rockford. In the time we've spent here, the city has developed tremendously - as those before me have said, there are plenty of outdoor activities to do (Anderson Gardens, Nicholas Conservatory/Sinnissippi Park, Midway Village, a plethora of golf courses, the Rock River, City Market, etc). The restaurant scene is improving, either off of old, family-owned places or new ones (The Rathskellar, The Norwegian, Olympic Tavern, Prarie Street, CJ's, Mary's, Uncle Nick's); IMO we have a large immigrant population that influences parts of our city. It is progressing, although not as quickly as some people hope. There is a Hard Rock Café & Casino in the works, one of the dilapidated buildings downtown has turned into a hotel, new art murals are going on the side of downtown buildings every day. I think it's fine & my husband & I bought a house here after living in downtown Rockford for a few years. 

Every single city in the US will have less than stellar areas, us included. The homeless population does seem to be increasing, but on the same token there is a great place called Miss Carly's that feeds them, sends people that need the extra help to rehab, & you can volunteer your time there. A lot of people you see begging for money are probably not homeless though, just panhandling. 

As someone has said previously, it can be pretty blue collar, especially in the surrounding cities/towns & there are a LOT of bars. But, I'm a bartender so it's proven to be a lucrative business to me. The music scene is lacking, but improving a little.

I live in Ogle County off I-39 now (smack in the middle of Rockford and DeKalb). The only real things to note for Ogle Co. (Rochelle, Stillman Valley, Byron and Oregon being the largest towns) are they have the lowest property tax rates in the region and it’s largely rural, close knit, and super conservative.

\-What do you love about Rockford/general area?

Good food scene if you're willing to put in the time and not just eat chain restaurants. Great parks, city and county, and Rock Cut. Lots of outdoor opportunities.

Winter isn't that bad. Just suck it up and learn how to enjoy it with winter outdoor activities (snowshoe, fatbiking, etc).

Decent enough bike infrastructure, could be better but doable. 

Cheap and good housing stock. Just choose your neighborhoods carefully.

Proximity to O'Hare for international travel! Also Madison, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in general.

\-What do you hate about Rockford/general area?

Taxes. The taxes on homeowners here are ridiculous and make up about 45% - 50% of our mortgage payment.

Apathy. Never seen a more apathetic town anywhere I've lived. People like to talk shit about Rockford, then do nothing about it.

What's one thing Rockford/general area lacks that you wish it had? (be it a store, restaurant, services, so on)

Korean food! Better Indian food. Better vegan/vegetarian options.

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of rockford. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of chicago. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of winter being down well below 0 for weeks and the summers are well above the 90s for weeks. the springs and falls are nice but its only about a month of each. 

rockford is also a highly industrial area, except that was 20 or 30 years ago. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for a few years then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant drive worth a shit. guys in their mid 30s are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every place imaginable. They also passed another granting rockford to build a casino this year or the next. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any way

3) I wish rockford had one street that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in rockford, or even wisconsin. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for a day. 

&#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The midwest is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for 6 months to a year to experience the seasons and they way people act like here. Sure we dont have Antifa like you do in the Pacific Northwest, but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at night and chain down what you dont want stolen. Welcome to the shitshow.",-9,2021-07-04 18:41:29 UTC

What I love about Rockford/the general area: the Half Price Books store.  Potato Shack. Barnes & Noble. CD Source. Toad Hall. Cherryvale Mall after the children have to leave.  Rockford University. Rock Valley College.  Murphy's Irish Pub. Woodman's, Several of the Taco Bell locations. Meg's Daily Grind.  Banana Cherry Bakery. Pizza Hut.  Chik-fil-a. Hobby Lobby. The Rockford Police Department.  The Eastern European grocery store on North 2nd Street.  Belvidere.  Red Robin. Five Guys. Pita Pit.  The big-titted girl named Ashley who comes into the place I work every day.

2. What I hate about Rockford/the general area: the hourly shootings. The daily stabbings. The pot dispensaries.  The overabundance of drug addicts. The hobos on every corner. The west side. Cherryvale Mall when it's full of children and teenagers. The Popeye's on East State Street and their shitty employees and shitty manager and fucking horrible service. The shitty BP station on east state street. The professional crybaby with the bullhorn downtown. The constant crime. Retards blaring their stupid rap ""music"" on every road. Dumb-ass ""protesters"" blocking the roads and making nuisances of themselves every time a criminal gets shot. Bears fans. 

3. White Castle. We need two White Castle locations, but they should open the first one on the west side. Then, like 3 months later, they should open one over near Perryville and East State.

A Costco was built here in 2019, so that makes me happy. :) I saw in one of the posts that you were vegetarian. Pig Minds Brewery has terrific vegan food, more pub style.

The most glaring downfall of Rockford appears to be property taxes. I’m confused as to why people haven’t talked about this more….

Illinois has one of the highest tax rates in the country, but Rockford is double the average Illinois tax rate. It’s my understanding that because of the lack of a strong business tax base for the city to draw upon, they are struggling to pay pensions, and hike up property taxes to pay the debt.

Part of our research process was looking at crime statistics. Nowhere is without it and places where it's super low, we can't afford to buy. So when it boils down to ""would I rather be a victim of a robbery of some kind or a violent crime?"", the choice is pretty clear.

I don't know your general feelings about the PNW, having spent so much time in Portland, but I'm having a hard time letting go of Washington, which has been my home for a total of 17 years. I grew up in Hawaii and spent a couple years in the Nevada desert. Washington was the place I wanted to be permanently, so letting it go, and knowing I'll probably never be able to return to live, has been a hard concept. I've never loved a place so much. It's sounding more and more like Rockford might be a good fit (especially after we spent most of April on the road touring 25 different states looking for 'the one'), so we'll see how things pan out once we're there. We get in midday on Sunday and will probably take in dinner and some kind of walking to stretch our legs after 2 1/2 days in the car, Chicago for a day to visit friends/family, then touring homes in the area and maybe Rock Cut, more food, and back on the road Wednesday morning.

Rockford doesn’t sell itself as college educated or that it has this type of work force readily available. On top of that, we don’t have a variety of industries that require different four year degrees. 

On the contrary, a town like Dekalb being home to NIU is going through a lot growth with Meta, Ferrara, Amazon, and more coming. It’s far smaller workforce but sells itself better as a college educated city. 

I think the positives for Hard Rock outweigh the negatives. If it was a generic brand casino I think it would struggle, but the name recognition is huge and people travel to visit their different locations. Is it a huge amount of people? No, but it will help our area and put money in our economy. It’s a draw, and anything is better than nothing. 

I saw someone comment above about a company like Epic moving here, hopefully to the west side. We need to be realistic. Any business or this size would be huge for our area but it wouldn’t go west of town—highway access isn’t readily available unless located close to 20, the work force unfortunately doesn’t support this type of business, and it doesn’t have the nearby amenities a large workforce would want near the workplace.",5,2022-08-27 05:00:51 UTC

It's interesting to see Rockton, Roscoe, and Machesney Park gain population size while Rockford loses it. I don't know what these smaller areas have that the city of Rockford doesn't, or if you would consider the growing population in those areas as actually benefiting from Rockford's economy (as if they are suburbs of Rockford). 

I think the process starts with growing education to sell to business that Rockford is here, and ready. Rockford only like 20-30 minutes further from Chicago than Dekalb, but we have Milwaukee and Madison going the opposite way. We should have no excuses to be behind Dekalb IMO lol. If we had a university that represented Rockford well, it could be a good start to bring business here. 

Once business comes, jobs come. Then, we aim to create an inner city metro- or bus system, that connects from Rockton to Rockford and stops in between. Start getting those suburbanites working in Rockford as well and more accessibility around the city without using your vehicle. I mean, if all goes well- maybe that inner city metro can eventually connect towards Chicago as well. We'd get Chicago folk coming up here for jobs lol/\\.",1,2022-08-27 05:11:42 UTC

I thinks it's a common sense and be smart type of deal. Treat it like a city. I would never leave my bike open and unlocked where i live now on the north side of Chicago so why would I do any differently in another city? It's not a small town.

In Rockford, common sense goes a long way. Don't be at sketchy bars after midnight, don't drive through sketchy neighborhoods after dark if possible. There is poverty and there is crime - unlike the suburbs, here it's more pronounced and unlike Chicago it's more obviously part of a single distinct community. 

Unlike other commenters, I think Rockford has some fantastic outdoor activities available. Rock Cut is a gem of a state park - great trails for biking/hiking and a nice lake for kayaking or fishing. The river affords tons of fun in the summer. Also, it's 1.5 hours to Devils Lake in WI or Starved Rock, which are about as pretty as it gets within 2 hrs of a global city in the Midwest.

There are some fine options for dining and entertainment as well, although there of course aren't as many as you would find in a larger city. If you need novelty every weekend, you might look elsewhere. But if you look forward to getting to you know hosts and chefs as the passionate craftspersons and caring human beings that they are, it's unparalleled.

1. I live on the east side and it's not that bad. I have gone walking alone at night as a woman around the wetland path behind the Perryville fire station and not been bothered at all.
2. I don't have a house, but they seem to be pretty cheap. I pay $1000 / month rent for a two bedroom apartment with a garage and a laundry machine. Only thing is, I've known a couple people who bought older houses in the area (I'm talking 100 years old) and weren't prepared to deal with unexpected maintenance problems, stuff like water in the basement, cracks in the foundation, etc. You sound like a reasonably competent home buyer though, just make sure to get a good home inspection.
3. Definitely safer on the east side. Biking to work, you may have trouble finding sidewalks and crosswalks depending where you are. There's a big bike path that runs down Perryville from Rock Cut to State Street though, so that's nice.
4. Loves Park is about the same but a bit more redneck-y.
5. Sure, there's stuff I like, but that probably varies based on what you like to do. I host a poetry slam here every month. There are some nice theater companies here like Artists Ensemble and Usual Suspects. There are comedy shows. There's City Market in the summer and Stroll on State in the winter. There's trivia on Tuesdays at Old Chicago. There's a branch of the YMCA at Newburg and Perryville where I go to Zumba classes. There is a nice board game shop called Gaming Goat, with a Mary's Market and Baker Street Burgers next door. There's a group of people who meet up at Barnes and Noble every Monday and look at chess problems. There's a branch of the library near me with a little cafe called Kate's Pie Shop and Records. Mostly what I like about Rockford is the size. It's big enough that there are things going on you can go to, but small enough that you don't have to worry about finding a place to park, or being crowded, or waiting for a table at a restaurant. If you go to an open mic, you see the same 11 people you see at every open mic, and you say hi and sit down. It's a communal feel you would never get in a bigger city.",8,2019-02-10 21:53:41 UTC

Good restaurants if you look hard enough. Some fun shows here and there at the Coronado (great theater!).

On Friday nights in the summer, there's a little festival downtown called City Market that we enjoy a lot.  There are three really good microbreweries here and a fourth just opened in Byron which is a short scenic drive away, if you're into that.

Lots of excellent pizzerias!  Many people I know that have left the area mention how they can't find places as good wherever they've landed.  We also have several good Asian restaurants and a local fast food chain called Beef a Roo is pretty popular with the locals.  

The main downside is the winters can be fierce.  We broke our all-time lowest temperature record by four degrees a couple weeks ago and this year icing has been worse than the past few years.

You all have given me way more comprehensive and personal information than I was able to dig up by Googling. It sounds like a place where I would fit in well. One huge factor my husband and I are discussing is the status of the Illinois economy and where it is going in the future. I'm sure the property taxes are affected by this, as well as the income tax. The income tax has gone up in the last couple years, and could continue to climb. From what I read, in 2018, the highest percentage of people moved away from IL than any other state, which could make the problem even worse. Is this a concern for you guys?

They only stop shooting and robbing each other over there long enough to shoot and rob foolish east siders who venture over there.  
2. Beats me.  My boyfriend bought his house (on the east side) before I met him. I don't know what he paid for it. But we're getting the fuck out of dodge in May when I graduate, and I've heard him say he's expecting to make a profit when he sells his house.

Downtown is improving and when I'm in town I look forward to going out on State down near the river. It's absolutely not a bustling town but it has some good bars and restaurants, and most of the interesting things are downtown. 

For recreation there is the sports factory downtown, rock cut, a bike path along the river and another on Perryville, sledding at Aldeen park and disc golf at Searles park, outdoor education and hiking at Atwood park, concerts at the Coronado, and a surprisingly robust live music scene from the Emmanuel Lutheran basement to shows at the metro center, and you might catch Blackhawks players coming back from injury on the ice at the Metro Center with the Ice Hogs.

My family and friends live in Chicago, Madison, Des Moines.  We don't have a kicking night life like you'll find in bigger cities, but we've come a long way in the downtown area on that front.  We have some great breweries, and more fine(r) dining than I can remember growing up.  We have the river, excellent golf courses if that's your thing, a frisbee golf course at Anna Page park, and decent parks overall.  Shopping, you'll find a lot of the stores that are in most cities.  I feel like we could perhaps use some more mom & pop shops/boutiques/specialty stores, but that's just me.  

Be mindful that the town can have a pretty negative nelly attitude (I'm happy to see mostly positive things in this thread).  My response to them is: What are *you* doing to change what you don't like??  

As for the crime, I will tell you, lock your shit up.  If it's not bolted down, it's likely walking away.  We live in a prime neighborhood now, and unfortunately that means we've been targeted more frequently than in our old hood more in the middle of town.  In 2 years we've had Christmas lights stolen/vandalized, and 3 brazen youth walked up to my garage, rifled through my car, and stole my phone I'd forgotten inside.  I *always* close the door, but my husband was 10 minutes behind me, so I thought; I'll be nice and leave it open for him.  :/  

As a female I have never once felt threatened while out running or walking the dog.  I am not fearful of my kids being out and about on their bikes.  ",2,2019-02-11 16:02:24 UTC

After you get the summons, you can call the jury phone number and ask for a deferment, which is about three months. You will need to give them a reason.  Then you have to call a special phone number the night before your jury duty, you have about a 30% chance you are not even needed.

While there are some nice pockets, there are also some very not nice pockets. The two apartment complexes downtown that would be in decent areas are William Brown Lofts and 321 Lofts. I have never lived in them nor have I known anyone who has, but the locations are nice and you would be within walking distance of a lot of downtown attractions. There are also lofts above the Prairie Street Brewhouse but I've heard those are really pricey.

In general, conditions do get nicer the further northeast you go, away from downtown. If you want to stay near the downtown area, the neighborhoods north of State St, near Rural St and around Prospect and Welty are fairly nice without being super expensive.

About that TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. And CHIPS CHIPS CHIPS, thinking back to those 5 huge CASES she got last week. Didn't that lady say she drops that off every Saturday or am I remembering wrong? She said AT LEAST 5 cases! 

""WE NEED ROLLING SUITCASES FOR SENDING PEOPLE TO TREATMENT.   
We are totally out. They are also very useful fro single moms without cars, people who go to food pantry etc.   
Also, there is an older woman who asks us for one of these collapsable, rolling bags (link below) and I was thinking that we could use a few more if anyone would be so kind as to send us a few.   
Here is the link: https://a.co/d/dI6J3Us  
Please comment below if you order one. We could use maybe 5 of them, but no more than that since food for sac lunches would be more of a priority.   
Here is our amazon wish list for anyone that would like to send food, or you can order chips from Sam's Club and send them to our address. 1125 5th ave Rockford, Illinois 61104 ❤️

It has never sat well with me that she exploits children in multiple ways, and has little regard for her own kids well-being and safety:

* Her kids participating in the ""ministry"", and photos and videos of them giving their things to other kids.
* Photos of other people's children benefiting from her being the hood Oprah handing out toys. (if she wants to help children, provide diapers instead of toys.)
* Speaking to First Graders at RPS205 and posting it on FB about what she does.
* Having kids decorate lunch bags.
* Using the schools for fund raisers.
* Posting a video of her toddler handing out sandwiches to strangers.
* Using the same toddler when she was an infant as a prop when they spoke at city hearings.",13,2024-03-27 15:11:04 UTC

We are totally out. They are also very useful fro single moms without cars, people who go to food pantry etc. 

Also, there is an older woman who asks us for one of these collapsable, rolling bags (link below) and I was thinking that we could use a few more if anyone would be so kind as to send us a few. 

Here is the link: https://a.co/d/dI6J3Us

Please comment below if you order one. We could use maybe 5 of them, but no more than that since food for sac lunches would be more of a priority. 

Here is our amazon wish list for anyone that would like to send food, or you can order chips from Sam's Club and send them to our address. 1125 5th ave Rockford, Illinois 61104 ❤️

You mean to tell me the people she drops off at treatment that don’t even have a guaranteed bed need a new suitcase? And she only wants five because food is a priority. But hey go ahead and order the food for us too.
