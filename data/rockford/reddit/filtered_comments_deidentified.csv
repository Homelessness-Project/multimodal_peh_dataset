[ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] actually help people get shelter and make people accountable.  The result of handing out tents, blankets, clothing, and food on the go is incremental dumping in already stressed neighborhoods. I pulled five contractor bags of bedding off the porch of an abandoned house behind my home [ORGANIZATION] (the city does not provide this clean up).  It is sad that people are sleeping outside, but I got to ask why are they rejecting the shelter and other 

Miss ORG2's is a grift that projects a very inaccurate picture of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. They claim to just hand out stuff until people are ready, which is enabling those who don't want to be accountable and have resisted the many services in [ORGANIZATION] so they can continue the [STREET] lifestyle.  Not to mention their exploitative social media posts that pay for their personal living expenses, building code fines, and lawyers because they chose to live at the shelter rather than using one of the many vacant buildings in the city."

""The role of citizens in ending homelessness **in their own communities**..."" 

It's easy to say we want to end homelessness, and if we just had the [ORGANIZATION] homeless population to deal with then we'd be fine.  This GPE2 has an [ORGANIZATION] homelessness response.  Literally hundreds of thousands of state and federal grant dollars a year to combat homelessness.  But we keep getting busses of ""problem"" homeless people shipped to us from other cities (looking at you, [PERSON]).  If it were just [ORGANIZATION] citizens battling homelessness, the problem would be solved already.  

This is actually the main reason I am opposed to a [PERSON]-[ORGANIZATION] train rail.  This isn't speculation, we KNOW this is happening.  Talk to one of the GPE2's [ORGANIZATION] people that respond to homeless complaints, they can verify.  And while it would be nice to hop on a train to [PERSON] for a bag of [ORGANIZATION]'s popcorn, we would be flooded with the homeless from every municipality that's on that line.  [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], every city and village on the ORG2 line (the logical one to extend) would say ""Good luck with that guy, [ORGANIZATION]"" and consider their jobs done."

Based on the map legend, [ORGANIZATION] receives about .1% of the bussed homeless in the [PERSON]. [PERSON]

Ideally the practice sends homeless closer to family who can help them, but it's not perfect. The [ORGANIZATION] study also didn't track unofficial bussing which is what [ORGANIZATION] has historically been accused of. (The study was based on [ORGANIZATION] requests of data kept by the originating cities.)"

To oppose something so beneficial because homeless people would use it is... Well... Dumb. 

You already say busloads of homeless people are sent to [ORGANIZATION]. If that's the case, a train isn't inherently going to make it worse, just more efficient."

Theyre people, they need shelter too. If you say you want to end homelessness but ONLY in your area, thats not ending homelessness, thats just making it so YOU dont have to see homeless people. If we have enough money and grants we should be opening our shelters to others and acting as a haven"

I also take a bit of an issue with your depiction of my concern being homeless people ""using"" the train.  I don't have an issue with that.  I have an issue with cities who are given MILLIONS of dollars to combat their homeless problems deciding that the appropriate [STREET] to use that money is by buying bus tickets to other places."

[ORGANIZATION] was recognized [ORGANIZATION] as having ""functionally 0 homeless"" and instead of asking us about our processes, other cities just said ""Great, let's send homeless people there."""
6,2023-06-16 14:29:38 UTC,3,2023-06-16 19:42:59 UTC,"homeless, homelessness",The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',"We don't have the money, space or workers to become much of a haven. I don't think the train will cause a problem, but cities need to work together so each of them is taking care of their own people and only moving them when it makes more sense (like when someone in [ORGANIZATION] has family in [PERSON].)

My experience has been that [PERSON] organizations are good at coordinating on homelessness with other cities in GPE2 and [PERSON]. That's better for the homeless than encouraging other cities to not develop their own successful programs."
6,2023-06-16 14:29:38 UTC,2,2023-06-16 18:14:52 UTC,homeless,The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',"No, that's not it at all and that's absolutely misconstruing my concern.  Homeless funds are limited.  We can take care of OUR homeless because our grant distributions are based on our population.  [ORGANIZATION] gets tens of millions of dollars and their response is to ship people to places with fewer resources.  Look up ORG0 Continuum of Care funding and you'll be appalled at how much money they get and that this is their solution.  

I don't oppose helping the homeless.  They are people as well and people need help. I oppose ""helping"" them by making them someone else's responsibility to help when you're given literally all of the resources to help them yourselves."

I know that tracking homeless generally suffered during [ORGANIZATION] of covid and that there was decreased contact with them across the board, so bussing must've dropped during that time."

I did not say anything about how those actions are taken *or* the writing in the article.

I will actively state that it is entirely suspect that they did not ask any unhoused people about their experiences, they entirely fail to discuss how they define almost any of the terms,  or provide any data. It could easily be entirely fictitious. I want [ORGANIZATION] to be better and that doesn't happen through puff pieces so I want to make sure it isn't bullshit.

I bring that up here in a lower comment because I think if I brought accusations up higher I  the post it would distract from the things I want to know.

If you ever want to make sandwiches with me or volunteer on [ORGANIZATION], please let me know. Miss [PERSON]'s is fun [STREET] to help and I promise you, it will make your heart happy and you will see miracles happen. I know there is a lot going on with the fraud page and all, but [PERSON] ca[LOCATION] believe everything you read. [PERSON] has not been found guilty of any fraud charges. [PERSON] has her taxes in and we are awaiting the audit. I do not believe that [PERSON] [PERSON] misused funds from all the facts I have been given. I call the fraud page out on their behaviors, such as making fun of [PERSON], volunteers, and the homeless. This did in fact get me blocked from the page that I believe these “mean girls” are behind. I do know for a fact that these “mean girls” do exist because they were mean to me when I volunteered there. (If you want to have lunch or something with me, I tell you all about what happened to me.) 

I am waiting patiently for the audit and facts. I’ve been quiet about my time volunteering at Miss [PERSON] because I have been waiting for the right time to tell y’all how I fell about this situation. The Fraud at Miss [PERSON]’s page is a bunch of bullshit and driven by mean spirited individuals who, I feel, did not get there [STREET]. They are not waiting patiently for an audit to be done, instead they are attacking, manipulating, causing all kinds of chaos and drama to ensue. They now have pulled [PERSON]’s children into all of this chaos and drama, where they do not belong. Kids deserve to be kids and not have to deal with adult issues that have nothing to do with them, but the fact is the fraud page can not sit quietly and be patient like the rest of us. I believe they want to give their opinions more than they want facts. Ladies and Gentlemen, the world is already negative, filled with corruption, and enough hate to take each and everyone of us out. Do we really want to keep doing this to ourselves? I know I do[LOCATION]. I want to live, laugh, and love everyone and everything with my whole heart, even if it causes me some tears now and again. I want happiness and peace. I want us all to be able to come together and help one another out, by lifting each other, up, by believing in one other, and coming together to form a strong bond and sense of community. Do you want facts or opinions? Do you want negative or positive? Do you want love or hate? If you do[LOCATION] like what you are doing, then change it, only you have the power to control yourself and how you react to others. Change, I believe is a great thing to want to do. I want to make changes that will fulfill my heart and soul. I want to love unconditionally. I want to just breathe and believe! All of this is what I believe and have learned in [LOCATION] volunteering at Miss [PERSON]’s. [PERSON] [PERSON] has taught me this. DATE2 I am grateful for Miss [PERSON]’s and [PERSON] [PERSON]. I am grateful for her wanting better and doing better [ORGANIZATION] as an individual. For creating this tight knit family were we all fit in no matter what is going on with us at the moment in our [ORGANIZATION] struggles. She fills in the gaps. The gaps that no other organization can. 💜

The policies and lack of resources put out are not decreasing, but are increasing the situation.  Watch what happens when your casino starts to take a toll on your community.  Bring in legal gambling; bring in legal drugs; but let's not bring in businesses that will attract the type of jobs that a community can be built around.  What the hell is wrong with you people?

The casino will most likely take existing gamblers from the slot parlors.

[ORGANIZATION] has been legal for [ORGANIZATION], and there has been no documented correlation between crime and cannabis.  [ORGANIZATION] and narcotics, are a totally different thing.  

The thing to remember about working with homeless people, is there is a segment that is resistant to help for various reasons.  These agencies cannot legally compel anyone to participate.  This segment is then held up as how the ""system"" is broken.  Actually, I've seen fewer homeless in my area [LOCATION].  The City is limited on what they can do about panhandlers, because of the law that allows it under free speech.  Don't assume these panhandlers are homeless.  I've seen one  woman who I know is an [ORGANIZATION] resident panhandling on [ORGANIZATION], I think the current city leadership has done a good job attracting new businesses to [ORGANIZATION].  The [INSTITUTION] and ancillary companies provide a lot of good paying jobs."

Hey [ORGANIZATION], when are you going to clean up all the blankets and tents that get dumped in your neighborhood by the same people?

Does anyone have insight on how full [ORGANIZATION] is on [LOCATION], and what they do when they are at capacity? Also, the city does put some people into hotels, what qualifies a person for that program?  I know [ORGANIZATION] had to participate in the City's [ORGANIZATION] process per her [ORGANIZATION], and she hasn't done that yet per the city citations. Is it because there aren't really that many ""new"" homeless people as she claims, or they are already in the system and she wants to shield them if that process requires her to log an encounter.

""DONATION UPDATEWE ARE NOW ACCEPTING SPRING/SUMMER CLOTHING!! Everyone has been asking and I’m so happy to tell you that we are ready! We worked hard over [ORGANIZATION] to work through any excess warm clothing yet still keep a small amount tucked away. It’s always such a delicate balance to try and anticipate the needs of the most vulnerable folks and we tend to need [LOCATION] stuff [STREET] longer than people would think, due to it being so cold at [TIME] still. That being said, we can still use some coats and definitely hoodies. More than anything….we need blanklets and sleeping bags and tents during the springtime because so many people lose access to emergency cold weather shelter, be it an actual shelter or an other temporary solution they found. It’s a whole new ballgame when there is no snow on the ground! Our doantion room has essentially been cleared out DATE2 that it is open. If it wasnt for the fact that we are constantly stocking it, I dont know that we would make it through [ORGANIZATION]! Thank you to everyone that has been dropping off so much [DATE] appropriate clothing as well as household items, toys etc. It’s just the best thing to see people leave protected from the weather. Or, to see them build new homes and have HOPE when they leave here with a few plates, an old quilt, and some clothes and snacks for their kids. Piece by piece, they are able to make an empty apartment a real home! Here are the things people are needing most right now: \*\*TENTSBLANKETS/SLEEPING BAGSCLEANING SUPPLIES (can be used) [ORGANIZATION]/ANY LINENS\*\*FOOD FOR LUNCHES (chips, granola bars, cookies, pudding/jello cups, bannas, oranges, apples)SODA FOR THE [ORGANIZATION] ([PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], Sprite etc…they like it all!) HYGIENE ITEMS (shampoo, conditioner, deoderant, razors, bar soap, hair products for textured hair, etc) As always, the FOOD is true number one things we need. Our numbers only steadily climb as the weather warms and we need all the help we can get to feed 400 or more people DATE2. Its pretty amazing what we can do when we work togetherDonation drop off is Wednesday- [DATE], but if you have food to drop off and dont mind a quick hand off, I’m home after [TIME] all of the time, so youre welcome to drop off sicne we need it so badly. I know many of you go shopping after work, so please feel free. Here are our quick links, incase you prefer to donate that [STREET]: ORG1 Wish List: [[URL] to donate: [[URL] Provide home cooked, or restaurant/fast food delivery meal to the hungry volunteers who work so hard arounf here, many of them homeless themselves, choosing to serve their peers, or in transition: [[URL]"

She makes up stories about them. She has a HUGE ego. A lot of the homeless she helped didn’t want to follow the rules of [ORGANIZATION] Rescue Mission and FAC0. So Miss PERSON0’s was a collection of misfits. Then she let the misfits be In charge of the back Donation space. Mass amounts of food, clothing or anything valuable was constantly stolen."

Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement."

[PERSON] is a [ORGANIZATION] Alder, and [ORGANIZATION] Senator [PERSON]'s Chief of Staff. 

I posted this so people are aware that [ORGANIZATION] does have an open investigation around her, as well as the city litigation.  It also shows how her narrative has people believing that shutting her down would hurt the community, but there is no data or evidence of who and how many is is helping, but a ton of evidence of how is getting funding and how it is being spent.  

**I will say it again:  Nobody was asking [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON3 to move into a commercial building and open it up 24x7 to hand out condoms, make-up, needles and junk food.**  She made friends with a few crack hoe's from the bar behind her, and the homeless old timers who got kicked out the shelters, and spun it like the ""system"" failed these people and they fell through the cracks. She was the only one in [ORGANIZATION] who could help them, yet likely never volunteered or talked to any other agencies in the area."

A legitimate organization would have employees and people trained with degrees to help in these situations. She doesn’t know what she’s doing.

Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with [ORGANIZATION] and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all [PERSON] saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.  They don’t have the facilities for that and not one person, [PERSON] or her homeless volunteers are trained to do that .  Especially to someone in a wheelchair who probably has a multitude of medical issues and if not properly handled could be seriously injured. Not to mention there were pictures of this person being cleaned up outside !!! For all the world to see."

Her son, [PERSON] died homeless on the streets of [ORGANIZATION] of a fentanyl overdose.  Ironically, I remembered who this guy was when I started my research.  His family is one that [ORGANIZATION] raised money for since his wife was ‘dying’ and they needed to get to [ORGANIZATION].  I had indicated [LOCATION] that [ORGANIZATION] had raised money for someone to move, and their felony records continued once moving.  She was arrested for things like begging, drugs, fake ID’s, the list goes on.  So it was pretty obvious it was a scam of a fundraiser, not sure whose fault, [ORGANIZATION], the husband/wife, or if everyone profited.  But it shows you can’t just hand money to addicts like that.

Then she sends this man off to some [INSTITUTION] that he remembers in his state of confusion.  I mean why call an agency that could actually help him.

I am biased tho bc I knew some of her lying behavior from mutual friends and I witnessed the PERSON0 FB incident which made it clear she was looking for clout and attention. To be fair, she may have been right about the [PERSON], I wouldn’t known and I support people calling out “me too” even if it’s messy. But one of the comments from the waitress always stuck with me-she said “PERSON2, you were here [TIME] and everything was fine, what happened?”

I would not call this social work and legally she can’t call herself that. I would say this is one of the worst examples I have ever seen of someone using “social work” to grift people and simultaneously fuck them up and be sloppy. I have seen a lot of veterans lie about their service and start advocacy and outreach groups. I worked for a vet like that. He took over a small agency on the south side and used the grant money to pay for his meals (not business like grub hub) and suits. But he never got involved with the clients so they were safe and handled appropriately. That staff did a lot of grassroots work with the homeless in the area who were not our clients. Linking them with services. We had a rotating schedule to feed them [LOCATION] and we fed them out of our own pockets. They ate the same food that we did. No one ever got on FB and asked for handouts lol. 

Anyone in the field who hears about a direct service [STREET] that doesn’t use grants, doesn’t pay people, and doesn’t follow mandated reporting is going to immediately see the red flags. 

From what I heard from insiders who work for the big players in social services in [ORGANIZATION], some worked with her because there was nothing. Like she said the hospital reached out to her to get people to rehab. Well if that’s true, the hospital must have been utterly up a creek without a paddle and forced to d/c. This happens regardless of the quality of hospital or the staff. It’s due to payer issues. 

Sorry for the long rant I could go on forever lol."

I spent some time homeless in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] was practically the only organization that helped with no caveats or megalomanical middle manager.


Fuck [ORGANIZATION] Rescue Mission."
44,2023-10-29 21:37:53 UTC,10,2023-10-30 06:34:04 UTC,homeless,Miss Carly- Part 2- why do people worship her,"As someone who has direct experience with homeless people and addicts I can say that the work she does is definitely helping people. I can't say anything about financials. I don't work for her, I rarely donate, I have volunteered twice, and I know people that have utilized her services. 

I feel it's worth putting the knowledge I do have, out there as I'm not seeing many people mention some of these specifics.

1. Homeless people and addicts are usually viewed as ""less than,"" even when trying to get into facilities that are supposed to help them. From the people thst work there to the CEOs that establish protocol, the person who is struggling is VERY often either treated like shit or given hoops to jump through that are damn near impossible. PERSON0 speaks about this in a recent post about needing IDs and a phone to get into facilities. 

The people that I know that have been helped by her have been grateful to be ""met where they are at,"" with absolutely no shame whether they make it or not and are encouraged to keep trying. These people are you and me, they are someone's son/daughter/husband/mother/best friend etc. who just can't seem to get their footing back in normal society. I say this from experience, until you have really witnessed it or lived it, you cannot understand how difficult it is to get a job, keep a job, stay clean, or find housing.

2. You talk about a [STREET] that you consider comparable, [PERSON]'s [STREET] (and I am fully aware of others: [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, etc.) As another person mentioned, there are rules and regulations that make getting help difficult. It may not meet someone where they are at. The Christianity aspect being one.

Sure, they could get in, but what about when they get kicked out because some counselor has an attitude [ORGANIZATION] and says they are being aggressive when really their emotions are completely raw from withdrawing? Back to the streets. Perhaps they try again to go there in [LOCATION] or 2. This time they use once and are told to leave. This cycle can continue for all of the shelters/programs etc. Eventually the person feels too ashamed to go anywhere feeling like a total failure or is blacklisted with nowhere else to go.

3. Harm reduction is HUGE. It keeps people alive long enough to give them a [ORGANIZATION] to get recovery.

4. Referencing what some have said about the buildings and her living situation and such: if you go back to the beginning, she just lived there in a sketchy neighborhood on a drug addled [STREET] with hookers. She offered a meal once and an idea seemed to be born. Due to the connections of people she already had from growing up in the area, people shared her first post and it just started to grow. In my personal opinion, it grew [STREET] too fast for anyone to manage, let alone an addict with DATE2 off hard drugs. 

Systems were not put into [STREET], positions were not made, they seem to just keep trying to catch up with what's in front of them. Adding storage, buying buildings, needing more as popularity grows. It's a hot mess there, but my personal opinion is that the intention is still to serve, while having no model to go off of. First meals, then clothing, then donations, then volunteers, then treatment, then meals for volunteers, gifts for kids in poor families, etc. I have seen the thousands of sandwiches and the backpacks full of treatment supplies and the free phones and the donation room jam packed and bustling. 

5. My final thought for now is that I greatly appreciate that she brings humanity and thus support to a group of people that are often rejected by society. When the ""worshippers"" of facebook make comments cheering someone on to go to treatment. That person gets to hear about that when they would normally be completely isolated with no support. It also opens the non-homeless/addicted/trafficked person's eyes to see these people out in their world and be a bit kinder. 

I think that's all I have. I appreciate the openness in which you are presenting your questions, so I felt my reply would be heard."

A big part of being homeless in [ORGANIZATION] was just trying to find a [STREET] to exist without being expected to pay money. [PERSON] was great for this. They made you get a case manager but that was super easy and quick and genuinely helped you with things. I frequently got shaving stuff and clothes. They would give you a tote to store stuff. The food was always perfectly acceptable and there was no extortion with making you sit through church stuff. Of course they had the church stuff but it was after the food and if you didn't want to listen you didn't have to. You could read or anything else quiet.

[ORGANIZATION] treated it's men like criminals. The hours they made you keep made it impossible to get or hold a job. The security people that were supposed to guard your stuff frequently stole. I had a friend who was working overnights at ORG2 but the head guy named [ORGANIZATION] didn't believe him for some reason so he had to sleep outside. You woke at [TIME] and had to be back at the shelter at [TIME] if you were late at all you were locked out. The people in charge would constantly threaten you with being kicked out and really relished the small amount of power they had. They forced you to come back at [ADDRESS]. I went to jail afterwards and it was legit an upgrade.

And full disclosure I was in active heroin addiction so of course that colors my experiences. I am [PERSON] now though.

EDIT: There were several places that helped me out. ORG3 gave me free coffee and breakfast. The [PERSON] church by the disaster house was incredible to me. And people at both hospitals were great. They were so much nicer than I deserved."

Some people have religious trauma. Others already have their own beliefs. A lot of churches don't even offer housing. [ORGANIZATION] has at least one school that could be used to house the homeless, and they still have access to enough money to convert them. They remodeled and expanded one of their churches instead. What would serve the community more, remodeling FAC0 so it has a shiny new entrance or giving a school or two an upgrade so people can get off the [STREET] and away from dealers? The answer is pretty obvious. 

That said, I can't completely condemn [PERSON] because I do know that ORG2 gives food to the hungry."

What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

I have personally been inside Miss [PERSON]'s and have seen first hand the work that she provides for the homeless, addicted and mental ill. I definitely did not do an inventory of the food she hangs out on a [DATE] basis. So I'm not gonna speak on that at all. I did visually see her speak to an individual that was gonna go AWOL on probation, while helping a handicap women in a wheel chair with her adolescent child get some clothes and food, at the same time help another individual get into drug rehab. All within [TIME]. She and her facility are trying to help where she can. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted at these posts tearing down an organization that is here to help. 
Before I go out of my [STREET] to ridicule someone in any fashion, I need to look at myself and ask ""have I done everything to help this individual with their mission?""  Because if I have not done that, all I'm doing is judging.  And then the next question is why? Am I ashamed of my lack of cooperation in this mission? Am I projecting my own bullshit into someone else?
 And for me, there's only one ultimate judge. And it ain't me and it definitely ain't you. 

When I was there she told me she was raided by the police. And no citations were given, they found nothing illegal. She also said they have been audited several times. Again, no fines. With the needle exchange, she told us it takes a special certification and the city wasn't handing any out. (That is another question for [ORGANIZATION]) However, they had to stop that program.  Again, no citations were handed out. 
Let me ask you a person question, if I may. 
If you saw [PERSON] out to dinner with her family would you say hello or would you come on here and ridicule her? [PERSON] on her, say things like, how dare she eat in a restaurant! How dare she [STREET] a car and not take the bus or public transportation! How dare she wear clean clothes!

This is in addition to the homeless prevention programs. 

I will say it again.  For someone who claims to have been victimized so much, she ignores the dangers of not having boundaries when it comes to her family safety.  She has a strange fascination with sex offenders.

Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise.

[ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

I will never be able to see any good in the organization because of this overwhelming evil of abortion. So if I can have that opinion, then surely you can have yours.

[ORGANIZATION] does need to get more [ORGANIZATION] in leadership but so does the Government. The unions could have met the diversity requirements requested by the developers but the developer did that to split the vote over the ORG1.

Honestly lots of times announcements like this lead to nowhere or we forget about it. I will agree that corruption is legalized in a lot of ways. The reality is it’s very difficult to ascertain what is going on. Is the city doing well or not? It doesn’t feel like it often but I do like the people of [ORGANIZATION] that work hard to make it work, I just don’t think that “thriving” in the [STREET] the current administration wants it to be should be the goal.

21,2021-07-04 17:50:28 UTC,8,2021-07-04 19:49:01 UTC,homeless,Considering a move to [ORGANIZATION] area,"My family moved up here from [ORGANIZATION] when I was [ORGANIZATION]. I have never understood the disdain people have for living here...I'm [ORGANIZATION] never had any serious concerns about [PERSON]. In the time we've spent here, the city has developed tremendously - as those before me have said, there are plenty of outdoor activities to do (FAC0, FAC1, FAC2, a plethora of golf courses, [PERSON], [PERSON], etc). The restaurant scene is improving, either off of old, family-owned places or new ones ([ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, FAC5, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON]); IMO we have a large immigrant population that influences parts of our city. It is progressing, although not as quickly as some people hope. There is [ORGANIZATION] in the works, one of the dilapidated buildings downtown has turned into a hotel, new art murals are going on the side of downtown buildings DATE2. I think it's [ORGANIZATION] bought a house here after living in downtown [PERSON] for [ORGANIZATION]. 

Every single city in the GPE2 will have less than stellar areas, us included. The homeless population does seem to be increasing, but on the same token there is a great [STREET] called [ORGANIZATION] that feeds them, sends people that need the extra help to rehab, & you can volunteer your time there. A lot of people you see begging for money are probably not homeless though, just panhandling. 

As someone has said previously, it can be pretty blue collar, especially in the surrounding cities/towns & there are a [ORGANIZATION] of bars. But, I'm a bartender so it's proven to be a lucrative business to me. The music scene is lacking, but improving a little.

I say go for it! 🤘"

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at [TIME] and chain down what you dont want stolen. Welcome to the shitshow."

Cons - the homelessness is less intense than [ORGANIZATION] or even the [PERSON] but just be careful as some of the homeless can be really aggressive. The crime has very specific hotspots and if you do your research you will know where they are. Some people on here are very sensitive about that because they'll accuse you of being classist and all that [ORGANIZATION] stuff but it is a safety issue so you don't go walking and driving into the wrong part of town at [TIME].

Not sure if it is an issue for you but most people I know have [ORGANIZATION] so you can legally carry. Never had a problem with law enforcement with it and keep my documentation current and follow proper etiquette."
