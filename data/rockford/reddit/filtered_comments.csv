The role of citizens in ending homelessness: 'Everybody can contribute and be a part of the solution if they choose to',6,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/14aycj1/the_role_of_citizens_in_ending_homelessness/,2023-06-16 14:29:38 UTC,"Be careful you are not endorsing enabling.  CP and RRM actually help people get shelter and make people accountable.  The result of handing out tents, blankets, clothing, and food on the go is incremental dumping in already stressed neighborhoods. I pulled five contractor bags of bedding off the porch of an abandoned house behind my home last November (the city does not provide this clean up).  It is sad that people are sleeping outside, but I got to ask why are they rejecting the shelter and other 

Miss Carly's is a grift that projects a very inaccurate picture of homelessness in Rockford. They claim to just hand out stuff until people are ready, which is enabling those who don't want to be accountable and have resisted the many services in Rockford so they can continue the street lifestyle.  Not to mention their exploitative social media posts that pay for their personal living expenses, building code fines, and lawyers because they chose to live at the shelter rather than using one of the many vacant buildings in the city.",2,2023-06-16 20:06:08 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

""The role of citizens in ending homelessness **in their own communities**..."" 

It's easy to say we want to end homelessness, and if we just had the Rockford homeless population to deal with then we'd be fine.  This City has an INCREDIBLE homelessness response.  Literally hundreds of thousands of state and federal grant dollars a year to combat homelessness.  But we keep getting busses of ""problem"" homeless people shipped to us from other cities (looking at you, Chicago).  If it were just Rockford citizens battling homelessness, the problem would be solved already.  

This is actually the main reason I am opposed to a Chicago-Rockford train rail.  This isn't speculation, we KNOW this is happening.  Talk to one of the City's Human Services people that respond to homeless complaints, they can verify.  And while it would be nice to hop on a train to Chicago for a bag of Garrett's popcorn, we would be flooded with the homeless from every municipality that's on that line.  Chicago, Arlington Heights, Palatine, Crystal Lake, every city and village on the UPNW line (the logical one to extend) would say ""Good luck with that guy, Rockford"" and consider their jobs done.",2,2023-06-16 16:02:32 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

If you ever want to make sandwiches with me or volunteer on community days, please let me know. Miss Carly's is fun place to help and I promise you, it will make your heart happy and you will see miracles happen. I know there is a lot going on with the fraud page and all, but ya can’t believe everything you read. Carly has not been found guilty of any fraud charges. Carly has her taxes in and we are awaiting the audit. I do not believe that Carly Rice misused funds from all the facts I have been given. I call the fraud page out on their behaviors, such as making fun of Carly, volunteers, and the homeless. This did in fact get me blocked from the page that I believe these “mean girls” are behind. I do know for a fact that these “mean girls” do exist because they were mean to me when I volunteered there. (If you want to have lunch or something with me, I tell you all about what happened to me.) 

I am waiting patiently for the audit and facts. I’ve been quiet about my time volunteering at Miss Cary’s because I have been waiting for the right time to tell y’all how I fell about this situation. The Fraud at Miss Carly’s page is a bunch of bullshit and driven by mean spirited individuals who, I feel, did not get there way. They are not waiting patiently for an audit to be done, instead they are attacking, manipulating, causing all kinds of chaos and drama to ensue. They now have pulled Carly’s children into all of this chaos and drama, where they do not belong. Kids deserve to be kids and not have to deal with adult issues that have nothing to do with them, but the fact is the fraud page can not sit quietly and be patient like the rest of us. I believe they want to give their opinions more than they want facts. Ladies and Gentlemen, the world is already negative, filled with corruption, and enough hate to take each and everyone of us out. Do we really want to keep doing this to ourselves? I know I don’t. I want to live, laugh, and love everyone and everything with my whole heart, even if it causes me some tears now and again. I want happiness and peace. I want us all to be able to come together and help one another out, by lifting each other, up, by believing in one other, and coming together to form a strong bond and sense of community. Do you want facts or opinions? Do you want negative or positive? Do you want love or hate? If you don’t like what you are doing, then change it, only you have the power to control yourself and how you react to others. Change, I believe is a great thing to want to do. I want to make changes that will fulfill my heart and soul. I want to love unconditionally. I want to just breathe and believe! All of this is what I believe and have learned in my 3 years volunteering at Miss Carly’s. Carly Rice has taught me this. Today I am grateful for Miss Carly’s and Carly Rice. I am grateful for her wanting better and doing better each day as an individual. For creating this tight knit family were we all fit in no matter what is going on with us at the moment in our daily struggles. She fills in the gaps. The gaps that no other organization can. 💜

Cannabis has been legal for a few years, and there has been no documented correlation between crime and cannabis.  Crack and narcotics, are a totally different thing.  

The thing to remember about working with homeless people, is there is a segment that is resistant to help for various reasons.  These agencies cannot legally compel anyone to participate.  This segment is then held up as how the ""system"" is broken.  Actually, I've seen fewer homeless in my area the last few years.

There aren't many people that would be considered ""literally homeless"" by federal standards. Those standards are by far too picky. Chances are this guy wouldn't fit ""literally homeless"" without actually going out of his way to meet those ridiculous standards. Basically, federally funded housing/placement  programs have an absurd amount of hoops to hop through. So he may not fit that outline immediatly, but it by far does not mean he is sheltered

""DONATION UPDATEWE ARE NOW ACCEPTING SPRING/SUMMER CLOTHING!! Everyone has been asking and I’m so happy to tell you that we are ready! We worked hard over the past couple weeks to work through any excess warm clothing yet still keep a small amount tucked away. It’s always such a delicate balance to try and anticipate the needs of the most vulnerable folks and we tend to need winter stuff way longer than people would think, due to it being so cold at night still. That being said, we can still use some coats and definitely hoodies. More than anything….we need blanklets and sleeping bags and tents during the springtime because so many people lose access to emergency cold weather shelter, be it an actual shelter or an other temporary solution they found. It’s a whole new ballgame when there is no snow on the ground! Our doantion room has essentially been cleared out every day that it is open. If it wasnt for the fact that we are constantly stocking it, I dont know that we would make it through a whole day! Thank you to everyone that has been dropping off so much seasonally appropriate clothing as well as household items, toys etc. It’s just the best thing to see people leave protected from the weather. Or, to see them build new homes and have HOPE when they leave here with a few plates, an old quilt, and some clothes and snacks for their kids. Piece by piece, they are able to make an empty apartment a real home! Here are the things people are needing most right now: \*\*TENTSBLANKETS/SLEEPING BAGSCLEANING SUPPLIES (can be used) CAT FOOD/DOG FOODSHEETS/BEDDING/TOWELS/ANY LINENS\*\*FOOD FOR LUNCHES (chips, granola bars, cookies, pudding/jello cups, bannas, oranges, apples)SODA FOR THE CREW (Mountian Dew, Coke, Sprite etc…they like it all!) HYGIENE ITEMS (shampoo, conditioner, deoderant, razors, bar soap, hair products for textured hair, etc) As always, the FOOD is true number one things we need. Our numbers only steadily climb as the weather warms and we need all the help we can get to feed 400 or more people every day. Its pretty amazing what we can do when we work togetherDonation drop off is Wednesday- Saturday 10am-4:30pm, but if you have food to drop off and dont mind a quick hand off, I’m home after hours all of the time, so youre welcome to drop off sicne we need it so badly.

Miss Carly addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss Carly volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  Carly addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets today while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  Recall a few years ago when Carly had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at Carly’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss Carly addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her place is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is the Rockford register Star may turn out to be a blessing for her, per Carly (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals monthly.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since Covid and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",8,2024-02-15 23:42:04 UTC,homeless

How many rides have been given how many people have closed that didn't have clothes hygiene supplies that didn't have supplies if this place gets shut down are you going to help the people or you know complain more that there's people on the corners asking for money while you're complaining to get the places to help them shut down.

Mark Bonne is a Rockford Alder, and State Senator Steve Staddleman's Chief of Staff. 

I posted this so people are aware that Illinois AG does have an open investigation around her, as well as the city litigation.  It also shows how her narrative has people believing that shutting her down would hurt the community, but there is no data or evidence of who and how many is is helping, but a ton of evidence of how is getting funding and how it is being spent.  

**I will say it again:  Nobody was asking Carly and Jacob to move into a commercial building and open it up 24x7 to hand out condoms, make-up, needles and junk food.**  She made friends with a few crack hoe's from the bar behind her, and the homeless old timers who got kicked out the shelters, and spun it like the ""system"" failed these people and they fell through the cracks.

A legitimate organization would have employees and people trained with degrees to help in these situations. She doesn’t know what she’s doing.

I am biased tho bc I knew some of her lying behavior from mutual friends and I witnessed the Irish Rose FB incident which made it clear she was looking for clout and attention. To be fair, she may have been right about the Rose, I wouldn’t known and I support people calling out “me too” even if it’s messy. But one of the comments from the waitress always stuck with me-she said “Carly, you were here last night and everything was fine, what happened?”

I would not call this social work and legally she can’t call herself that. I would say this is one of the worst examples I have ever seen of someone using “social work” to grift people and simultaneously fuck them up and be sloppy. I have seen a lot of veterans lie about their service and start advocacy and outreach groups. I worked for a vet like that. He took over a small agency on the south side and used the grant money to pay for his meals (not business like grub hub) and suits. But he never got involved with the clients so they were safe and handled appropriately. That staff did a lot of grassroots work with the homeless in the area who were not our clients. Linking them with services. We had a rotating schedule to feed them every day and we fed them out of our own pockets. They ate the same food that we did. No one ever got on FB and asked for handouts lol. 

Anyone in the field who hears about a direct service place that doesn’t use grants, doesn’t pay people, and doesn’t follow mandated reporting is going to immediately see the red flags. 

From what I heard from insiders who work for the big players in social services in Rockford, some worked with her because there was nothing. Like she said the hospital reached out to her to get people to rehab. Well if that’s true, the hospital must have been utterly up a creek without a paddle and forced to d/c. This happens regardless of the quality of hospital or the staff. It’s due to payer issues.

I can't say anything about financials. I don't work for her, I rarely donate, I have volunteered twice, and I know people that have utilized her services. 

I feel it's worth putting the knowledge I do have, out there as I'm not seeing many people mention some of these specifics.

1. Homeless people and addicts are usually viewed as ""less than,"" even when trying to get into facilities that are supposed to help them. From the people thst work there to the CEOs that establish protocol, the person who is struggling is VERY often either treated like shit or given hoops to jump through that are damn near impossible. Carly speaks about this in a recent post about needing IDs and a phone to get into facilities. 

The people that I know that have been helped by her have been grateful to be ""met where they are at,"" with absolutely no shame whether they make it or not and are encouraged to keep trying. These people are you and me, they are someone's son/daughter/husband/mother/best friend etc. who just can't seem to get their footing back in normal society. I say this from experience, until you have really witnessed it or lived it, you cannot understand how difficult it is to get a job, keep a job, stay clean, or find housing.

2. You talk about a place that you consider comparable, Carpenter's place (and I am fully aware of others: the Rescue Mission, Rosecrance, Mulberry Center, Stepping Stones, etc.) As another person mentioned, there are rules and regulations that make getting help difficult. It may not meet someone where they are at. The Christianity aspect being one.

Sure, they could get in, but what about when they get kicked out because some counselor has an attitude that day and says they are being aggressive when really their emotions are completely raw from withdrawing? Back to the streets. Perhaps they try again to go there in a month or 2. This time they use once and are told to leave. This cycle can continue for all of the shelters/programs etc. Eventually the person feels too ashamed to go anywhere feeling like a total failure or is blacklisted with nowhere else to go.

3. Harm reduction is HUGE. It keeps people alive long enough to give them a CHANCE to get recovery.

4. Referencing what some have said about the buildings and her living situation and such: if you go back to the beginning, she just lived there in a sketchy neighborhood on a drug addled street with hookers. She offered a meal once and an idea seemed to be born. Due to the connections of people she already had from growing up in the area, people shared her first post and it just started to grow. In my personal opinion, it grew way too fast for anyone to manage, let alone an addict with a couple years off hard drugs. 

Systems were not put into place, positions were not made, they seem to just keep trying to catch up with what's in front of them. Adding storage, buying buildings, needing more as popularity grows. It's a hot mess there, but my personal opinion is that the intention is still to serve, while having no model to go off of. First meals, then clothing, then donations, then volunteers, then treatment, then meals for volunteers, gifts for kids in poor families, etc. I have seen the thousands of sandwiches and the backpacks full of treatment supplies and the free phones and the donation room jam packed and bustling. 

5. My final thought for now is that I greatly appreciate that she brings humanity and thus support to a group of people that are often rejected by society. When the ""worshippers"" of facebook make comments cheering someone on to go to treatment. That person gets to hear about that when they would normally be completely isolated with no support. It also opens the non-homeless/addicted/trafficked person's eyes to see these people out in their world and be a bit kinder. 

I think that's all I have. I appreciate the openness in which you are presenting your questions, so I felt my reply would be heard.",10,2023-10-30 06:34:04 UTC,homeless

A big part of being homeless in Rockford was just trying to find a place to exist without being expected to pay money. Carpenter's was great for this. They made you get a case manager but that was super easy and quick and genuinely helped you with things. I frequently got shaving stuff and clothes. They would give you a tote to store stuff. The food was always perfectly acceptable and there was no extortion with making you sit through church stuff. Of course they had the church stuff but it was after the food and if you didn't want to listen you didn't have to. You could read or anything else quiet.

RRR treated it's men like criminals. The hours they made you keep made it impossible to get or hold a job. The security people that were supposed to guard your stuff frequently stole. I had a friend who was working overnights at McDonald's but the head guy named Lugene didn't believe him for some reason so he had to sleep outside. You woke at 5am and had to be back at the shelter at 4pm if you were late at all you were locked out. The people in charge would constantly threaten you with being kicked out and really relished the small amount of power they had. They forced you to come back at 1130 three days a week to listen to the place that Josh Duggar went for being a pedo.

It was horrible. Fuck that place. I went to jail afterwards and it was legit an upgrade.

And full disclosure I was in active heroin addiction so of course that colors my experiences. I am almost 8 years sober now though.

EDIT: There were several places that helped me out. Magpie gave me free coffee and breakfast. The Lutheran church by the disaster house was incredible to me. And people at both hospitals were great. They were so much nicer than I deserved.",10,2023-11-24 22:07:26 UTC,homeless

You said several offer rehab ? Who? Rosecrance can only do so much but the wait list is for state insurance is two to three months out. 
Rockford is broke, Single point of Entry has no more funds left and the wait list for housing is a couple miles long. Good luck getting to get anybody any help. 
Rockford Rescue Mission has no beds, they are constantly full. So where's all this other help you speak of? 
As for condoms and needle exchange, there's only one other program and it just came to the Winnebago/Boone county 3 months ago, Live4Lali. And they are another God send. 
Remedies has a battered women's program, beds are full. 
So yes, I have searched and I'll be the first to tell you, there is a huge problem in the Rockford area with homeless, SUD, mental illness and abuse. So before you start criticizing programs that are helping, check yourself.",0,2024-01-12 04:02:49 UTC,homeless

What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during Covid because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that MC would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with Housing First that Rockford is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  MC rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in winter.  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

Here are some links on the work the city does.

I have personally been inside Miss Carly's and have seen first hand the work that she provides for the homeless, addicted and mental ill. I definitely did not do an inventory of the food she hangs out on a daily basis. So I'm not gonna speak on that at all. I did visually see her speak to an individual that was gonna go AWOL on probation, while helping a handicap women in a wheel chair with her adolescent child get some clothes and food, at the same time help another individual get into drug rehab. All within 30 minutes. She and her facility are trying to help where she can. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted at these posts tearing down an organization that is here to help. 
Before I go out of my way to ridicule someone in any fashion, I need to look at myself and ask ""have I done everything to help this individual with their mission?""  Because if I have not done that, all I'm doing is judging.  And then the next question is why? Am I ashamed of my lack of cooperation in this mission? Am I projecting my own bullshit into someone else?
 And for me, there's only one ultimate judge. And it ain't me and it definitely ain't you. 

When I was there she told me she was raided by the police. And no citations were given, they found nothing illegal. She also said they have been audited several times. Again, no fines. With the needle exchange, she told us it takes a special certification and the city wasn't handing any out. (That is another question for a different day) However, they had to stop that program.  Again, no citations were handed out. 
Let me ask you a person question, if I may. 
If you saw Carly out to dinner with her family would you say hello or would you come on here and ridicule her? Slam on her, say things like, how dare she eat in a restaurant! How dare she drive a car and not take the bus or public transportation! How dare she wear clean clothes!

There is nothing and no one holding her accountable and tracking the things that come in. The city is suing her for non-compliance, again public record. She stated in an interview as well that she had to create programs to tie a receipt to, cooking the books, again public post and you can watch it and the city state the place isn’t safe as well to work or live in.

The stories and the numbers just aren’t factual. The number she states she feeds… not true and she’s been told that and ignores it.

Nobody has a job, has to arrange medical leave and can leave on short notice? Nobody has a partner or children that will need help?  

If someone is truly homeless in Rockford, the city's Housing First program will get them sheltered, and then work through the other issues with a case worker.  Is it perfect and is it easy? No, but they are effective and aren't isolating people at a facility 100 miles away.  The city is also utilizing programs that will provide long term help.  This is in addition to the homeless prevention programs. 

I will say it again.  For someone who claims to have been victimized so much, she ignores the dangers of not having boundaries when it comes to her family safety.  She has a strange fascination with sex offenders.  

There are scores of vacant buildings in that area that could have been used, instead of a live-work arrangement.  The only NA room in town is .5 mile west of her in a strip mall on College Ave that is half occupied.

Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss Carly's bc they know she has Narcan and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either way, but some of the comments are petty AF. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",0,2024-03-23 21:24:31 UTC,homeless

RHSD/Community Action administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people yearly. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. RHSD literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at night to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in Rockford's Human Services Department does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a way that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for a few months, or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for couple of months.  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in place, and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",4,2020-10-17 06:51:14 UTC,"homeless, homelessness"

Labor does need to get more POC in leadership but so does the Government. The unions could have met the diversity requirements requested by the developers but the developer did that to split the vote over the PLA. I could go on all day about Coleman but will spare the sub. I really wish they woulda focused on creating affordable housing rather than luxury units and honestly wish they woulda worked out the deal with RVC.

Honestly lots of times announcements like this lead to nowhere or we forget about it. I will agree that corruption is legalized in a lot of ways. The reality is it’s very difficult to ascertain what is going on. Is the city doing well or not? It doesn’t feel like it often but I do like the people of Rockford that work hard to make it work, I just don’t think that “thriving” in the way the current administration wants it to be should be the goal. The goal should be to make sure that everybody is able to get equal access to resources. The difference between east and west rockford is glaring.",0,2023-11-15 19:43:05 UTC,affordable housing
Considering a move to Rockford area,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/odpfhh/considering_a_move_to_rockford_area/,2021-07-04 17:50:28 UTC,"My family moved up here from Texas when I was about 7 years old. I have never understood the disdain people have for living here...I'm 30 now & have never had any serious concerns about Rockford. In the time we've spent here, the city has developed tremendously - as those before me have said, there are plenty of outdoor activities to do (Anderson Gardens, Nicholas Conservatory/Sinnissippi Park, Midway Village, a plethora of golf courses, the Rock River, City Market, etc). The restaurant scene is improving, either off of old, family-owned places or new ones (The Rathskellar, The Norwegian, Olympic Tavern, Prarie Street, CJ's, Mary's, Uncle Nick's); IMO we have a large immigrant population that influences parts of our city. It is progressing, although not as quickly as some people hope. There is a Hard Rock Café & Casino in the works, one of the dilapidated buildings downtown has turned into a hotel, new art murals are going on the side of downtown buildings every day. I think it's fine & my husband & I bought a house here after living in downtown Rockford for a few years. 

Every single city in the US will have less than stellar areas, us included. The homeless population does seem to be increasing, but on the same token there is a great place called Miss Carly's that feeds them, sends people that need the extra help to rehab, & you can volunteer your time there. A lot of people you see begging for money are probably not homeless though, just panhandling. 

As someone has said previously, it can be pretty blue collar, especially in the surrounding cities/towns & there are a LOT of bars. But, I'm a bartender so it's proven to be a lucrative business to me. The music scene is lacking, but improving a little.

I say go for it! 🤘",8,2021-07-04 19:49:01 UTC,homeless
Considering a move to Rockford area,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockford/comments/odpfhh/considering_a_move_to_rockford_area/,2021-07-04 17:50:28 UTC,"1) Its close to chicago. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in an hour or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of rockford. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of chicago. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of winter being down well below 0 for weeks and the summers are well above the 90s for weeks. the springs and falls are nice but its only about a month of each. 

rockford is also a highly industrial area, except that was 20 or 30 years ago. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for a few years then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant drive worth a shit. guys in their mid 30s are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every place imaginable. They also passed another granting rockford to build a casino this year or the next. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any way

3) I wish rockford had one street that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in rockford, or even wisconsin. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for a day. 

&#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The midwest is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for 6 months to a year to experience the seasons and they way people act like here. Sure we dont have Antifa like you do in the Pacific Northwest, but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at night and chain down what you dont want stolen. Welcome to the shitshow.",-9,2021-07-04 18:41:29 UTC,homeless

Cons - the homelessness is less intense than the west coast or even the PNW but just be careful as some of the homeless can be really aggressive. The crime has very specific hotspots and if you do your research you will know where they are. Some people on here are very sensitive about that because they'll accuse you of being classist and all that SJW stuff but it is a safety issue so you don't go walking and driving into the wrong part of town at night.
