Please also understand that many towns in the region send their homeless to [ORGANIZATION] as a means of shifting the problem to another entity.  I don't give money to panhandlers on the boardwalk as it is often used for drugs or alcohol.  It would be better to encourage them to seek the available services like [ORGANIZATION] Rescue Mission or others. 

ORG2 helps youths facing homelessness.  You can donate time, money, or things like sheets and clothing.

26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,9,2024-11-13 20:13:40 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"I was homeless for a while as a teen. The [ORGANIZATION] is always the hardest. Clothes, blankets, towels, hand warmers, warm food, non perishable food (but sometimes canned food ends up freezing and is almost impossible to open if you don’t have a can opener). Something everyone also needs is a backpack because you need to constantly carry everything that you own at all times. Something I had that I swear kept me alive was a thermos someone gave me and I would just drink hot water from [ORGANIZATION] and warm myself up from the inside. It really helped make me feel less cold. A sleeping bag is a huge game changer if you’re super generous. The [ORGANIZATION] rescue mission also lets people volunteer for the soup kitchen which feeds a ton of people. I use to volunteer there when I got on my feet. Something I do want to say is a lot of time people will assume all homeless people are addicts but it’s not always the case. For me my grandfather died who raised me and I ended up in a terrible foster home that I felt I had no choice but to leave and try and survive on my own. Some people are mentally ill, there’s a ton of different circumstances that can make someone homeless. But I know a lot of people go “I don’t give money because they will just spend it on *blank*” but one thing you got to realize is homeless are people too. We also want stimulation, we want to feel human, we spend our entire day just trying to survive and sometimes it’s okay for someone to want to just feel like a person for [TIME] out of [DATE] and listen to music, or paint their nails, or wear a necklace they really liked or got forbid have a drink like everyone else gets to do. I remember I ran into an old family friend when I was homeless and she took me to get my hair cut and I literally looked myself in the mirror and started crying my eyes out because I forgot what it felt like to just be my old self again and do things like that. That’s something I will never forget. Life isn’t just about surviving, it’s also about things that bring you peace and happiness, homeless or not we are all people."
26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,3,2024-11-13 13:55:20 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,My church does a [INSTITUTION] like thing [ORGANIZATION]. Always looking for people to volunteer with the nuns that do it. It’s usually at [TIME] and they feed and give them a warm [STREET] for [TIME]. Call PERSON0 parish and ask about it they should give you the information! I know it usually starts in [LOCATION]!
26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,3,2024-11-13 15:32:58 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"With [ORGANIZATION] coming up, if you want to make a difference and have the financial means, donations of jackets, heavy socks, wool hats, hand warmers, and clean underwear (especially long underwear) are often appreciated by either agencies or unhoused individuals.

Even if the person has a sheltered indoor [STREET] to sleep at [TIME], often these places will kick them out very early in the day so they spend a lot of [DATE] outside."

26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,2,2024-11-13 18:19:51 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"DATE0 about this time I don’t know who, but someone gave out new blankets to all the local homeless. It was kind of cute because they were noticeably creating a little style thing since they all wrapped themselves up and roamed around as usual.

Agreed that [ORGANIZATION] literally saves lives here."
26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,2,2024-11-14 00:05:27 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"I think we can't help them all especially if they have no desire for betterment. Best [STREET] is to help one or two who want to get off the streets. Seek the ones who probably ended up homeless because of variables unrelated to addiction.

I'd start by buying them a tent and maybe let them camp out in your yard until they get their confidence back. Buy them a bike and a gym membership so they can travel there to use the showers. They'll need a [STREET] to groom enough to look presentable for job prospects. 

Once they start working then they'll be able to afford a PO Box for their mail and official address to use for business purposes. With luck and determination maybe the one or two you help can afford to be roommates and share an apartment. 

Provide the shelter, bread and butter, and hope that by giving them respect and dignity they can help themselves   towards a better condition."
26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,1,2024-11-13 16:46:00 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"Clothing donations are a good start.

I'm so conflicted on the panhandlers. I know some of them are genuine and are truly just looking for something to eat. But I really don't want to help them with their drug habit and if I try to help them out I assume there is a high chance it will go directly to that sometimes even before food.

I've considered giving a piece of pizza or something. 

Long time ago not in [ORGANIZATION] I gave a panhandler guy $5 to help him out. He then said he was going to purchase [ORGANIZATION]'s new CD. Either that or he had just bought it. Can't remember. Ummm, okay dude. [ORGANIZATION]. I guess your musical entertainment is on me."

26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,1,2024-11-15 01:33:58 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,To really help reduce homelessness you need to create an incentive to get off the streets.  Everyone knows the solution but it's never enacted because no one can profit off of it.
26,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,7,2024-11-13 21:00:32 UTC,Best [STREET] to help homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,"I always give money if I can afford to. Who am I to judge what someone who literally has no home spends a couple of dollars on, first of all?

Second of all, if someone is an addict, then I truly feel for them, because not having enough money to score drugs/buy alcohol can send people into withdrawals, which can literally kill them. I wouldn't wish going through withdrawals while sleeping on the streets on my worst enemy. So if someone needs a couple dollars to get well just to basically survive, then I'm not going to judge. I just want them to stop being stigmatized for having shit luck with illnesses and circumstances.

And third of all, it's my choice to give someone money if I want to. I know if I were homeless/living on the streets and someone told me they didn't want to give me money just because I'd do XY or Z with it, I'd feel demoralized and dehumanized. I understand the sentiment is to want to protect people from themselves, but not giving a homeless person a 5 or whatever isn't going to save their life. But giving it to them, on the other hand,  could help them realize they're a person who deserves to have comforts just like everyone else.

Bit of a diatribe. (It's a subject I feel really intensely on.) And I am happy to vent to someone who thinks along the same lines as I do

Anyway...Thank you so much for your input. I am so sorry that anyone has to go through something like this, but people like you-- who've gone through it and made it out on the other end and who want to give back-- people like you give other people hope. You are a shining star."

If he’s a stickler about being monogamous still, then I’ll probably have to outsource, if anyone knows anyone who’s committed to getting everyone laid plz respond. I just want the homeless people in my area to be happy and warm."

Why are they so much more persistent here than literally anywhere else?,"[ORGANIZATION]. is less than 40k. Population of [ORGANIZATION] is 1.5mil. Estimated homeless in [ORGANIZATION] is nearly 400 or about 1%. Est homeless in [ORGANIZATION] is about 4000 or 0.2%. That's huge. That's why you notice it. And until [ORGANIZATION] can figure out how to increase residency, beyond the boardwalk will continue to get worse and worse"

Alll the issues a small city has that is overrun with casinos and nightlife giving license to people behaving badly.  But the beach is alright."

I’ve never had my car or company car damaged/vandalized in [ORGANIZATION].
I don’t count the occasional panhandler asking for change or a drunk/addict/mental person yelling at telephone pole as a crime.
[ORGANIZATION] is a cool area, enjoy!"
37,2024-09-03 06:39:55 UTC,1,2024-09-03 13:01:58 UTC,Moving to [ORGANIZATION]. Advice? Insights?,"I'm not personally familiar with [ORGANIZATION] (except that I've heard of it). But I do know there are many suburb-types who see one homeless person in the city and kind of overreact and/or freak out and then assume everything is super-sketchy and unsafe. 

There are also a lot of sheltered white people who have very little experience going into neighborhoods where there are more people of color. 

I tend to take reports of ""sketchy city/area"" with a grain of salt. Some neighborhoods are more dangerous than others but there is so much exaggeration online.

Can read the crime reports online. Are there a lot of armed robberies and stuff? Personally walking around at [TIME] or 3am and feeling comfortable is a good sign."

Sadly, I agree with this 100%.  Read some of the comments on online gambling forums, they gamble at [ORGANIZATION] because there are fewer ""sketchy"" people compared to the boardwalk casinos.  Lots of suburban white folks who see a homeless person or someone panhandling and they get upset."

I just bought a condo here [ORGANIZATION] (with disabled elderly man & my daughter). I know there’s drug addicts & homeless people - that’s every city - but it’s a bit shocking to see their living standards. 

Overall, [PERSON] is pretty good - they’re doing a lot of projects to make it look better.

The beach is a decent walk (for me it’s [TIME]). 

[ORGANIZATION] outdoor bar is open during [LOCATION]. Once it’s DATE2 / cooler they will close the bar outside and open the indoor one. 

[PERSON]. I like living here."

20,2022-07-03 12:33:31 UTC,9,2022-07-03 14:03:35 UTC,Change in [LOCATION],"I enjoy going to FFLOC050 about 4-5 times per year just to enjoy the ""fun/positive aspects"" of the city. However, I do walk as far as FFLOC051 and FFLOC052 at times for some of my favorite local spots such as FFLOC053 and FFLOC054. I must say that I noticed much less homeless and mentally disturbed people on the streets compared to previous trips. In fact, I do not recall seeing one prostitute on the [STREET] during my last few visits. Therefore, from a visitor's perspective, FFLOC050 has definitely been improving compared to the [STREET] it was back in [ORGANIZATION]. However, it still has a LONG [STREET] to go. Personally, I would love to live in FFLOC050 (if I had a decent job there) because there are a lot of positive entertaining things to do there, even outside of gambling. Many great places to eat, drink, and concerts throughout [LOCATION].

 I am sure there are several community outreach programs looking for volunteers to help at food banks, neighborhood watch groups, and other volunteer programs looking for help. You are in the perfect position to make a difference. I think research is needed to see where you can help the most. But, I must tell you that some good folks have already been making a difference because there is definite improvement in FFLOC050 compared to DATE2. I am just not sure how those improvements are being made."
20,2022-07-03 12:33:31 UTC,5,2022-07-03 16:54:27 UTC,Change in [LOCATION],"I work in [ORGANIZATION] and have family who live in [ORGANIZATION]. The only reason why drug use, homelessness etc is still so prominent is because they’d lose money trying to help. It sounds obscene but think about it. There are very few shelters in two block let alone mile radius and most of them end up going to FAC0 anyway. Instead of fixing the apartment complexes and collecting the e homeless and putting them in a shelter they just have them on the [STREET] because It’s cheaper. This world runs on the economy not empathy."
20,2022-07-03 12:33:31 UTC,3,2022-07-11 12:51:50 UTC,Change in [LOCATION],"I've managed government subsidized apartments for the homeless and borderline homeless....the majority become hoarders and create really bad pest situations, bed bugs and rodents. They never clean and the appliances are all broken and they do not let us in. My conjecture is that many towns and states have tried this and abandoned it due to the absurdly high cost of maintenance. The workers that deal with this are abused and disrespected by the residents too so turnover is quite high. Unfortunately fixing apartments to put the homeless in just isn't that easy of a solution. Feel free to try tho"
20,2022-07-03 12:33:31 UTC,3,2022-07-03 15:20:50 UTC,Change in [LOCATION],"You cant force people. There are programs and assistance that can help but you cant make people take it. I think if you hand out food or basic necessities that's the best [STREET] to help. Socks underwear, toiletries  that kind of stuff. Most of the homeless  people  know they can get government assistance but dont want it."
