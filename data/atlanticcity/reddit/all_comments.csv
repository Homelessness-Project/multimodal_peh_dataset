Best way to help homeless people in AC?,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/1gq9kwv/best_way_to_help_homeless_people_in_ac/,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,"May I first say that is very decent of you.  Please also understand that many towns in the region send their homeless to AC as a means of shifting the problem to another entity.  I don't give money to panhandlers on the boardwalk as it is often used for drugs or alcohol.  It would be better to encourage them to seek the available services like AC Rescue Mission or others. 

Covenent House helps youths facing homelessness.  You can donate time, money, or things like sheets and clothing.

The winter is always the hardest. Clothes, blankets, towels, hand warmers, warm food, non perishable food (but sometimes canned food ends up freezing and is almost impossible to open if you don’t have a can opener). Something everyone also needs is a backpack because you need to constantly carry everything that you own at all times. Something I had that I swear kept me alive was a thermos someone gave me and I would just drink hot water from wawa and warm myself up from the inside. It really helped make me feel less cold. A sleeping bag is a huge game changer if you’re super generous. The Atlantic city rescue mission also lets people volunteer for the soup kitchen which feeds a ton of people. I use to volunteer there when I got on my feet. Something I do want to say is a lot of time people will assume all homeless people are addicts but it’s not always the case. For me my grandfather died who raised me and I ended up in a terrible foster home that I felt I had no choice but to leave and try and survive on my own. Some people are mentally ill, there’s a ton of different circumstances that can make someone homeless. But I know a lot of people go “I don’t give money because they will just spend it on *blank*” but one thing you got to realize is homeless are people too. We also want stimulation, we want to feel human, we spend our entire day just trying to survive and sometimes it’s okay for someone to want to just feel like a person for a few moments out of their day and listen to music, or paint their nails, or wear a necklace they really liked or got forbid have a drink like everyone else gets to do. I remember I ran into an old family friend when I was homeless and she took me to get my hair cut and I literally looked myself in the mirror and started crying my eyes out because I forgot what it felt like to just be my old self again and do things like that. That’s something I will never forget. Life isn’t just about surviving, it’s also about things that bring you peace and happiness, homeless or not we are all people.",9,2024-11-13 20:13:40 UTC

Best way is to help one or two who want to get off the streets. Seek the ones who probably ended up homeless because of variables unrelated to addiction.

I'd start by buying them a tent and maybe let them camp out in your yard until they get their confidence back. Buy them a bike and a gym membership so they can travel there to use the showers. They'll need a way to groom enough to look presentable for job prospects. 

Once they start working then they'll be able to afford a PO Box for their mail and official address to use for business purposes. With luck and determination maybe the one or two you help can afford to be roommates and share an apartment. 

Provide the shelter, bread and butter, and hope that by giving them respect and dignity they can help themselves   towards a better condition.",2,2024-11-14 00:05:27 UTC

I'm so conflicted on the panhandlers. I know some of them are genuine and are truly just looking for something to eat. But I really don't want to help them with their drug habit and if I try to help them out I assume there is a high chance it will go directly to that sometimes even before food.

I've considered giving a piece of pizza or something. 

Long time ago not in A.C. I gave a panhandler guy $5 to help him out. He then said he was going to purchase Madonna's new CD. Either that or he had just bought it. Can't remember. Ummm, okay dude. LOL. I guess your musical entertainment is on me.",1,2024-11-13 16:46:00 UTC

Best way to help homeless people in AC?,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/1gq9kwv/best_way_to_help_homeless_people_in_ac/,2024-11-13 10:03:37 UTC,"I always give money if I can afford to. Who am I to judge what someone who literally has no home spends a couple of dollars on, first of all?

Second of all, if someone is an addict, then I truly feel for them, because not having enough money to score drugs/buy alcohol can send people into withdrawals, which can literally kill them. I wouldn't wish going through withdrawals while sleeping on the streets on my worst enemy. So if someone needs a couple dollars to get well just to basically survive, then I'm not going to judge. I just want them to stop being stigmatized for having shit luck with illnesses and circumstances.

And third of all, it's my choice to give someone money if I want to. I know if I were homeless/living on the streets and someone told me they didn't want to give me money just because I'd do XY or Z with it, I'd feel demoralized and dehumanized. I understand the sentiment is to want to protect people from themselves, but not giving a homeless person a 5 or whatever isn't going to save their life. But giving it to them, on the other hand,  could help them realize they're a person who deserves to have comforts just like everyone else.

Bit of a diatribe. (It's a subject I feel really intensely on.) And I am happy to vent to someone who thinks along the same lines as I do

Anyway...Thank you so much for your input. I am so sorry that anyone has to go through something like this, but people like you-- who've gone through it and made it out on the other end and who want to give back-- people like you give other people hope.

Any win over $1200 has to be paid by hand from an attendant.  There's paperwork involved so your machine pauses and an attendant comes to verify,  then goes to get the money and comes back.  My husband wins quite a bit (which is actually how we got this trip lol) and he won $5800 between his three handpays. 

Now,  this is different than you winning multiple times and cashing out a voucher for over $1200. Those,  you just cash out and can either go to a machine to be paid or a cashier window.  

I am not a gambler and just occasionally play,  expecting to lose but hoping to one day hit a big one.  I hit for about $715 on one spin, and you would have thought I won $100K. My husband has to explain things to me all the time.  

A few things have changed and are different than movies and shows:

When you put your money into a machine and you hit,  it is not going to spit out coins.  It's going to be credits. 

When you are done on a machine and you want to leave,  hit the ""Cash Out"" button, and it will print you a voucher that you can put into another machine to play or a cash machine to receive cash back.  

Another thing: if you want to cash out and you have cents on your voucher,  most casinos will not give you the coins back if you're cashing out on a machine.  You can actually elect to donate those to one of three charities they donate to.  I thought that was actually pretty cool.  If you want the coins,  I think you can go to a cashier window, and they'll give you the full amount.  There are some casinos that will give you coins out of the machine, though.  

Sign up for all the casinos rewards programs.  Sometimes,  I think in Ocean and maybe Hard Rock,  we'll give you free play money to play.  Definitely get that,  because why not? Then, put that reward card into the machines when you play so you can build points up for bigger rewards.

1.) First thing I did after getting off the Amtrak? Duh, gotta go touch the ocean. Who wouldn't? I've got a backpack with me, and that it's it. Never understood people that travel with half a house. Any rate, it's like a mile walk. Nbd. 

Only, about half a mile into it, I've turned down the Wrong Way. There's a police cruiser that flashes me down and tells me to turn around because I'm apparently looking to get robbed. (Thank you nice officer!)

Since then? It's not uncommon to see someone all twacked out just standing in the middle of the road. Drugs and poverty are EVERYWHERE but on the casino properties themselves. 

2.) No grocery stores. Not kidding, you have to go outside of AC to find food. Same for Walgreens/CVS etc. Even Amazon Delivery is *50* miles from AC. 

3.) Public transport does exist, and doesn't suck. It's a little bit of a challenge to translate the website, but once you find the .pdf (nothing lists times, just routes), it makes sense. Most of the busses are on the hour or the  45s. The ""Jitney"" is also an answer for anything near a casino or boardwalk. 

4.) This town is kinda ass. There's no real local flavor, no eateries, neat districts to explore, nada. Just poverty, people strung out on whatever, and casinos. Some flavor at the boardwalk, but it's really just tourist-y stuff.

AC has a fundamental social/economic structural problem: dismal rate of home ownership by people who live there.  the national average % for home ownership by residents is about 60% - in AC, it's about 30% (one of the lowest in the US).  the quality of city life starts with home ownership - homeowners have a vested interest in their neighborhoods and the safety of their streets. increasing home ownership restores neighborhoods, attracts quality essential businesses and services - good neighborhoods make a good city.  everything builds out from there. whatever can be done to increase resident-occupied home ownership is essential to making AC a decent place to live and work.

I must say that I noticed much less homeless and mentally disturbed people on the streets compared to previous trips. In fact, I do not recall seeing one prostitute on the street during my last few visits. Therefore, from a visitor's perspective, AC has definitely been improving compared to the way it was back in 2018. However, it still has a LONG way to go. Personally, I would love to live in AC (if I had a decent job there) because there are a lot of positive entertaining things to do there, even outside of gambling. Many great places to eat, drink, and concerts throughout the year.

 I am sure there are several community outreach programs looking for volunteers to help at food banks, neighborhood watch groups, and other volunteer programs looking for help. You are in the perfect position to make a difference. I think research is needed to see where you can help the most.

Tues and we’d nite us showing $199 per nite for regular king 
( but not the week of the 15th) 
Plus I think it’s $23 resort fee. 

So technically in your budget. 

Go online and check out the other hotels in the boardwalk. Midweek should be doable. 

If you dont stay at ocean at least go there get a card and play a bit. You should get offers for midweek comps 

Good luck",2,2021-06-24 17:27:23 UTC

Check out the Marriott Courtyard too, both of these are about a block from the beach.
