I would like to call to order the City Council meeting for April 4, 2017. Sondra, would you please call the roll? Here. Here. Present. Here. Right. Here. Here. Here. Would you join me in the Pledge of Allegiance?
 I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
 First order of business we have tonight is the, under city council reports, we have the nominating committee report, A&P commission nominees. Sarah, I believe, Sarah Bunch, I believe you have that tonight. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At the March 20th, 2017 Advertising and Promotion Committee meeting, the commission recommended the city council approve the following appointments for the Advertising and Promotion Commission.
 CHRISTIE SANDERSON, TOURISM INDUSTRY, ONE EXPIRED TERM ENDING MARCH 31ST, 2020. ROBERT ROADS, PUBLIC AT LARGE, ONE TERM ENDING 3-31-21. AND THAT'S OUR REPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEW SPEAKER I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S NOMINEES. NEW SPEAKER SO MOVED. NEW SPEAKER SECOND. NEW SPEAKER WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND TO ACCEPT THE NOMINEES. ANY COMMENTS? SONIA, WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL?
 I'M SORRY, SARAH, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT? I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THESE CANDIDATES, SO I WILL BE VOTING NO JUST ON A PROCEDURAL BASIS. I FEEL THAT PROCESS IS IMPORTANT AND THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT IN ALL OF OUR NOMINATIONS. SO I'M NOT VOTING AGAINST THESE PARTICULAR APPLICANTS, BUT I AM VOTING AGAINST THE PROCESS THAT I FEEL WAS SIDESTEPPED IN THIS CASE.
 So the city did have these applicant names for almost three weeks before the Advertising and Promotion Commission considered them. In the past when the nominating committee has wanted to have input over Advertising and Promotion Commission nominations, they've interviewed the applicants prior to the names being considered by the Advertising and Promotion Commission so that the commission could have the nominating committees.
 opinions in hand whenever they made their recommendation to the council. The city attorney's in memos in the past has said that it's improper for the city council to consider other names after the Advertising and Promotion Commission has made their nominations because it's a statutory process that the commission actually makes the nominations themselves. I understand that it's appropriate to...
 involve the nominating committee, but the proper procedure is for the applicants to be interviewed in the time between when the applications are received and the commission considers the names. Okay. Any other comments? I don't have my screen up to view any other comments, so I'll assume we don't have any. Has anybody got anything else they want to say on it? Okay. We have a motion and a second. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Abstain. Abstain.
 Yes. Yes. No. Mayor, since this is an internal motion, it only requires a majority of the City Council members who are here, and we got three with one abstention and one no. So the majority is three and the nominations are approved. Okay. Thank you. All right. Next order of business tonight is the Consent Agenda.
 Number one, approval of the March 21st, 2017 City Council meeting minutes. Number two, a resolution to approve a three-year lease agreement with Wings Avionics Incorporated for the airport hangar at 421 Ernest Lancaster Drive for rent in the amount of $1,606.49 per month.
 And number three, a resolution to approve an airspace permit agreement with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department for the Cato Springs Trail crossing of Highway 71 and Interstate 49. I will entertain a motion to accept the consent agenda as read. Sarah? So moved. John? Second the motion. All right. We have a motion and a second to accept the consent agenda as read.
 Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Batch? Yes. LaTierre? Yes. Long? Yes. Gray? Yes. March? Yes. Kenyon? Okay. Thank you all very much. And under unfinished business, we have none. Thank you, Council, very much for your work. We're not having any unfinished business. Thank you all.
 Under new business, number one, a resolution to authorize a contract with Progressive Trail Design LLC for the construction of new trails and improvements to existing trails in accordance with the Kessler Mountain Trails Master Plan in the amount of $296,721.87 and to approve a project contingency in the amount of $44,508.28. Kent. Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Mayor? Yeah.
 Have a little presentation for you tonight. There we go. At long last, we are finally, we've been through the trail planning process. We've been through the contractor selection process. And we have a contract before you for construction of 3.4 miles of new trail. Repairs and relocation to the existing trail. And a signage plan.
 for Kessler Mountain property. This is the result of the Trails Master Plan that was produced last year, adopted by the council last summer. This is the plan map that went out with the request for proposals. You can see in the center of the map the heavy solid red line
 That's 3.5 miles or 3.4 miles of new trail that will be constructed under this contract. It provides a loop which is below the bluff line, beyond the east side of the mountain, below the top of the mountain, and pretty close to the regional park. So this would be a very accessible area that could allow park visitors to explore the,
 the front country of the mountain woodland there. It does connect to the existing trail system on the north end, the top of the map there. And as you can see on the south end, it also extends off the loop and travels along the base of the bluff for a while and then goes up through the bluff and
 connects over to one of the existing trails on the top of the mountain. So the new trail will provide access on both the south and the north ends of the mountain, so greatly improve the access to those existing trails. That's the new trail. The existing trail
 Well, before I get to the existing trails, this is a map that indicates the needed locations for the trail signs, directional signs and confidence markers at each of the intersections, as well as two kiosks for new trailhead locations. This map is...
 a plan of repairs that are necessary on the existing trails. And these are repairs that have been identified in the the Trail Master Planning process, as well as there's some allowance for any new needs that may have occurred since then to those trails. These are repair areas, and I also mentioned relocation. As you can see, kind of the southwest corner of the property
 You see where obviously a number of trails extend beyond the city boundaries. These trails will be eliminated and relocated so that they will all lie within the city boundaries. On the original, the first map that was shown, the trails that are shown in the dashed red line are the trails that will be abandoned and the other trails will remain just strictly on the city property.
 This is some examples of some of the signs. This is results from Northwest Arkansas Razorback Greenway sign plan. And these are recommended signs for the soft surface trail system. These or variations of these are being used up and down the Northwest Arkansas Trail corridor.
 Again, this is some examples. This shows a kiosk trailhead location, which would have a map and some additional information on the trails. Again, this would be the kiosk sign. This is kind of a plan for interpretive panels. I believe we have four, yes, four interpretive panels.
 that are included as a part of this contract. And this is strictly to take a subject matter, flora, fauna, natural processes, whatever, and prepare some interpretive information to educate the visitor and the public on what they're experiencing on the mountain, whatever the subject of the interpretive panel is.
 This is an example of the trail confidence markers. These are indiscreet low posts that pretty much show you which direction to turn and just to let you know that you are on the right trail and how far it is to the next.
 And here we have some examples of some of the trails that the contractor has done in northwest Arkansas. This is pretty similar to what we will be seeing and what we expect for the New Kessler Mountain trails. You see that all of these trails are pretty much on a hillside. They're all bench cut, which
 is accomplished by either hand or with very small mechanized equipment. And we will allow that on this project. The equipment will be no wider than three feet. So again, it will be small and will not leave a large impact. Here's some more examples and the two photos on the left, you can see these are very good examples of rock armoring.
 where you actually take large slabs of rock and pretty much pave the trail. Now this is, we do have several areas on the existing trails where this has been identified and this will be accomplished. These are probably seeps or just particularly wet areas and this just helps armor the trail surface and protects the resource. Some more examples, excuse me. This is Blowing Springs up outside Bella Vista.
 You see an example of a stream crossing. Excuse me. And again, an example of a trailhead sign and the confidence markers. This is just a general cost breakdown of the different components of the contract. You can see we've got the trail layout design, the flagging, the GPS.
 ESTABLISHMENT OF THOSE COORDINATES AND THEN THERE'S NEW TRAIL CONSTRUCTION. THEN THERE IS A LINE ITEM FOR THE EXISTING TRAIL RELOCATION AND REPAIRS. AND THEN A BREAKDOWN ON THE DIFFERENT SIGNAGE NEEDS. THIS IS THE PROPOSED SCHEDULE THAT WAS PREPARED BY THE CONTRACTOR. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS HAS 50% OF THE WORK TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE END OF JUNE.
 That is very ambitious, but we are going to go at that full gun, so it's going to shoot for that. This has the entire trail grand opening at the first of September, and that's pretty much an explanation of what the contract will entail, and this is pretty much what we want to see in the way of a trail corridor out at Kessler Mountain. That's good work, Ken. Any questions? That's good work. Thank you. What questions do we have for Ken on this?
 Okay. What public comment do we have on this? Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the council. Mayor, I'd like to say that I'm getting excited about this, Ken. I really didn't have this kind of concept exactly what you're doing and that looks better than I could have imagined. So, thanks for your work. That's a good thing, all right. That's good stuff. Allen. I'd just like to make a motion to pass the resolution. Sarah. Second. We have a motion and a second to pass the resolution. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Any.
 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Number two, an ordinance to approve vacation 17-5725 for property located at Lot 33 of Villas at Forest Hill southwest of West Jewell Road and North Salem Road to vacate and access easement. Kip.
 Whereas the City Council has the authority under ACA 1454-104 to vacate public grounds or portions thereof which are not required for corporate purposes. And whereas the City Council has determined that the following described access easement is not required for corporate purposes. Now therefore it be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby vacates an access easement as described in Exhibit B attached to the Planning Department's Memo.
 Section 2, that a copy of this ordinance, duly certified by the City Clerk, along with a map attached as Exhibit A to the Planning Department's memo, shall be filed in the office of the Washington County Circuit Clerk. Section 3, that this vacation approval is subject to the following conditions. Number 1, any costs associated with relocation of or damage to utilities and new easement dedication shall be at the owner-developer's expense. And number 2...
 The existing alley, associated with lots 1 through 15 of townhomes at Forest Hills, shall be extended northwards to access Salem Road via the Villas at Forest Hills subdivision as indicated in the Forest Hills PZD Master Development Plan and approved by City Engineering staff in association with the grading permit for the Villas.
 The requested vacation shall not be approved until completion of the connection and its dedication and acceptance as a public right-of-way by the City of Fayetteville. Okay. Andrew? Andrew?
 Mayor and City Council, this property is just south of the Walmart neighborhood market on Weddington. I have it pulled up in Google Earth here so you can see where the cursor is. Here's the Walmart neighborhood market. The yellow marker is where the subject easement is located. It was dedicated last year when they were planning an alley for development of single family homes in this area. It was really a temporary type of an easement for an outlet until they connected the alley further north for future development.
 And so they're requesting to simply vacate this access easement. And at the time when the new alley is completed, which extends a little bit further north, then they would have a permanent connection and right-of-way. This was discussed at the Planning Commission meeting and unanimously forwarded on with a recommendation for approval. Thanks. Okay. What questions do we have for Andrew on this? Anybody good over there? Okay. Is there any public comment on this?
 So you know I'll bring it back to the council so we all didn't hear anything from anybody over there Move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading Justin second Motion second to go to the second reading. Sorry, would you please call the roll? Yes Yes, yes, yes Yes Yes
 An ordinance to approve VAC 17-5725 for property located at lot 33 of Villas at Forest Hills, southwest of West Ewell Road and North Salem Road, to vacate and access easement. Sir. Move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Do we have a second? Yes. Allen. Second. We have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Eddie. Yes. Second.
 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. March. Yes. Okay. Number three, an ordinance to amend 33.350 purpose and establishment of article 23 active transportation advisory committee of the federal code to expand the scope of the committee's duties and to establish a time for the election of the committee chair.
 Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby repeal Section 33.350, Purpose and Establishment of Article 23, Active Transportation Advisory Committee, and enact anew Section 33.350 as follows, quote, there is hereby established the Active Transportation Advisory Committee. The eight voting committee members shall elect a chair at the first annual meeting each year.
 This committee may make recommendations to the Transportation Committee on active transportation projects and issues that have been referred to them by the Administration or Transportation Committee, including, but not limited to, Subsection A, yearly trail, sidewalk, and paving overlay construction program plans. Review of overlay plans will be focused on incorporation of active transportation facilities. Subsection B, five-year trail construction prioritization plan.
 Subsection C, major sidewalk projects, trails, and other projects where major changes to existing street cross sections are planned. The review will be at the preliminary stage and will include typical cross sections and preliminary horizontal and vertical alignments. Neither the Transportation Committee nor the administration need to delay projects or wait for this Advisory Committee's recommendations.
 Subsection D, changes, additions, or deletions to the Active Transportation Plan and the Sidewalk Master Plan. And Subsection E, a member of the Active Transportation Advisory Committee shall present reports and recommendations to the Transportation Committee at least quarterly.
 The Active Transportation Committee shall host biannual guided tours focused on opportunities for active transportation infrastructure improvements. The tours may serve as two of the quarterly reports.
 OKAY. MATTHEW. THANK YOU, MAYOR COUNSEL. MATT MAHALOVICH, TRAILS COORDINATOR. ALSO SERVE AS THE STAFF REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. THIS CAME FORWARD AS A WAY TO TRY TO INCREASE THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. IT WAS THE GOALS OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE.
 As Kit explained, one of it is to see projects earlier. So if it's a construction project that may involve active transportation facilities, that that would be reviewed at an earlier stage in the process, which is usually a good thing so that if it is going to be changed in some way, that that's caught earlier to save potentially money on the project.
 The other thing is to have the biannual meetings so that one member of the active transportation committee would meet with the transportation committee and discuss any of the items, any projects and increase that communication as well as with tours. So that was the general goal is to increase communication. We do also have a member of the chairman of the active transportation committee here that can follow up.
 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BROUGHT BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION AFTER A VOTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER MARSH AND PETTY HAVE WORKED ON THIS WITH THE STAFF. I APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT ON THIS. BUT YES, WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE CHAIR OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, MAYOR JORDAN. MY NAME IS PAXTON ROBERTS. I'M THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
 I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BIKE AND WA. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BACK UP AND THAT THIS ORDINANCE REVISION HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT LINKED WITHIN THE COMMITTEE AND IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ADVISORY ROLE. IT IS INPUT AND WE REALLY VALUE AND APPRECIATE YOU BEING WILLING TO RECEIVE THAT INPUT.
 OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD OF US TO MAKE SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT COULD REALLY INCREASE THE MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS IN THE CITY AND THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE EVEN MORE USERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE A CAR FOR EVERYDAY TRANSPORTATION AND THAT USE EITHER BICYCLES OR WALKING AS A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO AND NOT NECESSARILY BY CHOICE. SO THE CITY HAS DONE SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB BUILDING OUT THE
 THAT NOW SOME OF THE LAST MILE PROBLEMS, SO TO SPEAK, ARE ON THE ROADS. I THINK THAT EXPANDING THE SCOPE SO THAT WE CAN GIVE INPUT ON THESE ROADS AND TO INCORPORATE BIKE LANES, PROTECTED BIKE LANES, CROSSWALKS, SIGNALS, WILL REALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. SO THANK YOU. NEW SPEAKER THANK YOU. WHAT QUESTIONS DO WE HAVE FROM THE COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS? OKAY. I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

 in order to amend 72.58 off-street parking facilities rules and rates of the city code to provide greater flexibility for event parking and city managed parking facilities and to make technical revisions kit
 Whereas section 72.58 H5 of the city code restricts event parking to the West Avenue parking lot for Walton Arts Center events expected to draw at least 600 patrons and requires the Walton Arts Center to provide personnel for parking activities during those events. And whereas the city should have the flexibility to conduct event parking in both the entertainment district and downtown business district.
 And whereas the city code should be updated to use the correct name of the West Avenue lot and include the Spring Street parking deck as a parking facility in the entertainment district. Now therefore be it ordained by the City Council, the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas section one that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby repeal section 72.58 of the Fayetteville Code and enacts section 72.58 as follows. O, event parking.
 The Parking Division may implement event parking in a City-managed parking facility as deemed necessary by the Mayor or his designee. Such event parking will require a person desiring to park a vehicle in a designated event parking facility to pay a fee of $5. The City of Fayetteville shall provide sufficient personnel to staff event parking.
 Section 2, that the City Council, the City of Fairlark, hereby repeals the introductory paragraph of Section 7258H and enacts a new introductory paragraph correcting the name of the West Avenue lot and adding references to the Spring Street parking deck so that it reads as follows. Subsection H, city parking lots, parking decks, and paid on-street parking spaces within the Entertainment District parking zone. For parking in the West Avenue lot,
 South lot, East lot, North lot, Spring Street parking deck, and all paid on-street parking within the Entertainment District parking zone, the following parking fees are established and shall be required to be paid by the owner or operator of any vehicle parked in those spaces or lots.
 Okay, Jeff. Thank you, Mayor, Council. Currently event parking is conducted when the Walton Arts Center requests it and anticipates 600 patrons to attend one of their events. They've recently requested that that ticket threshold be lowered to 500 ticket sales. And in researching the relevant codes associated with event parking, they've requested that
 TO ACCOMMODATE THAT REQUEST, WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND TO ALLOW SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE EVENT PARKING CODE. SO SPECIFICALLY THIS PROPOSAL REMOVES ANY REFERENCES TO THE TICKET THRESHOLD, GIVES THE MAYOR THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE EVENT PARKING, IT ALSO REMOVES SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO THE
 parking lots where event parking can be held. So currently the ordinance restricts event parking to the West Avenue parking lot within the entertainment district. This proposal removes any specific reference to a lot or district so that it would apply. Event parking could presumably apply to the entertainment district or downtown business district.
 And then I guess the final thing I would note is that if this proposal does pass, there are no plans or expectations to conduct event parking in any manner other than we currently conduct it. We just view this as an opportunity to provide some flexibility in the code should the need ever arise. Okay. What questions do we have? Okay. What public comment do we have? Okay. I'm going to bring it back to the council. Okay.
 Sarah. May we suspend the rules and go to the second reading? Allen. Second. We have a motion to second to go to the second reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Eddie. Yes. Tennant. Yes. Bench. Yes. Clitor. Yes. Long. Yes. Gray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. An ordinance to amend Section 7258 Off-Street Parking Facilities Rules and Rates of the City Code to provide greater flexibility for event parking in city-managed parking facilities and to make technical revisions.
 Sarah. Move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Adela. I second. We have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Petty. Yes. Tenant. Yes. Batch. Yes. Leger. Yes. Long. Yes. Gray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Yes.
 In order to amend section 72.58 off street parking facilities, rules and rates of the city code provide greater flexibility for event parking and city managed parking facilities and to make technical revisions. Mayor Weill Any final comments from the council? Mayor Weill Mayor, I do have one question for our parking manager. Mayor Weill Okay. Mayor Weill I've just started using event parking and find it very convenient. Has it worked out for the city money wise too? Is that why you're wanting to encourage that?
 Sure, it does generate revenue for the city and offers convenience to both event goers and the general public who view it as a premium service when it comes to parking. Thanks. Okay. All right, any final comments from the council? All right, Sandra, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you all. That concludes our business. What announcements do we have?
 Yes, Mayor and Council, we have several announcements. First, the city is still seeking nominations for our City of Fayetteville 2017 Historic Preservation Awards. The deadline is Friday at 5 p.m. So if you haven't nominated your top historic preservation recognition areas, please do so. The information can be found on the city's website.
 Tomorrow night, between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. at the Ozark Natural Foods Community Center room,
 Ozark Regional Transit has a public input session for a rapid bus transit pilot program, a study that's being funded with the Walton Family Foundation. This is an input meeting for Fayetteville citizens to participate and provide your comments into this particular idea. Again, that's tomorrow, Wednesday, from four to 7 p.m. at the Ozark Natural Foods Community Room.
 THURSDAY, I KNOW ALDERMAN LONG AND ALDERMAN LATOUR ARE PROBABLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. 3 30 P.M. ON THURSDAY IS THE CLABBER CREEK TRAIL RIBBON CUTTING AND TOUR OF A LARGE TRAIL EXPANSION IN OUR WARD 4 WEST FAYEVILLE AREA. PARKING WILL BE ALONG RUPPEL ROAD AND THE EVENT WILL BE HELD AT THE UNDERPASS OF RUPPEL ROAD ON CLABBER CREEK TRAIL BETWEEN EDGEWATER AND TIM'S STREETS.
 Again, that's 3.30 on Thursday.
 A COUPLE OF TRAFFIC THINGS TO PUT INTO YOUR DETOUR PATH. ONE IS COLLEGE AVENUE. APRIL TO NOVEMBER, OUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ON THE COLLEGE AVENUE IMPROVEMENTS BEGINS. PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IN YOUR COMMUTE AS WE BEGIN TO WORK ON PHASE TWO OF THE COLLEGE AVENUE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH ARE THE WEST SIDE OF COLLEGE AVENUE BETWEEN NORTH STREET AND MAPLE STREET.
 Also, this week between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m., milling and overlay work is taking place on the east side of North Street between College Avenue and Mission. So that street will be closed during those periods. So you need to plan another detour for that east connection point than what you normally
 SATURDAY, APRIL 8TH FROM 9 TO 11 A.M. AT KESSLER MOUNTAIN REGIONAL PARK AT THE CONCESSION STAND BUILDING NEAR THE SOCCER FIELDS. THE PARKS DEPARTMENT IS TAKING A PARKS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT INPUT COMMENTS FROM CITIZENS. THIS IS THE THIRD AND FINAL INPUT SESSION. ONE WAS HELD YESTERDAY.
 One was last week and this is the third one to provide input on the parks capital improvement projects plan for 2018 through 2022. In an effort to be better communicators for our citizens that certainly live around university sporting venues, we want to remind citizens that the baseball season has begun and that the University of Arkansas.
 has approved fireworks for their baseball events. So if you live in the southern part of town near Baum Stadium, fireworks could be displayed.
 During, at the beginning of the event when the Razorbacks run on the field at the start of the game during the seventh inning stretch, whenever a home run is hit or after a Razorback win. And the first home weekend game is this weekend. So if you have pets who are bothered by that, please make preparations for that.
 And we'd like to thank the University of Arkansas for sharing that information and those dates with us so we could communicate to our citizens when they choose to do so. I can sit on my back porch and enjoy this. Let me make sure I've hit everything.
 I do want to ask citizens to save the date for the Community Development Block Grant photo reception, which is going to take place on April the 19th between 2 and 4 p.m. at the Fayetteville Senior Activity and Wellness Center. It's a chance to really see how your Community Development Block Grant money is utilized through the photo reception that's being conducted, and we invite citizens out to see that.
 Sorry, the Ozark Metro Freight Rapid Transit is actually going to . Okay. Well, there you have it. So mark your calendars for next Wednesday on the Ozark Rapid, Ozark Regional Transit Bus Rapid Transit Input Session.
 What other announcements do we have? Mayor, I actually have some good news from the Arkansas Supreme Court today about noon. They issued their mandate in a city hospital case, which officially actually ends the case. I don't think there's any more ways it can be delayed at this point in time.
 I would like to note for the record that there were 14 judges, including Circuit Judge Christy Beaumont first, who looked at what the city had done and what the hospital had done and determined that what we did was absolutely correct. We followed the Stone Deeds intent exactly as they were intended.
 PROPERLY AND LEGALLY. AND SO NOW THE CASE IS FINALLY OVER. THAT MEANS THE CLOSING OF THE CITY HOSPITAL LAND SELL TO THE LIBRARY CAN NOW GO FORWARD AND THAT PROJECT CAN GO FORWARD. SO WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS MANDATE JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE WASN'T SOME LAST SECOND ATTEMPT BY THE HEIRS TO FURTHER DELAY THE PROJECT. BUT WE NOW HAVE THE MANDATE IN HAND AND I WILL HAND OUT COPIES TO YOU. NEW SPEAKER. WONDERFUL. ANYTHING ELSE, Y'ALL?
 All right. Thank you. Real good work tonight. Thank you. We're adjourned.
