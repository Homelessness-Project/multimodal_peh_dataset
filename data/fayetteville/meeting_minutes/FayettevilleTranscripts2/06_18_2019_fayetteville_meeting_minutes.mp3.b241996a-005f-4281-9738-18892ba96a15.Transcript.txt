Sonia, would you please call the roll? yes yes yes yes yes yes yes all right thank you all Thank you, Mayor and Council. I appreciate you all doing a side visit with me. That was wonderful. Thank you again for that. And thank you for your patience with this process. I've given you all additional information that shows all the tree preservation proposal summaries that we've had so far. The one he read was Proposal A, which was the original one. And then we had met with the applicant last Thursday, and that was Proposal B, which showed a limited development on that front portion of the property. And we did present that to the applicant, and that proposal was rejected. Now, yesterday, the applicant did make another proposal, which included – it was Proposal C, which included – the two new proposed tree preservation easements along with payment into the Tree Espro fund for $22,150. And then yesterday after our site meeting, let me know if that proposal D is correct. That was the information that I got from the members after the site visit was what you all thought would be an excellent proposal. So... With these four proposals is where we're at with this particular project. I did speak with Ken Easton, a former urban forester and current City of Fayetteville employee, and he did say that he had given permission in 2014 for some tree removal on site on the western portion. It was only a few trees, not as many as we witnessed on site, but there was some approval of tree removal. And then, let's see. For today, we are actually recommending or asking the council to table this project until July 16th so we can visit with the applicant further, and he also is in agreement with this proposal as well. Okay. All right. I'd be happy to answer your questions. I think that's a good idea. What questions do we have, council? Do we have any public comment? This is obviously going to be tabled until July 16th. Okay, seeing none. I'll bring back to the council Sarah I mean that we table this until July 16th as per the applicants request Second we have a motion second to table this item until July 16 any comments on it or anything I would like to thank the council for doing the site visit and I think it was apparent when we were there that there is there are some ecological services being provided by that site and a lot of that has to do with the tree canopy and the birds in that area. But I do think that the site could benefit from some eyes on it in the form of some limited development. So I really want to encourage the applicant to consider the city council's proposal. That's proposal D, because I think that based on the conversation, that was about the extent of any type of development that would be acceptable there. And I feel like that's almost even pushing it. So I do hope that in the future we'll see better maintenance of this lot. There was a lot of trash on site. And when we have a tree preservation area, that's not necessarily meant to be leave the trees and forget about the lot. But we do have to have ongoing maintenance in order to keep that a safe and habitable and healthy wildlife habitat. Thanks. Okay. Now, if you're interested in history of that, go back to April of 2001, and we have a large-scale development that was appealed by Council Member Santos and brought to the full council. That was an interesting discussion that Tuesday night. The vote, I remember, was 5-3, 2-0. support the appeal. So, but that's, go back. I've got these if you want some copies of those and the large-scale development that went with it. All right, let's move along to new business. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yep. Any final comments on the table? All right. Senators, please call the roll. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you all. Under new business number one, a resolution to approve an agreement with Food Recycling Solutions, LLC, for the hauling of organic compostables and recyclable material in the city of Fayetteville. Peter. Mayor and council, good evening. City of Fayetteville currently has nine franchise agreements similar to the one in... That's before you this evening with private haulers that operate inside our city limits. Eight of those haulers haul trash and construction material in 20, 30 and 40 yard roll off containers. And one of those nine haulers, Food Loops is their name, hauls recyclables and food waste and organic material and brings the organics to the city of Fayetteville. This agreement is with Food Recycling Solutions, so we would add one additional hauler who would haul mainly food waste and compost to the City of Fayetteville's facility. Our understanding is that they intend to work with Food Loops and offer them the ability to haul food waste in larger containers, in trucks similar to what we use for our compost services to supply. for yard debris collection And that would make their food collection more efficient all the food waste and organic material collected In the city would would be brought to our facility and would be included in our diversion reporting per the contract The applicant would pay 5% of their gross revenues received for providing these hauling services. The term of the contract is for one year with two additional one-year terms available. And then I also believe that Michael Krause from Food Loops and Richard Imes from Food Recycling Solutions are here and can help answer any questions you all might have. Okay. What questions do we have from the council for Peter? yeah um peter we talked a little bit about this contract last week and i but there was some new news today out of the university and and some of their recycling ending up in landfills um so i just haven't had a chance in seeing that to go back and look at contract real close um i know that for the compost this requires them to deliver it to our facility yes so there'd be no risk of that Wondering off and going somewhere else, but this contract also includes authorization to haul commercial recyclables It does do we have a similar guarantee in the the recycle collection portion of that? I as far as where where the end products go yeah the end products recycling and products do not have to come to us but if they do not come to us then they have to provide reporting on where they go and what in markets that they wind up at and so that's very similar to the end market reporting that we provide on all of our recyclables so if they were to run into problems with recycling markets we would know about it very quickly we should yes thanks okay son Yes, thank you, Mayor. So I was – I'm really excited that we're going to add this. I think it will be really great for our energy plan and our waste diversion plan. What are the main challenges that you'll identify and how are we mitigating those? Just as – I mean, it's a new program, and we're trying to figure out how to handle this new amount of – it's a brand-new thing that we're doing. So you're asking about the challenges associated with the composting of the food waste? Yes. From – From our operational perspective, one challenge that we have definitely identified is the handling of the compostable materials, so the compostable plates and forks and cups, the food waste that we collect. from a couple of public schools, University of Arkansas, and we bring to our facility, we do not grind. And so those compostable materials wind up not breaking down very quickly in our process. But in our experience working with Food Loops on all the compost that they collect, they do grind their material. And so all those plates and cups and silverware all gets ground up into smaller bite-sized pieces and it does compost. So we actually see this privately hauled compost being brought to our facility as a little bit superior to the stuff that we are collecting and processing on our own. In addition, adding the food waste compost to our existing compost process, which is The bulk of the material is yard waste that's collected from residents in the city of Fayetteville and then yard waste that folks bring to us. Mixing the food waste with that yard waste speeds up our composting process, so it allows us to process more material more quickly on our limited two-acre concrete pad that we have at our facility. Thank you. Any other questions from the council on this? Tracy. Yes. So I have a quick question. So if there was not, if it was, if we had a similar situation that the university seems to have experienced, I mean, we're just, it was just reported today. I think it was started in February when they, when there was really diversion to the landfill, was not diverted to recycling. So that's quite a long time period to actually for it to be put out in the public forum. I'm sure they knew sooner, but still. Yeah. So with our contracts, with the city's contracts, how quickly would we know that there was an issue there that our recyclables ended up in a landfill or there was no market? We would know very quickly. The primary difference in the way we handle our recyclables and the way the university was handling their recyclables is they had mixed recyclables. So it's aluminum and plastic and other materials mixed together that they were sending to a processor to then separate into aluminum only, plastic only. glass-only streams to then be sent on to remanufacturers. And so in our process, we bring the materials in, they are separated into those various streams and shipped directly to the remanufacturers. And so unless an aluminum remanufacturer that we're selling an aluminum bale to all of a sudden decided that they couldn't handle that aluminum bale and had to landfill it instead of melting it down and turning it into aluminum. I can't imagine why they would buy it from us and then do that with it. They just wouldn't buy it from us, I think, if they didn't have the ability to utilize it. So I would think, just to answer your original question, we would know very quickly if there were an issue with any of the materials that we're selling. A week or two at the most? Yes, absolutely. Okay, thank you. Any other questions for Peter on this? Peter, did this go through the Water and Sewer Committee? This did not. This did not. Okay. Okay. All right. What public comment do we have on this? Everybody gets one term with five-minute duration unless city council by vote. and it passes that they give you more time, we will determine how much time that will be or they will. I'll keep your comments directed to me. Don't engage anybody on city council or in the public. Stay on topic. Please give us your name and address. Who'd like to address us on this? Yes. Hello, my name is Alex Shirley. I'm at 2620 West Arthur Hart Street here in Fayetteville. But I also would like to say that I'm here on behalf of Louise Mann, who I'm sure a lot of you people know. And she's at 629 Gray Avenue. And I'll just read her comments and list of questions and then I'll sit down. And I do want to say once again, y'all have actually addressed some of these questions. Nevertheless, I'm just going to kind of follow my script. So I apologize, but I'll keep it under five minutes. First, I would just like to say thank you for establishing a program to collect food waste from restaurants. Because of finances, restaurants are already committed to reducing and reusing. Soups can be made from leftover veggies, et cetera. So I would just like to say thank you for helping turn the restaurants non-reusable into a valuable product, which is compost, and that's wonderful. I would also like to thank you for handing out free compost bins to homeowners. Giving residents an opportunity to take personal responsibility is also a wonderful thing. Now I'll move on to the questions here. And the first question would be, is the city entering into a contract just for food waste composting or other recyclables going to be collected as a result of this contract? And if other items are to be collected, Louie would ask that the contract be amended to state clearly and specifically exactly what will be collected and how it will be collected. And the concerns are as follows. The resolution reads to approve an agreement with Food Recycling Solutions LLC. for the hauling of organic compostables and recyclable materials in the city of Fayetteville. And staff recommends approving a resolution with Food Recycling Solutions LLC for the hauling of organic compostables and recycling material in the city of Fayetteville. Now, number two of the contract states quite explicitly that this agreement excludes residential uses. However, there seems to be a contradiction throughout the rest of the contract, specifically in number three of that contract. It says Haller agrees and understands that it may only collect and haul organic waste for composting and recyclable materials. Haller may collect organic waste and recyclable materials from, and I quote, residential, commercial, and industrial activities. Seems to be a contradiction there. So the question here is will food solutions be collecting in residential areas as well as commercial areas? And will they be doing this in a single stream collection in residential and commercial areas? And that's obviously something that's very important to Louie, and it'll be discussed further here. The word recyclables is used again in number four. So again, I would just like to ask, does this include food waste or food waste and other recyclable materials? Yes. Number five states here that hauler agrees and understands that it shall be required to haul all organic waste collected in the city of Fayetteville to the Fayetteville recycling and trash collection facility for composting, which shall be counted towards city waste diversion goals. So the question here is, will the food waste composting take place only on city property? Okay. The reason I ask that is in number 6 and number 7. I won't read these two twice, but it says the supporting information shall be sufficient to demonstrate the accuracy of fee calculations, shall include the following information. Volumes of the recycling collected in tons by commodity, which obviously is not a commodity, If it's just food waste, there wouldn't really be different commodities. But with disposition by destination market for all source-separated recycling, for any approved non-source-separated program, the hauler shall submit to the city by June 30th on an annual basis copies of contracting with processing mills and three – For any approved non source separated program, the amounts and tons of recycling collected with Fayetteville with disposition by destination market. I guess my question here really goes to the fact that number five states that all of this will be taking place at the Fayetteville recycling and trash collecting facility. So it's interesting that it would include processing mills or contracts with processing mills if all of this is to take place. In the city, then there would be no need to have a processing mill disclosure in this. And so my question is, is the city moving into single stream collection? Non source separated can mean a dirty Murph, an incinerator, single stream, any number of these things. So I'm asking that the contract be amended to describe exactly what type of program you are committing the city of Fayetteville to. And then we would just like to state in the spirit of transparency, I ask that the contract be amended to state clearly what services this contract is referring to. I also request that the city pass a recycling transparency ordinance that allows any citizen to observe what is being dumped from any truck collecting recycling or compostables. That means both private or publicly owned trucks. Any honest person with experience in the recycling industry knows that single stream would never have taken off had communities had such an ordinance in place. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Well, we'd like to start answering some of those. Yes, please come up. Hello, my name is Michael Krause. I'm with Food Loops. We are a food waste solutions company based in Rogers. We started in 2017 and most of our focus is in Bentonville and Rogers, and we focus on commercial clients and helping them with food waste solutions. So to address some of those questions, especially the last one, so Richard Ems, is the owner of Food Recycling LLC. And his focus is to take over the things that we cannot haul, right? And that is food waste. And so he'll be working in a much bigger truck, seven and a half ton capacity, which makes us a little more professional in what we're doing. And again, we will not... be hauling recycling. Uh, it is food waste is what his truck picks up and he'll be taking to, to city of Fayetteville, uh, and dumping those loads there. Um, and, um, In terms of recycling, I think the only reason that recycling is on that contract is because Food Loops, we also do zero-waste solutions for events. So take, for example, the Walmart shareholders last week. For, what, 40-plus years, they've never recycled anything, and they've definitely never recycled food waste. Well, this year, we got involved, and we recycled several tons of food waste from there. And then we also took advantage of... because of how we do it, which we do separate our recycling on-site. We were able to capture, number one, PET bottles and cans as well, which we ordered a dumpster with the city of Fayetteville, who took those and went directly to your facility. So the only reason I think we would ever do recycling is for an event, and really that's food loops, that's not – Food Waste Solutions LLC. And in that case, we partner and report with the city of Fayetteville. Each month I send Brian Pugh a report on how much food waste we've taken. And then our recycling goes to your bins. If that happens, but his job is mostly on the recurring Side of things so those customers that would be in Fayetteville that would require Ben's coming every week Let me see what other questions were addressing. I think the rest of them may be Better if you were answering this. Oh and then on the residential piece we have no plans at all doing residential We're just doing commercial clients Okay uh do we have any yeah okay i i drafted this and i think this shows no matter how many sets of eyes look at a contract something can slip through what i would suggest in paragraph three is removing the reference to residential so that it would be actually you would remove recyclable materials and residential so it would say organic waste from commercial and industrial activities In paragraph four, we would remove the reference to solid waste and recyclables. In paragraph six, we could remove the language about volumes of recycling collected in tons so that it just mentions this is the organic waste documentation. Here's how much we owe you. And then we could remove paragraph 7 entirely because that covers recycling and if no recycling is going to be hauled, we can just remove that from the contract. So that would limit their activities to just the hauling of organic waste from commercial and industrial activities. Okay. I'm sure everybody's going to remember that. Yes, Sarah. Oh, I'm sorry. Matthew was. Oh, sorry. Matthew. Sorry. I got to looking at people instead. Blake, are you prepared to make those amendments tonight, or do you need us to wait a little while? I would rather redraft the contract and get it back to you next time. Understood. In that case, I move we table this resolution for two weeks. Okay. Well, let me make sure that everybody from the public has got to speak on this. I think – does anybody else from the public like to speak on this? We're going to table this for two weeks. Okay. Sir? I had a question about the – The possibility of, you know, like we have some plates and forks and utensils and things that can be composted. Do those count as food waste or the recyclables? I would defer to the experts on that. Could that ever be considered a recyclable is what I'm getting at. Yeah, I think we would include that in the organics. And that's not food, but we would call it organics and not recyclable. So with any amendments to make it food waste and organics in terms of what they're authorized to haul. And as this program possibly continues and we grow what we're – accepting, we can always modify the contract. Sure. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Kyle. I guess before we table it and move on, I'd be curious if the applicant is okay with us taking away the authorization for recycling hauling or if that is going to be a big impact to your planned operations. Yes. That's fine. That was actually the original intention was just food waste. maybe that kind of slipped through or the language was was there food waste is recyclable off material too so yeah just uh defining the language a little bit more is uh is fine and the original intention was just commercial as well not residential so yeah so so limiting it just organics won't hinder your ability to service events and deal with their other waste yes yes thank you okay anything else We have a motion and a second to table for two weeks, right? Is that correct? Or do you draft another contract? Yes. I need a day or so to make sure I'm doing it right. Run it past Peter. Two weeks should be able to. Two weeks would be sufficient. I think so. All right. We have a motion and a second to table for two weeks. Any discussion on that? All right. Saunders, please call the roll. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Number two, an ordinance to amend Chapter 33, Departments, Boards, Commissions and Authorities of the Federal City Code to expand opportunities for federal residents to serve on City Boards, Commissions and Committees. Kyle. Well, thank you, Mayor. Mayor, you need to read. Oops, sorry. Yes, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Buckle your seatbelts.

TWO, IN THE EVENT NO APPLICATION FOR A POSITION AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SPECIFIED DISCIPLINE IS RECEIVED, THE POSITION MAY BE FILLED BY ANY RESIDENT OF THE CITY. There you go. All right. Now, Kyle. Well, thank you for reading all that, Blake. It was supposed to be short and sweet until we realized how much of the requirements were repeated in all of the board and commission listings. So I appreciate your attention to cleaning that up for us. The current requirements for volunteering on most of our boards and commissions is simply to be a registered voter. residing in Fayetteville. And registered voter comes with a lot of other strings attached. There are about 53,000 registered voters in the city of Fayetteville and about 85,000 residents. So some of those are not eligible to register to vote for a variety of reasons, but most of them just haven't been adequately engaged yet. All of them still matter to our community. This ordinance will, like Blake read, it will allow any resident, not just the registered voters, to volunteer on most of the city advisory boards and commissions. When this was last discussed, I think over a decade ago, the conversation was that requiring people to register before they can serve in one of these positions might motivate them to register to vote and become engaged in the democratic process. I suspect it actually just stops people from applying. Okay. So I hope this change will allow folks who may be somewhat disillusioned by the electoral process to get involved in local government in a more accessible and specialized and personal way. That once they've seen the importance of the work that is done here in our city, that... that they'll be excited to uh to continue being involved in government um that we may encourage some folks to to register to vote because i can't imagine that once you're involved you'll pass up that opportunity there's still also still a lot we can learn from members of our community who are not eligible to vote and i think that their voices are valuable in many of the conversations we have since the decisions we make will impact them and their lives as well so that's i talked a little bit about it last last week and and that's what i'll add for now and i look forward to uh to your thoughts on it okay susan anything you want to add to this i know you're okay all right what questions do we have from council on this um are there any age requirements for applying did we just effectively remove that and are we okay with that think council member Petty mentioned that last week and that well not intentional I don't particularly have a problem with that I think that there's a lot of things we do that we could could involve our more mature younger residents in the conversation yeah I just want to think You guys, for everyone who's worked on this, I think it will expand our pool of applicants. I'm on the nominating committee, and I would love to see that pool grow. And so I feel like this is going to really give people an opportunity to take on leadership roles and see the diversity of the applicants grow. So I appreciate this work. I think if I heard correctly that and tonight's nominating report you had several unfilled vacancies even after After making appointments is that yes. Yeah, so so maybe this will Give us the opportunity to Mark I had to give this a lot of consideration of course, but I I do think that when we look at this, it does offer a lot of opportunity to people that otherwise are cut out of the process. I'm sure they've already mentioned that earlier, but I do feel that way also. I do have some reservation, but I let go of it, that you needed to be a registered voter. But there's so much more on the other side, if you try to balance it, that it's going to make it worth it in every way. And I think that what you have here is also a process where there's an application that's reviewed by every member of the nominating committee. And then they have an interview with the nominating committee. And so we have the integrity of the nominating committee also to be sure that these appointments will fill critical roles and bring critical skills that otherwise we might not have. the pool of applicants without this measure, so I heartily support it. Okay, what public comment do we have on this? Good evening. My name is Miriah Wright and I reside at 1819 Hunters Ridge here in Fayetteville. And I'm currently here today in my capacity as founding executive director of Arkansas United, an organization that does immigrant rights advocacy and we run five immigrant resource centers across Arkansas, including one just down the road in Springdale. And I'm here today to offer support for this resolution and to congratulate and thank the city of Fayetteville for their leadership. The last time I stood before you all was when you had your welcoming plan debated, considered, felt very fortunate to be part of that process as well in terms of lifting up this opportunity. And I'm here to attest we have now over 11% Latinx and Asians. here in our state of Arkansas, and yet less than 1% hold any sort of appointed or elected office. We have a deep opportunity here in Arkansas to be able to bring those voices to the table. And I can attest to that personally, having served just seven years in appointed office myself as the first Latina to the State Board of Education, a body which I chaired just recently. And I can say the conversation changes. when we have diverse voices around the table, but also the opportunity to present unique perspectives and also unique solutions. And I know that that's exactly what you all are seeking here in the city of Fayetteville. And I'm proud to be accompanied today by one of our members who would directly benefit. He's also... lives here in Fayetteville, a proud graduate of the University of Arkansas and someone who directly would benefit and be able to take advantage of this opportunity. And we know of many more individuals like himself. So I am here in the hopes that you all will give a positive vote to this effort and really open the opportunity for us in Fayetteville to be able to have a more inclusive democracy and help take our city to the next level. Thank you so much. Thank you, Maureen. Very much. Good evening, Mayor. My name is Andres Herrera. I reside at 32 East MLK Boulevard. I'm here just to offer my support for this measure. As Maria attested, I'm an immigrant to this community, and I can just feel how this would benefit not only people within this community, but be an example for the rest of the state. I came here in 2012 to pursue my career at the University of Arkansas. I've now graduated with a bachelor's and a master's, and I'm proud to be working here as well. And I'm just wanting to tell you, you know, you don't have to be a citizen to love this city, to fall in love with it and to enjoy everything that it has to offer. And I would hope citizenship doesn't become a barrier to be able to give back, to be able to help in whatever skill we have, because I've loved all of the seven years that I've spent here. And I would really like for you to pass this measure and be able to help members of my community as well. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Okay, I'll bring it back to the council. Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. I'll second that. Okay, we have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Who is the second? Mark. Oh, sorry. I didn't push the right button. Kimmy. Yes. Eddie.
 Yes.
 Swanson.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes. Mayor, we might want to hold this one more reading. I think there may be some concern that we could be intruding on the Arkansas Sanctuary City statute. You know, all we've said in here is that payable residents can apply. But I think... we at least need to look further into whether, you know, the Sanctuary City law says, I think one of their definitions of a Sanctuary City policy would be one that grants to illegal immigrants the right to lawful presence or status within the municipality in violation of federal law. While I don't think this does that, this statute grants to any resident of the state of Arkansas the right to ask the Attorney General whether she believes that our policy is in violation of the statute. And if she believes that it's in violation of the statute, she has the power to withhold all of our discretionary funding from the state of Arkansas. We could appeal that opinion. It would go to the Pulaski County Circuit Court. And I certainly feel more confident in our ability to defend it at that point. But I don't know how long that would withhold funding from the city. So I think maybe we need to pause it a little bit and take a closer look at whether we think that would be in violation. Because I don't have a lot of faith in our Attorney General on this particular issue. Do we have any estimates on what the funding could be? I thought Paul was here. Paul, do you have any idea what the funding would be? That would depend on how broadly they interpreted that, but I would say because we're looking at motor fuel tax, we're looking at potentially the sales tax turn back from the state. We could be talking up to $6 million. Okay. All right. Kyle. Well, I appreciate the enthusiasm in moving forward, though I would agree that I think we need to hold it at least two more weeks because this is kind of a big change, and we didn't hear any opposing views here tonight, and I would certainly like to leave the floor open to that in case this makes the news and somebody wants to talk to us about it. So I'd – Did not have the intent to rush it. The reason it's happening now is so that we can go three readings and still make it to enactment in time for the next cycle of interviews. So I'm in no rush at this point. I will say I believe this stopped short of the Sanctuary City bill, and I believe the Sanctuary City was unconstitutional anyway. But I would rather not have to find out. You'd like to hold it a couple of weeks? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Sure. I'd like to just clarify that this isn't necessarily about just expanding to undocumented immigrants, but this also opens up for for youth to serve. They are our citizens of the future and there are some really bright high schoolers that I've encountered lately that would be, I would really welcome their perspectives on our boards and committees. This is about legal residents, green card holders, our visiting professors, that would be tremendous assets on our boards. This is about students who may not be registered to vote in Arkansas, maybe they're registered at their parents' house in Texas, but they want to participate in their community here where they're going to university. I just think about all those Fulbright scholars that come here from other communities and other countries and places in the world that have so much to offer, and it would be great to have them get a place on the board. So I just want to clarify that this is really about expanding opportunities to all types of non-registered voters. Thank you. Shalom. Yeah, absolutely for this. I'm still worried about kind of the age thing. Is there any chance that if... there's a recommendation that comes from a committee and there's somebody that is not of the legal status of being 18, that that could be challenged. Any decisions that we make later on, that's my only concern. As far as age? Right. Some decision that city council makes that they could challenge it based on a recommendation from somebody that is not 18 or older. I don't. I don't believe there are any – even the state-authorized boards and commissions don't have an age requirement. You know, the six that we've exempted here have citizenship or, you know, you must be a qualified elector. But don't those – don't they have voting requirements, which would be an age requirement? Which – The ones you mentioned. Yes, the ones that are excluded. No, the – The ones before that you mentioned, I forget which ones. Oh, the ones that we've listed? No, those don't have specific age requirements. Okay. I might just add for the council and the history. The city council used to have a youth advisory committee, and it actually had over half the committee were youth members below the age of 18, because how do you get advice as policy makers from youth without having youth involved? And so there haven't actually been any challenges legally to that. Because these are advisory committees, the people making the decisions on policy are meeting the requirements that you have to meet when you register to run for office. Cool. Thank you. I was on that committee. I got too old. No, it was a really good committee. We got a lot of input from students and stuff around the city. Tracy. I think this is a really wonderful ordinance that we're discussing tonight, and I really hope it doesn't evoke the sanctuary bill that was passed this past legislative session. I just wanted to comment that we had a terrific applicant for one of our committees. who was delighted that she was finally able, she actually hit her 18th birthday, and was so delighted to be able to apply to be on the committee. And I'm pretty confident that she would have applied at 15 or 16. So there are youth out there that want to get involved and represent our city and participate in our process even before they're able to vote. So thank you, Kyle and others, for all the effort to bring this to our attention. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I'd like to call Maria Rice back up to the stand. I think she's one of the few experts in the state and certainly in the region on this issue, and I'd be curious if she has a comment that's relevant to this discussion. Okay. Thank you so much, Councilmember Petty, and I apologize. I'm just physically not in the country in two weeks. And my nonprofit led all of the testimony in regards to SB 411, and we've subsequently been meeting with the governor's office, including as recently as just last week. And so what we can share is that there's a memo from the governor's office in regards to SB 411, in which he outlines that he's specifically talking about law enforcement. That was the intention of the bill. There was, because of the nature of how the bill was debated at the end of the session, there was not time for amendments. And there was an urgency to try and get this passed. And so the governor has also requested on behalf of the sponsors and the sponsors have committed, as he has put in writing, to adjust the bill because even within law enforcement and interactions between law enforcement and immigrant community, the governor confirms our concerns around racial profiling of the immigrant community. And the lack of due process that's listed in there. But we also are in active conversations with the Attorney General's office as well as just in general the rules promulgation process. And the Governor's office has affirmed for us there will be no rules promulgated. And at this time, the Attorney General's office has not even created a complaint process around this. nor anticipates taking any swift action because it is anticipated that the next opportunity of the legislature, they want to see amendments to SB 411 before any enactment is taken or actions are taken on behalf of the state. So again, this is specifically indicated and where as immigrant rights advocates, we continue to have concerns with SB 411 in regards to law enforcement. It is a bill about law enforcement and their engagement with the immigrant community and in regards to them asking about status. And it is not about something that would necessarily this would imply or be engaged. If it was, you also have the affirmation of a group of ours that we're working with national organizations to pursue any lawsuits if any action was taken in regards to SB 411, just because we believe so strongly that... that there's amazing work going on at the local level throughout the state. You all are one of 13 cities who have signed welcoming proclamations and have taken efforts to try and outreach to the community. And it is not the intention, and the governor does not want to see the intention of this being undermined. And so I think it's a more specific context, but a lot of SB 411 was just confused because of the nature of the debate. and essentially confusion around the role of local government in enforcing national immigration law. But the governor, as I said, committed to the concerns around that, did issue a letter that we're glad to share to the council if you all are of interest in seeing that. Thank you. Thank you very much. So I would, I'm hopeful that with the information provided by Ms. Raitham in the governor's office and the attorney general's office and in particular with respect to any documentation that goes to the legislative attempt. I'm hopeful and optimistic that some kind of a codifier's note or memo might be presented at the next city council meeting so that this ordinance does not have to be substantially amended. That's a good point. Kyle? I would definitely like to see the letter from the governor, as well as any other written documentation that may exist from those meetings with him that might support that statement. Okay. JUST TO CIRCLE BACK AROUND TO COUNCILMEMBER SKOGGIN'S QUESTION ABOUT AGE, JUST A QUICK REMINDER THAT EVEN ONCE THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE BRINGS FORWARD THEIR SLATE, THEY'LL BE ABLE We all still get to vote on every applicant. And while we normally do that as a package deal, there certainly have been times where one applicant has been pulled off for additional discussion. So I think there would be plenty of opportunities, whether it's age or some other reason might be a concern that gives a council member pause if we don't – don't agree with the nominating committee's decision with the applicants that they received, I think we would have plenty of off-ramps. Okay. Okay. I just want to be clear, I'm not concerned about young people making decisions. I'm worried about us going through a process and having it taken away for an issue. I absolutely want people at a younger age to be involved. If you look at the founding fathers, they weren't very old. Most of them, almost all of them, are probably younger than me. So I understand that there's value for people that are way younger than me. So thank you. I totally agree with that because everybody seems to be younger than me these days. Anyway, but I do appreciate it. The reason that we brought the welcoming plan to begin with is to get more diversity on our committees. And that's something that I was very proud that this council passed by unanimous vote. So we have, and I agree with what Council Member Marsh said when we talked about, you know, we have people that are in refugee camps. It's been 17 years average of being in a refugee camp just to get into the system and get to this country, to be a part of this place. So our intent is when we brought the welcoming plan was to give people, you know, it gives people a little bit of hope when they don't even think they have a prayer sometimes. And that's important that we stand for that. And diversity on our committees, I totally agree with everything that's been said here. I do think we need to wait a couple of weeks. I'd like to see that letter from the governor myself. I certainly want to see the letter from the governor. That would be suitable for framing. I would love to see it. So I guess we'll hold it right here for a couple of weeks, and then we'll look at it again. All right. Let's move on. Thanks, everybody that attended. Was there any other public comment on this? I'm sorry. Did I close that off and all of this? All right. Well, thank you all. Yeah, Bob. I think. Bob Stafford, 547 Sash-Termin. I forget what ward I'm in. One. I'm in one. There you go, Bob. I just want to say that I totally support this. I probably won't be here in two weeks, and there might be some naysayers here in two weeks. So I want to make sure you have at least one more voice that says thumbs up. I think it is good that you're waiting the two weeks because we know Fayetteville. I know you all are going to vote for this. You're going to pass this, and that's the right thing to do. But we've got to let those voices, those sourpusses, we've got to let them be heard. Because if you don't, you know it's going to come back and bite you, and they're going to – say what they always say and and so I think it's a wise move what you're doing and but I want you to know that that uh if I'm not here in two weeks that you had another yay if you get a bunch of days in a couple weeks thank you thank you Paul I do all right so we will hold it for two weeks I I know uh We will certainly want to be transparent and hear from everybody. Just to clarify, we voted for the second reading, so will we be holding it for the third reading then in two weeks? Yeah, and then we'll be ready for the third reading in two weeks. Thank you. All right. Everybody good? Thank you all. All right. Number three, a resolution to approve Federal Police Department policies 1.3, 1.1, 1.3, Use of force, 12.1.1, organizational structure, functions and direction, 26.1.1, disciplinary matters and warrants procedures, and 41.1.1, patrol. Good evening, Mayor, Council, Mike Reynolds, Deputy Chief of Police. What you have before you is four policies that you previously approved. We have a few amendments to it. The large majority of the amendments are just wordsmithing. It's just to improve the clarity and the flow of the policies. I'll just take an opportunity to kind of go over the significant changes in each policy. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. First of all, the use of force policy. The biggest change that we had there, we added an expanded section for on de-escalation of force. That came from a recommendation from President Obama's 21st Century Policing Task Force report. Then we removed a section on officer-involved shooting. It was incorporated, if you remember, about a year and a half ago into its own policy, officer-involved shooting policy that we brought before council and you approved. So that was the reason that we removed it from the use of force policy. And then we also added some more direction to our officers for storing firearms off duty. We have take-home vehicles. We have approximately 10 that you've approved through the council. And so we wanted to make sure that we gave our officers direction on how they stored vehicles off duty. So moving on to the organizational structure, you may or may not remember back in January, we took our IT, our Police Information Technology Division, and merged it with the city's IT TO MAKE OUR SERVICE MORE EFFICIENT. IT'S PROVED TO BE MORE EFFICIENT SO WE'RE JUST MOVING THAT ORGANIZATION FROM UNDERNEATH THE POLICE OVER TO THE CITY I.T. PORTION. UNDER THE DISCIPLINARY MATTERS AND AWARDS PROCEDURES WE ADDED A SECTION ON WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS. WE DID THAT TO MIRROR CITY POLICY. WE ALSO DID THE SAME THING WITH GRATUITIES. We had a section in there where officers couldn't accept gratuities, but as the chief mentioned at the agenda session, we consistently and were very appreciative of our citizens that bring cookies and cakes and things like that to the police department. So we wanted to make sure, and we worked with our city attorney to make sure that the gratuity section mirrored that of our city policy as well. And then lastly, the last section that I wanted to highlight was our patrol policy. We added a section in there that allows our officers to utilize their lights and siren whenever they're responding to a call and they encounter traffic congestion. Before they weren't able to do that without supervisor approval, so now they have their own discretion to do that. And then we also added a section in there that allows our chief to immediately fill a specialized unit position. Before we added this section, we would have to post those positions and go through the interview process. And we'll continue to do that, and that's how we want to do business. But we may have a military deployment where maybe four or five of our officers get deployed to the Middle East for a year, and they come off of our SWAT team. And so we would have to fill those positions immediately to make sure that we didn't have a vacancy there. I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have about the policies. Okay, what questions do we have, Ike, on this? Okay. What public comment do we have on this? All right, seeing none, bring it back to the council. It's a resolution. Yeah, Mark, I'm new. If we accept the resolution, sir. Second, we have a motion to second to accept the resolution. Any final comments to the council? Sonnets, please call. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you all. Number four, an ordinance to approve Vacation 19-6664 for property located at 485 North Henson Avenue to vacate a portion of a general utility easement.

Mayor, the department is reviewing a large-scale development for mixed-use development at Martin Luther King and School. Through that process, it became evident that there is a spider web of rights-aways and easements that have historically collected on this parcel. You can see, get a better look of the extent of it. They're kind of interesting. No need was identified for these rights-of-ways in these months. There is a need for additional dedications, which the City Attorney described.

Number seven, a resolution to express the intention of the city council to work jointly and cooperatively with experienced federal to develop a scope of work and contract for the programming, marketing, operations, and maintenance of the Cultural Arts Corridor public spaces. Peter. Mayor and council, with the passage of bond funding in April of this year, design work on the Cultural Arts Corridor project is continuing. The City's Landscape Design Consultant, Nelson Byrd-Wolz, is currently working on design development documents for the major components of the Cultural Arts Corridor, including the Fay Jones Woodland, the Razorback Regional Greenway realignment, streetscape enhancements for West Avenue, and West Avenue Civic Space. The design development phase of the project is scheduled to be completed in early fall of this year. Construction is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2020. on the civic, excuse me, on the Fay Jones Woods adjacent trails and streetscapes. Construction on the civic space on West Avenue is scheduled to begin in 2022 after completion of replacement parking downtown. As I'm sure you all are all aware, the Cultural Arts Corridor Project will be a transformative change to downtown Fayetteville. It'll provide an opportunity for a wide variety of programmed and unprogrammed events and activities and learning opportunities. Fay Jones Woodland will incorporate sustainable stormwater elements, woodland restoration features, native plant materials, natural trails and viewing platforms, locations for acoustical performances, and opportunities for visual arts, stream bank restoration, and informal gathering places. The Civic Space on West Avenue will provide opportunities for informal gatherings as well as programmed events and festivals, much to the benefit of our downtown. It's important to begin planning now for the long-term management and operation of these public spaces through a comprehensive and holistic approach that will complement our design process. This includes the naming and marketing of the area, the development of the organizational assets for programming and operations of the Fay Jones Woodland and the Civic Plaza space, and the development of a long-term operations and maintenance plan so this space can be a thriving, contributing component of our downtown. Nelson Byrd Waltz and the City of Fayetteville believe that the design development phase of the project this summer is the opportune time to include an entity charged with programming these spaces so that they can begin working with the design team on providing insight and feedback as the design continues to progress. This resolution will enable staff to begin working with Molly Rahn and her team at Experience Fayetteville to develop a scope of work for programming, marketing, and operations and maintenance aspects of the project. and draft a contract for the services. Funding for the planning, design, and implementation and maintenance of these elements will be identified in a scope of work, which will be requested through a negotiated contract to be approved by you all at a future date. We're very excited to recommend that the City Council approve this resolution of intent for the City to begin working with Experience Fayetteville on the Cultural Arts Corridor Project. And I'd like to invite Molly Rahn up here to say a few more words about her vision for how the process would go. Thank you, Peter. It has been a pleasure to work this far with the city staff and Nelson Byrd Waltz on beginning the design process for the Cultural Arts Corridor. Programming in the context of a development like this involves planning specifically from the get-go for the various ways in which this space will be used. It the programming needs to address how the public will access and interact with the different parts of the corridor, what infrastructure and facilities need to be put in place now so that people are able to enjoy it the way that we have promised and set the expectation that they will be able to. and what activities they might be engaged in while they're there. So it is one thing to say that we are building a space for arts and culture and that we are building a space that supports the arts and brings those to our downtown. But if we don't know why we're doing that or what that means or what that looks like or how that manifests itself, I think it will be very difficult to live up to these expectations that we've set. So I've had several conversations with NBW up to this point, and they have focused their design efforts on designing a space that can support a large crowd, but also one that will not feel empty or underutilized when there is not a specific event happening. However, the specifics of how large events will be set up in this space and how they'll interact with the space hasn't really been thoroughly examined. And they would like more specific feedback. Also with public art, we have heard and said that we want, that NBW needs direction on the public art program. And I think defining what that looks like in the early stages is critical. One of the reasons that programming isn't yet as well developed as I believe it needs to be is because many of the early conversations that we had with stakeholders centered around parking. And while that was necessary and we needed to have those conversations and we got through those conversations and found a solution that we could implement, what that meant is there are still things that need to be defined and need to be discussed with regard to things that don't have anything to do with parking, things that will actually happen in the space once it's built. And I think it's critical to support the work of beginning programming design now because we want it to support the full range of uses that it is able to. Also, from a cost standpoint, if we go forward with a plan that doesn't adequately allow for programming needs, as you all know, the cost to retrofit that and to go back and do that. after the fact is much higher and much more time consuming than if you design it from the beginning. Also, NBW has said that while they feel excited about this project and have a great deal of confidence in our city team, they also want more specific direction in terms of planning for the programming. And I believe that that is all I have, unless you have questions for me. What questions do we have from the council? Thank you, Molly. It's good to know that you all have been engaged in it up to this point and that you're ready to kind of take leadership on it. Can you kind of describe for us your plan for how you're going to engage and include and accommodate artists in the space, whether they're there currently or artists in the community who may want to bring into the space, and maybe also a note about festival organizers? Sure. Yes, absolutely. So what you did was already name two important stakeholder groups that we know it's critical to engage with one being artists, two being festival organizers. And then I would also add that our existing cultural institutions that border this corridor being the Walton Arts Center and Theater Square are also critical to be engaged in this conversation from the get go. And so if you're asking me the question of how specifically I would... incorporate artists and artists' works in the corridor, I think that's a conversation that I want to ask the artists. For one, how do they see themselves fitting into this process? And those... Sorry, I'm more interested in how you're going to include the artists in the conversation about the way their art gets used. Yes, absolutely. So I think what... It is my intent to hold specific stakeholder sessions. I know we have already done some of those. I think another round of those. And I think that's where we start. and then I think from there we develop a pathway going forward after that point but I think it's critical that artists be brought to the table from the onset. Thanks. You're welcome Teresa Thank you for speaking up tonight and nice to meet you. I haven't seen you around, but we haven't actually met. So this may be a little bit of an off-the-wall question and maybe you're not the right person to answer it, but I'm wondering have there been discussions about situations like security? Is that going to be part of your discussion with the large events? Is that going to be kind of included in that or is that a different group that's going to address those kinds of concerns? I think that's a both and question rather than an either or question. So absolutely, festival organizers are already that's already something that we think about when we put on large scale community events. And so I think that. There will be some great feedback and some great data that comes out of conversations with festival organizers that we can share with the designers and also that can be shared back with me as we think about how to manage this space and develop a plan to manage the space going forward. I also think that I don't want to speak for Peter, but I also know that he's had several conversations. even back when we were selecting the architect to think about how they might plan for security, because it is something that unfortunately has to be top of mind for everyone. I have another question on a similar vein. I've heard a lot of concerns, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but several concerns about what happens after hours. So the security of that space after hours, and I'm wondering if that's also included within a design discussion and organizing. So I don't know that I would say that it ... More so than being included in a design discussion. I think it's absolutely included in an operations and maintenance plan, which is what I want this resolution is designed to do is for me to be able to work with the city to develop that. But yes, I think an appropriate O&M plan has to account for, you know, when is it open? How late is it open? What's your security? How do you allow for? for those issues that you raise. So I think you're reiterating the very reason why we need to develop this plan, because those questions are important. Mike, you might want to address some of this. Absolutely. Before Deputy Chief Reynolds comes up, I'll just say that security has definitely been top of mind beyond just the times when the space is programmed and providing a security presence when it's unprogrammed. We've been thinking about lighting, cameras, keeping eyes into the space, creating – not trying to create spaces that are inherently unsafe because they're not safe. accessible or not well lit. And I'm sure Chief Reynolds has experience with policing those types of spaces and can speak to some of that as well. Thanks Peter, thanks Mayor. We've been working with Peter and his crew, the police department, and he reached out to us, I think it's been three or four weeks ago, and asked if we had a member of our department that we could put in touch with his division. And so we have several officers, specifically within our community oriented policing division, that are CEPTED certified, which is Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design. And that's what we've been working on. How do you design a building? How do you design a facility with lighting, with landscaping, to try to make it less attractive for crime? And that's what we're working on, and I think Peter kind of touched on that. Thank you. That's terrific. Thank you so much. You're welcome. All right. Sir. Thank you. Molly, when you were talking about the stakeholders on site, I didn't hear you mention the Community Creative Center. And we had a council tour there last night, and they expressed a lot of dismay about not being engaged in the process to this point. And I'm hearing a lot of those concerns from other artists in the community. How do you intend to dive deeper than we did in the initial citizen engagement process and really make connections in the creative community so that our local artists are benefiting? Yes, I'm glad that you brought that up and in no way were the entities that I named earlier meant to be an exhaustive list of people that we work with. And I know Barb and her career at Community Creative Center, they've been a recipient of A&P funding for several years and do excellent work. And so absolutely need to be engaged in that conversation. And I think I don't know if I would characterize it as necessarily going deeper. I mean, I think that the community engagement sessions that the city has already had were excellent. I think that there is a need going forward to host another round that are more specifically tailored to programming that we are really able to rein in. Because there is a whole universe of topics that we could bring up. And I think that we need to put some guardrails around that. The purpose of this conversation is about programming. We know you have concerns about parking. We know you have concerns about X, Y, and Z, and those are all valid concerns, but that's not what we're going to talk about today. And I think that we can design a program like that that does leave room for more people, specifically artists, arts institutions, and event organizers to have their voices heard. If I could interject something because I feel like we've kind of thrown Molly at the podium and this discussion really came from the mayor, myself as the chief of staff, our team on this project, the Cultural Arts Corridor. I think the reason that you even have this resolution in front of you today is because it is clear to me that we do not exist the expertise on the city staff to develop the kind of programming or programming entity that will be needed to have this be the vision that everyone has in their head. You know, our parks department might do maintenance, but they do maintenance of ball fields. Our horticulturists do it of certain flower beds. We, when we look and travel to look at projects around the country before we ever selected our architect designers for this design excellence grant, we saw very specialized, very well landscaping and maintenance associated with this, water features that had very different requirements in the maintenance and operation aspect of it than you would see at a typical city pool or a splash pad, as an example, or landscaping that was very different. Other venues, technology and at the use of lighting and wirelessness and video and things that just don't typically exist within our everyday operating and maintenance environment. So one to I mean the thing about this is none of this is going to be free just like it wasn't free to build this park We're going to be paying the A&P if they're the entity that comes out of this that begins to coordinate and create this programming arm or whatever entity they determine through their expertise that needs to be put in place. We are a partner in that. We're not 100% partner, but we're a partner because when we look at these projects across the country, they have private involvement. They have public involvement. They have... event venues where people are bringing an event and their infrastructure to operate within our canvas, if you will, that are also all a part of this. We want to make sure, number one, while this is in front of you, is that we don't fail that fantastic vision that people have for this corridor. And while a lot of people think about programming as it relates to, um, the Civic Plaza. I'll use that. First of all, the other part of this is to market it because how exciting is Civic Plaza? Not very. And we're hoping to come up with some great fantastic branding and naming that makes this corridor even more nationally known. But before we do our plaza, we do have a Fay Jones Park that's going to be coming on board that also has stakeholders around it with the library, our downtown entertainment district. There are a lot of things that are coming into place in this. And so when we talk about brainstorming who all should be involved, that's part of this task. When we talk about what the scope will be include, it's part of this task. It's... identifying who's going to do what. So from a maintenance and operation perspective, while the city, I think the perception is, is we're going to maintain the corridor ourself. We may provide the maintenance and operating dollars to do that as a part of our ongoing operation plan, or we may contract it to be done if it's so specialized that our workforce needs aren't able to handle it in the way that it's handled. Um, I also think we've talked about in this scope, the ability to look at the overall funding of this project. So, um, When we look at this with all these various places around the country, we see the city or municipality involved. We see private foundations involved. We see corporate sponsors involved in funding. It's not just one of those entities. It's a partnership of those entities, just like we have a partnership in Theater Square and a partnership in the Walton Arts Center and a partnership in the Fayetteville Public Library. So – We've asked Molly because when we think about these things politically, when you pick a group that you want to bring forward to lead or facilitate this kind of discussion, everything turns political here. If we picked, I'm just going to pick somebody that we didn't consider. If we picked the Walton Arts Center, why don't we pick them over Theatre Square or any other performing arts entity and it's their front door and so how will they be non-biased? Well, the thing about the Advertising Promotion Commission is it's a governmental entity created by taxes. It works with all of these groups. It has skin in the game to make Fayetteville the place to come. And they are going to help us market it long term as a part of the overall plan just like they've done with Pride Weekend last weekend, Bikes, Blues and Barbecue, First Thursday or other events that they've taken on. What we need is programming expertise for this type of venue. We need them to help collaborate that, them to come forward and say, here are the consultants or the tasks or things that we're going to need, and here's the participation aspect from the city, so that we can also plan for that from a budgetary perspective. I'm sorry to go on and on and on, but that's the discussion that we've had with Molly while we've asked her to lead that. We trust her. We trust her team. We trust the involvement of them to facilitate a lot of partners, people who have felt left out. or felt like that maybe we didn't outreach. And it's not just those. We've heard from other foundations that aren't the Walton Family Foundation, well, we would like to participate, or we fund these agencies, but we don't know what you're doing. That's the discussion that this kind of overall effort allows us to do. And, you know, to Molly's credit, she's already reached out with support from her leadership team to do some preliminary work just to say, what do we have to do to get started? And then there's going to be a bigger plan to come back about what we have to do to really implement and move this forward. So, you know, one thing I don't want to be misleading about in here is, The budget on this is it's not a no budget. It says budget impact none It's none to ask them to help us develop a scope But it's not none When they come back and say we want to hire these groups and we want to do these things and this is something Think about these large cultural amenities Crystal Bridges didn't open and then decide what to do with this programming it worked years it had an office on the square and The Amazium, same thing. You know, we're developing a venue that requires the time to develop it so it's as fabulous as we all want it to be and that our citizens vote in. And that's why we're having to start now. Okay. Sarah? I guess just what I'm looking for here is a commitment to a deeper engagement with the local artist community. Okay. That being kind of the independent artists and creatives, I feel like the larger organizations had more of a role in defining the initial scope of the project. But the consensus I'm hearing from the community is that the creatives were not adequately engaged and still have a lot of concerns that they will not continue. have a place in the success of this project. And so that's, that's where that is coming from. Sure. I recognize, and I think my, I know my team recognizes as does the leadership of the A&P commission recognizes that we, we need everyone to adopt i mean we need our stakeholders to feel um not only like they're okay with this but also that they're celebrating it and that they are engaged in that deeper level and so that is a commitment that i can make to you but i would also um appreciate specifically your help in doing that because i know that you being an artist yourself also have those relationships and so i could see myself really leaning on you to also help make that happen and i'd like that sure And to follow up with that, you can lean on me as well. Yes. The Creative Economy Action Group has 387 members, which came out of the Fayetteville Forward Group from 2009. And there are still people posting on that group. And I've actually been asking them about trying to revive a regular meeting time. So I would love to coordinate to help you with that. Thank you. you know, as much as you can connect with those artists, find out, you know, make it a platform so that you can ask any questions you need to. And we can just utilize the platform digitally, virtually. If you have a question you would like to ask the artists, then you can just post it right there and you'll get direct feedback. So I want to let you know about that. And then I'd love to help with other venues as well because there are many, many, many arts groups that we can activate via social media. Thank you. What other questions do we have? All right, what public comment do we have? I know, I can read. It says programming, marketing, operations, and maintenance. I advocated hard for the cultural arts, I shouldn't, that was, it was placed however, sorry. I advocated really hard for the cultural arts corridor as a way to access arts for people that are in need and people that may not be able to afford to be able to pay for those private connections to being able to go to the Walton Arts Center or the Theater Squared. And so I think it's important work that we're doing. I also want to take an opportunity to say that housing, we have create opportunities for attainable housing twice on the city plan 2030. That's my favorite, by the way. that it's on that particular slide twice. I know that the city staff has done a great job with city plan 2040 and working on 2050, all of those things that talk about housing. And I think that if we have this conversation going on about infill and this conversation going on about housing, and then we have this beautiful cultural arts corridor, and we don't look for creative ways to infuse housing in that and look for creative ways to be able to incorporate, whether that's on top of a parking deck, if that's liner buildings, whatever that is, we're going to miss. And people are really concerned. 52% was not a slam dunk. 52% says people are a little bit nervous about this. We trust you. But don't forget, and I know you guys showed up and I love that you guys, when you went on the Lewis lot tour yesterday, I was able to kind of hijack the tour and show you around Lewis Plaza. I really do feel all the love of city council. But I feel it's important to go on record to say, where are we putting housing in the cultural arts corridor? How are we going to be really creative and innovative? When you're creative and innovative, it may be bumpy. as I can attest. from buying an old motel um but i can assure you that um together we can really figure this out so please don't let that escape your mind um and i'm excited about um the amp leading this effort so thanks would you please introduce yourself for the record we all know who you are i'm so sorry thank you so much sondra i'm angela belford and i live at 4734 mays drive which is actually outside city limits but i'm the fayetteville housing authority executive director thank you sondra i apologize Okay, any other public comment on this? Yeah, please. Hi, I'm Eric Vigeux. I live at 1665 Radisson Drive in South Fayetteville. I was wondering if there was any plan to include public transportation and merge that into the corridor so that even those that don't really have a car to travel around Fayetteville moving forward will be able to enjoy it as well. I hope that's a good idea. Peter, do we have anything? I can say the location of the corridor is certainly at the nexus of several of our transportation options that currently exist. So it's right along a Razorback Regional Greenway, providing excellent access to active transportation opportunities. We also have several Razorback – transit routes that run through and along the corridor as well as a couple of Ozark regional transit corridors and routes that run through there we in addition have the Arkansas Missouri railroad that runs through that is primarily a freight corridor but I think you know there is potential There's been a lot of discussion in North East Arkansas about rail, and I think the future potential will always exist for that as a passenger transit corridor at some point in the future, and this project sets that up nicely. So I think while there are no specific and direct elements of the project that are specifically transportation focused, by its nature where it is located, it is very inclusive of transportation alternatives and options. Okay. And I might just add that the recent Route reorganization of Ozark Regional Transit specifically had stops related to this area. It's the beginning route for our College Avenue locations, both north and southbound. And those can change as our representative, now Peter, on the ORT board, can bring those requests forward as we set transit routes in the future and this project gets developed. Thank you. Any other public comment? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the council. Kyle. Well, I think that Don laid out a pretty clear case for the A&P being the right organization to take on this stage of the project. And I'm confident that Molly has heard our concerns about artist engagement and now considering transportation and how our future transportation network should be developed carefully considered as we choose the parking deck component of this project. So with all of that in mind, I make the motion to approve the resolution. Second. We have the motion and second to pass the resolution. Any final comments from the council? If you need any parking advice, I can probably help you with some of that. That's the last can. Anyway, thank you all. Sarah. Second. All right. All right. There's not any other discussion. May I? Sure. Nope. Nope. Okay. All right. So I'm just, please call her up. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. That concludes our business. What announcements do we have? All right, Mayor. We have quite a few tonight. So, um, First I want to start with, particularly based on the council's water, sewer, and solid waste committee, and your interest in the nutrient trading research advisory group, they have a meeting that was requested by the city of Fayetteville after that meeting that asked for the committee to consider a 60-day pause in the group's act on the Regulation 37. And they also asked for reconsideration of the regulations after TO BE DONE FOR THE CONCERNS RELATED TO BEAVER WATER DISTRICT AS A WATER PROVIDER AND THE COUNCIL'S CONCERNS. SO A MEETING WAS SET, IT'S FRIDAY, THIS FRIDAY, JUNE THE 21ST AT 1130 A.M. IT'S AT THE SPRINGDALE WATER UTILITIES COMMISSION ROOM WHICH IS WHERE THEY HAVE PERIODICALLY MET. There are only two agenda items on this meeting. One is to consider the approval of the minutes of their last meeting on May 10th. Well, actually three items. Second is to consider the City of Fayetteville's request for a 60-day pause of that regulation. And the last item is to set and confirm a date and time for meeting with this group and the Fayetteville and any other representatives to hear comments as it relates to the vision revisions of regulation 37 I say that because they're not planning and when I read their notes in their many committee that it's a committee meeting only to consider the pausing and The setting of a date for public comment. It is not actually taking public comment on those topics. I But we want to make people aware in case they want to go to show the interest. We just don't want them thinking I took off my time from work at 1130 to go and then they wouldn't let me talk. Because there will be a public meeting that addresses that when they set that. And Tim Nyander is our representative that has requested that. So, Tim. 1130 Friday, Springdale Water Utility Commission Room, and that's what their agenda items are. And then we'll have a meeting for the public to weigh in and provide their comments and our council members. Secondly, just want to remind that soon fireworks can be sold and used within the city of Fayetteville. This comes up every year around our Independence Day, Fourth of July holiday. There are also private events that get permitted in the city. that have been done. There have been three of those permitted so far for the upcoming July 4th holiday. But permitting fireworks stands, which allow people to purchase them, begins, we can begin taking those permits on June the 28th, so that's just a week away, uh, next week. And I also just want to remind citizens that on our website has the dates that fireworks are allowed. Um, the times of those and the types of those fireworks. And we'll do more of those announcements as we get closer to the holiday. But I wanted you, if you see tents start to appear and fireworks start to appear, it's because we're getting close to the time period where they can be sold within the city limits. And we will also try to do a very good job to make sure that we communicate the dates and times. So July 1st, 2nd and 3rd from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and July 4th from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. are the current ordinance allowed times. We will remind those again in the future for people who have pets and need to prepare and things of that nature. We also have some significant street closings. I want to encourage you to make sure citizens are looking at the news online and the cone patrol area that gives the street closures dates and times. Lafayette Street is another street that is going to be closed between the 24th of June and the 28th of June from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. It's a well-traveled street, particularly for our Ward 2 constituents and people who work. in the downtown area. So that information is online to check that out as well. And Lewis Avenue was closed today and tomorrow from 7 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. for drainage improvements in the Lewis area. So make yourself aware of that. If you're looking for a pet, this is a good time to adopt because the adoption fees for pet adoptions for dogs are is waived from June 17th through the 22nd. So check out the shelter and our great animals available for adoption. And this is a time that you can get those free of charge or with no adoption fee. Chief Dayringer's last day with the city. He's set to retire on June the 21st. Chief, you want to come up and say any parting words to the council? Yes. He has been fantastic. If you heard the mayor's speech the other day at our city staff reception, we couldn't be more thrilled. And we're so lucky that we got Chief Dayringer from Tulsa. Not only does our joke with him is he looks like that Monopoly man, but he's as smart as that guy walking around and did a fantastic job for our department. And so we wish him luck in his retirement, Chief. They called me that in Tulsa too, Don. Monopoly man. But I just want to thank you all for the opportunity. We've really enjoyed it here. We've found a permanent home here, and we look forward to staying here and look forward to enjoying our retirement and spending time with the grandkids. I get in a lot of trouble with them. But that's what grumpies are supposed to do. My new identity will be grumpy. We're Grammy and grumpy to the grandkids. So I'll be grumpy the rest of my life. But thank you all. I've really loved working here with everybody. Thank you, Gene. I would like also to add that... And if you heard my comments yesterday, 10 years ago, Chief Dayringer was the last applicant on the list. And I thought, well, I'm going to hire such and such and so and so. And he came through the door, and I thought, well, I wonder how much he's got here. And within five minutes after the interview, I knew he was going to be the next chief of the city. And I had three goals. and i said i want you to take this department to the next level i want the best trained i want us to be nationally and state recognized and i want you to develop leadership because the mark of a true leader is develop other leaders and you'll always be a successful leader if you do that and he answered all three of those questions and in his time as the fire chief we have become one probably the best trained department in state with a training facility sitting out there. We have an ISO rating number one, and that is very hard to attain. He developed our emergency action plan. He wasn't here when the ice storm hit, but he was certainly here while we were trying to clean it up, and he was instrumental in getting that work done, and he also has said he... helped me get through the preparation for the bond program and the places where we needed the fire stations. And we have averaged buying a fire truck a year for the last seven years. And that has been all under his leadership in this city. I will be eternally grateful. And at the end of the day, he's one of the humblest people I ever met. And he is a true example of a servant leader. So thank you for your service to this city. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. So I'd be remiss if I didn't say, well, who's in charge now? And so the citizens know that we will continue to be safe and that we aren't going with an empty chair. Our interim fire chief until the mayor makes a permanent appointment will be Chief Brad Hardin. He's here tonight. You want to stand up and wave, everybody, so you know who he is. So you're in good hands. Thank you. I might also add that, you know, that goal of the mayor giving Chief DeRinger to build leadership. We had had a. a succession of about four chiefs in the police department that had all come internally, but we had hired externally in the fire department for the last three chiefs. And we had seven people apply that year, and still they couldn't necessarily be the best qualified. And that was the charge that Mayor Jordan gave to Chief Dayringer, and he has done that steadily, which allows us to feel very comfortable to have Brad leading our fire department while we make that next election. So thank you, Chief. Gully Park Concert. They're really good concerts. If you're not catching them, you need to get out there. The next one is June the 27th, so it'll be next Thursday. It's the Northwest Arkansas Jazz and More. And how they describe themselves, they play great standard jazz, including tunes from the Great American Songbook. But we mix it up with hits and pop music from over the past 50 years, giving you more. So come hear jazz and more at Gully Park on the 27th. Let's see. I think that'll do it for tonight. What else? What other announcements do we have? Okay. I will be going on vacation tomorrow for about 10 days. If, like I told staff yesterday, if there's any problems or issues, I don't want to hear them because I will be gone. But Sarah will be running the agenda session next week, and it'll be a good time. I'm looking forward to a little time off. So I'll be out for about the next 10 days. All right. I can't think of anything else. Thank you all. Great evening. We're adjourned.
