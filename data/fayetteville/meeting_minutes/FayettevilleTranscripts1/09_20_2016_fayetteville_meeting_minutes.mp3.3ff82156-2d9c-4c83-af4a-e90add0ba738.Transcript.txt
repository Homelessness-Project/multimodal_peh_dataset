This is on the second reading. Well, Mayor, it would be on the second reading. As you remember, last meeting it was removed from the table, and at that point in time we were provided a bill of assurance And so the next day on September 7th, I drafted a new ordinance reflecting the bill of assurance and attaching it as an exhibit to the ordinance. And so rather than reading the old ordinance without the bill of assurance, I would ask that the city council at this point amend the current ordinance to the one that I supplied to you on September 7th. And it's also, I gave you another copy of tonight. So we would amend... of the bill of assurance to it, correct? Or amend just... Amend the ordinance to reflect that a bill of assurance has been provided. All right. Sarah? I move that we amend the ordinance to reflect the attachment of the bill of assurance. John? Second that motion. Okay. We have a motion to second. Any discussion on... Okay. Would the neighbor in second or please put in their motion? John puts his second in there. did you do no problem okay we have a motion in the state sondra would you please call them yes yes marsh yes yes yes yes okay Now, you can move to suspend the rules when I just read the title. I should note before I would do that, though, that also in the body of the ordinance, it was amended to read that, just as it had said before, but then subject to a bill of assurance, the area sought to be rezoned neighborhood conservation and neighborhood services shall be restricted to a maximum of 400 single-family homes. That would be in Section 1. If you want me to read the entire thing, I can, or else you can... Allen is nodding like he wants me to read the whole ordinance. So I will be happy to do that Okay, and orange to rezone that property described in rezoning petition sick RZ n 16-50 442 for approximately 99 acres located at 2514 West Lurie Road from RA residential agricultural RSF one residential single-family one unit per acre and RSF for residential single-family four units per acre and to NC Neighborhood Conservation, RA Residential Agricultural, and NS Neighborhood Services subject to the bill of assurance, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby changes the zone classification of the property shown on the map, Exhibit A, and the legal description, Exhibit B, both attached to the Planning Department's agenda memo. From residential agricultural, RSF 1, residential single family, one unit per acre, and RSF 4, residential single family, four units per acre, to neighborhood conservation, residential agricultural, and neighborhood services, subject to a bill of assurance, the area sought to be rezoned in neighborhood conservation and neighborhood services shall be restricted to a maximum of 400 single family homes. section two that the city council the city of federal arkansas hereby amends the official zoning map of the city of fayetteville to reflect the zoning change provided in section one okay jeremy you got anything nothing new other than what mr. Williams just mentioned the bill of assurance was provided by mr. Kavanagh's this request is to rezone approximately 70 almost 73 acres the neighborhood conservation and 14.7 nine acres the neighborhood services and 11.6 acres to residential agricultural as shown in the attached exhibits the bill of assurance does limit the development of property just to single-family dwellings with a maximum number of four hundred Okay, I know that Councilmember Adella Gray wants to hold this on the agenda. Mr. Mayor, for those that weren't at the agenda session, she asked that this be left on the second reading and also this afternoon we heard from the applicant that he was not going to be able to attend. There are some questions I would like to ask him to make sure I understand what his bill of assurance is intended to mean. And so I don't think it would be good for us to go to the third and final reading without him being here to be able to answer those questions. Okay. Okay. Any other comments on that, counsel? John, I think you were the one. I mean, Sarah. I do have some concerns about the lack of clarity in the bill of assurance. And if the landowner does intend to limit this to just 400 single family homes, I would suggest he would say something that it will, those zones will be limited to single family homes with a maximum number of 400 because as it's written right now i feel like that would limit us to 400 single family homes but an unlimited number of multi-family homes it just seems rather vague and so i hope that you'll have the opportunity to provide some clarity yeah i I agree it is a rather vague bill of assurance, and I think it would be very helpful to have the drafter here so he can tell us clearly what his intent is. Okay. After seeing the ambiguities in the Terminola land agreement, I felt that we need to be very careful on these so that we don't run into that same situation again. Thank you. Okay. John? well i understand if we need to wait for the questions to be answered i'm all for clarity in any agreement we enter into as a city but i'm hoping this is not just another delay technique we've this has been in the works for about a year and a half now and i think we need to move with appropriate dispatch to move this project to completion so i hope my colleagues on city council will act in good faith and ask questions that need to be asked but let's give this man an answer up or down one way or the other thank you mayor well anybody else do we have any and also we'll be able to discuss this at next monday night's ward 4 meeting so it is good i think to hold it for another week another council meeting Okay, is there anybody now we're gonna hold this a couple weeks So does anybody in the public here wants to speak on this or anything because you get a chance to speak on it a couple weeks Okay, gonna bring back to the council. I take it. We're gonna hold it here Everybody agreement. All right. Let me see Okay, the next one is number two in order to resolve that property describing zoning petition RZN 16-5500 for approximately point two three acres located at 235 East 7th Street from NC Neighborhood Conservation to DG Downtown General. That was left on the second reading. And again, during the interim from last meeting to this meeting, fairly recently the applicant has submitted a bill of assurance. So I have redrafted the ordinance to reflect the bill of assurance and provided a copy of all that to you tonight. So I think before I read anything further, I would ask that the ordinance be amended to reflect that a bill of assurance has been offered. Okay. Matthew. Yes, thank you, Mayor. As I stated two weeks ago, because the applicant is a business partner of mine on some other projects, although I'm not involved with this, I'll be refusing for the discussion. Okay. All right. Now I'll make a motion to amend to the current version before us. Okay. Sarah. Second. We have a motion and a second to amend. Any discussion on that from the council? Okay. Any discussion about the amendment from the public? So you're not bringing it back to the council. We have a motion and a second to amend. Any further discussion on that? All right. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Look here. Yes. Yes. Marsh. Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Okay. I'll read the amended title. An ordinance to rezone that property described in rezoning petition RZN 16-5500 for approximately .23 acres located at 335 East 7th Street from Neighborhood Conservation to Downtown General subject to the attached bill of assurance. And I probably should have waited until you suspended the rules so I could only read the title, but I can continue reading the body or somebody can move to suspend the rules. Although it will take six votes to suspend the rules. I will entertain a motion to suspend the rules and go to the third reading. No, just be at the second reading. Second reading. Second. So moved. John? Second that motion. We have a motion to second go to the second reading. Any discussion on that? All right. Senator, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Right. Sorry. Marsh. Yes. Kenyon. Yes. Tennant. Yes. St. Mark's. Yes. An ordinance to rezone that property described in the rezone petition RZN 16-5500 for approximately .23 acres located at 335 East 7th Street from Neighborhood Conservation to Downtown General subject to the attached bill of assurance. Jeremy, you got anything new on that? Yes, Mayor and Council, you may recall this item came to you with a split vote of the Planning Commission 4-4. The request is to rezone the property from neighborhood conservation to downtown general. Some of the concerns cited were the demolition the uses within the property of what downtown general does allow which does allow for more intense commercial uses within this primarily single family and smaller multi-family neighborhood we spoke with mr niederman the applicant and he's offered a bill of assurance and i'd like to just go through that with you the bill of assurance limits the property in two ways and the uses allowed on the property and also the height limit The first use permitted uses within this zone would include use unit one citywide uses by right which are allowed in any zone within the city. Single family dwellings it's used in eight, use unit nine two family dwellings, use unit 10 three family dwellings and use unit 24 home occupations. For all other uses would be stricken from being permitted within this zone For conditional uses that would be allowed within the zone use unit to citywide uses by conditional use permit Use unit 25, which is our office and studio uses using it 26 multifamily again condition by use conditional use permit Cottage housing use unit 24 and use unit 25 small scale production Would be also be allowed by conditional use permit The height limit would be restricted to 45 feet maximum by this bill of assurance as well Which does reduce it from downtown generals maximum of 56 feet? Staff good with that. Are you good with that? Yes, sir. Okay. Good is the applicant here? Human's you'd like to approach us say something. Hi. My name is Aaron Ederman. Thank you for having me and spoke with Jeremy and Quinn Thompson last week I think we came to a reasonable agreement on it and what I'm hoping to further from this conversation too is that looking for a new category that will allow some of the flexibility that downtown general does without some of the uses that other people may object to. So I'm hoping that this is one step, while this is related to this location in particular, that this is one step to move us towards a new zoning classification that hopefully we can agree on. Thank you. Any questions for Mr. Neiman on this? Thank you. Is there any public comment on this? So now I'll bring it back to the council. Sarah. I really like what the developer has proposed here. He's really given us, he's basically limited it to a lot of what it was previously designed to handle but then basically made some accommodations to deliver some accessory dwelling units on non-owner occupied areas. lot so i think this is going to help give us some appropriate infill in that area as well as provide some affordable housing options in terms of flexibility and size and scale so i support this a hundred percent and i'm moved that we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading have a motion we have second mark i second the motion of a motion second and go to the third and final reading um sorry would you please call the rope Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, I think that's six. So an ordinance to rezone that property described in a rezoning petition, RZN 16-5500 for approximately .23 acres, located at 335 East 7th Street from Neighborhood Conservation to Downtown General, subject to the attached bill of assurance. Thank you. Okay, Justin? It just seems like this is a very creative thing that this developer is doing in an area that will benefit from it greatly. So I thank him very much for that. Thank you. Yep. Sarah? I move we approve the ordinance or the rezoning request. We're on third and final reading, aren't we? Are we on third and final reading? Yes, you are. So we're fixing about . Mark? I also endorse the way that this was handled. Unfortunately, we didn't have an appropriate category to meet the needs of the developer to fit appropriately in the neighborhood with the appropriate infill, looking also at size and scale. Thank you to the developer for being... um willing to work with our city staff to come up with a creative solution so that we can go ahead and get this accommodated and certainly this will move us forward to looking at a new zoning category that will be appropriate in this area or this type of development so i certainly wholeheartedly support this as it's prevented as it's presented with the bill of assurance okay john i'm supporting this rezoning because i support development and growth in our city i don't think the correct criteria is what i prefer or what i don't prefer i think what's important is that we grow our city within the regulations that we have established for that growth and i'd like to see those applied evenly throughout the board across the board so that someone who comes in and says, well, I want to do this, and, well, maybe they fly the wrong political flag or something like that, we may not like what they're doing, but we have to recognize that all development is good to one degree or another. It may not meet our personal preference, but if it's being built, probably somebody wants it and somebody likes it. Nobody wants to build an ugly building that nobody wants to live in, rent, or own. We need development. We need to grow. So I support growth. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, John. Anybody else? Okay. There's more of the final comments. Sandra, would you please go on the road? Do I have a second? Well, we're on the third and final reading, I thought. Latour? Yes. Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Bennett? Yes. Schaumacher? Yes. Okay, Matthew, we're done. All right. Now we have public hearing. Okay. I'm going to open it up to a public hearing. A resolution authorizes the city attorney to seek condemnation of possession of certain lands owned by Drake Street Property LLC, 1155... properties, RPM1 properties, federal LLC, aka RPM1 properties, LLC, and now LLP for the water and sewer relocation associated with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department Project, BBO414, Interstate 49, and Highway 112 interchange and approve a budget adjustment. I believe we have a kid of an amendment. Yes, this is a new record, three straight amendments. I think this is a good amendment, though, because we have been able to settle with Nelms LLP or whatever there for a very small easement we needed on the north side of the road there, and so we do not need to seek condemnation there. We are having to continue to seek condemnation for the south side of the road over fairly long easements just because we need to, as soon as possible, obtain legal possession of this easement so that we can move our water and sewer lines out of the way of the highway department who is about to, of course, begin this. a multi-million dollar improvement to that particular intersection. And they're on a very short time frame. They asked us to move very quickly. And so that's what we're doing. I've been in contact with the owner and his attorney. They realize why we're doing this and that we're certainly going to continue and negotiate in the future with them. I really don't anticipate a trial, but in order to get possession legally of this property and move forward, we have to seek this condemnation. Okay. Thank you. Oh, I would ask, we sent a memo out to you with the new resolution that removed NALM, so I'd ask for you to amend the current resolution to the one that was handed out tonight. Okay, we need to amend to take out the NALM properly, correct? That is correct. All right. All right, Sarah. I move we amend. Allen? I'll second that motion. We have a motion and a second to amend. Any discussion on it? All right. Senator, would you please call the roll? LeTour? Yes. Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Higgins? Yes. Petty? Yes. Bennett? Yes. Yes. Okay. I have nothing further. I don't know if staff wants to talk about that, if Chris is here or Tim, but if you have any other questions, I think staff will be able to answer them for you on this particular project. Who has the staff? Anybody from staff on this? Go on up, Tim. well i don't know if they have any questions but if they do he he knows the technical stuff i just know the legal stuff that we need to get a possession of these easements okay all right okay is the is the owner of the property here they want to say anything or okay do we have any public comment on this okay bring it back to the council all right let's wish the council sarah i move that we approve the resolution We have a motion to approve. And Matthew? I'll second that motion. We have a motion and a second to approve. Any final discussion on this from the council? Okay. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Fletcher? Yes. Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Petty? Yes. Sinner? Yes. Chopmar? Yes. Okay. Under new business, number one.

As you will remember, recently the voters of the city of Fayetteville authorized the property tax in the amount of 1.2 mils to service bonds for improvements to the library. This is pushing forward with that initiative. to provide the bonds which would pay for those improvements. Again, those improvements would be secured by the 1.2 mills authorized by the voters over time now the actual enter The actual issuance of the bonds will probably take place early next year however, this is the council's authorization to Work and prepare on the documents to issue those bonds. It'll be a special revenue bond which means that it's payable from that property tax and not from other sources and I'll be happy to answer any questions we do have in the audience. Dennis Hunt from Stevens, who is the underwriter, Beau Biddle from Stevens, the underwriter, and Gordon Wilburn from Kutak Rock, who is our attorney and bond counsel on this. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Paul, at the beginning of this project, there was a cloud hanging over the old city hospital property. I think there was a lawsuit. Yes. There was a question as to whether or not the ownership would revert back to the family in In fact, the city library could buy it. Has that been cleared up? Has that been ruled on? That has not been ruled on in the Supreme Court. I've been advised by Kit because he is carefully following that. That has not been ruled out at this point in time. My understanding is we should probably have a ruling by the end of the year. We have every reason to believe that... the heirs contention will be turned down. We don't know that for sure. However, improvements will in fact be made to the library, whether it's on that property or other property. Again, this would pay for the bond issue for those improvements, and the architectural work, et cetera, will start once we know for sure where the location will be. So we're going to sell the bonds now, we're going to raise the $26 million, and we're not sure we have the property yet to build on. But the director of the library assures me that they will spend the $26 million whether we have the property to build on or not, right? Well, that's not exactly what I said, John. This authorizes the issuance of the bond. The issuance of the bond we expect to be early next year. By that point in time, we'll have a ruling by the court. We won't issue the bonds until we know where that location is going to be, and at that point in time move ahead with the project. So that's where it will stand. We won't issue the bonds until that has been cleared up because obviously the architectural agreement or architectural plans will be contingent on precisely where it is. This again authorizes the issues of the bonds. doesn't issue the bonds at this point in time. One other issue, you mentioned in your delivery that the voters had approved this. Do you remember what the vote count was? I do not have that off the top of my head. Seems like I remember it was about 3,000 people of the 20,000 registered voters in Fayetteville. So I think to not tell that part of the story is an overstatement of the facts. We need to tell the whole story and let people know what's going on. Thank you, Paul. Anybody else, any other questions? Okay. I'm going to open it up for public comment. Who would like to address us on this? Okay. I'm going to bring it back to the council. Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. And we have a motion to go to the second reading. Matthew. Mayor, I'll second the motion.

So would you please call the roll? mature no long yes march yes yes yes yes yes yes okay number two an ordinance living attacks on the real and personal property within the city of federal arkansas for the year 2016 fixing the rate thereof at 2.3 meals for general fund operations point four meals for the fireman's pension and relief fund point four meals for the Policeman's Pension and Relief Fund, 2.5 mils for the Federal Public Library operations and 1.2 mils for the Federal Public Library expansion and certifying the same to the County Clerk of Washington County, Arkansas, Kip. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, ARC, Section 1, that a tax is hereby levied on the real and personal property within the City of Fayetteville, ARC for the year 2016 to be collected in 2017 for the following purposes at the following Real and personal property, the purpose general fund operations, the levy 2.3 mils. Fayetteville public library operations, levy 2.5 mils. Fayetteville public library capital expansion, 1.2 mils. Policeman's pension and relief fund, 0.4 mils. Fireman's pension and relief fund, 0.4 mils for a total of 6.8 mils. that the real and personal property so levied and the rates provided therefore are hereby certified to the County Clerk of Washington County, Arkansas, to be placed in the tax book and collected in the same manner that the county and school district taxes are collected. Section 3, that the city clerk is hereby authorized and directed to file certified copies of this ordinance in the office of the County Recorder, County Clerk, County Assessor, and County Tax Collector for Washington County, Arkansas. Mayor and Council, as you all remember, at this point in time in September each year, the Council must set the property tax levies for the city for next year for collection in 2017. This request includes the 2.7 mil increase that the voters approved for the library. 1.2 mils was approved for construction we just discussed, and 1.5 mil was approved for operations. Okay. So the other levies are exactly the same as they were last year. This incorporates that additional 2.7 mil for the library. Again, we do it annually at this point a year. Now last week at the agenda session, we had a discussion about what the general fund budget looks like at this point in time that the mayor is intending to present in November. We're putting final touches on, but we gave a summary of what it looks like. at this point in time. And I'll hit a couple of the highlights of that. We had about an hour discussion, and it was recorded at the agenda session and is on the website. The high points are that the expenditure budget looks to be about $43 million next year. That's up $1.6 million from this year where the budget was $41.4 million. Again, that's the operating budget for this year. 80% of that total budget is personnel. So it's heavily weighted in personnel. We're our very personnel heavy services in our services because there are police, fire, and people who deal with the public. The major increases in this budget is economic development program, new economic development program, and that would be estimated to be, at this point in time, $440,000. New personnel are being recommended, two police officers, one dispatch, one deputy clerk, because their workload has increased by some legislative changes, a half-a-person thing agent, Also includes the economic development director, economic vitality director, which is part of the economic development program. It would also include .2 FTEs for parks for additional programming. one HR generalist and I will point out that HR has been down one person since 2008. This would restore it to the 2008 level. Also, one developmental services individual to help with applications for permitting. And that particular individual would help, especially in the smaller developments, getting a lot of that paperwork moving rather than having other people who are analyzing the larger commercial or larger residential development applications moving. to take them from that job and then handle the smaller items. So that is the mayor's suggestion to help move along with the permitting process as much as possible. And again, I will remind the council that development services is not at the same level it was back in 2009. So this is making up for an individual that was in fact positioned rather cut at that point in time. Other increases beside the economic development program and the new personnel would be increased motor pool charges. Now the motor pool is where we pay maintenance costs for vehicles. pay for replacement cost to replace new vehicles, and also pay for overhead type cost to run the shop, which has 18 FTEs. Also we have increases in the Loppe Pension Fund. Each year the Loppe Pension Fund increases our contribution. They can increase up to 1% each year based on actuarial studies, and that's gonna take place next year. We have contractual agreements and software licenses that are going to kick in next year. Some of that's for some of our new software that we have here at the city for the ERP we're currently implementing, and for LaserFiche, which is going to bring some enhancements into our document imaging program. We also have increased costs that are generated by the regional park, things such as lighting, maintenance costs, things of that nature. Laughter So that's the high points of what the additional $1.6 million in cost that we see at this point in time that the mayor is recommending. On the revenue side, as we look at it, sales taxes, we anticipate will be up about $1.2 million compared to budget. permits we anticipate maybe up about $150,000 compared to budgets. Now that's putting permits up at about a million dollars, which is putting it at a fairly high level, but we feel comfortable that that's a proper estimate. Jeremy and I worked very hard on that and recommended that amount to the mayor. Currently sales taxes are are running about 4.9% up from last year. However, I don't really think that's going to hold for the rest of the year. We're going to be going up against sales tax increases last year, pushing between 8% and 9%. So I expect that to cool off a little bit. However, I still think that we're going to be up $700,000 to $800,000 this year in sales taxes, and that has been incorporated into the budget for next year. The two things I want to point out that the budget does not include at this point in time are salary increases. As a reminder, the mayor normally comes through with a salary recommendation first quarter of the following year, and he does that for a couple of reasons. Number one, at that point in time we see if we have a surplus. We anticipate we could use that surplus. to pay for those salary increases. Now you don't pay for a salary increase or an ongoing cost with a one time revenue. That is very true. But in that first quarter, we also get a glimpse of what revenue looks like going forward. So based on whether or not we have a surplus, whether or not we think revenue will be able to perpetuate and carry that increase on into the future, that decision is made at that point in time and the plan is brought forward to you. One of the safeguards of doing this are if we don't have a surplus or it doesn't look like revenue is going to move forward at a large enough level to pay for salary increases in the future, we can always stop the salary increases at that point in time. We certainly don't anticipate reducing salaries, cutting back, but we can stop them at that point in time until we see the revenue growth catch up. We have a sufficient reserve to handle at this point in time what I think a major economic downturn would be. But this is the presentation we have at this point in time. It looks like the general fund is going to be about $43 million next year, up 1.6. We feel revenue will be at that level to fund that particular budget. And with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions. What questions do we have for Paul on this one? Okay. What public comment do we have on this one? Okay. I'll bring it back to the council. Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. Okay. Do we have a second? Matthew. Mayor, I'll second the motion. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading.

Jeremy. Mayor and council, this is approximately 0.7 acres located in the south side of East South Street between College and Washington Avenues. This property has been the subject of a couple of council discussions regarding the zoning with the Walker Park master plan. And also in 2009, the council denied a request to rezone the property to downtown general by vote of 7 to 1. Originally, the request was to rezone this property to downtown general. We expressed some of the same concerns relative to the Walker Park Neighborhood Master Plan, and we also heard from some neighbors about those same concerns. The applicant in this particular case at the Planning Commission chose to change that request requested rezoning and so this request now is to rezone from a bird conservation which is a single-family district to a different single-family zoning district RSF 18 which is a slightly higher density allows up to 18 units per acre staff and the Planning Commission feel like this is an appropriate rezoning this is largely single-family and some multifamily land use in this area there are some businesses in close proximity and this transitional area into the neighborhood so we feel like a higher zoning district higher zoning density would be appropriate and still preserve the single family character of the block the planning commission agreed and voted seven to zero in favor of this request okay what questions we have for jeremy on this matthew thank you mayor uh once again i'll be recusing i brought the application forward okay any other questions a public comment do we have on okay and we'll bring back to the council sir i have received no um public comments on this proposed rezoning but it does seem to be consistent with the viewpoints i'm hearing from the neighborhood so with that i move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading now i'll second that motion we have a motion second to go to the second reading sondra would you please call the roll Yes.

That zoning district is what the majority of the city's zoning, including our parks, are zoned. It allows for governmental uses as a use-by-right. Staff recommends approval, as did the Planning Commission, with a vote of 8-0. What questions do we have for Jeremy on this? Make a motion to move to the second reading.

Whereas the City Council has the authority under ACA 1454-104 to vacate public grounds or portions thereof which are not required for corporate purposes, and whereas the City Council has determined that the following described portions of utility, drainage, and access easement are not required for corporate purposes. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council, the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1. that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby vacates portions of the utility, drainage, and access easement as described in Exhibit B attached to the Planning Department's memo. Section 2, that a copy of this ordinance, duly certified by the City Clerk, along with the map attached to Exhibit A to the Planning Department's memo, shall be filed in the office of the Washington County Circuit Clerk. And Section 3, that this vacation approval is subject to the following conditions. Number 1. the vacation is limited to retain the east 38 feet of the west 46 feet of the easement area as utility easement for existing sanitary sewer as requested by the city water and sewer department and section two i mean condition two any costs associated with we look with relocation of or damage to utilities and the new easement dedication shall be at the owner developer's expense Okay. Chair? This is an existing access utility and drainage easement located within the Summit Place neighborhood, which is accessed off of Township just due east of College Avenue. Marks Mill Lane is the access point to this particular easement along the backs of these lots. The request is to vacate a portion of that easement. Not all of it is needed, and this will help with their tree preservation requirements. So we're certainly supportive of that request, as was the Planning Commission with a vote of 8-0. and what questions do we have for jeremy on this okay what public comment do we have on okay what public comment do we have on this okay right back to the council now motion to suspend the rules moved to the second reading sarah second that okay all right we have a motion in a second to go to the second reading somebody would you please call the road yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes an ordinance to approve the AC 16-55 36 submitted by Mike Bauman for a property located south end of marks Mill Lane to vacate portions of utility drainage and access easement motion to suspend the rules and move to the third and final reading second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second an ordinance approved vac 16-5536 submitted by mike bauman for property located south end of marks mill lane to vacate portions of utility drainage and access easement any final comments from the council on this am i good okay yes yes marsh yes yes eddie yes yes yes yes okay so would you please call me thank you sorry i got i got to watch the screen all right number six an ordinance to amend the springwoods commercial plan zoning district to allow single-family dwellings as a use by right on tracks two three and four of lot two okay it ordained by the city council the city of fable arkansas section one that the city council the city of fable arkansas hereby ordains that the portion of the springwoods commercial planned zoning district as shown on the map exhibit a and the legal description exhibit b both attached to the planning department's agenda memo is amended to allow single family dwellings on tracks two three and four of lot two and to add the requirements included in exhibit c to the planning department's agenda memo to these tracks All other terms, conditions of approval, and statements of commitments remain unchanged and effective. okay sure back in 2003 the city council rezoned a large parcel west of i-49 north of moore lane east of dean solomon to a planned zoning district it was a mixture of uses including single family multi-family commercial and then also 124 acres set aside permanently for green space that green space contains the headwaters of clabber creek and is part now of the northwest arkansas land trust property uh this request is to allow change the zoning of the property is simply to allow another use unit a planned zoning district is a custom zoning district wherein the applicant simply chooses the uses that they want to have in within the zone and they submit that to you all for review and you approve or deny that this particular property was approved in At the time applicant did not dissipate single-family uses however, they would like to add single-family uses within this zone And so that is the the basis of the request for the City Council to consider Planning Commission voted 8 to 0 in support of this Recommended change and staff is also recommending approval Questions we have from the council Okay, okay a public comment that we have Is the applicant here?

Chris? Yes, thank you, Mayor. We've been working with the Highway Department for a couple of years now on this project. They're ready to begin design. We started back in 2014 with a proposed cross-section that included bike lanes, part of the city's master plan. We immediately recognized as a staff that the bike lanes were not an appropriate design across this bridge because of the design of the bridge, the right turns, the loop ramp that will be constructed and the right turns. It's not safe to have bike lanes with dual right turn lanes. So we requested that the state basically reallocate that space that was included in the bike lanes into a side path, keep the cross section the same, same width, same cost. and just reallocate the space. They responded with a proposed cross section that was a little bit wider than what we had proposed, but included the side path. That's after we went through an iteration where we actually changed our master plan to indicate that the side path was the preferred design. So they went back to the side path, they did present that, and that's the cross section that you have in front of you. However, they went back to the original, a smaller cross section that didn't include bike lanes, only included traffic lanes as the base point. So they started with a cross section that only for vehicles and then are asking the city to pay the additional cost of the side path. That cost is $415,000. You can see the history in there that we have gone back and forth quite a bit with the highway department. And we feel like we're at this point that this is a much needed connection for bicycles and pedestrians. So at this point, we do need to proceed with with approval of this so the highway department can move on with the design. uh... this does impact the transportation bond program uh... will be coming out of the transportation bond program at this time uh... it does impact uh... one of the last projects that we have on the list zion road a oedd yn cael ei ddatblygu, ond bydd yn cael ei ddatblygu ychydig mwy, 415,000.

Felly, wrth fynd i'r drws dros y llaw, a rwyf wedi siarad ymlaen am hyn gyda phobl ac mae pobl yn hapus iawn i weld hynny'n digwydd felly diolch i chi i gyd am hynny. Justin. Rwyf eisiau cyfeirio at y sylwadau tebyg. Dwi ddim yn meddwl bod ffordd i ddatblygu pwysigrwydd cyfnod o gyfnod ymgyrchu pedaethol o un ochr i'r llall yno. Rwyf am ddweud am y datblygiadau gwych a'r pethau a all eu adeiladu ar ar y ddau ochr yn ffynnu'n hyfryd os oedd yna ffordd i'r datblygiadau cymharol hynny yn hytrach na chael yn traffig a'i sefydlu ar stoplight ar ôl stoplight. Felly, rwy'n gwerthfawrogi hyn, ac rwy'n credu y byddai'n dda iawn iawn i'r ardal hwnnw. Felly, rwy'n hapus i'w gweld. Iawn. Rwy'n mynd i ymweld â'r cyfnod cyhoeddus am hyn. Iawn. Rwy'n mynd i'w gynnal yn ôl i'r Cyngor. Matthew. Ie, diolch, Prif Weinidog. Mae'r cyngor Rwy'n edrych ar y hanes. Rwy'n credu bod Chris wedi gwneud gwaith da o ddysgu hynny mwy na un. Rwy hefyd eisiau cymryd ymlaen. Fe wnes i ddarllen rhai o'r e-bostau yn ystafell ystafell y Cyfan yng Nghymru. Ac yn ffynniol, dydw i ddim wedi bod yn fwy ymwneud â'r ffordd y gafodd y mater hwnnw. Felly dwi ddim yn credu y byddai unrhyw beth arall wedi'i wneud yn wahanol am y sefyllfa hwn. Ac, chi'n gwybod, byddaf yn ei gefnogi, wrth gwrs, oherwydd mae'n rhaid i ni, ond dwi ddim yn gallu helpu i fod yn ymddygiadol o ran sut mae ein gweithiwr ddechrau wedi'i gyflawni. A, chi'n gwybod, wrth ddarllen y llythyrau, chi'n gwybod, ac wrth gael cael eu arwain ar y llwyth yma gan y gweithiwr, And then them relying on kind of a policy-as-policy shrug to rebuff our request. Even after today, we received through that agency more than $500,000 from a program called it's called the transportation alternatives program and it's for trails and then they tell us that a side path here is merely recreational at the same time they encourage us to apply again to the transportation alternatives program for funding to pay for the side path it's just i i couldn't be more confused and i don't want to be um i want to be adversarial about even though that's probably in my nature to be aggressive on something like this instead i'd like to point out that if the agency is relying on the guidance that is set by the american association of state highway and transportation officials ashto whose guidance they cite in their letters to us and i want to remind them that at the very beginning of those guidance documents There is a section on how they are able to do things that are different than the tables and diagrams would suggest if their engineering judgment in their determination would mean a different design, an alternative design was safer or otherwise went to their intent and purpose more closely than the specific guidelines that are recommended. I think it's clear. When you have 20,000 people approximately who live west of the interstate, many of whom are students, who attend classes east of the interstate, many of whom are workers who work at jobs east of the interstate, who, whether it's out of necessity or preference, would like to walk or ride their bike, they absolutely deserve a safe way to do that. And I don't think there's anybody... anybody who studies this issue anywhere that thinks that the side path that we're proposing and asking for is less safe than the highway department's proposal for bike lanes. And so rather than be aggressive and adversarial and point out everything that's wrong with that, I want to appeal to their better nature and ask them to please use their engineering and do what's right for the people of Fayetteville and for the people of the state, because I think that, personally speaking, as a taxpayer, I expect them to be more judicious with our tax dollars. Okay. Alan. I'd like to make a motion to pass the resolution. Justin. I'll second that. Okay. Any final comments from the council? I'm just going to say, as a mayor, my job is to make sure that the people stay safe in the city. And I'm going to tell you, putting the overpass in and striping off a line where bicyclists can practically clean a mirror on a car as they go by, I didn't feel was safe. So we have brought this to you. We have spent, well, bless their hearts, I will just leave it at that. We spent a long time negotiating and negotiating. This is the best I can do. So we're, but one way or the other, we need to put that side path in there because we've got to keep everybody safe. So, anyhow, Sandra, would you please call the roll? Woodshire? Yes. Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Hinnant? Yes. Hattie? Yes. Hinnant? Yes. Topmine? Yes. Okay. Well, thank you all very much. All right. What announcements do we have?

We will have a Ward 4 meeting September the 26th at 6 p.m. here in City Hall in room 111. We'll be discussing the Razorback Golf Course and the Mount Comfort Road rezoning. So look forward to seeing everybody there. Okay. Anything else? I have a few announcements. Okay. Excuse me. Of course Fayetteville congratulates Miss America Savvy Shields.

It will be on the website, free parking, during the Bikes, Blues, and Barbecue event in the entertainment district, including the Spring Street parking deck Wednesday through Saturday. Be careful not to park in the residential spaces. That would be those starting with the letter R. Those are not free.
