Here? Here. Here. Here. Still here. Now, would you join me in the Pledge of Allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Good evening, everyone. We have an item that item three on the consent agenda will be pulled. Is it going to be put back on the agenda anywhere at all? Or is it a point of discussion or just for this entire thing? Mayor, I think that we can't just totally pull it off without putting it on the agenda someplace. I do understand that the applicant or the person that was a proponent of this actually wants it denied because they're going to redo a different agenda item in a similar subject. But that's what we have to do formally. We have to remove it from the consent agenda, and then we'll take it up. Is it, Sandra, is that immediately? Right after consent. Don't let me forget that, you all. I'll be— All right, the next order of business we have under presentation of reports, we have the monthly financial report from Paul Becker. Good evening, Mayor and Council. Council will be happy to note that you get to listen to me once a month now instead of quarterly on a financial report. But I'm happy to talk about our financial position right now. This is through August, so this is two-thirds of the year. The general fund sales tax is up about 4.87% so far this year. Permits are up a bit. Fines are down. Franchise fees are basically flat. General fund as a whole for revenue is up about 3%. Certain expenditures are in the works. However, the expenditures to date are roughly where I would expect them to be. We do have some major expenditures coming up later in the year. But right now we're looking good. We're on track with expenditures in the general fund, and revenues are running up about 3% at this point in time. As far as the street fund is concerned, we're up about $100,000 in revenue for the street fund. Operating costs in our future are on the rise. And the one thing we look at revenue in each of the funds, the operating funds I'm going to talk about, as you remember when we talked about salary increases and the increases that you did grant, in the first quarter of this year, they hit all funds, not just the general fund. We generally talk about that specific fund, but those are additional expenses to each fund. So we have to look for revenue there to be able to support those payroll expenses. Again, the street fund's up about $100,000. spent roughly 58% so far in the street fund, and we're completing some capital projects as we go forward. As far as the parking fund is concerned, that's up about 4% of revenue compared to last year, so that's shown a pretty good increase. There we've committed about 58% of our expenditure budget at this point in time. We still have some capital expenditures there coming forward. the August time period. Parks Development Fund, that again, that's up about 4%. Remember that's HMR taxes, one penny of the HMR taxes. That's up about 4% or about $85,000 so far to date. Expenditures are about in the range of 60% of the total budget at this point in time. So that's about on track. Water and sewer, revenues in water and sewer are up 6%. The usage is up a bit compared to what we had anticipated. Remember, there's a 3% accelerator, so much of this is attributable to be from usage itself. Again, we're going to look at the budget, and again, there's quite a bit of capital left outstanding that has not yet been committed at this point in time. But the revenues look good, and expenditures are about where we normally are. Again, we do have some large capital expenditures out there that take a lot of planning time going forward. Trash and recycling, revenues up about 6% there. Again, that percentage of that fund committed is about 54% at this point in time. More capital coming in the final quarter, but we should be in pretty fair shape there too. The airport revenue is up about $147,000, which is pretty solid as far as the fuel expenditures are concerned. Again, expenditure is right around on track. So right now it looks like our operating funds are basically up anywhere from 4% to 6%. If we look at percentages for the revenues, depending on that specific fund, I concentrate on those funds. The only time I'll bring up that service funds or construction funds are if I see a problem. So I'll keep this as brief as possible. That's where we are right now. I'll be happy to answer any questions. What questions do we have, Paul? Anything? All right. Number two, nominating committee report, Housing Authority Board. Mark, I believe you have this one. Yes.

An unfinished business, number one, a resolution to grant the appeal of Council Member Sarah Marshen to deny the Federal Housing Authority's application for a large-scale development. Sarah? Thank you. This issue has come to my attention through a variety of concerned citizens that, you What the Housing Authority is attempting to do is to concentrate poverty in a portion of South Fayetteville that is very far removed from services and access to schools and other critical infrastructure that tenants of their housing... Their housing... Project, I guess, for lack of a better word, need more access to. I hope that everyone has had a chance to read the amazing packet of information that Planning Commissioner Allison Quinlan forwarded to us earlier today that really summarizes the issue at hand here. But from a... But overall, in reading this, I think it becomes abundantly clear that the process that the housing authority used does not meet the high standards that the city of Fayetteville holds itself to in regards to transparency and public process and citizen engagement. But what we have before us now, we have to make a decision based on the project's compliance with the Unified Development Code. just to put this into perspective um if we were to approve this project or approval of the morgan manor development is one of the three triggering conditions of approval for sale of our willow heights housing project and so i want you to keep that in mind as you consider whether or not this development meets the prerequisites of our unified development code um and uh I'm making the appeal based on subsection 4, which is that it will create or compound a dangerous traffic condition. The proposed plan more than doubles the number of families living on Southwood Avenue, which does not meet City of Fayetteville standards. And our code states that when a proposed development has access to paved streets or roads only by way of substandard streets, the developer shall be responsible for contributing this proportionate share of the cost of improving the substandard access streets to existing city streets. The FHA has stated that the residents have a lower car ownership rate than typical Fayetteville population and are more dependent on walking, biking, and transit. For the photos that were attached in Commissioner Quinlan's memo and that were distributed last council meeting, we can see that in the neighborhood where they're proposing to move these residents, it's only accessible by substandard streets. And you can see many photos of people walking or using wheelchairs in the street because the... The sidewalks are not handicapped accessible. Fayetteville Public Schools has confirmed that the roads connecting the Morgan Manor property to the rest of the city are so substandard that they cannot send school buses down them. Children will be required to walk to College Avenue to meet the closest school bus route twice daily, whereas at their existing location, they're able to walk to school at the elementary school. And increasing the number of residents dependent on walking in a neighborhood that requires walking in the street compounds an already dangerous traffic situation. So that's what I would like us to keep in mind as we consider public comment in this issue tonight. Okay. Andrew, I know that we didn't engage you much last time, but I'd like to know the staff's perspective on this. From the traffic safety standpoint, I think the council should proceed with caution if you find this to be a dangerous neighborhood or a dangerous situation. This is very similar to many, many streets throughout the whole city as far as street widths and sidewalks and things of that nature. In fact, the city contributed money for the Willow Bend project, which is creating over 80 units on the same street just to the north of here. And it was approved by the Planning Commission that it did meet a safe traffic situation with even more traffic. In this particular neighborhood, in my opinion, it's not like some of the other neighborhoods in Fayetteville where it is very steep and you might have some sight, distance, and access issues to be aware of that could create a dangerous sight line for cars and pedestrians and conflicts. In fact, this is one of the more flat areas. And many of the streets here, they do have sidewalks at the back of curb and the streets are for the most part slow speed and well connected. And I have pulled up here an exhibit just showing some of the street connectivity. And one of the excellent things about these older neighborhoods is they have good bones as far as street connections. And so one of the things that this project would do would be improve traffic safety and improve street connectivity. And I'll zoom in here onto the site. You can see what the project is proposing. So the pink outline is the existing Morgan Manor property. And these gray buildings are the new buildings. And you can see here there are three cul-de-sacs that kind of dead end into the property. They will be connecting all of the cul-de-sacs for a loop street system with two points in and out to the west. They'll also be connecting 12th Street out to Wood Avenue. And Wood Avenue adjacent to the site is substandard. It's about 20 foot wide with an open ditch. And they will be required to widen the street out to 28 feet wide. So there's room for parking and a new sidewalk that meets the full city code requirements. And as far as the connectivity, I think that's one of the biggest things from, I think, from the public safety standpoint is you will have you know, another way in and out of this development instead of coming into a dead end. You can get out to Wood Avenue. And you can see here, because of the street system here, you can connect all the way out to Morningside via Nantucket or here on McClinton Street. So I'm not sure about the school bus issue as far as where the school buses run and why they run or not, but I think this would certainly allow – you know, fire trucks and ambulances to come down Wood Avenue and turn in and connect out through here and get out, you know, down here to 15th Street. If you have real technical questions, we do have our engineering staff present that can address anything, but from the Development Services Department, we don't feel like this would be creating or compounding a dangerous traffic situation. So you think basically it would improve the situation from what it is now? I think it will improve the situation for the whole neighborhood. All right, the Housing Authority I know is here tonight. Would they like to address the City Council and then we're going to throw it open for questions from the council itself. Good evening, my name's Mike Emery. I'm chairman of the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners. We'll have some other people up to address specifically these concerns that have been brought up. I'd like to speak as a member of the board. As you know, the primary goal of the FHA is to provide safe, affordable housing to low income families. we set forth on the morgan manor expansion with that at the forefront of our minds also i've got a petition right here that represents 75 percent of our willow heights residents who are in favor of this move and this project we're deeply disappointed at the actions surrounding this appeal of the planning commission's approval it should be noted that any citizen who walked through the front doors of city hall this evening could see the posted business hours of 8 a.m to 5 p.m monday through friday that same information appears on the city website just like every other business and office in this city the hours of operation posted on the building and official website can be taken as canon the appeal of our project was filed at 5 21 on the last day and allowed to stand our formal protest of this appeal was denied by the city attorney on the grounds that quote the city clerk's office was in reality open for business at 5 21 on august 28 2017 and so the submitted appeal was timely in By law, the city council is bound to the same rules as the public concerning appeals. If the information available to the public indicates close of business is 5 PM, then it follows that the city council members should be held to that same standard. There were lots of people questioning why the housing authority was not represented during your meeting two weeks ago. Frankly, we didn't know about the appeal or the need to be at that meeting until a reporter called me for dinner during dinner and asked for comment. The city notification system failed to inform the housing authority. Mike, what we're trying to discuss right now is the project, and we'll get to that end of it, okay? But I'd like to see why you all think that this is a good project. Okay. Can you address that or have somebody address that first, and then we'll get to the other stuff. Let me bring up Denise Smiley then, our executive director. She will address conditions in our budget. Let's stay with the project right now, and then you'll be allowed to do that later. Yes, sir. Mr. Mayor. Yes, ma'am. City Council. My name is Denise Smiley. I'm the Executive Director of the Federal Housing Authority. I was hired by the board in 2012. And so I want to tell you about the conditions I've seen at Willow Heights since I was hired there. I think knowing what the conditions are will tell you and explain why we are wanting to do this project at Morgan Manor. You've heard a lot of stuff about transparency. All of that has to do with Willow Heights, so I think my remarks certainly should be consistent with the considerations you all have before you. So may I? Yeah. First of all, I want to tell you that I got my capital fund. Award from HUD. Capital funds, major improvements. We just heard from your Mr. Fred Becker or whatever, but capital improvements. Excuse me, Paul. We have been awarded $184,391 for three properties. Willow Heights, Hillcrest Towers, and Lewis Plaza. In a true world, I would say if I divided this all equally, I would have an amount of $50,000 or more to do something for this project. But the second look, I found out that management improvements, I have to spend a lot at $22,000 and administration, $18,000. So what I have to work with for capital improvements at Willow Heights are $47,000. I want you all to take in consideration all the reports that you're going to hear about. You're going to hear from a report that was, I think, the mayor and the city council, the city attorney asked to be presented because you all wanted to see what type of, what it was going to cost us to repair Willow Heights. I think the estimate came in over $4,000. Okay, okay. $4 million. Sorry, $4 million. I have $47,000. You had another report from our consultant, AEI, when he said 2-plus million. Once again, I have $47,000. And when I get my capital award, I have two years to spend that. So $47,000 is not going to go very far. I'm probably going to spend it within the year. and I can't get into that until January of 2018. Yesterday, my maintenance man brought this pipe up, showed some of the conditions that were passed on our pipes These are the kind of problems we're having and if you look at those reports, they weren't able to identify how much it's going to cost to repair those sewer lines because those sewer lines are in the walls of our buildings. But in the last couple years, we have spent over $5,000 in repairing sewer line issues. We have had to go into our retaining wall to get to those pipes. Sewer line, water lines explode or collapse. We've already got an estimate at Hillcrest Towers for what, over $3 million, which we're trying to get an emergency grant. We do not have the money to make those necessary repairs. I just ask that you take into consideration that Morgan Manor, we own that land. We're not adding extra costs. And you all know how expensive it is to buy land here in Fayetteville. We're not going to have that added cost. We have all the construction costs and whatever, but this is about our residents having safe, decent, and affordable housing. And what they have right now is not very safe. I can't say that these lines are going to collapse tomorrow, but I know since we're having the problems, it's going to happen really soon. Where are we going to have the money? Emergency grants take a while to get, so you have to pay the bills, and where does the money come from? I have some reserves, but HUD requires you to have a certain amount of money set aside to be operable. Mr. Mayor, we're saying that this is a necessary thing, that project that we're venturing on. It's not something that we've thought about just willy-nilly in the last month or so. This is something that's been going on since I took office in 2012. Prior to me coming to office, there weren't a whole lot of things done to Willow Heights and Lewis Plaza. And you know why? Because the plan was always, always to tear down Willow Heights and relocate our residence somewhere else. I want to say one final thing. If we remain at Willow Heights, after getting the money wherever, we don't know where that money's gonna come from. We have to relocate our residence. That's 40 families that we have to move somewhere. Where would they go? I guess we can try to, I've already been trying to contact hotels because we gotta get ready to prepare for the Hillcrest Towers renovations there. That's money that we have to move them, we have to inconvenience them, move them away for I don't know how long, and then bring them back. That cost is all gonna be on the Fayetteville Housing Authority. So I'm just saying, please take in consideration all the things that we've got going on, along with the things you're gonna hear from our consultants about why this project in Mooring Manor is necessary. It is necessary, and I just hope you all remember, $47,000 is all we have to work with. All right. Yes, Sarah. I have some questions. Yes. Actually, Mr. Mayor, I just wanted to... We have in your records through the Freedom of Information Act, we found that through your own cost assessment that you could bring the 40 existing units up to standard for $2.1 million, and yet the new construction is $8.65 million. So that's four times the cost. But ultimately, none of this is relevant because what we're here to discuss today is whether or not the Morgan Manor proposal is consistent with our Unified Development Code. Thank you. Do I get a chance to respond to that? Yes, you do. It's relevant because when we had our proposals, one proposal was done for one specific reason, physical need assessment. So then you looked at the exterior of the building. You did not look at pipes. You didn't look at possible asbestos. You didn't look at all these other things. So when the city asked for another proposal, we got that and it came back over $4 million. The thing is, we don't have 4 million. Regardless of if it's three times or whatever, we have $47,000, ma'am. That's what we have to deal with. RAD is gonna allow us to maybe use a process that's gonna allow us to make better housing for our residents. They don't have air conditioning. They don't have central air. It's not ADA accessible. We're already having problems with the plumbing. This is not a good place that they're in. I can't do my job to provide fair, safe, decent, affordable housing with the conditions and the financial straits that we're in. Thank you. Okay. Listen, everybody. What I'm trying to get at here tonight, how is this development going to help the area? How are we going to get access to the roads? How does this all work in the neighborhood to meet the sort of codes that we're needing? We can talk about money and... we can talk about whether the appeal was proper. But right now, what I think Sarah brings up a good point. What we had before is, is this thing compatible with the neighborhood around it? If that's so, I'd like to keep the topic with that as best we can, please. Well, Mayor, I will even say, as I informed the Planning Commission, that actually we can't even look at compatibility, Mayor. That's something that should be done by zoning. Okay. So that as... Council member Marsh said that the only things we can look at They're printed in our unified development code and there are six reasons for potential denial of a large-scale development They're all printed out about the only one that has any real discretion in it is the one that she mentioned which says it's number four the proposed development would create or compound a dangerous traffic condition For purposes of this section, a dangerous traffic condition shall be construed to mean a traffic condition in which the risk of accidents involving motor vehicles is significant due to factors such as but not limited to high traffic volume, topography, or the nature of the traffic pattern. Whether or not this is a good project, whether Morgan Manor needs to be enlarged, or whether Willa Heights needs to be removed or kept, has no bearing whatsoever in this decision. This, that particular decision was actually made and is the responsibility of the Fayetteville Housing Authority. They made the decision. They thought it was in the best interest of their clients and the poor people that they serve to, in fact, try to go in this direction. Reasonable people can disagree, say that's probably not right, but that's not an issue before us. So even though you would like to defend that decision and other people would like to attack it, it's really not before the city council. It's whether or not one of these six factors in our Unified Development Code had been violated or not. If one has been violated, the large-scale development can be turned down. If none of them have been violated, it must be approved. Okay. All right, yes. Good evening. I think he laid the groundwork down very well. My name is Eric Gold and I am manager and principal of red conversion specialist and consultant to the housing authority. I watched the video from your September 19 city council meeting and was shocked at the number of allegations leveled against us and the housing authority and the amount of misinformation that was presented. As stated by Mr. Williams and others, the application for large scale development should be judged on whether or not it meets the minimum requirements of the city's unified development code. However, since several speakers have called into question the wisdom of the housing authority's decisions with respect to this project, I think it's very important that everyone understand the parameters under which the housing authority makes its decisions. The Housing Authority operates under Section 9 of the Housing Act of 1937 and is governed by HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing. HUD currently oversees about 1.2 million public housing units and has acknowledged that there's $26 billion of deferred maintenance related to these units. As a result, the public housing inventory has been losing an average of 10,000 units annually through demolition and dispositions. In order to address this problem and in the face of significant budget cuts, in 2012 HUD established the Rental Assistance Demonstration or RAD pilot program, which allows public housing agencies to leverage public and private funding sources to reinvest in the public housing stock. The program provides a path to convert public housing units to a project based section eight contract under the authority of HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing. As a pilot program, this opportunity was originally limited to 60,000 units, but has recently been expanded to 225,000 units. To date, over 61,000 units have converted nationwide, raising over $4 billion to rehabilitate and replace affordable properties. Some important factors about RAD to consider are number one, HUD requires that a public or non-profit entity must always maintain a controlling interest in the property, ensuring the long term stewardship of the properties. Number two. The residents will continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and are provided a robust set of rights and protections including consultation during the conversion process, the right to return to the property when repairs are completed, or to return to the new property as applicable. And a right to move with tenant based assistance if necessary. Number three, in order to convert its units under RAD, the housing authority must show that it has available resources to maintain the apartment units for at least 20 years using projected cash flow and or an established reserve for replacements. Number four, the Trump administration's proposed budget includes $1.9 billion of cuts to the operating and capital funds of public housing agencies nationwide. Over the last ten years, the capital funding that the Fayetteville Housing Authority receives from HUD has been cut by a third. The Section 8 program, however, has not experienced the same level of budget cuts, but rather includes annual cost of living increases. In short, RAD creates greater funding certainty while allowing increased operational flexibility to empower the public housing authorities and owners to serve their communities. During your September 19th meeting, Councilmember Latour expressed his concern about the egregious allegations being made against us and the Housing Authority. We share those concerns and appreciate the City Council voting to allow us an opportunity to appear before you to refute those allegations, which I will now address. Thank you. Okay, we've got to stay with the Unified Development Code. The city attorney has already laid out the ground rules here. With all due respect, there were a number of very egregious allegations made against the housing authority and against us, and I think we should have an opportunity in public to respond to those. We would have had a chance to respond to them if we had been notified of the meeting two weeks ago. Our meetings are always publicized by the city clerk. Is that right? So everybody knows that the meetings are going on. Now, look, everybody. The city attorney has laid out the ground rules of what we're here to discuss, and that's a Unified Development Code. That's what we're here to do. If you don't want to address that, then you need to take a seat. Okay. Now, who would like to address this on the Unified Development Code? Thank you. And I just want to be clear. What was the violation that we had against the Unified Development Code? Okay. I'm sorry, what? The reason that it was brought back for appeal, what was that reason again? That it violated one of the six factors of the Unified Development Code that allow for rejection of a large scale development. And as made more clear tonight and actually at last meeting, I think, was the allegation that would create or compound a dangerous traffic situation. Yes. Sorry, now that I'm, I just wanted to make sure that we're on the same page. I believe Andrew did put it very well. We are actually creating for this apartment project multiple levels of connectivity that we did not have before. Fire access we would have off of Wood Avenue. We did not have that connection before. So the only accessible points were from Washington Avenue. If Washington Avenue gets blocked, that means that this property has limited access for fire. We now have access for people in Nantucket and for the rest of the area to be able to access Washington Avenue through our property. So we have created now a connectivity from the West side wood Avenue that are able to go or sorry from the east side of Wood Avenue that are able to go to Washington from Through our property to get over the West so we've actually kind of created that connectivity all the way through there Wood Avenue itself does have sidewalks along a good portion of it that that go to Huntsville Avenue. As Andrew said, they are right at the back of curb, but they do start one property over from us on the other side of the Head Start program and go up north from Wood Avenue from there. I do not remember, and Andrew may be able to help me on that one, if we have sidewalk connectivity from our existing project to Washington Avenue, but I do know that we do have a lot of availability of roads and access in that portion. So that, I believe, we are looking at widening Wood Avenue, which will allow for fire access that actually meets the fire code as of today, and we are adding fire hydrants to that street and street lights so visibility also gets improved as part of the project. So you're widening Wood Avenue, you're making a connector from the Morgan Manor to Wood, and you're widening the road. So you're making those improvements and you're making connectivity on west to Morningside Drive one direction and what's the other one the other direction? No, Morningside Drive I believe goes through Nantucket. Yeah, but isn't that the way you're going to have to end up going through there? Let me see. Ours to Washington, which is in the opposite direction. I may be wrong. Okay, okay. Yeah, Morningside Drive is through Nantucket. You're right, you're right. But, yeah, we have actually better connectivity to Washington and to Wood Avenue from our property, which we do not have at this time. Andrew, are you in agreement with that? I do agree with the applicant's engineer. Okay. All right. Any questions for the applicant on the Unified Development Code on this and the connectivity from the council? I think you might ask Andrew. Okay. Sarah. I just would like you to introduce yourself. Sorry, I forgot to. My name is George Duquesne. I work with Moon Associates. I am the civil engineer for the project. Thank you. And then will you be connecting Wood Avenue all the way through to 15th Street? At this time, that is not part of our budget. So that is not on those. So there are really two means to exit this development, and that's going to be through South Washington Avenue or through South Wood Avenue. Correct. both of which are substandard streets thank you okay any other questions thank you can i make one more comment sure um only through development do we get better streets um so as part of our development we would be improving at least our section of the streets we would hope that development up north from us would also improve the rest of the streets okay i would note that most of the rest of that street is already developed okay all right Alright, now let's start. What questions do we have from the council to the staff or the housing authority? On the Unified Development Code, Sarah. From the perspective of children getting to school, perhaps Andrew, could you show us the route by which students would walk to Washington Elementary School from Morgan Manor? What is the safe way for those kids to access education? I haven't looked at the full route. It's quite a ways, I think, from Washington. So Washington is, I believe, way up through this direction. I think the quickest route would probably be out to the west and then eventually up South School through this direction. Washington Avenue is, again, too far north here. So, I mean, the general... There's a number of different routes because it's a grid street system. So I think the walking route through Walker Park and continuing up through this area would be on, likely if you're walking would be on smaller streets that are 20 to 25 feet wide. In some places there are sidewalk at the back of curbs, some places there are not sidewalk and again this is similar to many other areas around schools. So where would they cross 71 be? Where's a safe crossing for children to get to school across 71B? Again, I haven't looked at Washington Avenue. That's quite a ways away from the property. There is a crossing. There's a couple of different signalized crossings on 71. I think at Dixon Street is one. I think there's also one at Mission. Okay. And then where would – which route would residents take to walk to a grocery store from the proposed development? Again, probably the closest grocery store is – the saver at the corner of Highway 45 in College. And it's the similar route you would take probably the, you know, east of 71 Business, you'd probably walk up through many of these neighborhoods. I don't think you would walk along 71 Business. Thank you. Okay, any questions from the council for anybody? Al? A question for the city attorney. Can we actually consider the impact of walking? It's not part of subsection 2.4 of our development code. Well, when you read the Unified Development Code, I agree with you that it does talk about where it talks about the risk of accidents involving motor vehicles is significant. Thank you. Doesn't talk about pedestrian safety there, but I think that it's probably not totally off base. A pedestrian might be hit by a motor vehicle. And obviously we're looking at safety, and so I think that you can look at it. We have to somewhat be reasonable in what we're looking at, and we don't control the school district zones. We don't control the school bus routes and what they pick up and what they don't pick up. And so I think we need to pretty much stay within our own sphere and not get into another governmental entity sphere where if something was changed, would I know that some of the children I think at Willow Heights go to Washington like I did. It's too bad that we don't have Jefferson anymore because that's where my children went. And Washington is a very, very long way from Morgan Manor. And so that would certainly be a difficult thing, but that's not really for us to decide. I would hope the school district would look at that and decide where the best place to be, where's the safest place for the children to walk, and whether or not it's safer to have a bus take them somewhere. Okay, then I have a question. Denise or Mike or somebody, have you all talked to the – who wants to answer this? Okay, okay. Okay. Mike, have you talked to the school district about the routes or? I personally haven't. Oh, okay. Well, that's cool. Somebody give me an answer here. My question is, if you make these improvements, are they going to look at picking up children in that area? Yes. So there's currently a bus stop. Because I know they don't run buses down in there right now. There's currently a bus stop at 12th and College. I'm sorry, yeah, college, correct? It's one block west of Washington is college. There's currently a bus stop there. I talked to Rick McWhorter at the bus depot. He's the route director, route coordinator. Yes, I'm familiar. And he said that once these apartments were built, they could add a stop at Wood and McClinton. Okay. Which would be even closer. So you've talked to them and they're willing to put a bus stop at Wood and Clinton? Correct. They currently have a route that comes south on whatever that next street is to the east, right there. It begins with a D, I believe. It comes south on that street, turns right onto McClinton, and then goes north on Wood. They would create a stop at the corner of McClinton and Wood. I'm sorry, I'm somewhat, where is McClinton at? Right there. So the bus currently- Okay.
 Okay. I got you. And the bus stop at college is only two blocks from the site. Okay, so they would put a bus stop in on Wood and- Wood and McClinton. Okay. Okay, and then also if I can comment, there is continuous sidewalks on both Wood and and Washington all the way up to Seventh, and then continuous sidewalks from Seventh to College all the way into downtown. The Walmart neighborhood market is 1.1 miles from both sites. The public library, the farmer's market is only a half mile further from Morgan Manor. There's several amenities that are closer to Morgan Manor, if I may. The Jefferson Center is a half mile from both sites. The Walker Park is 0.7 miles closer to Morgan Manor. The Senior Center is 0.4 miles closer to Morgan Manor. The Frisco Trail is 0.6 miles closer. Walgreens is 0.8 miles from both sites. The high school is 1.4 miles from both sites. And Washington Elementary is only half mile further from Morgan Manor. And it's serviced by buses. Okay. Thank you. What other questions do we have, Council? I'm curious about that. I'm familiar with bus routes and such. All right. What other questions do we have? Okay. Now let's open it up for public comment. Now here's the rules for public comment. Hang on. Everybody gets five minutes at the microphone. Keep your comments addressed to me. You all don't seem to be having much issue with that tonight. Keep your comments addressed to me. Don't engage anybody on the council or anybody in the audience. Okay? And everybody gets one turn at the microphone unless a council member brings you back. If you need extra time, a council member will have to make a motion. They will have to be a second. They will decide how much time to give you, okay? Otherwise, you have five minutes. And please talk about the one issue that is before the city council, not whether this is a good project or not, but whether it will create or compound a dangerous traffic situation. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right, let's begin. Good evening, Mayor Jordan. My name is Bill Reagan, and I am a lifelong resident of Fayetteville. The new estimate for Morgan Manor has jumped from $6 million to $8.65 million because the city of Fayetteville has withdrawn its support from this project. And now FHA will have to pay impact fees and probably won't receive cost share from the city on drainage, stormwater issues, and problems with traffic in the immediate area. Drainage and traffic. That's your answer. Thank you very much for your time. All right. Thank you. Bill? Who else would like to address us on this? Yes. Hi, Mayor Jordan. I'm Olivia Trimble. I've lived in Fayetteville my whole life. I've lived in South Fayetteville my whole life. And I wanted to weigh in on the traffic situation. So I have two kids. They're in the back. And you couldn't pay me enough to let them walk from Morgan Manor to Washington Elementary School, especially with the lack of sidewalks close to Morgan Manor. So I just thought I'd weigh in about that. Okay. Thank you, Lynn. Who else would like to address us? Hi Mayor, my name is Rachel Reynolds and I live on South 12th Street across from the 12th Street Apartments and Morgan Manor is right behind it. Frequently, I like to talk to my neighbors, so I'm out on my porch and what I have seen is a large number of my neighbors who are dependent on foot traffic. Those are children and those are adults. And if you think about... the distance between resources and also the roads in that area. If people are walking to the grocery store, the nearest grocery store is the neighborhood All day and all night, I see my neighbors in large numbers, on foot in electric wheelchairs, children, elderly, adults that are carrying grocery sacks, walking back and forth from those after school. There are children all up and down South Washington. Every mother on that street worries about their child getting hit. It's a conversation that happens already. people worry about the speed limits, talk about trying to get those changed because there is that issue with traffic. I've heard my neighbors complain about the increased traffic already and also concerns about other developments that are moving in. We have Millow-Benn that's moving in, which will increase traffic. If you're centralizing especially, a high residents in poverty in this area that is difficult to get in and out of, I'll say. That's gonna create an even greater traffic issue. Also the bus system, there's a bus stop there. Many of my neighbors depend on buses. They stay on my porch and wait on the bus if it's raining or if it's hot. And you're talking about with this development increasing the number of people that more than likely will be dependent on those resources. So I just wanted to share what it is from the perspective of someone who lives across the street and is in this area that we're talking about this development growing in. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Mayor Jordan? Yes. My name's Melissa Terry and I live on Wood Avenue. I'd like to talk about the traffic and the sidewalk connectivity. While there are some fairly good stretches of sidewalks continuously down the street, they're not ADA accessible. There are no curb cuts. The sidewalk on Wood terminates at 7th on the west side of the street and then picks—well, doesn't pick back up from the block from 7th to MLK. So the sidewalk issue as a resident is valid in that it's true that we see our neighbors who need ADA access, but they will choose to ride in the road rather than take the sidewalk because it's not accessible. And then as far as the distance, the distance. for pedestrians to get to the resources that they need like school and groceries and whatnot i'll just say that there's a really good public policy forum called strong towns that published an article recently about the quality of and safety of walking through neighborhoods as opposed to walking, like to get to the neighborhood market, you have to cross 71, there's busy streets, et cetera. And so the safety issue there, especially for somebody to make a, But I would consider a fairly glib statement that it's only a mile further. Well, it's not a mile further when you have your hands full of groceries and little kids is 2,000 more steps. So I would say that traffic issue is a really big deal. Thanks. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? My name is Tricia Gutting, and I'd like to echo the statements of previous speakers. As far as the foot traffic that I've seen, I actually live north of Willow Heights, and so I've seen my neighbors use our streets. And in comparison, our streets are tree-lined, there's very light traffic, there's quite a few deer in the neighborhood, and so a lot of cars are stopping and paying attention. And I'm also a porch sitter. I like to watch the neighbors walk by and chat with them. And quite often I do see groups of younger children. They're walking to the store on their own, and it seems like it's a lot safer situation for them to be in. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. We have a question for Council Member. So you currently live over, where do you? I live on Spring Street, and so I'm. So what we're talking about here is the safety issue, and I think what I'm hearing you say, in your opinion, from where you live on Spring, compared to what we would be compounding. All we can talk about is this. issue in the south side of town, but you're saying that it's a compounding issue that concerns you because you see it as an increase of risk and safety. I'm worried about my neighbors that live near me now moving to the streets that the previous two speakers had. So you think that you're putting them in harm's way by Moving them, yes, away from. Okay, I'm just trying to. It's a lot of safer neighborhoods. I'm only basing my thought on what we're faced with, and that is the safety issue down at the relocation of Morgan Manor. But I think that you do have a very valid point of view when you care for your neighbors, and you're saying that you think there's an increased risk of maybe a pedestrian car incident or a car incident by accident. relocating more individuals in this area am I correct thank you and I'm sorry I just I want the comment has to be directed to the development we're talking about so thank you okay I'm gonna bring it back to the council he wants to begin mark I think that we have to look at the integrity of the neighborhood and the safety of the neighborhood and only that as we move forward. I've always said this any time that someone comes and represents their neighborhood, that probably the best information you can get is not from an engineer, it's not from a study, but it's from the neighbors that live in that neighborhood. Because I know my neighborhood better than anyone that doesn't live in my neighborhood, regardless of what engineering is or regardless what some type of study is. And so I'm feeling at this moment that there is an increased risk of safety in this area. There was a time in my life that I lived in this area too. I lived at 404 South College. And what I know in this area is there's topography that is challenging. There is areas that need infrastructure improvements the city probably needs to step up and do it but until that is happening I don't think that it would be appropriate to move forward on this because there is without a doubt hearing from the neighbors that live in this area and in increased risk of safety and so as I move forward until I hear something different I will be basing my vote on on the neighborhood, those that actually live, walk, and know the neighborhood in which they live. So I just wanted to express my thanks to the neighbors that came out. I want to express my thanks and the hard work to the Housing Authority. I was on the Housing Authority. It is not easy. The empathy I have for you guys is deep and sincere, and we must work as a community to come together to resolve the issues. So in no way does this reflect on the housing authority, but simply on my perception of the safety and the development of this project. Thank you. Okay, Matthew. Yeah, I just have a question now. And to give it a little context, I am, uh very careful about setting a new precedent with regards to the termination of creating or compounding a dangerous traffic condition i'm very very careful with it and so so i have a question with respect to that and i'm not sure who should answer it so directed at our city attorney and our planning staff are we able to consider that the proposed development and its users might have a disproportionate rate of vehicle ownership or things of that nature? Or are we restricted to merely considering what might be constructed? I think that we have to avoid very much speculation about that we don't have facts for in regards not only to vehicle ownership, but also just to traffic safety itself. And I'm You know, usually if you're looking at turning down a preliminary plat or a large-scale development for traffic safety, then you've got evidence that at a close-by intersection there's been a lot of accidents. There's been a lot of danger there. We have heard some residents say, you know, people are in the street. We've seen pictures of that that were provided. Right. What we, I don't think, have heard, I don't know, maybe it's there and I just haven't heard it, is that there is a significant danger right now at where this place would have to empty out. We also have heard from Andrew to remind you all that we approved, you all approved, will have been with a much higher amount of houses that will basically be connected to this subdivision, this new development. And yet, without batting an eye, without anyone saying, well, how far are they going to have to walk, or where are they going to walk on, or how far do they have to drive, or is it going to overburden the streets, we just approved it. It does concern me as the city attorney that we make sure that we use the same measuring tool with every large-scale development that comes in and that we don't treat one development different than its neighbor. I share your concerns and your caution, and I have no desire whatsoever to speculate about any other impacts or any other measures. But I want to ask my question again. If we had documentation, and I don't have this right now, if we had documentation that showed significant disparity in rates of vehicle ownership, would we be able to consider that? Well, yeah, I would think that if you had the documentation, you could. Normally, of course, a traffic study is done, and so that question would be better posed to the traffic engineers who are the alleged specialists in all this and who do traffic studies and I guess would have some more information about whether or not the ownership disparency has been established to the kind of proof that they would think is relevant and applicable could actually be presented in court. So I'm really not the person to answer that. I think that that would be more up to a traffic engineer. That's not my specialty. And so, you know, you have a lot of leeway to decide what factors you think can be important, so I would not say you can't do that. I'm not the one actually to make that decision. MR. Okay. So first I want to say... While I collect my final comments, if I have to make final comments tonight, I'm reluctant to vote on this at all tonight given we have three absences on the council, especially since one of which is from the ward in question. Very reluctant to do that. If we have to, I'll make some additional comments. And I will say this, though. With regards to this particular criteria of the Unified Development Code relative to traffic conditions, unless I'm presented with some kind of incontrovertible evidence that shows there is a great disparity in rates of people who have to walk out of necessity in this project with respect to other projects, I don't see a way to carve out a denial here that doesn't have wide ramifications for other decisions. Yes. I really detest inconsistent decisions, and so I'm being very cautious about that. It's the only way forward I see to put daylight between, for example, the Willow Bend decision we've made in the past and this one. We know, for example, Willow Bend is a mixed-income project and probably at pretty normal rates of people who have to walk out of necessity. I don't really have any data about this one. I have some... suppositions that ring true to me, but I don't have anything that's reliable. So I'm being very, very careful about that. I'd be interested in seeing that, using it to help me in my decision, but I don't have that right now. And like I said, I might have more comments if we decide this tonight, but I'm very reluctant to vote with three absences. Andrew, do you have any information on traffic? Yeah, I would agree with the city attorney, be it probably a traffic engineer and looking at the actual rate generation for the type of development. So I probably wouldn't want to speculate either. Okay, because I know we did approve, you know, that's the thing that keeps nagging in my mind, we approved Willow Bend, which is a significant amount of . . . I think the data's there. It's at the rates of vehicle ownership at Willow Heights. Okay. Well, I would just add that subsection four just says we are, it does empower us to consider the nature of the traffic pattern and so if we did have that data, that is a valid consideration point per the ordinance. Anybody else? Allen. I'd like to see us table this for a couple of weeks. I'd like to have more city council members here before we vote so that we can draw consensus. Okay. I'll make that a motion. Okay. All right. I would be interested in the data you're looking at, too. I know that the busing thing was an issue for me, but I also know that there's going to be connectivity from that particular project to Wood Avenue, which changes things considerably for me as far as the connectivity. because I know that they don't run bus routes down there. But again, I agree with Matthew. I don't know. I mean, he's driving. I know that the rule of thumb, Andrew, isn't it for every 100 units, it's about 1,000 trips a day, but... That's correct. So we got how many units going in? Fifty. Yeah, so you have 58 units and about, you know, eight to ten vehicle trips a day. So you're talking, you know, five to six hundred trips a day. And if there's some sort of ratio based on a lessening of vehicle ownership, there might be fewer vehicle trips and more pedestrian trips. I think if you actually looked at the you know compared it to willow bend i mean they have you know 85 units and so they probably have they generate you know 800 to 900 vehicle trips so i think the i'm still would be concerned just from that you know the amount of pedestrian impacts from willow bend would still be very similar if not greater than what this project would produce but i i would just be speculation at this point but just because the number of units are uh much more over in Willow Bend. Interesting. Mark? People keep trying to compare this with Willow Bend, but the topography is very different here than at the upper part of Willow Bend. And so that's my concern. Whenever you're looking at the very lowest area, There is a safety issue because I know from when I lived over there, I would not walk up the hill to get to college. I would go down Locust and take a risk and go over because of the topography. A good portion of Willow Bend will be at the top of the hill. And so if you're looking, and I also had a pretty serious accident in the area, but I was a college student. So I do have a personal experience. When I lived at 404 South College, I do know how that topography going up to meet college up there is very indicative of the routes that you take both in your vehicle and in your pedestrian access. So I do have that personal experience in the four years that I lived down there. And I have to think about that. So it's not the same as Willow Bend. Okay. Council Member Marsh. Yes, I'd just like to, using Andrew's numbers, even if we were to take a conservative and say 500 trips a day, That would be, even if we divided it equally between the two streets, would an extra 250 cars trips a day down South Washington Avenue improve safety or not? Would an extra 250 trips a day on Wood Avenue, would that improve the safety of that street or not? and I just don't believe that these streets are built to handle that kind of capacity safely and accommodate the amount of pedestrian traffic that we already see in the neighborhood and that will likely be more as a result of this development. Okay, Mark you have the floor. Okay, anybody else? So we have a motion, second to take. Now, any discussion on that? Senator, please call the roll. Yes. Yes. Yes. Eddie? Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Now, Kit, I want to address another thing. I know that there has been some discussion on the appeal process, and I know that you have sent a memo on that. I know, Mike, you brought it up earlier. So... Well, it was actually a letter in response to Mr. Crouch, who has been representing the Housing Authority. And... And I spoke with the city clerk, and she provided me a memo saying that, yes, on the website it says her office hours are 8 to 5, but normally she has scheduled and has her office open from 7.30 to 5.30. And if that's her normal open time, then when Councilmember Marsh sent in her notice of appeal at 521, then it was when the office was open. And, in fact, at that day, it was open. So the normal course of events is the office is open then. It was the opinion of my office, including my assistant first and mine second, that this was an appeal that was timely filed. I have been as city attorney for the last 16 and a half years, always interpreted this particular section as generously as possible to allow an appeal and not to deny an appeal. That doesn't mean that if someone flatly breaks it and, you know, tries to send it in and it's just a day late or something like that, or sends it in at midnight, there's nobody there. Does that mean that we're going to accept it? Probably not. But in this particular case, I think the facts make it clear to me that this appeal was timely filed and that was what my interpretation was. We told the city clerk that the next day, I think, when she asked. And that is still our interpretation that this appeal was timely filed and is properly before the city council. Senator, do you have anything you want to add to that? We regularly, I mean 99% of the time, have someone in our office from 730 to 530 work through the lunch hours to accommodate the citizens. We have a lot of citizens and staff. and after-hours meeting that we try to accommodate. And we have a lot of citizens that come in and want documents notarized before or after work. So we did that as a courtesy to our citizens, and I do have people scheduled from 730 to 530. Okay. I might ask you another question. I know that on the door of City Hall we have our time from 8 to 5 and I believe on the web we have our hours from 8 to 5. Is that correct? So is that any sort of issue? I don't think it affects my, it does not affect my opinion in this particular case. I'm not even sure how they got on the city front door. I know those doors are often open after 5 o'clock. Now, I know if you go to the county, if it's close to 430, you're not getting in. But, because I've tried to go over there to file something, and, boy, you better be at the city, at the city clerk's office before 430. But I appreciate Sandra keeping her office open as she does. I think it is a service to our citizens. And she is paying someone to be there. Now, that to me seems that office is open. It is not only open in fact, but she is paying someone and scheduling someone to be there so that office will be open. So I really don't think it's a close call in this case. appeal was in fact sent to Sondra during the time that her office was in fact open. And was open to that date and time almost all the time. So I think that it would be very hyper technical to try to say, well, because the door said 5 o'clock, then obviously everybody's got to be closed at 5. Well, my office is often open beyond 5. I'm glad I'm not down on the door. because that would be very strange for me. And I think that the other thing is I don't know exactly how that was set up. I surely don't remember the city council saying this will be the hours of operation of the city clerk's office. That's really up to city clerk. And so I just don't think that there's really any real question here. And if there was a question, if it was ambiguous, I would interpret in favor of allowing the appeal no matter who it was. A citizen, a developer, or an alderman. I'm going to hold everybody the same standard, but I'm going to allow an appeal if it's ambiguous. Okay. Thank you. Now, I know that we have tabled this. Alan, how long? Two weeks. All right. What information do you need in the two-week time that we're tabled? Okay. I'd like to get more information about the... if we can about the citizens that will be their rates of using cars and that sort of thing that we talked about. So I don't know how to phrase that but we understand. Andrew what about a traffic engineer? What do we? Typically something that's technical we would ask the applicant to provide that information. I'm not sure if our staff has the ability to look at their rates of ownership of their types of development and kind of guess that. And I'm not sure if we could look. We do have traffic modeling and see if there's something in our models that show this type of development. But I imagine our models are pretty general. I would probably just say multifamily. So I don't know. We could research it and see what we could come up with. And I did see the police chief back there, so they can sometimes look at an intersection and see if there's an unuseful number of accidents or something at the intersection. Of course they can. Got it, Nye? Okay. I have a comment on it. Sure. I think that if we look at the current rate of mobility in the current occupied units, that probably would be the most relevant because it would be based on our local situation. It would be local. And I think that that's what we should look at. Okay. Do you all have an ability to do that, Denise, Mike, or... You might want to address this at the mic to make sure everything's, everything. We have information as to who owns a vehicle. Who basically is driving and who's walking, right? I guess you could have somebody to call and ask that question, knowing that. Well, I mean, if you can't provide the information. That's right. I mean, I don't have the information. I don't have that information. We don't ask people what they drive a vehicle. Okay. All right. All right. I think for me, you know, I'm making an assumption, which you know what they say about assumptions. But I think I'm making an assumption that the people, that we have maybe more people who are using wheelchairs and... you know, more, maybe more people who, because of their income level, maybe don't have access to a car or public transportation in this area. So it's important to me if we're, If I'm going to make that assumption, then I have something to back it up with. So I'd kind of like to know, you know, since we've seen pictures of the street with people in wheelchairs going down the street and little kids walking in the street, we want to try and have a safe place for everybody. I'd like to know that. So thank you. All right. Okay. We'll see what we can put together in a couple of weeks. All right. All right, I will see everybody in a couple of weeks then. Not everybody. I know you're here for a few more things. Thank you all. Okay, which brings us now to new business. Number one, an ordinance to amend 94.05, use of fireworks to allow the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks to conduct a small fireworks display to celebrate their 10th birthday party. That's something that the mayor brought forward. I know that he... Want me to read it? What? It's an ordinance, so I need to read it. I am very sorry. Yes, it is. You read it. Okay. Whereas the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks is one of Fayetteville's crown jewels and has made substantial improvements and progress... during the last decade and whereas the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks wishes to honor quote those who made it happen and Are making it happen with the celebration on October 8th? 2017 at the Botanical Garden now therefore be it ordained by the City Council the City of Fayetteville Arkansas section 1 At the City Council the City of Fayetteville are hereby amend section 94.05 subsection G by adding the following quote the The Botanical Garden Society of the Ozarks may also legally conduct a public fireworks display to celebrate its 10th birthday party on or about October 8, 2017, if approved by the Mayor and Fire Chief and in accordance with subsection B1 and 3 and subsection D. Okay. This is something I'm bringing forward. The Botanical Garden wanted to have a fireworks display for 10 minutes to celebrate their 10th anniversary. And according to the ordinance, I can't sign off on that, so I have to bring it to you all because everybody gets one fireworks display per year. So here we are, and I'll entertain whatever questions you have. I think it's pretty self-explanatory. Is there anybody from the Botanical Garden here that would like to say something? No? Well, I guess it's me. All right. You're carrying the water. That's okay. I'll bear that burden. Do you have any questions of me? But that's pretty much it. I can't. I'm not going to go over y'all's head to do the fireworks display. I had Kiff draft something, and I do believe we want to do this next week, so we'll have to do it. an emergency clause to go with it or? Actually, I don't think we have to because, well, I can explain it, but if you don't want me to, I won't. Okay. But it will be immediately effective according to my interpretation. The least known the better. Any questions from the council on this? Do we have any public comment on this? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the council. We have to wait for Alan to suspend the rules. Oh, yeah, we've got to have Alan. So I'll explain why this is immediately effective, even as an ordinance. I'll just do filler here. An ordinance that's general and permanent has to be, you have to wait 31 days for it to go into effect. This one is neither general nor permanent. It happens this one event at a single time. So it's specific and only is in effect once. And so even though it's changing our code, it's not general and specific, therefore it's immediately effective. And now we have Alan back. Good timing, Alan. Okay. Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second. Alan. Second. Thank you. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Sondra, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Canyon. Yes. Petty. Yes. Batch. Yes. And Mayor Jordan, they need a sixth vote. I'll vote yes. An ordinance to amend Section 9405, use of fireworks to allow the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks to conduct a small fireworks display to celebrate his 10th birthday party. Sarah. We're on the, give me a, spin the rules and go to third. Spin the rules and go to third reading. Sorry, the screen shows. That's okay. It's cool. All right. Second. All right. We have a motion to second. Matthew, second that. All right. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Finion. Yes. Eddy. Yes. Spach. Yes. Marjorie. Yes. And in order to amend section 9405, use of fireworks to allow the Botanical Garden Society of the Ozarks to conduct a small fireworks display to celebrate his 10th birthday party. OK. Well, any final comments? I hope you will support this. Any other final comments? It's a really big thing. It won't be very long until really they've been a real great partner for this city. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, number two. Number two. We have an ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and to approve a cost share agreement with Robert Martin, Andrew Williams, and Nick Banks for the installation of Water Main along a 1,520-foot portion of North Star Drive with the estimated amount to be paid by the City of Fed will not to exceed $23,950 and to approve project contingency in the amount of $4,790. Kip. Whereas Robert Martin, Andrew Williams, and Nick Banks will be developing property located on North Star Drive and have requested that the city share in the cost of constructing an 80-inch water main along a portion of North Star Drive a distance of approximately 1,520 feet. And whereas the City of Fayetteville would benefit from the cost share as it would allow development to connect, will allow for a future secondary water loop to help prevent the possibility of residents losing water service in the event of a water leak in the area, and provide for ample future capacity which will facilitate future development. And whereas Section 51.112 of the Fayetteville City Code provides that, quote, the city shall pay the excess material costs of facilities of a size that is larger than required to serve subdivisions when such excess size is specified and required by the water and wastewater director for the general benefit of the water system, unquote. And whereas waiving formal competitive bidding will save time and cost by utilizing the developer's contractor who will be on-site installing the line for the developer's project. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical. and therefore weighs requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a cost share agreement with Robert Martin, Andrew Williams, and Nick Banks for the installation of an 8-inch water domain along a 1,520-foot portion of North Star Drive with the estimated amount to be paid by the City of Fayetteville not to exceed $23,950 and further approves a project contingency in the amount of $4,719. Okay. Yes, sir. good evening mayor council a little more information on this mr martin mr williams and mr banks have requested introduce yourself to the council aaron watkins with the city of fedville water sewer mr martin mr williams mr banks all three have requested requested that the city share in this cost of upgrading the installation of the water line from a four inch to an eight inch as you can see on the screen it's about fifteen hundred and twenty feet on star drive So doing this is going to cost a total of $66,925. The city's portion for that upgrade would be $28,740. That includes the 20% contingency of $4,790. The City of Fayetteville would benefit from this cost share because upgrading this water line to an 8-inch will allow the development of the property we see on Star Drive. It also provides a future loop to help prevent the possibility of residents from losing water service in the event of a water leak. And it provides ample future capacity, so the future plan would be to continue that line northward to tie it in to make that loop. Waiving formal competitive bidding will save time and costs by utilizing the developer's contractor who will already be on site installing the developer's water line. Funds for the city's portion of the work are available in the Water and Sewer Impact Fee Cost-Sharing Project. And this item was presented to the Water, Sewer, and Solid Waste Committee on September 12, 2017. It had a three-to-one recommendation to bring to the council. One committee member was absent at that meeting. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Okay. So you've seen it marked and everything looks good. This meets the goal of connectivity and capacity, and so we're very pleased to accommodate this type of cost share because our goal, especially in this area, is to get a loop there that we don't have. It's dead ends and capacity. Any other comments or questions from the council? All right. Any public comment on this? See none. Right back to the council. Mark. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. Sarah. Second. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh. Yes. Cannon. Yes. Petty. Yes. Batch. Yes. Mayor Jordan. Oh, yes. ordinance to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a cost share agreement with Robert Martin Andrew Williams and Nick banks for the installation of a water main along a 1520 foot portion of North Star Drive with an estimated amount to be paid by the city of Fayetteville not to exceed twenty three thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars and to approve a project contingency in the amount of four thousand seven hundred and ninety dollars Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Allen. Second. We have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh. Yes. Kenyon. Yes. Yes. Batch. Yes. Mayor Jordan. Yes. In order to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a cost share agreement with Robert Martin, Andrew Williams, and Nick Banks for the installation of a water main along a 1,520-foot portion of a North Star Drive, with the estimated amount to be paid by the City of Fayetteville not to exceed $23,950 and to approve a project contingency in the amount of $4,790. All right. Any final comments from the Council? Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, number three, an ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approved purchase of repair parts for a screening unit at the Westside Water Resource Recovery Facility from Avivo USA LLC in the amount of $35,252.93. Parent? Yes. Whereas the city has installed two bracket green fine screening units at the Westside Water Resource Recovery Facility, which remove debris from wastewater as part of the treatment process. And whereas one of the screening units has a damaged upper rotating shaft assembly that needs to be replaced, and Obivo USA, Inc. is the sole source provider of the parts required to make the necessary repairs. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council, the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1. that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby fines the above circumstances, make competitive bidding not feasible or practical, and therefore waives the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves the purchase of repair parts for a screening unit at the Westside Water Resource Recovery Facility from MoVivo USA LLC in the amount of $35,252.93. Okay. Thank you. As part of the treatment process at the Westside Wastewater Treatment Plant, water passes through one of two screening devices that we're talking about. It removes debris such as wipes, rags, toys, other foreign objects from the wastewater. This debris is removed to protect the downstream equipment in the process and to prevent the debris from co-mingling with the biosolids, which as you know is sold as a Class A fertilizer to the public. So one of the bracket green fine screening devices has a damaged upper rotating shaft assembly. It needs to be replaced. This assembly includes the upper shaft, the sprocket, the bearing housing, seals, and all other related parts to make it function correctly. Ovivo USA LLC is the sole source provider of this equipment. and has the necessary parts to repair the screen. The city received a quote from Avivo for the price of $35,252.93. So the repair parts would be purchased and the installation would be performed by a combination of treatment plant and contracted mechanics. Funds for this are available in the wastewater treatment plant, plant pump and equipment project. And this item, too, was presented to the Water, Sewer, and Solid Waste Committee on September 12, 2017. It had a 3-0 recommendation to bring to council. At that meeting, too, one committee member was missing. I'd be happy to answer questions. Okay. What questions do we have in the council? Okay. Did this go through water and... Yes. And you're getting very good at our suppliers. Avivo is exactly right. Avivo. Thank you. And I believe if you compare this to what we paid last time, it's $18 less. We're getting a big discount. I wish John was here. Good bargaining. Good bargaining. Good bargaining. We're working on that. John, if you're watching. All right. All right. What public comment do we have on this? I'll bring it back to the council. Mark. I move we suspend the rules and go to the next reading. Sarah. Second. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Petty? Yes. Yes. Gordon? Yes. In order to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve the purchase of repair parts for a screening unit at the Westside Water Resource Recovery Facility from Ovivo USA LLC in the amount of $35,252.93. Sarah. Move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Mark. Second that. We have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Yes. Mark. Yes. Kagan. Yes. Eddy. Yes. Dutch? Yes. Mayor Jordan? Yes. An ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve the purchase of repair parts for a screening unit at the Westside Water Resource Recovery Facility from Ovivo USA LLC in the amount of $35,252.93. Any final comments from the council? Sandra, would you please call the roll? Long? Yes. Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Teddy? Yes. Dutch? Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you all. Number four, an ordinance to rezone that property described in the zoning petition RZN 17-5915 for approximately 2.38 acres located west of 825 South Razorback Road from I-1 Heavy Commercial Line Industrial to UT Urban Thoroughfare. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby changes the zone classification of the property shown on the map, Exhibit A, and the legal description, Exhibit B, both attached to the Planning Department's agenda memo from I-1 Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to UT Urban Thoroughfare. Section 2, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby amends the official zoning map of the City of Fayetteville to reflect the zoning change provided in Section 1. Andrew. This property is a long, narrow parcel. It's located with street frontage on both Beachwood Avenue and Razorback Road, and it is behind the Andy's Frozen Custard on Martin Luther King, if any of you know where that is. There is about 70 foot wide of railroad right-of-way that they're proposing to rezone to urban thoroughfare The zoning is compatible in staff's opinion with the surrounding land uses which have been transitioning from lot industrial uses to multifamily and commercial over the decades. the land use plan does not actually designate railroad right-of-way in any particular fashion but we do feel like the um the request is compatible with the land use plan to the north which identifies this area as city neighborhood area which identifies higher density and this area has been transitioning as i mentioned from an industrial area to a residential area over the years so the planning commission does recommend in favor of this request with a vote of six zero And I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. What questions do we have from the council for the staff? Okay. What public comment do we have on this? Okay. I'm going to bring it back to the council. Alan. Make a motion to suspend the rules and move to the second reading. Okay. Do we have a second? I'll second that. A bunch. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Okay. Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Vanden. Yes. Eddy. Yes. Yes. Mayor Jordan. Yes. In order to rezone that property, describe the rezoning petition RZN 17-5915 for approximately 2.38 acres, located west of 825 South Razorback Road from I-1 Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to UT Urban Thoroughfare. Okay. Sarah. Sarah. Bunch? Oh, I'm sorry. No? Oh, I'll make, let me see. You'll make a motion to go to the third and final reading. Now that I left my name up here, I'll make a motion that we, let's see, suspend and go to the third and final reading. And Alan? I'll take my name down now. You're still up there too? Would you like to second that? Yeah. Alrighty. We have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. That's all right. I think things are going very well, actually. John, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Hinton? Yes. Eddie? Yes. Yes. Yes. In ordinance to rezone that property described in a rezoning petition, RZN 17-5915 for approximately 2.38 acres located west of 825 South Razorback Road from I-1 Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to UT Urban Thoroughfare. Any final comments from the council? Sondra, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Ken? Yes. Eddie? Yes. Yes. Okay, and all that excitement, did I ask for public comment? Remember? They were rushing the microphone. Yes. Everything? Yes. Okay. You did. Okay. Thank you. I'm the applicant. If anybody has any questions, I'm available. I think Mr. Garner covered it, though. Thank you. It's all good. Well, thank you, council, and thank you, public. All right, number five in one of those evenings. A resolution to express the City Council's intent to participate in funding for a network episodic television series being filmed in Fayetteville in the amount of not to exceed $500,000 over a two-year period. So, Devin. Good evening, Mayor Jordan, Council. My name is Devin Howland. I'm the Director of Economic Vitality with the City of Fayetteville. The resolution before you tonight is a resolution of intent to participate in funding to the tune of $500,000 over a two-year period for a network episodic television series being filmed in Fayetteville, Arkansas. This is the largest film in Arkansas' history looking at our community. We're not done yet, and we're going to talk more about that, but this will have a very large economic impact. And in a little bit, I'm going to specifically talk about the impact that it will have on our community in Fayetteville. Because that's really what matters with this incentive. But we were contacted by our economic development contractors, the Chamber of Commerce, with this project. And so I feel it's fitting to ask Chung Tan to come up, who will be introducing our guest with the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, who's with us tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Chung? Good evening, City Council and Mayor. My name is Chang Tan. I'm the Chief Economic Development Officer for the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce. We are very happy to bring this project before the City Council. We are very happy to report too that this is one project that I think every state in the union would like to have a hand on. So Fayetteville, North-East Arkansas is actually shortlisted to only two. We are the one of two finalists for the country to get this project. That in itself we consider it as a win because of the great things that is happening here in Arkansas and also the great work of Chris Crane, the commissioner for the Film Commission for the state of Arkansas. So we are competing with another community from out of state. This state in particular is very aggressive in getting movies productions to be produced in that state. So just off the bat, we are competing. We are almost like the underdog. But thanks to the state of Arkansas, thanks to the governor, thanks to Chris Crane, the film commissioner, they believe they come to us and say, you know what, we think we have a shot at it, but we have to be aggressive as well. And so why are we doing this? Why are we taking this chance and make this investment, recommending that the city takes this investment? It's because Fayetteville is about creative economy. It is economic development effort. We have a lot of assets here. We have songwriters. We have actors. We have actresses. We have the Walton Art Center, the Tier 2 Square. We have production studios. We have bands. We have a lot of those things that are here that could benefit from this project if it does come to Fayetteville. So it's helping to bring the skill set transfer. We are doing our own thing here already, but if we have a big project and we have this group of folks coming to Fayetteville, coming to Northwest Arkansas, it will only build on the skill set transfer. company is also looking for community collaboration. In addition to the incentive, they are looking at a community on how welcome they will be to the community. And we exemplified that statement by bringing in the University of Arkansas, by bringing in the city, and also by bringing in the Fayetteville High School. So these assets of ours, they do have programs in communications, behind the camera, in front of the camera, in editing, in technical expertise. So we are hoping that by, again, bringing this project, we will have the involvement of the community. And so this is something that is not done. We have to continue to work on it. And right now, I would like to bring Chris to come and speak before the council. welcome chris hi thank you very much uh first of all uh uh it's a pleasure to be in front of all of you and thank you for allowing me to to speak to this i'm i'm the arkansas state film commissioner my name is christopher crane uh first of all i'd like to give you a brief narrative we uh we oftentimes when we stand before city councils we're seen as interlopers and and and the state often doesn't have much stake in the community i want to tell you that that I lived in Fayetteville for quite a long time. I was a resident of Carlson Terrace. I went to Leverett Elementary. That's how old I am. And I was not, however, one of the 475,000 audience members who saw the 78 Orange Bowl. But... I stand here because I have a fiduciary responsibility just as you do. And I feel very strongly not only about this community, but about the entire state of Arkansas. We have a long history in the film industry, but a lot of it is a little jaded. And I was a public school teacher for eight years before I took this position. And I worked in the industry. A long time, was a public school teacher and then started to write legislation because I saw that Arkansas had a problem. We put a lot of money into educating content developers only to export those content developers instead of the content. And it became incumbent upon myself to say, look, all of these content developers we need to keep in the state. And so we need legislation that can help build the infrastructure and support these content developers in a place in which they're impassioned to live. And that's the state of Arkansas. Needless to say... That brings us here. I've been in this position for 10 years. We've had pretty good success. One of my favorite films that's been filmed in the state of Arkansas came from this area, and we worked very diligently on that, and that was Greater, and that was the Brandon Burlesworth story. Fantastic piece of cinema, and I think it showed this community in a beautiful light. This particular project, we've been working on for about a year. And I will say that a couple of months ago, we were able to kind of whittle it down to be one of few states in competition, and now we are one of two states in competition. And your chamber and your economic development team and the mayor's office and everybody has been very nimble and very diligent and very helpful. And so I'd like to applaud the community for getting us and helping us to come this far. This particular project, and I don't know any other term to use, is pretty sexy for this community. It is a project that Arkansas is a character and not a caricature. And it's not your basic bloody mama where we are going to be stereotypes like we have in the past. This project needs Arkansas and it needs Northwest Arkansas because of its topography and its aesthetic beauty. It would break my heart as the state film commissioner to see this project filmed in another state and for Arkansas to be portrayed as somewhere else, which sometimes happens to us. This particular network series... you guys will be very happy to know is one of the preeminent production companies in the world. There's not a place in the world that wouldn't want this particular series. They have committed to shoot all eight episodes in Fayetteville. They will be housed in Fayetteville. They will be buying their dry cleaning and their donuts and their lumber in Fayetteville. And as you know, I mean, film is the ultimate amalgam of all of the creative industries. And you guys, of course... have the ultimate amalgam of constituents because you guys have all of these content creators and you have the seamstresses and the carpenters and the makeup and hair designers and you have all these people in your community and I'd like to put them to work. That's what economic development is about. And we'd like to put them to work for a long time because this particular series will be in your community for probably at least nine months. We already have someone on the ground who has been hired. by this network and they're in the audience today. And so they are committed to start this process if we can get to this point. I'm here from the state because we would like this community buy-in. We need your help in making this project the forefront of this industry and helping with this economic development initiative. I feel very strongly that this particular investment on your part, you'll see amazing return. We can get into the weeds and talk about all of the ancillary implications. But what I'd like to talk about right now is this project and dollar for dollar. You guys, they're talking about spending about $70 million in your community. We're talking about a $500,000 commitment on your part. I have some ways, and you guys, I think, are talking about doing this in maybe two fiscal years. That's great. We could even go free if that poses a problem. We just need a commitment from this community to help in this initiative. What questions do we have, Chris, on this? Okay. Sorry, Alan. Yes. MR. Not so much a question, but Mr. Crane, I'd just like to say thank you for coming to Fayetteville tonight and impressing upon the community and the Council the importance of the economic development opportunity that we do have here. I think it's important for people in our community to understand why we're talking about spending such a large amount of money. But the attraction to Fayetteville could be very substantial, and I'm very excited about the opportunity. I definitely hope Fayetteville gets this opportunity. MR. Thank you very much. Okay. Mayor. Yes. Yes, Mr. Crane. Can you, do you have the ability to tell us what the direct spend on taxable spending in Fayetteville might be and what the tax revenue we might get back from this would be, the direct tax revenue? I do. And, you know, I think that part of that, and I'll call Devin up again as well. We both kind of worked on this together to come up with your local impact. We have a study that I would like to offer all of you done by the Economic Research Associates that we commissioned that really talks about the direct, indirect, and induced economics of this particular program. I also can give you some figures on the state level, but I'd like to get Devin up here to talk about the local because we've kind of broken it down and give him the opportunity. Devin? Okay. The ERA model that Mr. Crane is referencing was in your agenda packet last session, but I'm going to take it even further to the local level because that is a statewide model. You've heard a lot of these reports and you're going to hear more that this will have a $178 million economic impact on the state as a whole. And having worked at the institute to develop this study and use this model, I can attest to its validity. You will hear more about ancillary and induced benefits, economic multipliers, and et cetera. But I think it's pertinent first to talk about direct spend and direct tax before we get into that. But I want to caution you that any time I take a look at an incentive, we're dealing with taxpayer money. It's something that we have to take a great deal of scrutiny. And I can tell you in my heart of hearts that I truly believe in this, that this is a good investment to make money. And so this project has on the ground expenditures of $20 million. Let's ignore surplus spending for the time being. Unaccounted items, production crews, this is sales tax potential of $400,000. This project has a payroll of $37,678,316. If only a fourth leaks into our community over the next few years. That is $9,419,579. That's $188,391 in sales tax and 58 cents. If we're looking at lodgings and early projections, and again, this process, we're still in the very young stages, but we're looking at 300 people coming into the community, 100 of which those will be local hires. In that very factor, I'm not calculating into this. But 300 people in our community, nine months, let's say only 250 stay in our lodging. We're looking at HMR revenues for that. That's $6,075,000 in sales. So HMR revenue, that is the two pennies, is $121,500. Now, that's direct. That is a direct tax impact of $709,891. That's a net of $209,891 over our $500,000 investment. But I feel it's pertinent to talk about the potential, the induced, and the economic multipliers that this has. These are not guesses. These were done by models that I would trust, and I do trust to this day. Induced and indirect impacts. The ERA model projects that this film will generate, in induced and indirect, an additional $26,543,703. Let's say we capture a fourth of this. This can come through tourism. This can come through other ancillary benefits. If we capture only a fourth of that, even through re-spending and circulation back into our economy, that's $6,635,925 in sales. Some other information we've been provided. This crew, they get per diem. And so we wanted to take a look at that. What is our food and our beverage expenditures going to look like? If we base it off $62 a day, 250 people for 26 weeks, that's $2,821,000. That is an indirect tax potential of $189,138. So our total taxable figures are now to $44,951,504. Reasonable expectation, and I feel confident in saying this, and this is a conservative estimate, a reasonable tax potential of $899,029, a profit of $399,029 over our $500,000 investment. When I look at this, I want to make sure that we are going to make money, that this is a good investment to help us further accomplish our goals, and that it is my staff's opinion that this truly is. I'd be happy to answer any questions. But before I go on, there are a few other things I do want to reference. There are lots of ways to look at this. A report by Ernst & Young, which discusses the economic impact of film subsidies, states for every $10 million in production, local tax impacts exceed $150,000. Given that this is a $70 million production, that model estimates $1,050,000 in tax revenue. This is a huge win for the creative economy and the arts as well. It's a wonderful marketing opportunity, and we have been assured that Fayetteville will be shown in a beautiful light because Fayetteville is a lead character in this film. I'd be happy to answer any other questions or talk about any of the other benefits we've discussed in the past, such as workforce and the educational opportunities and the experiences for the 100 citizens that could potentially be hired through this role. Thank you. What questions do we have? I have a question for Paul after. Yeah, I was going to bring up, I also want to bring up Molly Ron from the A&P Commission. I'd like to have her thoughts on this as well. Molly first? Yeah. Yes, sir. Paul, if I could, and I know we've talked a lot about the budget lately, but just for the citizens who don't normally look at our reserve funds, could you talk a little bit about how we're funding this and the health of our reserve funds? Sure. Thank you. This is not a budgeted item, so we would have to be looking at general fund reserves. We've talked about this before. If we look at general fund reserves right about at this point in time. There's $18 million. Now we would have to subtract $7 million for a 60-day reserve fund in case we have a disruption in revenue. We have to take a look at what we are going to have to fund. for our current expenditures and we have a couple of large items in there. Theater Square is still coming forward. We granted salary increases this year, things of that nature. So about this point in time, we've got about $5.5 million of available reserves. that could be considered for these types of investments. Again, when we talk about reserves, let's talk about what we do with reserves and what reserves are. Reserves are for security. It's for flexibility. It's reasonable to spend them on one-time expenditures. You certainly can't live long-term on reserves and operating costs. This is a one-time expenditure. Certainly there are no guarantees, but that would be our reserve position. I would suspect by end of the year we'd probably be talking in the neighborhood of $6 million worth of available reserves. Certainly that is contingent on how the rest of the year will end. I did look at the numbers that were indicated to you they seem realistic obviously there are no guarantees in anything there was a risk involved in any any opportunity or any expenditure but the but the numbers I've seen look look reasonable for this type of project contingent on the estimates of the expenditures that we have seen that does that answer your question Alan? Mark I believe you had. And this is for Paul. This is for Paul also. I have received some inquiries on this. Just the assurance, the reassurance that we would get the, looking at the numbers that are provided, that we would replenish with abundance the general fund over time, and time is money. So we're looking at an investment over three, to actually, it's two years. to distribute the money, but yet we won't see the replenishment into the general fund for three years probably. Well, if we talk about this and it started, it depends on when it starts. I think we were talking about production time of two to three years. Nine months. Well, nine months. That's what I needed to know. Okay, if it's nine months. then we have almost immediate impact on it. And what you're going to have to evaluate certainly is long-term, what could that mean? What would that mean of the introduction of a new industry to the area? Those are the things that we can't measure that we would be looking at further down the road. But I don't know what the timetable to start this is, but if we're talking about nine months – For this particular project, I would say we're looking at probably the end of this year into or into next year and would have a fairly immediate impact, the numbers at least we're talking about here. And then of course what we're looking at it on income is sales. tax income for a lot of it, right? Well, we're talking about it? Yes. Generally, it's sales tax income. Remember, we're going to get two cents. One's for debt service. One is for operations. Certainly, the payments off of bonds, it's going to help everybody anyway. And the other portion goes to the operations. That's sales tax. Okay. Devin also talked about it would have an impact on HMR taxes. HMR taxes as far as people from the outside coming, being housed here in the city, depending on how much they like to go to restaurants and visit our other venues, that would certainly be an impact to us. The numbers we've talked about here were 121,000. That of course would be split between perks and A&P commission. But that's some of the other dollars you would be looking at. Going to other possibilities, someone might partake about buying some alcoholic beverages here. And if that's the case, of course, we would generate some alcoholic beverage taxes. So those would be the three that you'd be looking at, HMR, sales tax, and potentially beverage tax. Well, it is a hefty contribution, so we have to look at it over time, the risk. and also the leakage out of the economy, because we will be hiring individuals from outside the community that will be taking money with them. You just can't say it's all been here, and that's in the model. And I think that we do have a valid model, and I want people to understand that the validity of the model would show, if this was a successful investment, that we would easily be able to replenish the reserves because the reserves are very important to those of us that are looking at capital expenses Water, Sears, Olive Waste that kind of stuff big big expenses in the in the long run and operations. So again time is money and I'm looking at the the overall expenditures and the real expectation to cover and replenish what we're suggesting to set aside. So thanks for the insight. Mark, you know me well enough that nobody values reserves more than I do. You and I walk on the same road, my friend, and that's why I appreciate you so much. But it's a discussion that has to be... So well understood over time that, yes, we're using reserves, but the model shows that there's a direct implication that the reserves will be replenished at a reasonable rate of return over time. Okay. Thanks. The one other thing I think we do all have to make very, very clear is this is a resolution of intent. Right. It's not an appropriation at this point in time, but a resolution of intent certainly means that you're realistic. And a valid point that was brought up by another person, it's like we're looking at a housing crisis, but yet we're spending – this can help handle that because we're going to have – increased income over time. So that's just what I have to say up front. Thanks, Paul. Okay. I'd like to hear from Molly Braun tonight from the A&P Commission. What's her thoughts on this? Thank you Mr. Mayor and I am speaking on behalf of the Advertising and Promotion Commission and we are in support of this project and have worked with Christopher and the Film Commission at the state level and also with Chung at the Chamber and with Devin and I have relied on the economic analysis that Devin has provided and that you have heard Paul speak to so I won't reiterate that and I'll simply talk about what the development the things that we look at. First and foremost, one of the concerns that I had initially was the way that Fayetteville would be portrayed. I think Christopher said it best when he said that he was certain that our city would be a character and not a caricature. And in the conversations that I have had with this group, I feel confident that that will be the case. that is an utmost concern for us and my my concerns about that have been alleviated I think in terms of promotion and the way that it highlights our wonderful city I think that it will present us in a positive light and I also feel like the our hotel community is supportive of this and that we have the resources needed often as you know sometimes that's a as that is the big source of our HMR funding, that is a constituency that I take very seriously. And I feel like this will generate a positive economic impact. You heard from Devin, 121,000 just directly in HMR. I think he's being very conservative, which is appropriate and what you want. But I think that this will be a win for our hotels and restaurants as well. Do you have other? Okay, what questions do we have? Mark? Nope, any other questions? All right, let's take some public comment. Thank you, Ma. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Everybody gets one turn at the microphone. You're on a five minute time limit unless council members decides to give you more time or ask you a question. Please introduce yourself and time begins. Peter Tonneson, Ward 3. Preliminarily, I mean a lot of numbers have been thrown around. And anytime I hear 27 million, yada, yada, yada, and $3, or 44 million, yada, yada, yada, and $512. I mean, I start becoming a little suspicious about the specificity of these projections. One thing I'd like to say as a taxpayer, if this is such a good deal for the state, I'm sure Governor Hutchinson has a half a million dollars that the state could kick into this project. and have it produced within his state in the city of Fayetteville. We can get that question answered for you. And the other thing as a taxpayer with respect to the money is my sister's in film production. She's in set design. She's been doing it for 25, 30 years in New York. I mean, any film production or TV production is a very risky business. I mean, there's all kinds of pie in the sky with projects that start some – have spectacular success and some fail. So if we, as the citizens, were to come up with a half a million dollars, what would be the assurances that Mr. Williams could write in to make sure that we get this back and not just tax revenues that may or may not appear? But I wasn't even so much interested in the money. I think these are serious questions and the city should go at the money aspect of it cautiously. But I'm really interested in why can't we find out what is this about? I mean, we've been told now Fayetteville is the lead character in this film and will be portrayed as a character and not a caricature. But what is this? What are these eight episodes about? Is this driving Miss Daisy or deliverance? I mean, how is this Chief Tabor CSI or Breaking Bad? And I care about how this community is portrayed. And someone else who feels that it may be portrayed in a good light may have a very different opinion of how I would feel my city's being portrayed. Because I didn't grow up here, everyone knows that. But this is my city now and I love it. And that's the reason I came tonight. What is it about? What's the title? Who's the producer? Who's this distinguished studio? You can go through the trade journals, and I tried and tried, and I haven't been able so far to come up with a hint of what this is all about that's going to be done in my city, about my city. And that's my concern. And I think if they just come and show up and ask for a permit to do all the movie stuff, which I know all about what that entails, that's fine if it's their money. But if it's our taxpayers' money, then I think the taxpayers have a right to know what it's all about. And I don't think that's too much to ask. Thank you. Can I get an answer now? I will let Chris answer that. Okay, so there's a lot there. Do you want me to address all of the issues? Well, I think what Peter's asking is about the money and about what it is. Okay, so specifically the money. We have a state incentive program. Right now it's a 20-30 incentive program, 20% of goods and services with an additional 10% for all Arkansas workforce, and so when you're talking about the state's commitment, 100% committed and we're committed on that level that you can do the math on. So 20% with a 30%. Again, as we addressed at the very beginning of this, is we're in competition with another state. We have a little bit to make up. We want Fayetteville to help with that because we have a huge investment on the state part that we are putting into this. Governor's 100% behind this project. State of Arkansas Economic Development Commission is 100% behind this project. And another little caveat to this is They don't get an incentive, and they wouldn't get an incentive, if it doesn't pass the audit. And so all of these incentives are performance-based. So you, as a municipality, will not be on the hook for your commitment if it does not pass the audit, which goes through the Department of Finance and Administration. So the Department of Finance and Administration on the state level will audit this production before a single penny. is given, which means they have to produce all of the episodes that they say. This isn't a fly-by-night organization. This is the real deal. Now, as far as the name of the project, we work under an NDA. I cannot disclose that. That is confidential until we sign the agreement. Once we sign the agreement, we will make the announcement. And that's where that stands. I can tell you and I stand here as a member of this community and as a citizen of Arkansas that I have the utmost faith in this production company and what they say they will do. I know the governor is very supportive of this. The governor is extremely supportive, extremely. Okay. All right. Who else would like to address us? Hi, I'm Dee Dee Peters. Many of you know me. I live in Ward 2, and I'm here as a citizen, not as a city employee. I worked in the still photography industry for approximately 10 years in San Francisco. When I moved here 16 years ago, I came directly from this field that we're talking about where I made between $250 and $750 a day. I had a very good living. I was constantly learning new things, advancing from minor positions up to key roles in productions that were anywhere from thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. I made a list of jobs that people would be doing that you don't necessarily have to have a skill set for, But you do need to be a hard worker and you can get up, go up and rise in the field. Those things are styling assistance on set, wardrobe makeup, craft services, that's like snacks, fruit, making sure everyone's happy, coffee, catering services. They'll need to have that. Location scouts, while they'll bring people from their own production company, they'll need assistance, people that will be able to talk to property owners and guarantee like hey you know me we can get this done or hey i know this great place it's awesome we need to shoot here talent scouts for extras assistance for that work rental of rvs mobile bathrooms and then there's location fees for people that do rent out their property it's not housing or hotel any prop and wardrobe purchasing that needs to happen here And then I thought about the group of people that live here that I know that work in this industry. I'm very surprised at how many people have the skill set and they're working at other jobs or have moved out of the state to take jobs in other cities where they can do this full time. But then we also have all these artists that are going to be here, visual artists, who will be at the university and they'll have skills that can work do this stuff and if we want people to stay here if we want to retain this talent as visual artists people are going to need a job that they can do not full-time and these are the kind of jobs that they can have so i just wanted to set that and also remind you guys that um One of our economic development plans is for the creative economy, and this definitely fits that. And I think that it's just a great win for Fayetteville and for people here that don't have a technical experience in this, but they can continue to learn, and it really just takes hard work getting up early, staying late, working hard. All right, thank you. Thank you. who else would like to address us on this members name's carrie elder my son and i own rock hill studios we opened our doors in june of this year spent many years coming to the decision to invest heavily in the city of fayetteville in an infrastructure and let me explain why a lot of people have asked why have you done that when there's uh there is a growing There is a growing content development atmosphere here, but it's extremely slow. And it's not that we wanted to accelerate that, it's that we wanted to do just what this woman that just spoke said. That it wasn't that one thing would come in here and generate so many dollars and whatever, make a mess of it, if they did, the smaller ones, things like that, but to create permanent jobs in this industry. And that is why we built the studio, which is, there are other studios, but we built one that a production of this magnitude can and will use. They won't transfer work that's done in the studio setting versus out on location. they won't do that elsewhere so we keep all of those dollars so there's that we have just so you know since June we we have hired over five people in permanent positions full-time not part-time already to accommodate advertising dollars that were going to if it came to the state of Arkansas it was going to a different city than Fayetteville Okay, commercials that are being shot for companies all in the region now have a facility where they can shoot in Fayetteville, commercials with drive-throughs and things like that. Equipment rental, gear rental, that all, we have a partnership with a huge gear rental company that it will be all in-state revenue. So I don't know, I think it sounds like, I haven't done the math, but it sounds like that they've covered those things. But here's the important part. is that those were not available several years ago. Those dollars wouldn't have stayed. And the last point I want to make is about the technical jobs that are created. Editors, the STEM type of jobs, that if there are good-sized productions and we're developing content within, which we have done also, we are creating more permanent positions that are of the technical and STEM. We also have worked with the U of A right now. The U of A is actually using our facility right up till February, three days a week. They're shooting and they're actually housing, I think 20 people in our facility. So I would just encourage you to not look at this as a one-time thing. It is an extraordinary opportunity like nothing we could imagine. often said, well, we build it and they will come. That was a big risk that we took that maybe this industry, because we have so much to offer here, would grow if we had the infrastructure. But it's pretty clear that we've got here in Fayetteville, Fayetteville, not just in Northwest Arkansas, no, Arkansas, but in Fayetteville, the opportunity to capture those dollars that are not staying here now, and the talent and the crew, and build technical, permanent technical positions. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the council. Who? Allen. I'd just like to say that I think that this is a great opportunity, and I'll say that again. If I have to bet on any city in northwest Arkansas, it'll be Fayetteville any day. And I think that this could be a really good production and draw a lot of people to the city of Fayetteville. And I think that it also can create a larger opportunity for the artistic and creative community that we have here to actually have more jobs and retain people in the community more. So I'd like to make a motion to pass this resolution. And I'm excited to see this happen in Fayetteville. Okay. Hopefully. Thank you. I just keep thinking about our economic vitality plan, the Fayetteville First Plan, and how it designated arts and culture as our number one focus area that we really need to grow our economy. And I think this is right up that alley, and I think the numbers are very favorable. I think their estimates are conservative. So with that, I would like to second Alan's motion that we pass the resolution. Okay. What other final comments do we have? Matthew. Yeah, it wasn't until about 430 or so today that I decided to vote for this, and that was when I started talking with Devin about some of the numbers in more detail, and decided to vote against it at that point, but I didn't have my mind made up. I was just doing some math, and I just wanted to point this out. With a nine-month production timeline, assuming we gave them all the money at the very beginning of the production, and assuming we're not getting any HMR revenues, only the $709,000, That's a return on investment of almost 40% in the first year. It's like venture fund territory. So I think this is pretty cut and dried. I don't really care, or I shouldn't say I don't care. I am not so concerned with locating it here in order to make sure that it's here in terms of how the city is portrayed. I think they film on some other location. They're going to try to portray Fayetteville true to the script. The direct impact, you know, I was concerned a little bit about this may be seen as corporate welfare, but the direct impact of this is, I think, unquestionable. It seals the deal, so I can vote for this with very high confidence. Any other final comments? Now, Council, I will tell you how we got here. I was contacted a couple months ago or maybe longer about this chance to invest. Now, we have talked on this, Council. to make economic investment in this city. And I knew that the mayor and Chris did a fantastic job. The AEDC is behind this. And you make those kind of calls as a mayor to bring these kind of investments to you. Because if we're going to develop the economic engine of this city, we're going to have to make these type of investments. We made investments in Kessler Mountain. We made investments in Theater Square. This is another step in making investments in the arts. And I think we need to take this step. And I know somewhat it is a leap of faith somewhat. But I think we need to do this. You know, when we talk about this, we can just – not do anything and we just sit back. But this city is always on the cutting edge doing something new and thinking outside the box and pushing the envelope. And I think this kind of investment is going to be, it's not only just about the money, but it is going to highlight the city on a national level. And these are the kind of decisions we have to make. I wholeheartedly support this. I appreciate all the work from the A&P, and Devin, you've done a fantastic job. Paul, thank you for running the numbers. Chamber of Commerce, AEDC, Chris, you all have been wonderful to work with. And we know the governor's behind it. I know this thing is going to work. So, folks, let's make the investment and let's push this thing forward. All right. Having said that, Sondra, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. Thank you all very much. All right. Number six, an ordinance in Act 110.03, small cell facilities and networks, Chapter 110, telecommunication franchise bill posting and small cell facilities and networks. It is. Whereas the city has been approached by multiple telecommunication providers who are interested in erecting small cell facilities throughout the city to provide services to Fayetteville residents, and whereas it is necessary to balance the importance of ensuring residents have access to this important technology, the provider's interest in having a streamlined, consistent, and fair procedure and fees to install and maintain the facilities... the interests of the city and residents in responsibly managing the use of public rights-of-way and minimizing the aesthetic impact of small cell facilities now therefore be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville Arkansas section 1 at the City Council of the City of Fayetteville Arkansas hereby an act section 110.03 small cell facilities and networks in chapter 110 telecommunication franchise bill posting and small cell facilities and networks of the Fayetteville Code, as shown in exhibit A attached to and made a part hereof. Okay. Susan? Well, I'm certainly really excited about this topic. I've been waiting for it all evening, so thank you very much. As I mentioned when I brought this topic to you at the agenda session, there were several people on staff who worked together to recommend the language that Blake will then talk to you about in a few moments. But I really am excited about this topic, and I wanted to provide a little bit more background about the small cell technologies so that you all could speak to your patrons when they ask, what are they talking about? What do we mean by this next generation of technology? And so what I want to do is describe just a little background and ensure the council, the reason we're here tonight, after such a long agenda, why did we place this on the agenda for tonight? We're ready to roll. We want to begin to implement this technology in our city. And we want to do so in a proactive way to make sure our citizens can have the access to enhanced wireless services as soon as possible. And so when you think about the infrastructure that we're rolling out in this proposal, you that may have been and the council we've all talked about equitable access to broadband for me years and they will have uh... mayor has a digital inclusion plan this is one peace of that puzzle we've got broad-band networks that the city's in working on with our institutional network we have all kinds of capacity that we'd like to bring to the citizens and services on line this is one piece of that puzzle this is not an entire uh... network this is part of the telecommunications network uh... so as we understand from the various providers who have come to visit us and have put in uh... their requests for permits, some of the 4G, that's the current wireless network technology we talk about, has become saturated or is becoming saturated and then providers are wanting to build out the infrastructure in order to meet the demand with the current technology. And at the same time, what they'll be doing is building their infrastructure to meet the new next generation called 5G and that is just going to provide more capacity, more better service to citizens. We expect that deployment to begin around 2020. At any rate, and what that will mean, that deployment will mean to us as a city, that 5th generation or 5G network will have the capacity to enable our future transportation network innovations and really efficient and reliable service to our citizens. And then, as you know, after 5G is implemented, there will be whatever six or, you know, exponential G we will have after that. We've been doing a lot of research with different organizations over the past couple of years about this topic and what should cities in general, what should Fayetteville do to prepare for this technology. We work closely with next century cities. This is a really... great organization made up of hundreds of cities across the country. We share stories and are members of a network so that we can have weekly updates, white papers, webinars, podcasts. It's just a really informative group and the director of that group has helped directly with us as we have fielded questions to her. Her name is Deb Sochi. I think she's a really wonderful person to work with. We also work with the National League of Cities Information Technology Committee. They have been in the process. I'm on that committee for developing a municipal action guide on siting small cells across the country. We began work on that over two years ago, and it has become a longer project than we anticipated simply because it's a pretty complicated subject with lots of moving parts. But I think the ordinance that we're bringing for your discussion tonight will hopefully show that we've aggregated the research we could possibly get our hands on. But in a nutshell, we wanted to make sure we were reviewing our permitting process, and as far as what cities should do, we should really aggressively, as in all of our permitting process areas, look at streamlining, batch permitting, how we can turn things around in a timely manner. This is called the shot clock for permitting. Of course, for you all and for our city citizens, we want to manage our assets, and for our providers, we'd like to also identify those assets and make that information easily available to the vendors so that, for example, working with Keith's group and the GIS shop, we can make location, we can identify locations of city owned property poles and light poles and traffic signals that would most lend themselves to adaptability in this 5G environment. And so we want to make that information easily available to our providers. And we want to create partnerships with them because we want to enable them to implement this technology as quickly as possible. So those, the providers we're speaking of right now, we have heard from, we shared this draft ordinance with AT&T, Cox, Verizon, Extinet and Mobility and three of those providers provided impact input. We have gone back and forth with analyzing their ideas and trying to make sure we agreed and could bring those thoughts to you. What I wanted to do is share a few pictures, and I want to thank Keith Macedo very much for helping break down the visuals for these technologies. When you talk about small cell components, this is a picture not necessarily of what a pole might look like, although this one looks like this. It is to show you all of the different pieces of technology that go into making the service available. And so it's not just you don't put a simple little antenna on something. It requires all these components. You've got to have the antenna and the mount and the radio packs and the... electric meters and the breakout panels. So these are just different aspects of the things these small cell technologies are built of. And then I wanted to show just some examples of poles that different providers have brought to us and shown us in their presentations and how the poles are evolving over time. You can have as simple as a regular wooden pole that has these technologies on it in a location that you might feel it doesn't matter that it's a wooden pole with these technologies on it, or you can have any version of poles like these. This first one we're looking at is in Vegas. It's what they call a slick pole with attachments. stealth version on the right is just a variation and it shows how the attachments are becoming a little more hidden uh... this one is really sleek with the extension on a street light these two show extension on street light poles As you move on into today and the technologies that are being deployed in public places, especially where there is a need for density and more and more of them, they're becoming more stealth. And the one on the right shows really stealth implementation on a traffic pole. Other pictures would show, for example, this next one on the left. all the components are installed inside the pole. You wouldn't even know what you were looking at if you walked upon that. And then the same is true in that other component. stealth poll there on the right. It's just the way the technologies are evolving is what I wanted to show you over time. So all the providers we're talking with are talking about utilizing these different types of technologies and trying to make the best fit in the locations around town. But in our research, we wanted to make sure that we had addressed impact on right of way, appropriate and flexible fee structures, and particularly public safety, line of sight, pedestrian traffic and height. The density of small cells and the aesthetics, those go together. You want to make sure not only do you have the camouflage and the height and determine the type of pole retrofit versus new pole, but you want to make sure you don't populate a certain given block. I mean, think about where you live. and just look down the street, how many of these would you be able to tolerate to look at every day when you pull out of your driveway? And the relative need for the display of the poles and the aesthetics and the service that they provide. It's just, it's a toss-up. And so we wanna, in fact, enable our zoning and development administrator, currently that would be Andrew, to use some criteria and guidelines for making sure that we have these aesthetics and other considerations as well as service as he deliberates the permits that come in. And our ordinance did build in different considerations for public land right-of-way versus private. Finally, I'm going to conclude my presentation and ask Blake to talk about our ordinance. But I wanted to remind you all, we reviewed several cities. I mean, at least a dozen that I've looked at and all of us have looked at as many different ones as we could find information about. We preferred the Overland Park model as it varies upon the type of installation proposed and whether it's on private property or city right of way. As to costs and fees, there was a very wide range, and I'm gonna ask Blake to speak more to how he arrived at the fee structure for Fayetteville. But from the low end, the Little Rock AT&T sample ordinance with those figures for the city-owned poles, $200, Lincoln, Nebraska is a different animal. In Lincoln, they have lease agreements under their, they have very strict use codes for right-of-way and they have lease agreements with Verizon and actually also they just added, I spoke with the Lincoln, Nebraska CEO today and he mentioned they had added additionally, mobility and they believed they would have a third provider before the next month is over. But at these rates, at $1,500 permit fee and $1,995 per pole, but that's Lincoln and that's their standard and they have different right-of-way management system in place. Blake, I'd like to ask you to go ahead and I'll move the, I'll drive as you talk about the ordinance. You just nod at me and I'll move ahead. Before Blake starts, I'd like to thank him. As you all might be aware, the last few weeks I've been concentrating on trying to defend the Uniform Civil Rights Protection Ordinance, and that has caused a lot of time and effort in that, and so I just didn't feel like I could put the effort and concentration into this ordinance that it needed, and Blake has done that, and he is now the expert, and I will certainly defer to him in his presentation. Thanks, Mayor, Council. Blake Pennington, Assistant City Attorney. I gave a pretty in-depth presentation at the agenda session last week. I've whittled that down to three slides, so I hope it'll kind of condense it to the major issues that I think are going to come up tonight from the providers. Section 110.03C provides for a single application for up to 10 individual facilities of a similar type and size at a time within a seven-day period. Andrew thought that that was appropriate for the staffing levels so that they weren't overwhelmed. Subsection E, governs co-located facilities that would be small cell facilities on buildings towers poles streetlights etc there's an administrative approval process that we're recommending there is a The standard would be no higher than the top of a building and no further than the edge of the building, except that at one provider's request we have provided a variance procedure that would allow them to go 10 feet higher than the existing structure and 5 feet out from the side if they can prove that that is necessary to provide the services. Camouflaging and stealthing would be required for co-located facilities. Under the fee structure, we've got an application fee of $200 for the first facility, $25 for each additional facility, and an annual fee of $250 for any facility located on a structure in the public right-of-way. We also added in the latest iteration of this that non-franchise holders would provide the city with four pairs of dark fiber for public use at $2. Cox's request, I'm asking that you amend subsections E7 and F3, Right now it provides that if a provider doesn't have a city franchise, and we were told that there are some providers who have a state franchise but also pay city franchise fees. So we want to expand that to include an exemption for those who are paying city franchise fees, even though they don't necessarily have an agreement with the city. So at some point I would ask those two subsections be amended to add or does not pay franchise fees to the city pursuant to another agreement. Susan? Oh, I'm sorry. Next. Under subsection F, this would be new facilities in the public right-of-way, new poles, new towers, the integrated light poles that you saw in the pictures earlier. We have an administrative approval process that we're recommending for that. They would be required to comply with our current telecommunication franchise construction standards that are set out in 110.02. The fees for this, the same application fees, the annual fee for these would be $50 for each facility located in the public right-of-way. We understand that when they're building a new facility, the provider is bearing the cost of those structures, especially when it's not just a wooden pole, when it's a streetlight that has this technology included in it. and so we wanted to recognize their expense in that over the long term. Non-franchise holders would also be asked to provide four pairs of dark fibers for public use. Under the height limitation in this, we are recommending no more than 10 feet above the median height of other telecommunications facilities in the area, but not more than 30 feet anywhere. When we looked at other cities, there's a pretty broad range. Overland Park is the one that we recommended, have used pretty heavily. They use a height limitation based on street classifications. And in Overland Park, they say 50 feet in height for thoroughfares, along thoroughfares, 40 feet in height for collectors, 20 feet for residential streets. We could look at Little Rock where there's a 50 foot height limitation. San Antonio, Texas has a 30 foot limitation. Highland Park, Texas only permits facilities on existing poles. Houston, Texas has a 40 foot height limit. and Wichita, Kansas has a 40 foot height limit. So we're bringing to you the recommendation of 30 feet in part to encourage these providers to co-locate on other facilities rather than put new poles in our right-of-way. With the height issue, I know one of the issues that the providers have raised is the line of sight issue, and they need to get over certain structures in order to beam the raise of their services. uh and my understanding from meeting with these is you know they've identified a specific location that's kind of a sweet spot for their service but i also think that there's a certain amount of wiggle room so one one particular spot with a 30-foot pole may not work but if you move 50 feet over a 30-foot pole could be okay or they could find an existing structure and go 10 feet higher on that continuing in subsection f Camouflaging and stealthing would generally be required, although the zoning and development administrator can grant a variance if a standard wood pole wouldn't degrade the streetscape. However, there would be no variance for residential areas or improvement districts. We included a distance requirement of 500 feet between standard wood poles. There would be no limit other than the practical limits of how close the technology can be to another facility for stealth or camouflage poles. We've included an application time frame and a decision would generally be issued within 60 days as long as all of the information has been provided. Finally, under subsection G, for new small cell facilities on private property, we're recommending that they comply with our cell phone or cell tower requirements and obtain a conditional use permit. So if I could boil it down to four primary issues that I think you're gonna hear from the providers. One is fees, two is height, three is the distance between facilities, and four is the camouflaging and stealth requirements. And I'll be available for questions. Okay. And so just to conclude, conclude, again, we're trying to balance aesthetics and demand for the wireless technologies. We feel it's incumbent on us to help you all and the mayor determine fair market value for the use of our right-of-way for these facilities and provide an equitable process for the deployment so we can work with the providers to get on with it. Okay. What questions do we have for staff on this? Alan. Thank you, Mayor. I know that the first time I read through this and I emailed Susan back and I said, what does that mean? I felt like I was reading a technical manual from the Federal Communications Commission. But I think that any time we're dealing with aesthetics of this magnitude in the city, we should give our citizens a chance to fully understand it. I currently am very supportive of this, but I think one of the things that we could do tonight is leave this on this reading and take more public input because I don't know that the people in the community really understand the importance the impact that this will have on the aesthetics of Fayetteville as a whole. And when you just look at the controversy that comes up from installing one cell phone tower in the city of Fayetteville sometimes, those may be much larger, yes, but it's substantial discussion that comes from those things. So I think that leaving it on the first reading may possibly give us an opportunity to improve this even. But thank you for all the work you've done on this. It's been great and thank you Susan for reaching out to explain it as well. Yes, thank you Mayor. I was looking at the fees and I was surprised, I didn't know if we were not, that we were relatively so much lower than a place like Lincoln. I was wondering, do we have an estimate of how many customers a single pole might serve? I do not. That would be a good question for a provider in the room. Can anyone answer that? good afternoon good afternoon mayor and council my name is neil bora um i am the government relations manager for mobility for this market including northwest arkansas so as of right now the technology really isn't available to co-locate two small cells on one pole as you saw from this presentation there was a lot of equipment that needs to be either on the pole or in some sort of ground equipment we prefer to keep everything on the pool um Also, to make a comment about those pictures a little bit earlier, I mean, those are actual deployments. Deployments that you've seen are constructions, completes of these small cells that you see in 2017 and as technology evolves are a lot cleaner. They try to keep everything on the pole, less clutter in the right-of-way. There are different form factors for the equipment for all four different carriers, and we represent all carriers at some level or the other. Primarily our deployment in northwest Arkansas is for Sprint. And so I just want to make clear that everybody has a different deployment model. Everybody has a different form factor. But as of right now, for small cell technology, there isn't one pole that can hold two different providers. Okay, so for a normal pole that can be deployed today, roughly how many customers would it serve? What's the theoretical max? Of one pool? Yeah, correct. It's one provider. No, not provider. How many customers with a data plan could access it? Oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry. Well, I mean, for... These, okay, so that's a very difficult question, right? So small cell technology is to densify coverage in high density areas, high traveled areas, areas around the campus that you'll probably see some sites, areas around business districts. So it will be of service to people within that vicinity. It won't be like a traditional macro tower, which it protrudes to a large, you know, three, four miles of coverage. This will be between, it could be anywhere between 200 feet to 500 meters. And it really just depends on the line of sight, the height of the pole. Is there a maximum number of connections? Yes. I'm trying to get to a sense of what the utilization of the bandwidth on a... So if we put a small cell up, and this is very hypothetical, if we put a small cell up on a pole right outside... So I went to the law school, graduated 2014. If we went and put a... put a small cell up you would service everybody with sprint between there um everybody that's across garland everybody probably even up towards the campus but it would it's too it's too you know densify their coverage to give them better speeds and better coverage and it really just depends on you know i wish i could give you an answer for the amount of people it would cover but It depends on how much infrastructure is around, where the nearest macro tower is to that vicinity, and if there's any obstructions in the area. Obviously, some carriers have more customers in other areas than others, so there might be one provider that has 15 to 20 proposed sites. There might be one provider with four to five proposed sites based off of the constituency of its customers within that area. area okay well thank you so so i'm asking these questions i mean if we assume if we assume a uh a data plan costs somebody fifty dollars a month for easy math that's six hundred dollars of revenue a year and um i don't know we can't tell how many people might connect to these polls or what the value is but i mean if we're assuming there are a hundred or more people that are going to get a lot of value out of one of these polls that's uh sixty thousand dollars worth of revenue that might go to that. And I don't even, I'm not, this pure speculation, pure easy math, do not get the impression that these numbers might in any way be realistic. But to me, a fee of $250 initially or $50 annually seems extraordinarily magnanimous on the part of the city. So in any case, I think we've got a great ordinance. I'm really proud of staff and what you've pulled together and the research that you've done on other cities and the precedence that other cities have set where providers are actually doing installations. That indicates to me that we've got something that's very reasonable and realistic. And if there's carrier opposition to this proposal, I'm going to view it with a high degree of skepticism, I mean, based on that math. In general, someone suggested that maybe we needed to wait. I'm in favor of that. Okay. Anybody got any more questions? I think we want to hear from the providers. Is there a certain amount of time you want me to allot each provider? Okay. All right, everybody gets five minutes, so here we go. Hi, my name is Kathy for Acre. I represent AT&T in Northwest Arkansas, and we appreciate so much the time that staff has put in on the ordinance, and I feel like I'm raining on the parade to be here today to have issues with it and I hate that because for example Susan I've been talking about this since February trying to come up with the right ordinance and we want it to be right for Fedville but it's a very complicated issue like the gentleman was saying. technology prevents co-location on a small cell. And to help you understand when this would come into play, if you have a smartphone and you've got four bars and you're trying to download something and you're like, why does that thing just keep going round and round? I've got four bars. That's a capacity issue. In other words, the tower is full and you have to wait for somebody to drop off before it's gonna download what you're trying to look at. So the small cell just helps connect those customers that we already have. So that if they're downtown Fayetteville, there's a lot of activity, The network gets full. This just increases our ability to serve our customers. But since we can't co-locate, we have problems with the ordinance because co-location is all through the ordinance. And you even have to explain on every single application why you're not co-locating. Well, the technology doesn't allow it because you're using a spectrum that is just open to everybody. So there's interference if they are too close. And so what we would like to ask on behalf of AT&T and Verizon is next, at your next city council meeting, if we could do a joint presentation to the council with just a little bit more information, because apparently we haven't educated everybody to the right extent that we need. So that would be our request to the council. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Hi, I'm Susan Davis. I'm with Verizon Wireless. And I'd like to also thank you very much for bringing this together, especially Susan and Blake for putting all your hard work into this. We appreciate the city staff willing to accept some of the proposed changes that we've... helped with that we look forward and continue uh work closely with the city staff as well as members of the council to help get this approved we also what she had said we're trying to put something together to help explain kind of where we're coming from to present to you next next meeting We believe that this will give us ample time to prepare to discuss with you the industry's concerns. And we look forward to answering any questions that you have. Hopefully we'll have a lot more to give to you next week. Okay. Two weeks. Yes, two weeks. Thank you. All right. Who else would like to address this? Good afternoon again. My name is Neil Vora and I represent mobility So a particular concern for us are just a few things. I don't really have much of a concern with fees They are somewhat similar to what the Texas bill is requiring and I do find that they are Relatively fair again, and as He brought up the 500 feet rule between two structures that are holding this equipment. That's not based off of engineering. That's based off of pure, I assume, aesthetics or whatnot. But that should be relooked at because there's four different competitors, and they're all trying to get different types of areas where there might be high-density needs. Everybody doesn't have one structure. you know, one carrier. There's four different carriers that are trying to compete in a very competitive space. And so this 500 rule really restricts the amount, or restricts the ability for the end users, which are the citizens, to get the service that they really need. I do think that the height restricting at 30 feet, while I do understand that's also an aesthetic concern. Maybe the city of Fayetteville should look at some other models as well, where I know the state of Texas has regulated to, either the maximum of 55 feet, the lesser of either 55 feet or 10 feet above an existing structure within that same right-of-way. So that keeps you at a level where you're not seeing one structure 20, 25 feet above the existing infrastructure in the right-of-way. However, it does allow some leeway for our clients to get that line-of-sight technology for their antennas. And then just a As I want to echo the same comments of AT&T and Verizon, the co-locating issue is a big issue. And it's really not – this ordinance is written with the technology being available. As of now, it's not available. And as we are an infrastructure company, we would love more people on our pools. But that's just not available as of right now. So with that, I really appreciate your time tonight, and thank you very much. Thank you. Who else would like to address us on this? My name is Dave Reynolds. I'm with Smith Communications here in town. I just also wanted to say thank you. This is some ideas that we had talked to the city about in the past, is this kind of situation. It fulfills a very specific need in areas that areas of the city that companies like ours can't really fulfill with macro type towers. This is the answer to where that needs to be and now it's finally becoming available. to this area and we'd like to say thank you because that will help us tremendously and help the carriers that that we work with thank you all right who else would like to address this okay i'm going to bring it back to the council i assume you're going to leave us on leave this on this reading two weeks okay all right let's move to number seven An ordinance to amend 33.360, purpose and establishment, 33.361 composition and 33.364 meetings of article 24, town and gown advisory committee of the federal city code to expand the scope. Committee's duties to redefine the membership of the committee to better fit the new purpose and minimize redundancy of city and university staff. on the committee and to reduce the number of required meetings from four to two each year. Whereas the Town and Gown Advisory Committee, which was created on July 3rd of 2012 by Ordinance 5511, advises and makes recommendations on a periodic basis to the City Council and the University of Arkansas, And whereas the relationship between the city and university has strengthened through coordination and collaboration on many issues, and expanding the committee's scope to addressing community and neighborhood engagement will provide an opportunity for the committee to make an even broader impact. And whereas reducing the number of university and city staff members serving on all committees will reduce redundancy, increase efficiency, and amplify the voices of the stakeholders serving on the committee. Therefore, it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby repeal Section 33.360, purpose and establishment of Article 24, Town and Gown Advisory Committee, and act anew Section 33.360 as follows. There is hereby established a Town and Gown Advisory Committee. This committee shall be a forum for collaboration between the City of Fayetteville and the University of Arkansas on mutually relevant issues including, but not limited to, capital projects, transportation and traffic, infrastructure planning, neighborhoods, cultural and community engagement, safety, fire and security. The committee is empowered only to advise and make recommendations on a periodic basis to both the City Council and the University of Arkansas on such issues and to adopt rules for the conduct of its own business. Section 2. That the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby repeals Section 33.361 Composition Article 24 Town and Gant Advisory Committee and Act of News Section 33.361 as follows. Quote, the Town and Gown Advisory Committee shall be comprised of 12 voting members consisting of the following. Two permanent co-chairs, one of each, one of which shall be selected by the mayor and one of which shall be selected by the chancellor. One member shall be a member of the city council appointed by the mayor. One member shall be a University of Arkansas student living off campus in the city appointed by the mayor. Two members shall be citizens at large appointed by the city council. One member shall be the Associated Student Government President. Two members shall be the communication directors or their equivalents of the city and the university. One member shall be a representative of the University Facilities Management Department appointed by the Chancellor. One member shall be a representative of the City Development Services appointed by the Mayor. One member shall be the superintendent of Fayetteville Public Schools or his or her designee. Community members appointed by the City Council serving at the time and adoption of this ordinance shall continue to serve as voting members until the end of their term. The appointees currently serving as City Ward Representatives and the Business Owner City Development Representative shall be immediately converted to citizen-at-large positions. Staff members for either the University or the City serving at the time of the adoption of this ordinance shall not continue to serve unless appointed to fill a position above. Section 3, that the City Council, the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas hereby repeal Section 33.364 meetings and enact a new Section 33.364 as follows. Quote, the Town and Gown Advisory Committee shall meet at least twice per year at a time and place that is mutually convenient to the membership. The Town and Gown Advisory Committee may meet more frequently if needed. That's the end. Okay. Who has this? Mayor, I'll handle this on behalf of our Chief of Staff, Don Maher, and Laura Jacobs, Chief of Staff at the university. Laura was not able to make it tonight, but she did present to you all last Tuesday at the agenda-setting session. So it's pretty straightforward. I'll just entertain any questions. Okay. Ellen. Thank you. Susan, just one quick question, and I guess it's something for the council to think about as well. The two positions that would be at-large positions that the city council would appoint, I would think it might be a good idea to make those two at-large positions from different wards of the city so that we don't end up with two people, you know, that live in just a single pocket of the city on the commission and then have nobody from other areas to represent the city's needs on the Town and Gown Advisory Board. We didn't talk about that, and I couldn't imagine why anyone would object to that. I'm going to leave it up to you all. Okay. If that's the case, then I'd like to make a motion to amend... section D subsection 2 so that the two members citizens at large appointed by the City Council should be from two separate wards I'll second the motion I've been on this committee and I think that what it has done is open a lot of communication between the university and the city and it's very stagnant because of the overwhelming size so it's important that we get more efficient. I was taken by the surprise by this and I'm the city council member on it so let me just No one asked. We missed you last time. Well, I still have a phone, and I'm connected, and I'm chairman of the nominating committee who looks at who we appoint, so I was a little surprised. But needless to say, looking at this, it does handle a lot of the problems that we're having in this committee because of the scope being so broad we haven't been able to move forward from our initial activity. So I wanna say that I totally support this. Alan's point was gonna be what I was making. I was gonna actually say that maybe we should have one and three and two and four or something like that so we have a north and south or east and west because we do have to have representation in the community that's broader. So I appreciate that. So anyway, we're moving forward. I think that this is the right thing to do. I'm not sure that we have really met the initial reason that we set up this committee, and I'm not sure that this is going to do it, but at least this is a step in the right direction. So there you go. Okay. I do apologize. You weren't notified. Okay. So we have an amendment. Two members, two different boards. Correct? All right. Do we have any public comment on the amendment? Nope. Bring it back to the council. We have a motion and a second. Any discussion? All right. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh. Yes. Yes. Eddie. Yes. Yes. Okay. Do we have any other questions from the council or anything? I'm going to open it up for some public comment now. Anyone from the public like to address us on this? Okay. I'll bring it back to the council. Now, motion to suspend the rules and move to the second reading. Sarah? Second. We have a motion to second to go to the second reading. Sonja, would you please call the roll? Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Higgins? Yes. Eddy? Yes. Dutch? Yes. And no... I hear Jordan. Yes, that's right. Sorry. It's all right. An ordinance demands section 33.360, purpose and establishment... Section 33.361 composition and 33.364 meetings of article 24 town and gown advisory committee of the Fayetteville City Code to expand the scope of the committee's duties to redefine the membership of the committee to better fit in the new purpose and minimize redundancy of city and university staff on the committee and to reduce the number of required meetings from 4 to 2 each year Okay, here we are Sarah? Move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Do we have a second? I'll second that. Okay, we have the motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Higgins? Yes. Eddy? Yes. Batch? Yes. Mayor Joyner? Yes. Yes. In order to amend Section 33.360, Purpose and Establishment, Section 33.361, Composition, and 33.364, Meetings of Article 24, Town and Gown Advisory Committee, of the Fayetteville City Code. to expand the scope of the committee's duties, to redefine the membership of the committee to better fit the new purpose, and to minimize redundancy of city and university staff on the committee, and to reduce the number of required meetings from four to two. And I will remove one of the four I's for minimize and spell it correctly. Thank you. Okay. Any final comments from the council? All right. Senator, would you please call the roll? Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Huffington? Yes. Eddy? Yes. Batch? Yes. OK. Number eight, resolution to adopt the 2018-2022 five-year capital improvements plan. Paul? Just have a few comments. We had an expanded discussion at the agenda session about the plan. First, it is a plan. It's not an appropriation, not a budget, subject to change yearly, as we normally do and discuss adjustments to that. The funding of the plan is available resources for funding, $112 million. Almost $35 million of that or over 30% is for water and sewer infrastructure improvements. That's to be understood because of their infrastructure and capital needs. $16 million for transportation, that's 14% of the total capital plan. $18 million in vehicle and equipment replacement. That spans every operation in the city. Public safety, $12 million in investments in the safety equipment, technology equipment for public safety. It shows our commitment to public safety and to technology and protection of our police and fire firefighters. There's $6 million allocated to parks, $7.5 million allocated to trails. That's 82% of the entire capital plan. This year we sent the capital plan to all the council members. Thank you for your response. We got that response. We discussed it. Lionel considered all of your comments. They were well taken. Based on that, we adjusted the original draft that you looked at to add a half a million dollars into a Hanson upgrade or the equivalent with another system for work order and permitting systems is primarily for the building permitting systems. We know that needs some upgrade and some functionality. So we heard that and incorporated it into the plan. Increase the drainage, increase for drainage work by $200,000. That's certainly been a major topic, something we've discussed many times, and we thought that was well taken. We deferred a parks master plan. for that. We felt that the master plan could be deferred. I think our number one objective at this point in time has to be the completion of the regional park. We do have money in for improvements at the community parks, but until we get further along with that, we thought a master plan could in fact wait. We Also heard the need for sidewalks, we increased sidewalk program by $100,000 in a 2018 budget. Took that from the street overlay project. We also heard several of you indicate if we choose to do traffic calming, the Transportation Committee or the Council wants to do some traffic calming, where would it take from because we don't have no appropriation for that. I'll just draw your attention on page 8 of the plan. We've expanded cost sharing right away in intersection – cost sharing plans to include street calming if you wish to use it for that. There's $100,000 in that per year for those type of programs. Unfortunately, we can't afford to fund everything. We also always have more needs that we have to look at other funding mechanisms later. Those unfunded requests were $124 million to highlight them. Estimated $36 million for police headquarters, which would consolidate all of the officers in one area, bring all the equipment, all the storage, etc. We certainly understand that we have an old facility where they're housed currently. $11 million for a radio replacement system. We're gonna have to look at exactly when, we don't know, but that's gonna be costly. We need to start thinking about that at this point in time. We have requests for a fire station, apparatus, completion of training ground from the fire department for $13 million that we couldn't fund at this point in time. So that's something we're gonna have to think about funding at a point. $21 to complete the regional park. We're going to have to talk about how we're going to come up. $21 million. I'm sorry, Lionel. It's been a long night. $21 million to complete the regional park. We're certainly going to have to look at all methods available to get that complete, and we're certainly proud of what we've done on the regional park so far, but we certainly haven't financed the completion of that. There were also roughly $37 million worth of road projects identified by the engineering department, the largest of which would be the completion of Ruppel Road, which would complete the box that we've talked about. before so there are funding needs out there however I think our plan and setting the priorities for 120 112 million dollars are out there hopefully you've had sufficient time to look at that we've received your input and with that we're presenting that plan again that's the starting point for the budgets always subject to adjustment during that budget year I'll be happy to take any comments Okay. Questions, I should say. All right. Who wants to be first? Something's not working. Did you have, oh, okay. I thought you had a bunch to speak. All right. Well, all right. Is there any public comment on it then? All right. Then I will bring it back to you. Oh, we got one right here. Oh, we got one. Okay. Almost made it. Okay. Right up. My name's Richie Lamb. I'm a Fayetteville resident. I'm also the chairman of our Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, and I've been in that role for at least three years. As you are aware, we did make a recommendation for up to $200,000 to be added to the CIP for parks for a new Parks and Recreation Master Plan. And y'all spent a lot of money tonight. I know what y'all are going through when it comes to budget, and certainly y'all have to take a lot of things into consideration that we don't because we're focused just on the parks. So I think the best thing that I could say to you is that there's $6.5 million in capital improvement plan for parks. And all of that's based on information from 2002. And I have to, along with our other board members, I have to meet with the staff every month. And sometimes we ask them questions and we get answers that refer back to that. So I think at this point, the best thing I could tell you is that we're not asking to increase the overall plan. We'd like you to consider taking out some of the existing plans. improvements that are on there. There's two items that I can think of that are approved in the plan. One is $90,000 for new lights at the tennis courts at Wilson Park and then there's I believe $135,000 for improving one of our existing basketball courts and those are two things that we feel like we could to a later time because we feel so strongly that we need a new master plan because quite honestly we don't know if we're making improvements to existing facilities that we don't even need anymore or they might be needed in a different location and that's the kind of information that we would get from the plan so um and then the last thing i'd like to say is that we are going to support whatever decision that you make and we thank you for putting so much thought into thank you Chuck Maxwell, also on the Parks Board. Again, this is about giving us a tool to put back in our toolbox and allow us to include the citizens in the community to have the opportunity to look at and give us their ideas of what's important and give us an opportunity to have that guidance as to what is important for all of us in the community for our parks. Thank you. Okay, anybody else? Okay, going to bring it back to the council. Sarah. Yes, I'd like to ask the chair of the Parks Board to clarify. The two expenditures that you wanted to pull were $90,000 for new lights at the tennis courts, and did you say $135,000 for improvements to the basketball courts, thus totaling over the $200,000 request? Yeah, I'm going to pull that up real quick. So what is currently on the plan being proposed is for 2018. Connie has the magic. She definitely does. Oh, there it is. She may get real mad at me for doing this. Yeah, and actually, Connie would prefer to answer that. It doesn't necessarily have to be you. You just brought up the point. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah, we have $135,000 for the Wilson Basketball Court replacement. Okay. And it is in bad shape. We know that. Um, there's also $91,000 for replacing existing lights on the tennis courts there. So those are, those combined are over what we're asking for. And like I said, we, we, without that, without going through that process, and it does take several years, um, to go through it, we, we honestly are looking at each other in the meetings saying, man, we don't, we don't even know if we're spending money on something that... You know, we may not even necessarily need or we may need ten tennis courts over there. We don't even know. Right. I mean, we know what we think we know, but we feel like we learn a lot from having a third party who has a lot more resources than our current staff does. And certainly the board members do give us that information. Thank you. Thank you. As a big proponent of long-range planning and data-driven decision-making, I think that it would be wise for us to strongly consider this very reasonable request you know when when we're talking about a master plan or you know they're using data from 2002 that was the year I moved away from Fayetteville because I didn't like the trajectory the city was taking we're a very different place now and our growth patterns have really changed the dynamic in our city and we need new data to reflect that so you know I would hope that we could table Table this discussion until we have more council members here to approve such a big Long-range plan, but I would like us to put some serious consideration into honoring parks request Okay Thank You mayor one Do you mind if I ask Connie a question? Connie I have a quick question because I know a lot of times when we put money into older courts like the basketball courts It could be due to safety issues and lights, sometimes we have matching grants that go into that as well, and we don't wanna leave money on the table. Are those the situation with either one? Well, the courts are actually, the basketball courts are in disrepair. I mean, there's a lot of the concrete start, or the asphalt's starting to break up and stuff, and it is highly, highly used. The tennis courts are old lights that we've had up for, Well, when I was here in 82, it's the same lines. So, you know, they're just needing to be updated. So, you know, that's the problem. You know, you get new parks, but you have the old parks that keep needing to be renovated. So it's a hard balance. All these things are important to different citizens for different reasons. Thank you, Connie. The other thing, Mayor, I'd just like to mention is, and I know we don't have the money in this five-year CIP plan to do it, but I am really excited that we'll have a bond issue coming up to resolve some of the other topics. And I think that the other section of Ruppel Road will be a major, major economic driver for the city, and I think it will be the next thing that will help alleviate the traffic patterns on the west side of town. So I'm hoping that we can include that after we have a bond issue. I got it. Thank you. I'm following. I understand. Okay. Mark. As we're looking at this as a long-term plan, I can understand the need for this. But also, it's a long-term plan, so if we're removing this out of next year for the basketball court that is disintegrating, because I live right over there and I walk by it every day, that's putting it into a long-term situation. So, again, I'd like to... Look at evaluate this to see where we can adjust But in five years there's not going to be any concrete on that the way that it's eroding on the north side And it's not safe I watch the kids that run across there or you know where it's eroding Next to the tennis courts and then also the lights are concerned because there are old mercury lights we need LED lights there that probably can pay for themselves and So give us some time to look at this and juggle a little bit. Paul, do you have an idea here? I have a suggestion. As we said, this is subject to adjustment every year at budget time. Right. That's going to be in roughly November. We can take that up at that point in time when we talk about the specific budget. Or if you want to hold the plan, we can hold the plan up for it, but these are rather specifics that we do consider for adjustments. So I'll bend to whatever you would like to do, but that would give Connie the opportunity to study a particular issue and see what her suggested adjustment would be and where they stand on that. That's a suggestion to her. Like I said, we adjust this each and every year. That would give ample time to analyze possibilities. Mr. Mayor? Matthew's next. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see that. Thank you, Mayor. I think that we should do the Parks Master Plan on that particular issue, and I have The police take home vehicles program, is that funded by the sales tax revenues or impact fees or something else? Is it eligible for shifting over to the parks master plan? At this point in time, I believe it's in. So it's fungible with the parks master plan? Pardon? It's fungible with the parks master plan? No. I'll have to look at it to tell you the truth, Matthew. Okay. I can't remember. Well, I was going to have to look at it. That's why I asked. It's at the top of my head. There's nothing. Okay. Well, Sarah, hold on to that. He's going to be. I'm going to give him an email. Sarah, what? Mr. Lamb, were you trying – is it okay if he comes back up if you speak very briefly? Yes. Thank you so much for allowing me to come back up. Okay. the bond issue, when you talk about things like that, I would be extremely concerned if we were talking about asking for something like that from our citizens and we were not prepared as a department with something like the master plan. Well, that's why we have the department head sitting right there that makes those kind of recommendations to the mayor. It is in sales tax capital. Okay. So, yeah. I understand we're probably going to table this tonight. I'm not going to push a motion right now, but I want to signal that I would be willing 100% to divert funds from the take-home vehicles program into doing a parks master plan over the 2018-2019 year. I think the Claims of benefits from the take-home program are tenuous anyway, but more than that, I think that if we're going to push a bond issue, we need to have that information. I think it might be a little bit irresponsible of us to push a parks improvement list and a bond issue on a vote that's probably going to put us in debt service. If the last was any indication for more than 15 years, I think that decision has a lot of weight to it, and we should be as informed as possible. So I think that's very important, and I don't think that development of sports facilities at the regional park is our number one priority as a city with respect to park development. I think it's a priority, but it's not my highest priority, and I would speculate that if we surveyed the citizens, it would be a priority but not their number one priority as well. There are a lot of parks throughout the city. for different neighborhoods, for people with different needs, for people with different interests. And it's not right that we're a city that values parks so much, so much. And we're working on information that was last pulled together in 2002. And look what we've done with it. I mean, Kessler Park, that wasn't in the plan, right? Wasn't in the plan. It's a great idea, you know, and we went for it. And I don't have any regrets about that. But I have no idea what other opportunities or needs we've missed that are so much smaller, that are so much more neighborhood-oriented. And so it's a priority for me. And if we were going to target something, I'm very reluctant to pull basketball resurfacing or tennis court lights from downtown. which are needs we have identified without having an up-to-date plan we already know their needs i'm very reluctant to cannibalize other parts of the of our parks programming to pay for a master plan but if if there's a piece of the cip that i am reluctant to fund is that take-home vehicle program and and you know i'm not saying cut it entirely it's a 500 000 program in the cip right now um You know, there's a compromise split to do that and to get a little bit of that and the parks plan. And that would be what I'd suggest in two weeks. CHAIRMAN BRYANT LORENZO. All right. Allen. MR. And, Mayor, I know you always look for input from everybody and try to draw some consensus. I'd like to say that I had a similar concern about the take-home vehicle plan, and I'd like to see us look at using those funds differently. VICE CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, why don't we just table this for a while so we can kind of... get our head wrapped around it. Okay? We'll bring you something back. Sarah, I see you. Yes, regarding the take-home vehicle program, I'm also not convinced that that is the best investment in our officer retention. And I would like to hear from our police department what if they could survey their officers and see what might be more effective substitutions for that program? I think he can address this pretty quick. Because I do believe we need to invest in keeping our officers and... So I can tell you that far and away from anything else when it comes to recruiting and retention, the most common thing we hear by far is the take-home vehicle program. Springdale has it, Rogers has it, Bentonville has it, the county has it, state police has it. Most everybody we compete with has it. So it is, like I said, by far and away, the most common thing we hear that they have it, you don't have it. And also we have a council member that's very passionate about that, that is not here tonight. That's what I'm saying, my champion's not here tonight. So, okay, all right. Thank you. Allen, Chief. Sorry, my mic wasn't on. If I could ask just a quick follow-up. What percentage of our police force has take-home vehicles, though? I think right now we're currently not counting canines because they're very specific. They can't be used for anything else. I think just take-home patrol cars, I believe we have eight. Okay. The officer has to live in the city limits, and they have to be here, have to be at the police department for at least a year before they're eligible. And how many patrol officers do we have? Okay. that drive police cars somewhere around 65 to 70. i think last year we done a little survey if we were going to furnish everybody that fit those cloth cases live in the city and had at least a year we need 23 more vehicles to to make it 100 everybody which would cost a lot of money And that's one of the reasons I think it's a program that may not fit Fayetteville just right, because it only serves a very small segment of our police force. And if we're looking at raising salary to compete, according to the study that was done, I'd rather pay people more. I think they'd rather be paid more than get a take-home vehicle. But that's just my two cents. I mean, that's where I would be if I were in their spot. But if we only have eight... out of the 68 to 70 police officers, then that seems like it's not serving a large percentage of the police force. Just my two cents. That'll be a wonderful discussion when we come back. I think from what I can tell from what I'm hearing tonight, the Parks Master Plan is something that you all are interested in. So we'll go back. We'll look at that. The police take home. You have some concerns about that, but I want the council member that is very passionate about this program to be here before we just decide to do something with it. But you're still interested in the tennis court lights and the... I mean, those are things... I know what you're talking about because I saw those courts in there and had a check. yes and has our sustainability office looked for incentives for lighting um because that seems like something that we could find some funding for to upgrade those lights somewhere in some other capacity so i think we've got a lot of information that we need to i think you need to i do appreciate y'all's input in this i really do so that helps us so we'll go back we'll look at some more stuff we'll look at the plan we'll look how we can possibly look at funding that. We'll bring you something back. I don't know. When do you want to see it again? Two weeks, I'm sure. Okay. Yes. We'll go to work on it tomorrow. Okay, so I guess I need a motion and second to table indefinitely. Oh, do we have, oh, Matthew, do you have something else? Move the table for two weeks. Two weeks? Yeah, you're not off the hook, Paul. Oh, Sarah? Second. We have a motion and second to table for two weeks. And we'll look at the Parks Master Plan and the Take-Home Vehicle Program, just for starters. Okay. Sundridge, please go on the roll. Long? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Cannon? Yes. Eddy? Yes. Batch? Yes. Okay, number nine, an ordinance to amend 34.27 Salem Municipally Owned Real Property of the Federal Code, KIPP. Whereas Act 470 of 2017 has placed a new requirement that, quote, municipal real property shall not be sold without competitive bidding if the amount exceeds $20,000, unquote. And whereas the city should reference these new requirements in ACA 1454 302 in the Fayetteville Code and remove any and all conflicting provisions within our current Code Section 34.27. Now therefore it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville Arkansas Section 1 that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville Arkansas hereby amend Section 34.27 sale of municipally owned property by repealing subsections D and E. and enacting a new subsection D as follows, quote, all sales of municipally owned real property shall comply with the requirements of ACA section 1454302 as currently enacted and as may be amended in the future. I was enjoying some light and easy and fun reading of the Acts of Arkansas for 2017. They're about 1,200, 1,300, I guess. I don't know. Anyway, it came to 470 and I almost fell out. It had been kind of hidden away in the code, but all of a sudden it now requires that I We must have competitive bidding for the sale of any property that's $20,000 or more. We were ahead of the curve a few years back when we required that ourselves. And then we took it out because we found it was kind of difficult to really do that satisfactory with all kinds of property. But now the legislature has followed our lead and enacted in state law, so we now must follow the state law. What I did in our code is I left all the notice requirements and the fact that you could think about rezoning if you wanted to and appraising it if you wanted to that are in the first three subsections. But the two subsections that I think we must repeal actually conflict with the law. One allows a realtor to sell. That's what we had to enact in order to get the Gully Park land sold. And so we just need to repeal those two and put this new subsection D in. One other problem this has, in that Act 470, it talks about exchanging property. Now, I don't know how you competitively bid exchanging property. And, you know, we've been looking at trying to work with the university on potential exchange of property or something. And now, frankly, I don't know how you're going to do it. I don't know how you can competitively exchange property. But I guess they didn't think about that when they were enacting this. So at this point, that's why I presented it to you. And, you know, kind of another explanation of Paul's every monthly report. Well, that was another one of those little acts of Arkansas that just kind of appeared. Because I guess somebody heard that we wanted to hear Paul not every quarter, but every month. And, you know, so he has pulled down there to legislature, so he got that act passed. And so now we get to hear him every month. Okay. What questions do we have from the city council? Yeah. Yeah. I don't have, I mean, because it's sale, I don't have really an argument for or against the ordinance itself. I did want to ask an absurd question and maybe get some clarity on its impact. If we offered up a piece of land, city on land for competitive building, bidding, and we got, you know, a response that was ten times higher than the next lowest and it was from an oil refinery with no pollution controls. And we got the next lowest bid was for some rainbow-powered solar cell manufacturing facility. Would we be able to consider the impacts of the highest bid and reject it and take the next lowest bid? In that scenario, I think we have real problems. You know, I think that just like when we looked at the come and go in the Casey's, I said You know, you could consider something besides cash. Of course, that's when it was our own rule and not the state rule. Right. But I said it if the cash would have to be pretty close Before you could do that and it was in fact very close there and because I think they offered to build a lead building and some other things like that that The City Council decided to award it to come and go even though Casey's had bid slightly higher And I think that was probably okay this state law is even different than our normal competitive bidding law when you're buying stuff. Because then it can be waived by the city council, you know, if it's impractical and infeasible for competitive bidding. This has no waiver provision in it. So it does make me nervous about not going with the high bidder. I think that... I would probably, if we found ourselves in a situation like we did between Casey's and Cummingsville, still say that you have a little wiggle room, but you don't have a giant amount. The only benefit to that is I don't think maybe we're going to zone land that would allow such an oil refinery operation. construction. I hope not. Andrew's told me they're banned throughout the city. Is that right, Andrew? In your memo, you said something that made me wonder if, you said we can consider the intended use, and so I'm trying to explore that a little bit. Could we offer land for sale for a provider, for providers to bid on, providers of particular services? Could we say, for example, to continue this, you know, my absurd questioning, could we say, for example, we have a piece of land. We want to have the largest solar facility in the state. Who wants to bid to provide a solar facility? I think the only way you could do that would be indirectly by zoning it for the kind of use you want. And, you know, as you know, and you could actually potentially even zone it as a planned zoning district. So, you know, if you really wanted some sort of facility with a very limited use, then you could try that. It makes me a little nervous, though, because that's a little bit, you know, if we put too many restrictions on it, I can see somebody saying, well, you're not really competitively bidding it. You know, you're bidding it just so this one entity can get it. So that's... That would make me concerned, but you can at least restrict the uses legitimately by having a zoning district that would at least allow the kind of use you're looking for and wouldn't allow uses you would not be happy with. Okay, thank you. Anybody else? I would say that since we might have something coming before us after this, we might want to go to the second, third reading so we can get this out of the way tonight. Okay, well... do we have any public comment on this well i'm going to break bring this cheery little item back to the council now and uh alan i'll make a motion to suspend the rules and move to the second reading we have a second second okay who's got it man it's a hat trick all right matt has it all right sunday would you please call the road long yes marsh yes yes yes yes yes mayor jordan yeah And the ordinance to amend Section 34.27, sale of municipally owned real property of the Fayetteville Code. Allen. Motion to suspend the rules and move to the third and final reading. I'll second that. All right. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Higgins. Yes. Petty. Yes. Hutch. Yes. Mayor Jordan. Yes. And the ordinance to amend Section 34.27, sale of municipally owned real property of the Fayetteville Code. Okay, any final comments from the council? I'm not even going to start tonight. I think this is a really bad law, by the way. I'll just leave it at that. There you go. All right. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Hinton. Yes. Petty. Yes. Hutch. Yes. I must say, I was not very happy when I found this law. I know you're not. I'm not very happy either with all that. Anyway, on we go. All right, number 10. Thank you all, by the way. A resolution authorized Mayor Jordan to sell about 9.6 acres of city property on the Commerce District to his highest or best better. Yes, Mayor, Councilman, my name is Devin Howland, and this was our first time with this new change with Act 470. However, given the time period, I'm in awe. I do want to thank your staff for helping us make this happen. We did not receive any bids. No bids? No bids at all on this parcel, so I'd like to request it be tabled indefinitely, and we will continue to work to adapt and draw people to our college park. All right, then. I need a motion and a second to table indefinitely. Sarah. I move we table indefinitely. Allen. Second. We have a motion to second to table indefinitely. I'm sorry I did not take any public comment. Would you like to address us on this? Please come up to the mic. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South City Lake Road. I rent this parcel that has been posted for sale. I live at 2351 South I have rented this for almost 40 years. I'm the one that makes it saleable for you all because I spend thousands of dollars, not in rent that I pay you, brush hogging it and mowing it. And that's how that land gets sold is it's open and it makes people interested in it. So that it was posted on the land that it was to be sold tonight to a company that was going to pay $16,000 an acre for it. So are you all saying that that sale is gone? Yeah, that sale is gone. Okay. So it's still for sale at $20,000 and now has to be bid if it's above that, am I understanding correctly? That's right. If it's more than $20,000... Well, see, there are several acres on there, and so you have to value the parcel as a whole. So it's certainly going to be above 20, so it has to be open for, if the city council wants to sell it, it has to be put out for public bid. And this has nothing to do with the other land that you recently sold. No, fortunately that was done before this law took effect. And so we actually had the power to do that back then. But after all this time. We don't have that anymore. So the land across the street from where I live, which also sold for only $15,000 an acre, does go forward. Yes, that was right because that pre-deceit was in front of this, was sold and arranged to be sold prior to this act going into effect. So we weren't bound by this act for that land. I would like to just in general say that when these sales happen, it won't maybe matter anymore, except that this piece hasn't sold. But I've been maintaining a lot of land for 40 years that actually belongs to the city, and that's been a great pleasure. But it would be nice to receive some kind of notice instead of just a walk out one day and there's a sign posted. I mean, it would be nice to know that someone is bidding on it or that someone expects to sell it because it causes, you know, some discord. And, you know, there's nice things that are happening in the city. In relation to this, I'd just like to mention that Town Branch is a really pretty little creek. and maybe Parks and Recreation could think of something to do for these lower income houses that are causing some discord in the planning for the city. I see those kids standing on the street and walking around And maybe they don't have the money to play tennis or do more expensive things, but they do like those trails. And older people like the trails. And so maybe just, you know, give them some money to work on Town Branch because your city land goes right to some really pretty areas. Thank you. I will tell you, Elizabeth, you should have gotten at least a prominently displayed sign on the property that the city was considering selling that. Uh-oh. Okay, we need to look into that. You're welcome. Okay. We have a motion and a second to pass to table indefinitely. All right. Any final comments on that? You have mine. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Long. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Indian. Yes. Teddy. Yes. Patch. Yes. Okay, that concludes our business. What announcements do we have? Everybody's too tired to make any announcements tonight. Okay, Susan. Yes, go ahead. Okay. Now, aren't you glad you came, Garner? Whoops, I didn't have my microphone on. I'm sorry. And if you all, I'm sure you did visit with him earlier. And to let the public know, Garner joins us. from recently most recently from Austin Texas after a 40-year career in management of planning programs in Boulder Colorado Lincoln Nebraska Lawrence Kansas Oklahoma City in Austin Texas so we're really excited to have Garner and looking forward to working with him I have a few other announcements The public is invited to provide feedback on the purpose, goals, and scope of the city's energy action plan.
