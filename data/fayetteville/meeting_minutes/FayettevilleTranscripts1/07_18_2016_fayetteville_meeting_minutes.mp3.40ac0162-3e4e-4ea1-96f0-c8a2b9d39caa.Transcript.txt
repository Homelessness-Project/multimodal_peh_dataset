 Here, would you join me in the Pledge of Allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Okay, the first order of business we have tonight under City Council main presentation reports and discussion items is a report from Ozark Regional Transit. I believe. Thank you, Mayor. Can y'all hear me good? Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the council. My name is Jeff Hatley. I'm with Ozark Regional Transit. I wanted to compliment y'all on your renovations in here. This is beautiful. Also, while I was waiting, I noticed that you had the 2030 goals, and number four on there was we will grow a livable transportation network. I'm happy to report tonight that your public transportation part of that puzzle is growing. We are at our six-month deadline. milestone here through 2016 and the fixed route system in Fayetteville has grown by nine percent compared to 2015's numbers at this time. The fixed route overall has also grown at nine percent. In Fayetteville, the paratransit, which is the vans, curb-to-curb service, has grown 22 percent and overall in the system it's grown by 6% so that's probably the biggest increase here in Fayetteville. Overall with the fixed route and the paratransit band curb to curb service, it's grown 10% in Fayetteville since this time last year or at the same point this in 2015 and 9% overall. Another large increase is the number of bikes we've been carrying. In May, we had a record number of bikes at 727. And then June of this year, we set another record at 911. So that's increasing quite a bit. Other than that, I will just open it up to any questions, comments, concerns. What questions do we have? Anything? John? John? Good evening, Mr. Hatley. I'm pleased to hear that you're growing. We always like our enterprises to grow. Can you tell me how you compute the growth rate? When you say it's grown by 6%, it's grown by 11% or 20%, are those new people, new riders, or are those the same old riders riding more often? It's just ridership. Right, so it could be people just repeating. It could be the same people riding more often, or it could be additional riders. Okay, so you could have no new customers. Correct. You could just have old customers riding more. Yes, that's possible. Thank you very much. Okay, any other questions? Okay, well thank you very much and thank you for your service to the city. Thank you. Okay, next order of business we have tonight is the consent agenda. Number one, approval of July 5, 2016 City Council meeting minutes. Number two, a resolution to approve a two-year contract with Allison Architects Incorporated for Professional Architectural Services for the Woolsey Homestead Historic Restoration Project in the amount of $15,000 for Phase 1 in 2016. And in the amount of $35,000 for Phase 2 in 2017, contingent upon approval of 2017 annual city budget. Number three, a resolution to approve the 2016 Community Development Block Grant CDBG Action Plan to authorize the mayor to execute the CDBG agreement for 2016 when received in the amount of $619,098 to approve the 2016 through 2025 year consolidated CDBG plan and to approve budget just contingent upon receipt of the grant funds. Number four, resolution to authorize acceptance of the Arkansas Firewise Grant from the Arkansas Forestry Commission in the amount of $500 for use by the fire department and to approve a budget adjustment. And number five, a resolution to approve the purchase of office furnishings from Interplan Incorporated DBA Interplan Office Interiors in the amount of $64,491.62 pursuant to a state procurement contract for the Recycling and Trash Collection Division, DELTA. that we accept this agenda as presented. Sarah? Second. We have a motion and a second to accept the consent agenda as read. Senator, will you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. OK, thank you all very much. Under unfinished business, we have none. Under new business. We have one item. An ordinance rezone that property describing was on the petition RZN 16-5442 for approximately 99.10 acres located at 2514 West Flory Road from RA Residential Agricultural, RSF 1 Residential Single Family, one unit per acre, and RSF 4 Residential Single Family, four units per acre, to NC Neighborhood Conservation, RA Residential Agricultural, and NS Neighborhood Services. Kip. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby changes the zone classification of the property shown on the map, Exhibit A, and the legal description, Exhibit B, both attached to the Planning Department's agenda memo, from residential agricultural, residential single-family one unit per acre, and residential single-family four units per acre, to neighborhood conservation, residential agricultural, and neighborhood services. Section 2, at the City Council, the City of Fayetteville Arc, so I hereby amends the official zoning map of the City of Fayetteville to reflect the zoning change provided in Section 1. chair good evening mayor members of the council this property has been seen before recently as a rezoning request it's approximately 99 acres north of mount comfort road west of dean solomon road here on the aerial photograph you can see this is the old razorback golf course which is encompassed here south of anac drive the boundary being approximately in this location to the west and then along dean solomon road um The City Council denied a rezoning for this particular piece of property several months ago, and this is a different applicant with a different request. This particular zoning is essentially a bound. It does not include the exact same property. you can see in the rezoning exhibit that is a request to rezone the creek section clabber creek traverses across this property and that particular piece of property which is about 11.6 acres is requested to be rezoned residential agricultural the 72 acres south of that is requested to be rezoned to neighborhood conservation and then to the very south of the property this 14.8 acres is requested to be rezoned to neighborhood services For the areas proposed, neighborhood conservation staff felt that this zoning was compatible with the surrounding residential properties to the north, east, and also to the west. And I will get to a zoning exhibit here. So you can see this particular property to the east is rezoned or zoned for residential development as part of a planned zoning district. The majority of property surrounding this is rezoned or is zoned RSF4 with some spots of residential single family eight units per acre as well. To the south, the request for neighborhood services. That is one of our form-based zones. It allows for single-, two-, and three-family development as well as some very small-scale commercial uses. This is adjacent in particular to an existing facility Two and three family residential development zoned RT-12 along Dean Solomon Road, as well as some other residential and agricultural type uses, including a manufactured home park along Mount Comfort Road. um additionally to the to the east you all have seen other rezoning requests in the form of the car dealership that's been expanding within this area as well as other c2 and other requests in this area the proposal we believe is consistent with the future land use plan designation along for the natural area along Clyburn Creek. RA is the closest zone we have to conserving those types of land. It allows for very low density, if developed at all, two units per acre. I'm sorry, one-half unit per acre. And so we felt that was justified and compatible as well. On June 13th, the Planning Commission reviewed this request. At that meeting, there were three members of the public that spoke in opposition to the rezoning. The primary items of discussion included the same items we discussed the last time, increased density, flooding, traffic, and a lack of adequate street infrastructure. The Planning Commission also discussed with the applicant a desire for more variety. At that time, the entire property was being requested to be rezoned, neighborhood conservation. So a revised proposal was submitted, including the residential agricultural as well as the neighborhood services to the south. Planning Commission voted 8 to 1 in favor of this request at the June 27th meeting with no public comment presented at that meeting. I would note in the last few days we've received several emails, as you may have as well, from neighbors, some of which could not attend tonight. So because this is a large property, I would request that you not make a final decision tonight on this particular rezoning. You'll also note that a lot of those emails referred to a bill of assurance and, you know, What if, factor if a bill of assurance were offered. A bill of assurance has not been offered on this property, so I just want to make sure that's clear. It's unlike the last rezoning that you all saw that had a bill of assurance limiting the number of units. And so the density essentially would be... limited by the zoning that's on the property and the maximum density that would be allowed. Of course, you have to exclude floodplain, floodway, streets that you have to develop. So generally, you don't ever get to that maximum density because of those factors. But I just want to make sure that's cleared. Staff did recommend in favor of the request, and I'd be happy to try and answer any questions. Okay. Would the applicant like to speak to the council? Is the applicant here? I'd like to say a few words to the council. Then we'll take questions from the council. My name is Bart Bauer and now when I result when I went for the zoning the NS was I was told that I would not Be approved unless I put in the NS so that came from the Planning Commission and that my plans are nothing like that Most of this property. There's so much of it. That's unusable. It doesn't show up here the multiple ponds Floodplain floodway huge change in grade. There's there's no way this could hit any type of high density density It's It's very difficult to develop at all. Really, there's so much with it that I don't know what it says on the paper, but you can't come close to any type of density on it because I think there's probably about 50% of it I can't even use. So it's a tough deal, really. So my plans are really I'm looking at what the gentleman is to where the NS is. He would like to do what's exactly across the street. I think it's called the Pines at Springwood or something like that. I have a gentleman that's looking at doing where the NS is doing that and then I'm looking at doing residential lots And out my zoning would be down. I'd be below Like down there below two lots per acre just because it's hard to hard to develop to go around the pond and such So it's a it's a tough site. There's not going to be ever any density on this site So that's all I got to say. What questions do we have for the staff or the applicant? from the council. John? I was pressing my button for my colleague, Alan Long, also speaking. Okay. Alan? I just had a question for the applicant. Okay, sure. Thank you. After speaking with some of my constituents, they communicated to me that there was talk of a bill of assurance being offered if the city were to, in their CIP plan for this year, improve the infrastructure in the area to bring the streets up to a level that they could handle the amount of traffic. in the area, but that hasn't been something that's been discussed by the council. Can you give us a little background on that discussion? Well, here's what I said is the thing is like they say, the real problem is not too many units, not enough. It appears that what I've been doing on the pricing the project out, I don't know if I can do it because there's not enough density. The soil there is quite bad. I have to have like a four foot undercut to put the streets in. It's pretty difficult to do there. There's so much frontage there. If you notice that whole Dean Solomon, that's about for me, for my infrastructure, if I have to do it, it's about 400 some thousand dollars. I think we're at 542. If I could get some help from the city, I would definitely do a bill of insurance to do just a residential subdivision, 75-foot wide lots. They think mine is like 134 lots. And then I have another gentleman, he's tried to put where it says NS, that you can put 10 units an acre. Right now, he's right about 76. So instead of it being, I think that's maybe 16 acres, instead of 160, really if you go by the zoning, he's only at 76 units. So we could stay under 250 units on that 100 acres, easily be at 2.5 units per acre. And I would do that if the city could give me to help out on doing the street, yeah, I'd be more than happy to do that. Let me say that we cannot really negotiate a bill of assurance that's either offered with no strings attached by the developer to encourage the city council to grant their rezoning request or not. I understand. And so we can't negotiate with you, we can't promise something for you to make a promise. That's just not allowed for us to do. I hear you. I thought we were just in the discussion because you asked me the question. I think we have gone probably too far on that. We need to stop. My question was more oriented toward the motivation for that. I didn't understand what it was exactly, but you did bring up a good point that the hydrologically sensitive soil in the area, that's very environmentally sensitive area. Yeah, and I've gotten a wetland study and we're staying out of it. A wetland study? Yeah, I already went and got a study done on it. So that's why I say that eats up a lot more area too. It really does. So I won't be invading into the wetlands and trying to do it. Any other questions from the council? Okay, let's take some public comment. Everybody gets one turn at the microphone. Please keep your comments directed to me and give us your name and address. and don't engage council member or anybody in public. Okay, so who would like to be first? Now if council member wants to bring you back up for questions, that's okay. But that's the only way you get to come back in. Who'd like to be first? Tom, this one. Hi, my name's Jared Dunn. I live on 3632 South Tower Circle, which is between Holcomb and Holt schools. And I just would like you guys to be cautious before you rezone anything just yet because we don't really have any nice parks that are available to us west of the bypass and north of Mount Comfort. So I just see this as a great opportunity to utilize that space and the walks that are already there. I see people running down the old trail, like the old sidewalks on that course. and biking down it even though they're probably not supposed to but it just seems like a great opportunity to to really make a park for the west side kind of like the gully park of east side of fable and i used to live over there and would go there as a kid so that i think it would be a really good idea to consider that and that's all i have thank you thank you who else would like to comment on this Good evening, Mayor. Brian Sorensen, 2882 Purple Phlox. I don't have any PowerPoints tonight. Sorry, guys. It's pretty short and sweet, I think. First of all, it's different than last time because we really like this developer's idea. But we're talking about the zoning component. We're not here to approve development, so that would influence what I'm about to share. We really like his stuff, but we have to deal in worst-case scenarios. And if it's rezoned as it's proposed and the developer falls on hard times financially and has to back out – Again, we have to deal with worst case scenarios. And so if this thing was fully developed, NCNS, I believe the numbers work out. And I can't quote them because they're not in my notes, but I believe it's actually more units than the Lindsay proposal. And so that's concerning to us, and so we would, it's not as sexy to beat up on BART as it is Lindsay. I think that's why you don't see as many people here today. But we're still very passionate, and we feel like there's a big body of work that was put forth during that first meeting. proposal and those issues are still very relevant to us. And so it was never about apartments or style of dwelling, it was more about total density load to the area and the issues impacted by that, just to remind you, would be traffic infrastructure and of course the environmental component, those are our chief concerns. So there was some way, and again, the bill of assurance idea came up, I understand, it's not something the council can request, but as a direct neighbor to the property, I would be in full support of Mr. Bauer, what he intends to do, as long as I could be assured that scope creep wouldn't lead to more units than what we talked about last time, which based on the vote by the council, I believe was determined to be a bad idea at that time. So that's our feelings. Pretty much speaking for Prairie View Acres, that's the neighborhood that I live in. I see some other folks out here from that neighborhood and they'll speak to you here in just a moment. Thank you, Mayor. Okay, thank you. John? Brian, can I ask you a question? Thank you. When the developer came up, Mr. Bauer, he said that really he may not have enough density because only half of the land, because of soil types or wetlands or whatever, is developable, if that's a word, can be developed. How would you address that issue? If we want to limit the density, it seems like it might be naturally limited already. I don't know if I can answer that question. I don't know the economics. I don't know where the break even is. It's a little bit anecdotal to hear him speak on that topic. So I don't know how the numbers would work out. I would hate to force density on the property to make a project work at the expense of the public. And that's where I would leave it. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. OK. And Alan? Brian, if I could ask you one more question. living in clabber creek area crystal springs can you tell us a little bit about the flooding in the area uh sure yeah we see it i back up against clabber creek the back of my property adjoins that the northwest arkansas land trust property there we see high water tables currently at my back fence the water table is essentially at the soil level we have i think i shared with the council at a previous meeting we have crawfish infestations which is very unique for fayetteville We see water creep up over the banks of Claver Creek, overtake the road at times, certainly fan out and spread across the north end of the property at question today. So water is certainly a problem. I know there are engineering things that can be done to address some of those concerns. But as I've heard some people say, and again anecdotally, the engineering requirements would be pretty great And that probably speaks to Mr. Latour's question around what is it going to take to make it feasible. I don't know if any development to any degree is feasible here. So it's a real problem, and we certainly have empathy for Mr. Kavanagh. Again, I didn't meet with Mr. Bauer directly. John Scott Bull did, but by all accounts, a very well thought through plan. I've seen or at least heard of the concept. It's a great concept. It's very attractive to us. We really like it. If Mr. Bauer built what he has said he will build, we'd be in love with it. We think it would fit very well. But again, it's really an issue of worst case scenarios for us. But the water issues, Mr. Long, are real. We see them. You'll see some of us out there taking video because we've gotten into the habit of capturing it for you guys, but it's a hard habit to break. But it's a big deal. I've got the soil composition. an area rock to be found. Many of the homes in proximity to the project are here recently have been peered. I got some folks behind me who've been involved in the development of the existing neighborhoods. They can speak to that. But for folks on a basic slab footing, we're seeing cracking in foundations because there's a lot of settlement issues there. It's like slicing through hot butter or butter with a hot knife when you go to dig. So would you say that you'd mention the maximum density, worst case scenario, because we're only talking about rezoning here. Right. The maximum density, if that were to happen with this rezoning, do you think that the added concrete and roofs would only amplify your problems? Well, certainly. You know, I'm no expert, but I certainly have done my fair share of reading on water runoff and soil permeability and the effect of asphalt parking lots, roof damage. square footage and so forth. Yeah, it's going to send a lot more water down there. Now, the experts will have to weigh in on that, but I have to think a lot of water is going to be sent down into the Clabber Creek area on the north end. I'm concerned about that because I joined the property there. So any water creep that takes place, I'm likely to see it in my backyard. But that's just one component of it. Back on July 1st, I was driving the very north end intersection of Dean-Solomon And 112, we talked a lot about that last time. I saw a head-on accident, fire truck, ambulance, the whole nine yards, dispatch to take care of that. I didn't look in the police records to see exactly what happened, but that was a part of our concern and it certainly manifested itself since the last time we spoke. So I think the traffic count's a big part of it. And that's on the upper reach of that road and so I don't know that there's anything that can be required of a developer to do to improve safety up on that northern edge. Thank you. You're welcome. John? Brian, just I'm curious, how far is your house from the nearest stream? My house is approximately 250 yards. Yeah, approximately. Did you know the stream was there when you first- I knew your next question. Did you know it was there before you moved there? I knew it was there, had no clue about the water table. True story, I noticed these mud volcano mounds in my backyard and I thought, what the heck are these things, right? I grew up on a hill with red rock, you know, and it took me a while to figure out those are Arkansas burrowing crayfish, I believe the species is called. So I went in knowing the stream was there, but not exactly what the full scope of that stream meant for me and my property. Due diligence, probably more of it should have been required on my part, but here we are today, so... well for the record i bought on top of a hill yeah the next house i buy is likely to be on top of the hill far from water so okay thank you you're welcome any other questions okay thank you hi my name is carly grace i live at 3069 knight heron drive in creek meadow subdivision it's just northeast of van eyck um so i was here the last time we talked about this and um I like a lot of other people like Mr. Bauer's plan. It's a great idea, but it's definitely not guaranteed, and that's why we're here talking about it tonight. He said tonight, quote, there's a guy looking at building something similar to the pines in the southern portion, where it would be, I believe, neighborhood services. A guy looking into that is not very promising to neighbors who are living here. So what we are wanting is more of a guarantee that this neighborhood services isn't going to turn into a 12 plex or something more dense. So something like the Pines would be great, or a 3 plex, something like that. something more dense and I know you didn't ask me this mister long but that is what I would be afraid of more than mister Bauer ending up building more dense on more densely on his little section it would be more at the others zone that I would be concerned that it would become really dense I'm also he said it's a difficult area to develop That raises concerns for me that something could fall through and he could drop his project altogether. If it's difficult soil, if it's difficult something else, he could throw his hands up and it goes to a different developer similar to Lindsay. And then we've got a more liberal zone if you vote to change it. Okay. On the density, we brought up schools last time we talked about this, but now we have a little more data. Holcomb. The elementary school this is zoned for is up to seven kindergarten classes this fall, up from five last year. So it's getting very crowded. It's getting very dense. We can document that, and that's without this area being developed. So just wanted to throw that in there because last time we didn't have a lot of numbers. Um, so to wrap up, I think Mr. Bauer's plan is great, but if it falls through like a lot of plans do, this property could be even more dense than the Lindsay development that you already voted down unanimously. Um, I know that you cannot really even discuss a bill of assurance, so we hope that you hear us, Mr. Bauer, that that is probably what it's going to take for us to want to recommend this. And this is such a large piece of property that I hope that you can be patient. I know it's annoying to rehash these issues over and over, but it's a really big deal for this part of the city. I guess I'm supposed to address you, but I know that I would love it to be a park too, but this isn't the place to discuss that. The Parks Board is where people need to be talking about that. However, I think Mr. Bauer's plan is a great alternative. Thank you. And if one developer were to try to get the city to help with roads, it's my understanding that that would take several months and that that would need to be done before they re-approach the city council. Is that right? Well, it's got to go through the budget process. The city council will have to sign on and probably go through the transportation committee. So I hope that the developer and the city council can be patient so that we can develop this area in the right way. It's not going to be a golf course, but if we can be patient I think the time we've already invested discussing this would just really pay off and that's all I have to say thank you good evening I'm Kyle Smith I live at 2801 West Dove Drive and I look forward to the eventual development of the Razorback golf course like we said it's not going to be a development forever all right not going to be a golf course forever but The development has to be the right development, and I'm not convinced that this plan is as great as even some of the neighbors think it is. Our area of town has been the focus of several of these discussions lately. At the last meeting, we talked about some services further down Mount Comfort. and I was in favor of that one I'm in favor of some neighborhood services on this property as well but it's got to have got to work in context and if we look at where this one is positioned on the property I have some real concerns I think it makes sense to put it out by Mount Comfort it makes sense to have commercial services available on Dean Solomon we've heard that it's got some problems but We need to work on those. This one is positioned at the end of Raven, which at the moment is a street into a neighborhood that has one other outlet back out on the Mount Comfort at the other end, and beyond that, Raven doesn't go anywhere yet. I can't wait until Raven is built all the way through. The neighborhood needs the connectivity. Some of my neighbors will disagree with me on that, but... Think it'll give us an escape route out the back of our neighborhood when Mount Comfort is backed up and personally I look forward to being able to walk from Bird Haven where I live to my family's houses in Crystal Springs But even when that's built it's going to connect residential neighborhoods on both ends. There's going to be It's that kind of neighborhood all the way through according to all of the future land use maps and And on one end, on our end, the sidewalks aren't, you know, it's the bizarrest patchwork of sidewalks I think I've seen anywhere else in town. There's half of one block. To put the neighborhood services, whether it's actual business services or something like the condos across the street here, just seems like an odd placement on the smallest of the three roads in the area. Yeah. When we have a plan that has neighborhood services on Dean Solomon or all the way out to Mount Comfort I will be here and giving it my full support, but sitting it back there. It doesn't make sense It doesn't doesn't fit with the in the type of development. We're trying to grow here with 2030 objectives and My encouragement here would be to look at this whole neighborhood and not just the one piece of property as each individual developer Comes forward with it if we put the zoning map back up on the screen It's an odd patchwork and I don't think very much of the land out there is going to be developed under the current zoning We're gonna see lots of these questions and requests to change things If we could do it as one big plan for the area instead of a piece at a time I think that would Give us an outlet for all of the neighbors to be happy with the broader picture. Thank you Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Good evening. My name is Greg Smith. I'm at 31 45 West Salem Road I don't adjoin the property but Dean Solomon is a primary route for me on almost a daily basis Everybody said everything that probably needs to be said so I'll be very brief in March you voted unanimously against the high density zoning proposal by Lindsey and uh based on the density and impact on dean solomon road since then nothing has changed from all of your original concerns that should make for a fairly easy decision and while we would still prefer a park or golf course we realize that that won't happen to that end most of the neighbors feel that mr bower's development plan is probably the best option we will ever have and would fully support it however without some form of assurance that tells us that if it falls through that we don't end up with a situation that is worse it's hard to support that uh it's not to stop him it's not stop mr cavanis we want the best for both of them but if that loophole opens up something far worse than anything we've seen so far could easily slip through so again in march you showed to the citizens that you heard what they said you stood behind them and you made that decision we just asked that you do the same A new zoning proposal would allow for a 20% increase in the number of units above and beyond what Lindsey had proposed. And that is essentially the same. It's just like voting for a bad idea only because somebody made it worse. So we just ask that you consider that. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? J.R. Meeks, 2804 Purple Flocks, Board of the Property. I'm going to tell you I agree with basically everything they said. I... I wish there, you know, I think there there could be a way that if he wanted this deal I think people could support it with a bill of assurance But without it right now is exactly what was just said previously is that it opens up a door that it's just too loose Under the current time I've had calls today from a lot of people and everybody had the same concern We would all like to see the property be developed and be developed in a way that was compatible to what's around it. But just with the straight zoning request, that's not what we're doing. And so again, I appreciate y'all's time and thank you for your consideration. Good evening. My name is Wes Berry. I live on 2875 Topaz. It's kind of in the corner on the north end there. Again, I think everybody's kind of repeating the same concerns that we have with Lindsey and repeating them again tonight From mr. Bauer side. I've been watching him and he's been His plan makes a lot of sense. I'm with him. I'm sure he's a little confused before he got here tonight the Planning Commission asked for for more density and he's probably thinking well I got turned down due to that last time So I'm sure that is confusing. It's confusing to us as well So as the gentleman just said I feel like that part would be a pretty easy decision to make the other part is just Specifically on the property where I'm at on that north end when it when it rains out there I know the flooding's come up a lot but About a foot and a half into my backyard is kind of where the the water has made it to now A year ago. It was a foot and a half on the other side of the yard so the different rains we've had that waters actually crept a little closer to my house and as we've lived there longer. I've had some engineers from my office come and stand on the back porch and look at it, and to his point, they said the same thing. This is a very difficult part to develop. The Lindsay Group, when they were looking at it, decided I think they were gonna donate that whole area to the land trust, and I think, one, that's not necessarily what they do as a company, but two, it is a really tricky area, And the concern for the people that live directly on the course there is just that that how do we make sure that? That water is not now three or four feet closer to my back porch than it already is so that's that's a concern for me on top of obviously the density issues and and Dean Solomon specifically I When I leave for work, I work up north, and I actually head north on Dean Solomon to hit 112 every morning because the traffic getting onto the interstate there on – south of me is so bad. So it's six and one half dozen the other basically, but as early as I leave, it almost seems a little better from that way. Coming home, it's just the same. So I take the Johnson exit both ways, but that area on 112 and Dean Solomon is a disaster after work and any time after about 717. It's unfortunate that I know the number down to that exact science, but if you hit it under that, you're causing 20 minutes on the way to the office. So again, the specific parts behind Topaz and Van Eyck, I've watched that water creep up, so I'm concerned there, and as everybody else has said, without the assurances with which Mr. Williams has made it pretty apparent, it's not something that you can deal with. The zoning is the only thing we have. So again, Mr. Bowers got a great reputation. Seems like he's done great work in the past. I think we would support most of what he does or wants to do. If something falls through, that is extremely concerning that we wind up worse off than what we started. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Hello, my name's Jim Irwin, and I live at 2925 West Topaz, which is the little slanted area that backs up right to the golf course. The creek is my backyard, basically, so I'm about... Three, four hundred feet from it, and the water does get to about within 50 or 60 feet of my back fence. I enjoy it, actually, because I have a little lake when it does rain and all the birds and all that. But I want to kind of readdress what everybody else said is that we're basically re- Voting on the rezoning of this which is basically the same plan that you had back with Lindsey So we still fall under the same issues. I do like his plan, but again, I'm with the what-if scenario You know, there's there's things that happen in life So you never know what could happen to cause this not to be developed the way it is so based on just the rezoning of you still are getting the same issues that we had back in February or whatever March think that we did that you guys voted it down for for the same exact reasons. So the plan's not changed any from then. It's the same NC, stuff like that. We keep saying that a bill of assurance would make us happy. I think if it was just rezoned RS4, we'd probably be happy too instead of NC. I know the The Planning Commission just wants to rubber stamp NC on everything now. But RS4 would keep that to the limit also, and he doesn't even have to do a bill of assurance. So the other thing I have is that you have the one area of the creek, which under the Lindsay property, that was going to be donated to the land trust or was worked out to. Right. We haven't heard what he's planning on doing that. It's going to be rezoned to RA, but that means he can build houses in that area based on that zoning. So I'd like to know what the plan is for that myself. Okay. Just to know if the plan is to move that to the land trust like it currently is. Because, you know, there is a lot of animals and stuff that I see on a daily basis that use that area. So, like I said, I think currently under this zoning, you need to not vote for it based on the same reasons you turned it down in March. But I do like this plan. Okay. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Yes, come on up. Evening I hadn't planned on speaking My name is Richard noise. I live at 2862 Meadowlark Drive been there 18 years now and I just wanted to throw a few things in there and talk about flooding and My house is right at 1253 feet above sea level and I've seen it to where the only way to drive a vehicle out of my area is to go south on the interstate and You couldn't go under it. You can't go down Dean Solomon. Ruppel Road, the bridge is high enough, but the approaches are too low. And then you go on down Mount Comfort, Hamstring Creek goes underwater, and the bridge at Ruppel Road goes underwater. And it's not a good scenario at all. And I wanted to say something. I live in Bird Haven Terrace. And my concern is, I disagree with my neighbor back here about sidewalks and we need to open it. I like for it to just be left alone. I walk a lot on the west side. Last year I walked over 1,300 miles, and a lot of the sidewalks are useless in Fayetteville and a lot of our area because the houses are so close to the street, and they have parkways, and people can't get two vehicles together. their driveway without blocking the sidewalks. We have basketball goals and so most time I'm in the street walking because the sidewalks are impassable and anyway, I just like the Bird Haven Terrace just to be left as is. Okay, well your sidewalk shouldn't be impassable. Well, I've made numerous efforts to talk to the city about that anyway. We'll see what we can do about getting them cleared up, right? Right, but it might be. Okay, thank you. You're very welcome. Who else would like to address us? hang on let's let all the public get down and then I'm sure they'll want you to come back up alright who else would like to address us on this come on hi thank you Mr. Mayor my name is Lorraine O'Neill I live at 3001 West Weddington apartment 82 here in Fayetteville and it is something that most people may not question, but even though a property may look undevelopable, undevelopable, I spent enough years in South Florida where they turned the Everglades into a great big housing project. And we know that on first sight, whenever a developer looks at a property, he may use that as his bargaining point to get a lower price, and then after all the hoopla has settled, he comes in and brings a huge... pile of dirt, fills it in, and does what he wants to. And that's something that most people don't think about. The worst-case scenario very definitely could happen here. So just something to keep in mind. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Harold Hubbard, 2555 Van Eyck. I board her up to the back of the golf course. I just echo what everybody else has said as far as the density and you know we'd support what the what the developers plan to do but as it is it's hard to support the way it is i also would like to echo the the flooding at any given time there's literally water standing in our backyard so i'm about 200 yards from the creek and there's water there all the time so any further development and i guess the only third thing i'd add to that would be you know there's really nothing said about the land north of the creek in this proposal and that's probably a concern we've got standing out there too if what happens to that okay thank you who else would like to address us on this hello i'm linda mark was i live at 2901 van ike i mean topaz i was at the other one uh I'm wondering, I see and I hear so much about all the things going on, and I've been involved in selling all of the homes all over in this whole subdivision of Crystal Springs, Cobblestone Crossing, and all these different projects around. And it's so amazing to me. I hear so much about... the walking trails, the bike trails. I've seen what happened on Van Ash, the wonderful new roads we have. I see the sidewalks. I see the bike trails. I never see one person on those bike trails or sidewalks on Van Ash. I've come up and down Van Ash Dean Solomon Road, Salem, nothing, nothing in all the years, in the last five years, have I seen anything that developed to make Salem Road a better road from Holcomb Elementary clear down to Weddington. Nothing has been done. There's no sidewalks. There's no place for people to walk. Dean Solomon Road has not had one single solitary thing done to improve it in how many years? I mean, drive down it yourselves. Just look at what we have to deal with every single solitary day. And that's with all the people for the children. There's no safe place for kids to go play unless they go directly to the school playground. There's nothing. There's no place for people to walk unless they come walking through our neighborhoods. And there are not always people that live in those neighborhoods, right? you know, we push for more development, but we got to, it's that inner structure. It's the sidewalks. It's the different things. And they keep talking about wanting to build more commercial things. We don't have the, it's not built up for that. I mean, you can't even get two cars down that road in a safe, somebody's guiding one way or the other just to get down Dean Solomon Road. So I think before a lot of things are done in that particular area of Fayetteville, there needs to be a lot more work. research with all the different people involved in the city of Fayetteville who make these decisions to try and get our roads and make that a safer area for people there's no place you see we see people biking up and down Dean Solomon Road up and down Salem there's no sidewalks there's no place to go so where do the cars go where do the people that live there how how safe is it for them and And I keep seeing all these new things that are being built everywhere, but nobody is going in that direction. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Good evening. My name is John Thorne. I live at 2319 Wolf Run Road, the pines at Springwoods, directly across from the golf course. From my understanding from the developer, we really don't have a problem with what he's proposing to do in that property. However, the rezoning, the RC, that right in the NC, zoning could allow up to like 875 properties over there or homes over there. Without a bill of assurance, I'm definitely against the rezoning. If his plan falls through, somebody could come in there and really put a lot of homes in that area with that zoning. So that's my position, and I think probably a lot of our owners that are in our properties, probably their position. So I really don't think that zoning without a bill of assurance gives any protection to anybody in that area. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Okay. Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the council. Now, would you all like to have Mr. Bowers come back up? John? All right, Mr. Bowers, come back up. Council Member Zachary, come back up. First of all, I'd like to thank everybody. I really appreciate it. Actually, I feel like I'm getting supported here for what I want to do, so that's good. What I'd like to say, some of the flooding I did, when I went out there and examined it, there is almost a crossing with a bunch of culverts in it that is clogged. And that's what's making some of this property. There's two of them doing that. And what's happening at the north end, quite a bit of it, what's happening is two areas where it's clogging up the water, backing it up, and then it's caved in also, the Clever Creek portion, and cleaned out. I think that would make a big difference for what's going on today with no homes. I think that would help it, you know, because like you say, it's damming up and coming up onto the property. So that's all I want to say to the homeowners. It's on the north end, Mr. Fowler. Pardon me? It's on the north end. Yeah, it's on the north end. You can see where it ponds. It's actually not a supposed to pond there. If you come off of Dean Solomon right there where it starts to pond, that's not a supposed to pond. See that crossing there? There's a culvert in there, several culverts that are clogged. Then you come down a little bit through. There's one right there. Now that one back there too, that one's broke too, and that's happening too. Then when it comes into the trees there, you can't see it, but it's clogged up in there too. Plus the pond is leaking, that's another issue that's happening, so it's not retaining the water somewhat either. There's a little bit of issue there. So some of it to the north, that's what's happening to some of that Claver Creek. Some of the crossings now have been, over the years, the culverts are 100% full. So when they rain, they automatically have to flow up onto the ground, and they don't come back towards the creek. Because the creek bed kind of raises, and it's shoving it out towards the houses. we can look into that mayor if i could just make a comment all of those are on private property they're part of this rezoning they're not city property culverts so that's private property stuff yes sir okay I'm sorry, Al and then John. That's what I was going to point out. I was just going to ask the question, too. If you were aware that beavers were the main cause of the damage. Right, yeah, I got the problem. That goes back to the wildlife in the area, too. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. John? Mr. Bauer, do you think you might be putting together a bill of insurance next week? I think I could look into it, yes. Yes. I think it would be a very wise thing to do. Yes. Thank you. Mayor, I'd like to ask a question, too. Did you ever discuss rezoning through a planned zoning district with the planning department? That is something that really doesn't require the engineering it used to. It's just a zoning decision. And... And with that, you wouldn't be zoning high density any lands that you believe are undevelopable. I mean, why would you put high density on them? And so that would really bring your numbers way down and give some relief and some confidence to the neighbors that there wouldn't be – a much bigger development, I think, that you're wanting to do. So you could certainly talk with the planning department about that too and potentially modify your current request in that direction. either by redrawing your lines between the various zones that you are asking for or changing the zoning or actually doing a planned zoning district that would hopefully accomplish what you want without still giving assurances to the citizens. Now, like he says, some of this wasn't my idea to get them zoned this way, so I'll leave it at that. So, okay, I'll look into that and I'll see what we can do. All right, thank you. All right, thank you, Mr. Bowers. Now, we're not going to start around public comment again unless somebody brings you up. All right, council, do you want to? We good? Okay. Allen? Okay. Everybody wants to hold it right here on. Okay. Good enough. All right. That concludes our business for the evening. What announcements do we have? Mayor, a couple of announcements. The Gully Park concert series, this is one of the final two concerts for our summer concert series. come dance to the group called Flashback. It's a band that features talented musicians, two lead female singers who've been together for approximately 10 years. They focus on tunes with maximum danceability. That's their marketing. They play hits from the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s with a few newer songs and originals mixed in. It's a concert this Thursday, 7 p.m. at Gully Park. We also want to remind citizens that this week the City is going through our first step of our technology upgrade and conversion. And while this conversion is taking place at the end of this week and over the weekend, it will have some minimal impact on citizens and their ability to make payments. Thursday, July 21st, payments will not be accepted after 4 p.m. We typically go until 4.30, so you have until 4 p.m. And then Friday, July 22nd, only utility service payments will be accepted. All other payments, payments like for dumpsters, any impact fees, anything that would be as an AR payment, will resume regular processing on Monday, the 25th, If you bring it by, we will hold it, process it, and send you the receipt. Or you can make those payments online anytime. That's not impacted by this conversion hold. They just won't post to your account until Monday, July 25th. For those payments that are made in that time period prior to the due date or received by the due date, there will be no late fees charged as a result of this.
 Okay.
 John? Two things, Mayor. We have an election coming up on August 9th. This will be a new tax for the library. There needs to be plans to come out and vote for conscience on that. August 9th. That's coming up pretty quickly. Number two, it seems to be open season on police officers around this country. I want to state right here publicly my support for the Fayetteville Police Department. Every time they don their uniforms, they're putting their lives in danger. And they're there to protect you and me and our families, our wives, our spouses, our husbands, our children. There's an action movement going around. Tie a blue ribbon around your mailbox and your fence. You'll support your police officers. I'd like you to join us in that effort. Okay, thanks, John. Alan? We have a war for you. We have a Ward 4 meeting coming up on July 25th. That's next Monday. It will be here in City Hall in Room 111 at 6 p.m. Thank you. Okay. Anything else from anybody? Before we adjourn, I'd like to make a public statement tonight. I spoke with a group and have been speaking with groups across the city in the last week. And I believe the tragic events and situations in Minnesota and Louisiana and Dallas and Baton Rouge again this weekend lead me to understand one thing. At the end of the day, everybody wants to go home to their families at the end of the day. In my opinion, all lives matter. All people matter. And we need to focus our efforts on being a peaceful community, from black lives to the lives of our police, to the lives of the LGBT community, and those of our Latino community and non-Native Americans as well. For all of our families, all lives matter. As mayor, I believe in and work every day to establish culture and federal of fairness and quality to all people. We govern with an open mind and open door and an open heart. Believing that our diversity is our strength and inclusion of all is the only way to have a truly functional and welcoming community. And I'm proud of our police force for their proactive approach policies and protocols and best practices and handling situations such as those we have seen in the news recently. I met with and continue to meet with leaders in our community on a regular basis to ask their assistance in helping us with our diversity and recruitment so that our police force mirrors the types of diversity we see in our community. And I want to assure all of you and the public that all officers have appropriate training in the use of force and bio-based diversity training for all people, regardless of skin color, religious beliefs, their dress, or who they are or who they love. instances of brutality that have been occurring elsewhere have no place in this community. In a time where it seems that we see around us, all we see around us is hate and violence, I see a better day. And to quote Martin Luther King that I put on my Facebook yesterday, I will leave you with this tonight. He states, Martin Luther King Jr. states, I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. Thank you all very much, and good evening. We're adjourned.
