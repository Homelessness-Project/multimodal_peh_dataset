I would like to call to order the City Council meeting of October 2, 2018. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Present. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Join me in the pledge of allegiance. Thank you. All righty then, welcome everyone. Tonight we have, under our presentations and reports, we have the monthly financial report from Paul Becker. Good evening, Mayor and Council. This report is through August, so it's two-thirds of the year has been completed so far. So far, our revenue in the general fund is doing very well. We're up 4.9% in sales tax, and again, sales tax, 60% of the general fund revenue. Expenditures are in line with what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. Building permits are up close to half a million dollars at this point in time, so building is also very strong in the city, so I'm very happy with our financial position at this point in time in the general fund. For as the street fund is concerned, revenue is flat compared to last year. Spenditure is in line with what we would anticipate at this point in time. So the street fund is holding its own. Parking revenue has been down a little bit this year. It's getting a little better as we head toward the end of the year. Parking fees are down about 4.5%. They're starting to pick up pretty well. However, none of our debt service payments or maintenance programs are in jeopardy. So the parking fund is doing well also. HMR, HMR... Taxes are up 4.6%. Again, this is the HMR associated with the parks fund used for parks maintenance. Again, as I said, it's up about 4.6%, so that's doing well. Water and sewer, actually, the water and sewer fund collections are up about 6%. Remember, 3% of that is due to a rate increase. The rest is due to increase in consumption. Still got close to $20 million worth of fund spend capital projects at this point in time, but we've got sufficient balances to fund that, so water and sewer is doing well at this point in time also. Recycling and trash collection is absolutely flat on the revenue side this year. We'll probably end up with a loss in operations this year. We're currently underway in a study for rates for the trash and recycling to get that to where it should be, in line with the new procedures that you have recommended or have approved in place going forward. Okay. So, again, that race study will be coming forward in the next couple of months. As far as the airport's concerned, fuel sales are up very nicely so far this year. Twenty-six percent actually fuels up. Again, our associated expenditures with fuel dispensing is also up. We'll gain probably about $200,000 this year from the airport fund. That's where we are at this point in time. So, so far, everything looks like it's in pretty good shape. Revenues are up. I'm very satisfied with where we're going, and we'll talk more about this each month. And remember, we're heading into a budget discussion soon, so we'll have a lot more discussion on finances at that point in time. I'll be happy to answer any questions. What questions do we have for Paul on the finance report? Okay. Thank you, Paul. All right. We also have an Ozark Regional Transit report tonight. Thank you, Mayor. Ladies and gentlemen of the council, my name is Jeff Hatley. I'm the public information officer for Ozark Regional Transit. We have... Our overall ridership year to date is down again this year, 5.6% from this time last year. And, of course, last year we had a major downfall after the fire in January. But Fayetteville is the exception to that. We've had 78,195 riders in the city of Fayetteville year to date, which is a 5% increase over last year. We started offering veterans rides. We started allowing veterans to ride our bus system region-wide back in June of 2017. We've had as many as 511 veterans riding in one given day and a total of 21,730 veterans. as of the report I received on August 6th, that number is going to change, or we're not going to be able to keep up with the exact number of veterans that are riding since Fayetteville now has picked up our fare box and every citizen of Fayetteville or everybody that rides in Fayetteville routes now rides free. We don't designate whether or not it's a veteran rides free, but we will track it in the other municipalities. Representative Womack's and Senator Bozeman's offices really went to bat for us after our fire to help us stabilize and get our footing again. In April of this year, they helped push through the Federal Transit Administration, and we were approved for a $3.6 million grant for replacement vehicles lost in that fire. We have gone through the bidding process now, and we will be able to replace 12 of the 20 buses that we lost. We were able to replace eight initially from the insurance proceeds, so we're going to be made whole again. actually better than whole because these are going to be brand new buses straight off the assembly line, whereas what we lost to a large degree were very, very old buses. In addition, just a couple weeks ago, we were granted from the Federal Transit Administration, also through Representative Womack and Senators Bozeman's office, a $2.9 million grant for construction of a new administration and operations center. We will be asking for... We'll be looking for qualified bidders here in the next few months, and then we will be asking for proposals early next year, and we hope to get it out of the ground and finished up hopefully by the end of 2019, early 2020. And that's going to allow us to grow and provide public transportation in this region for the next 30 years. And believe me, anybody that hasn't seen our offices, you don't know, but we do need an administration office. We really do. I'm just going to show you a thing here. I won't worry about that. But we've got a new Token Transit app on our phone so that you can download the bus passes, and it's just an easier way to show the bus driver that you paid for a pass, and it's also better than a paper pass in that if you bought, say, a 30-day bus pass on the 6th, it would be only good for that month, whereas if you buy this phone app on the 6th, it's literally good until the 6th of next month. So, yeah. I had, Ms. Smith was kind enough to pass this paper out. This is kind of a week-by-week ridership. Since we don't have the September numbers yet, I wanted to be able to show the ridership since the changes that we've made on August 20th. And if you'll notice, the very first table up there has routes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Those routes have been combined and deleted and rearranged to where it's now route 10, 20, and 30. And there's no real way to match apples to apples. But if you'll notice, the total daily passengers has increased. The week of August 13th through August 17th, which is the week before we made all these changes, we had 396 passengers in Fayetteville. The last two weeks, two weeks ago we had 423 in Fayetteville, and then last week we had 437. So that's increasing, even though we forfeited some coverage over to Razorback Transit in an effort to streamline the whole public transit system in Fayetteville. And you can also see there's a graph at the bottom of that that kind of shows, between the green and the blue, a little bit of a learning curve as we change, which is typical. Okay. And with that, I will leave it open to any questions or comments or concerns. What questions do we have? All right. Thank you. Okay. The next order of business we have tonight is the consent agenda. Number one, a resolution to approve a lease agreement of a portion of the airport with open avenues incorporated.

Okay. Garner, anything new? Mayor, I don't have anything to add. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Okay, would the applicant like to open with a statement tonight? Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I just wanted to make it very clear that... Introduce yourself. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. My name is Seth Mims, Specialized Real Estate Group. I wanted to bring to your attention this evening that we went to a lot of time and effort to make sure that we use the tools that you guys have adopted and put into place as we worked on developing this land use plan. And one of the most striking things about this land use plan is that it is truly infill. And, of course, we know appropriate infill is supposed to be our highest priority. But I would like to go a little further and say that appropriate infill is generally defined as the development or redevelopment of vacant, mostly vacant, and undeveloped property. Infill near existing amenities and services like parks, trails, schools, etc. without a corresponding increase in car trips and traffic congestion that is caused by building on the edges of town. So Fayetteville has made efforts to encourage appropriate infill, and they've done that by rezoning properties in the city's core to allow more residents and a mix of housing and other uses, stores, offices, all in close proximity. This first slide kind of shows just how infill this property really is. It is really just about in the center of the city. And this next slide shows that this property is surrounded by an interstate on one side and the state's largest university on the other side. It is a quarter mile from the largest employer in our city, and... It is less than a mile from the central business district. So it's all in an area that has been disturbed for more than over 100 years. So it really is appropriate infill. And, you know, we're also supposed to discourage sprawl. We do that through compact, complete, and connected neighborhoods. Compact as in denser housing. Meaningful open spaces, sounds like our proposal. Preserves, small blocks. Complete as in a varied housing. Mixed uses, civic uses like a retreat center. A mix of jobs and housing and neighborhoods and connected, meaning, you know, street-oriented buildings, interconnected streets, and being connected to trails and greenways, being very appealing to the pedestrian. That is the opposite of sprawl. That's how we combat it. Now, the city's land use plan is really the antithesis. Antithesis. Gee whiz. Thank you. Do I seem a little nervous? How about I take a breath and breathe five seconds? It's the... Okay, what I'm trying to tell you guys is, as you know, since World War II, our development patterns have not been correct. We have been encouraging folks to drive as far out as they have to until they can afford housing. And that's not very nice because that increases their transportation costs, increases the time that they spend in their commute, reduces their quality of life while increasing the carbon footprint of a city. Sprawl is certainly unaffordable for cities because it puts such a strain on more and more roads, widening of roads, water, sewer, police, fire, all these things that have to be extended out to the edge of town. Discouraging sprawl really helps reduce our dependence on vehicles. And that's something that we have to really take seriously in a legislative manner. So I really feel like this land use plan is adding housing supply to the city's urban core, and that really combats the housing crisis that we're having. So traditional town form is what else we're supposed to do. How do we do that? We use form-based codes. What is traditional town form? It's mixing uses, right? It's where you've got residences, stores, civic uses, all those things in a walkable area. That is traditional town form, and that is what we are supposed to be putting together in this town, and that is quite identical to the land use plan that we have submitted. In an effort to make traditional town form the standard Fayetteville has adopted not just form based zoning codes and Planned zoning districts that allow for a mix of uses but they have also really done a great job of Making an emphasis on how the quality of life increases when the use of the car decreases so here in our proposed PZD you can see that we certainly are mixing uses. We're talking about a restaurant, lodging, civic spaces, like a retreat center, all staples of traditional town form. And that's exactly what we're proposing in this land use. So we're also supposed to grow the livable transportation network. And if we're going to accommodate another 60,000 residents in Fayetteville in the next 20 years... We're going to have to take that pretty seriously. And what we've done here to help with that is we have given Matt Mihailovich a letter that basically just explains that we are committed to giving the city free land for right-of-way, for a trail, to help make that needed east-west trail connection that we're lacking in that area. This would give folks the ability to ride the bicycle from Mount Kessler all the way to the University of Arkansas on into downtown. It would give folks who worked or studied at the University of Arkansas an option for alternative modes of transportation. That's the livable transportation network that we're trying to create here. And also, this particular site... It's surrounded by transit routes, so it really does fit right into our livable transportation network. Also, I would add that the U of A is somewhat of a nucleus for our trail system, so being able to make a direct east-west connection into the U of A is a huge benefit for pedestrians and cyclists in our town. We're also working on assembling an enduring green network, and this map that you see on the screen shows you that right now, the star representing our site, we are not a part of the enduring green network. However, we would like to be, and by putting this land into permanent conservation and connecting it by a trail, both east and west, we are in fact enhancing the enduring green network. The property is not currently... there, but we would like it to be. Our land proposal helps it become that, even though current zoning is in contradiction to that. Also, we want to be working on creating opportunities for attainable housing. That's an issue, we all know. From the planning perspective, there's been a lot of studies done. What folks have realized is that there's this piece missing. It's been now called the missing middle, but it's alternate housing types. It's not a sprawling large lot, one-story home. It's the opportunity to buy smaller homes on smaller lots or homes that are attached to each other. When you have a smaller lot, a smaller home, you've got lower construction costs, lower land costs, lower energy costs to maintain it, lower maintenance costs of the yard. The small is the new big. You've probably noticed there's a lot of folks that are gravitating to not wasting their money on utilities and wasting their leisure time mowing the lawn. This is where housing is going. And so in response to that, the city of Fayetteville, our excellent planning department, came up with residential intermediate urban. And the definition is... It's designed to permit and encourage the development of detached and attached dwellings in suitable environments, to provide a range of housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes, and to encourage a diversity of housing types to meet demand for walkable urban living. So, compatible in scale with single-family homes, speaking of compatibility, I'm going I think you'd agree that our proposal is extremely compatible. Planning staff found that it was compatible with the neighborhood and the future land use map. Planning commission found that it was compatible. And the Environmental Action Committee recommended with a unanimous vote to you guys that this is a good move for the environment. I think that compatibility has been settled. we hosted several neighborhood meetings in an effort to get to know the neighbors, to talk about what they wanted to see or didn't want to see. Here are six official ones. So we actually had one before these six in a lawyer's office here in town. He probably had 12 neighbors there with him, a total of seven neighborhood meetings. And I tell you what, we really listened to him. And you can tell that in our PZD. You know, these lots along Markham here that you see, these single family large lots, those lots on the north side of Markham, those are as long as a football field. These lots are the size of half a football field. That is an effort on our part to show compatibility with the rest of the neighborhood. The rest of the neighborhood around us has an underlying zoning of RSF4, but there are many homes on larger lots than that. And so each place where our development comes into contact with the public realm, we have gone to great lengths to provide very large lot by today's standards alone. In an infill location like this, that is a very large lot. Why? Trying to be compatible, trying to be sensitive to the neighbor's wishes. I also think that you'll notice all the forested buffers around our PZD. We're very serious about trying to make sure that our neighborhood is hidden from the view, from the existing neighborhoods, from the view coming up or down 49. We've really worked hard to pull our homes back behind the ridge line so you won't see it. You'll just see the green hill, and we feel like that is extremely compatible. Also, we... We have provided for another access point north. We propose that we take Sang north on down to Halt where also and saying connect and that extra connection is going to provide Some relief on Cross Avenue as well as an alternate route for folks that are going to leave this PZD and head north so again We really listened to the neighbors because they were really concerned about a connection to the south on South Sang down to MLK or a connection to the service road on Interstate 49. We heard from all of them that they didn't want to see that. And so, again, responding to the neighbors, we're connecting to the north. So lastly, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to talk about. The current zoning, briefly. The current PZD is really not functional nor sustainable. It's a seven-acre boutique hotel with a two- or three-ton bathtub on 69 acres. That's not appropriate land use. It's obviously not sustainable. You know why I know it's not sustainable? Because it already went bankrupt on its own. And now we've owned it for a while, and we've got to see the operational side. And we understand it takes about as many staff to run a 40-room hotel as it does a 7-room hotel. It was designed for failure, not on purpose, but the design led to failure. That uncertainty that surrounds this current PZD will continue. If you guys don't vote in favor of our proposal, it's going to continue to surface because a seven-room boutique hotel on 69 acres just doesn't work. Now, if we leave the PZD as it is, again, voting no to our proposal is not a permanent solution. It doesn't fix anything. The current PZD does not have any tree preservation, any conservation areas. Yes, you're only allowed to build two more single family homes and four more cabins or something like that, but that's all a function of zoning. A PZD is a zoning. We all know that a zone can get rezoned. It's normal. This city council or any city council in the future could rezone that property. So there's nothing permanent about the solution that we have right now. It obviously needs a permanent solution. So what I would like to say is that the previous owner, the gentleman who put this PZD in place, He did not want to put any property into a conservation easement. Here we have a letter that he wrote to Jeremy Pate, who at the time was the planner. Evidently, Jeremy had been asked by some city council members to inquire if Mr. Archer would put some of the land in his PZD into a conservation easement. And here you can see he clearly said, it is unreasonable for anyone to ask us to put any part of our property into a conservation easement, especially PZD. as an implied condition for rezoning our property as a PZD. You see, he reserved all of his development rights on purpose. They're still there. They're there. What we need to do is make sure that they get a sense of permanence with a positive outcome for our city. So our current zoning really, really is not satisfactory. Did you know that our, this is out of chapter 167, our tree preservation and protection code, and it says that the highest priority for tree preservation are canopied slopes. And the current zoning has all of that area slated for development. The entire western side of that mountain, what you see when you're going up and down Interstate 49, the whole thing is currently zoned for four units to the acre residential development. You know, the west side of that mountain, honestly, if I were to take you up there, you'd agree with me. It's the prettiest, most pristine wooded area on that hill. And the reason why is because it was not logged as recently as the top. You know, the sides of the hill have a denser canopy. In fact, that west side, there's almost no canopy. Japanese honeysuckle on that west side. Almost no invasive species. Why? Because the canopy is so dense and the forest is so old. It's beautiful. And that's what we're talking about, putting in permanent conservation area and dedicating to public use for trails and for enjoying nature and connecting to it. So if you look at this slide, you'll see this is a 1958... USGS 7.5 quadrangle, which is the federal government's mapping of topography and land use. And what you see here is the white represents the areas of disturbance. and the green represents the areas of least disturbance, the basically canopied hillsides in this instance. And what's interesting is if you compare our zoning proposal, what I would call the development envelope, the RIU area in which the neighborhood will occur, almost lines up exactly with the white area of previously disturbed mountaintop. In fact, did you know that this mountaintop Used to have almost no trees. Here's an aerial from 1965. And you can see the trails on the left-hand side on top of the mountain. See that kind of arrowhead-shaped trail? See those lines? There's a succession of lines. Those are row crops. That was being used as agricultural use. And we know it's been inhabited by humans for well over 100 years. I mean, it was a boys' and girls' camp. It used to have a lot more homes up there than it has now. You guys might remember. It used to be a lot of cabins. That area has been disturbed. That is not pristine wilderness. That's the place you're supposed to develop, and you're supposed to not get on the hillsides. So I would also like to... point out that our proposed land use really is a permanent protection. And the reason is, A, economically speaking... augmenting the hospitality offering, adding some more guest rooms so that we can host the entire wedding party. Part of being a destination wedding venue is having the rooms for the guests to stay in. And when you've only got seven rooms, there's not enough rooms for the groom's party nor the bride's party to stay. And so they wind up going to another hotel. I think you guys know that we need hotels right now. We have a need. for that. And this is a really neat way to do it where we can make the inn and barn, the event slash wedding venue, financially feasible by growing it to a point where the economies of scale, where the operational efficiencies make it a permanent plan. Also, adding homes in the neighborhood is going to make the farm-to-table restaurant In the first floor of the inn, financially feasible. That was part of the original plan, but it's hard to open a restaurant when you've got seven rooms and no other houses that are really in walking distance. And so, again, this plan provides for financial permanence for this property. And lastly, speaking of that, I would like to say that... The 44 acres that we're putting into immediate conservation easement, that, like I said, is the most pristine part of the property. It's the most valuable for tree preservation, and that will be permanently preserved forever for generation, generation, generation with the approval of this land proposal. See, the permanence here is in such stark contrast to the current zoning. Also, I would say you notice we've really tried hard to not let this neighborhood become a traffic cut-through that would affect our neighbors on Markham and to our east. We've worked hard to come up with alternate connections, and I think most developers would just take the connection to the service road and run it all the way to Markham. This proposed land use is also... In complete compliance with the open space plan, the Northwest Arkansas open space plan is a convergence of the three local land conservancy groups. It was put together by the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. And what it says is that the areas in dark green are the most important for conservation. And you can see our site overlaid upon this area next to the highway. And, in fact, we are conserving what is the most valuable to the land trust, to the nature conservancy, to FNHA. And one of those reasons, aside from the fact that it's very pristine, it's thick canopy, it's on a hillside, but it's about the view corridor. that the rest of Fayetteville and the rest of Northwest Arkansas and for the next 60,000 people that get here in the next 20 years, they're going to see that every time they go up and down the highway. Did we protect it permanently or did we leave it out there to see what we got next time? That's the difference in the permanence. So, yes. I really am almost done. If you add the 61 acres that we think is going to be slated for permanent protection as well, tree preservation, public use, that would be 105 contiguous acres. Right there, right where our local conservation groups have told us that they want conservation. That is permanent protection. Now, what could be done by right? Let's talk about that real quick. If somebody came along and got their hands on this piece of property, right now with the West 72 that are zoned as RSF4, they could easily fit at least 257 homes. Now, there's a little misunderstanding out there right now amidst some of the folks that are opposed to this proposal. plan, but let me clear it up real quick for you guys. In residential, the tree preservation can occur on the individual lots. It's not that you have to take 30% of those 72 acres and put it in some sort of permanent conservation easement or tree press. No, not at all. The 30% only has to occur on the individual lots. And you know what happens if you can't meet the 30%? Yeah, on-site mitigate with new trees, littler trees, or you pay money into tree escrow. But it's not, the current zoning is not some protective thing that's going to help anybody. And right here you see 257 units, and I believe that any other developer would connect to the service road, and he would bring that traffic through down Markham, and it would be a much worse scenario for our neighbors than our proposed use. And lastly, the current PZD, as we know, is just a zoning problem. It can be rezoned by this or any future city council. Some future owner who didn't want to own a money-losing seven-room boutique hotel would just shut down that hotel and the event venue at the barn, commit to you guys, I'm done with commercial uses. We will not use, we'll just conform to RSF4. I believe they could come in here and get it rezoned to RSF4. It used to be RSF4. There's an underlying RSF4 that was there before the PZD came into play. And on all four sides, it is completely surrounded by RSF4. So if that happened, if the next guy got his hands on this property, and rezone the PZD to RSF4, we came up with 507 homes. And by the way, these lots are drawn to RSF4 standards as they would apply in a hillside, hilltop overlay district. 60-foot wide lot, 8,000-square-foot lot minimum, and in not too many hours... The designers were able to get 507 homes on there. And so what we're proposing is really so much more appropriate. It has so much valuable permanence for us as a community, and it really puts away the uncertainty that exists right now. So I just want to humbly, respectfully ask you guys, uh, for your approval of these concurrent land use plans that concludes my presentation mr mayor okay what questions do we have for the staff john mr mebbs i've had a request from one of the neighbors that lived downhill from your develop proposed development what measures will this development take to mitigate runoff or exacerbate or exacerbation of their current flooding problem? That's such a great question because, again, where the current zoning comes in, it's all on a hillside. And trying to control stormwater runoff on a hillside is virtually impossible. Almost the only thing you can do is put in a concrete pipe and shoot it downhill and make it somebody else's problem, which is not appropriate development. The right way to handle stormwater is using low-impact development techniques. You spread it, you slow it, and you soak it. And when you're developing on a hilltop, you're able to accomplish that. There's enough space for you to use low-impact development techniques and manage that water before it shoots down the hill. So this proposal is actually much more favorable, speaking of stormwater runoff, than current zoning. Give me an example of low-impact development techniques. Well, so what you want to do is you build breaks, berms in the land, rain gardens, so that you can catch that water as it is running across the ground. You funnel it into ditches that take it into rain gardens where plants, root systems, filter the water and soak it up and thereby slow it down. So low-impact development techniques really use a lot of plant matter and space to achieve their ends. Thank you. Yes, sir. All right. Any other questions from the council? Okay. I guess we'll take some public comment. So here's the rules. Okay. Everybody gets one turn at the microphone, you get five minutes. Unless a council member asks you questions, and I would appreciate it if the council would wait and hold their questions until the five minutes are up with each speaker. That way we don't have to stop the time or start it again. It's hard for us to keep up with. So please hold your questions until every speaker is up. Are you all agreeable? Thank you If I just one turn to my phone you get five minutes unless councilmember ask questions or by vote of the council The motion is second by majority of the council can give you more time. I guess I don't know We'll discuss whatever time you think Keep your comments addressed to me don't engage anybody on the council or anybody out in the audience. All right Okay, so Let's see. What else? Stay on topic. Now, we've got two of these. We've got one after the other. I will be taking public comment on both issues tonight. So you get one turn on this one, one turn on the next one. Okay? I don't want to put them together because we knew that we weren't going to be taking a vote. We've got two issues tonight, and I think there needs to be public comment on both of them. All right. Let's see. Now, I don't want everybody getting all excited here tonight, booing, hissing, stomping, yelling. Don't jump up in the crowd and start yelling stuff unless you've been recognized by the speaker. Okay? Stay on topic. I'll keep you on topic. Let's see. Give us your name and your address. Okay. Everybody got it? All right. Let's begin. Who wants to be first? Yes, please. Just come right on up. My name is Edward Haight-Manick. I live at 1622 West Markham Road. And if this development plan was on an integral part of the road network in Fayetteville, if there were eight or ten access streets that interjected a piece of property of this size, I would probably be in favor of it. I certainly believe in infill. My opposition, I used the numbers that I got from two meetings with the developers up at Pratt Place Inn. And the projection for 486 housing units, 80 hotel rooms, a store, two large events each year on the scale of the Roots Festival, weddings and smaller events, and I did traffic calculations based on information that I – that I got from other planners, transportation planners. And the projections for traffic from this development were something in the range of overall perhaps 6,000 trips per day. Seth and the developers suggested that probably 75% of that traffic would come up Markham Road. And the particular problem with this location is that it has the interstate on one side. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard has one of the higher traffic counts in the city of Fayetteville. Razorback Road is obviously, you know, at different times and during different events, the traffic counts vary, but it's a very difficult street to access from not only from Markham, but from Palmer and Center Street and all the streets that intersect with it going to the west. And, you know, you. There need to be fire and ambulance services that have access to, you know, if a resident in the neighborhood has a heart attack or, you know, needs emergency services, they have to be able to get there. And it's, for me, it's inconceivable with the traffic that we already have to add that much and not to have cars backed up on all those roads going to the east from that development. And likewise, you know, I'm saying Weddington is a heavily, heavily trafficked street. And so, you know, I believe in green building. I know that they're a developer that's known for building LEED certified developments. And there would be places where this would be appropriate. But I really feel strongly that Markham Hill is not that place. And I think that this process needs to be at the very least slowed down. So that there are opportunities for someone to step in and make appropriate use of Markham Hill, which would be for. You know, nature study and preservation and and forest and university uses. And if there were more time, then perhaps some solution could be found. And I think that there are still I understand that we're going to have a growth in population problem and in housing shortages in Fayetteville and in all northwest Arkansas. And I'm sympathetic to that. but I still feel like there are large undeveloped areas that would be appropriate for that sort of development. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Okay, everybody come on up if they want to speak. I'm Ethel Simpson. I live at 409 North Oliver. And as I've been sitting here and especially listening to Seth, it occurred to me that some of the assumptions... in the project could be held up in comparison with some of the statements that we've been seeing on your boards up here. And so I jotted down a few examples of that. One of the goals of the Plan 230 is appropriate infill and infill. I think all of us recognize that infill can be a desirable way to prevent sprawl, but I think when we look at the word appropriate, we want to be sure that the terrain and the surrounding neighborhood which is subject to invasion by the Razorback Rooters and other people, as it is, subject to interruption by people driving the shortcut from Weddington Road to the university or to the high school now, that it might not be appropriate to have infill there. Although I have to say that if there is infill, it seems to me that... the plan here might be the best we could expect. But I'd just like for that comparison to be there. Also, that we want to discourage sprawl, and Markham Hill is an established neighborhood that is experiencing infill. Not all of it is pretty. And there is a certain disappointment about some of the developments at the edges of our neighborhood, along Nettleship, for instance, where a lot of damage is done to the terrain. And Mr. Nims pointed out about the little trees that are planted, the little toothpick trees that take the place of the nature that was there before. Another thing in one of the goals is a livable transportation network and We already have an overload of transportation on Markham Road that has been pointed out very ably by my predecessor, so I don't want to go into that, but I do urge you to think about traffic on a sort of steep and narrow street that doesn't have many ways beyond, just straight up the hill, and to be sure that... that consideration carries some weight as you make your decision. There is that about the Enduring Green Network. It's there on the board now. I don't understand how it is that Markham Hill was not already on the Enduring Green Network. It seems to me it's very green and it's been enduring for quite a while. But at any rate, it's... It's hard to see how commercializing that hill is going to make a difference in improving the green network. Attainable housing is another thing, and I hope that when we talk about attainable housing, we mean housing that is affordable. Our neighborhood is not well known for its affordable housing. We have big lots. We have big houses. Some of us have designer houses and so on. And I fear that... The style of housing on Markham Road is going to be like what's already there in our neighborhood, and it's not going to be terribly affordable. So we'll have a hillside with a bunch of rich people driving their big fancy cars up and down that street to weddings, and that's not going to help the working people of this town who have to work for the University of Arkansas for wages that couldn't allow them to live on Markham Hill. Then just to conclude, in the 2050 plan, there are a couple of things that I can quickly mention in my half minute, that we have a naturally beautiful city, that we have an interest in ecosystem preservation, and that we want a safe and fun city in which to live. And I think those are values that we really hope can prevail. And if you agree that this... development will not destroy those values, then I could bear the kind of vote that I fear you're going to make in favor of this project. Thank you. All right. Thank you. My name is Margaret Holcomb. I live at 548 North Gray Avenue in Fayetteville. As I listen and have listened to both my neighbors and to the developers' and their rationale for what they would like to see happen on Markham Hill. It strikes me that we approach it from two different perspectives, one as shareholder and a development company, and on the other hand, as stakeholders in the neighborhood. What I heard tonight from Seth, although there have been conversations with the stakeholders, the... small accommodations that have been made actually create more traffic headaches than it solved. And the appearance along the edges of this proposed development do not hide the fact that the impact on the stakeholders in the surrounding neighborhoods will be immense. Traffic. Traffic. noise, stormwater. It is a question I can acknowledge if the current zoning addresses all of the questions that we have even as stakeholders. No, it doesn't. But 233 houses, I believe Seth said, that would be currently available, as opposed to 500 homes. 1,000 square feet of impervious structure will generate 600 gallons of runoff. If you multiply that, and I was more conservative in my multiplication this afternoon as I looked at what I would say here, you're talking about in the 45 inches of rain that usually occur each year in Fayetteville, you're talking about 41 million gallons of stormwater that have to be handled just from the homes alone. And that was not... going up to the 507 that Seth said would be put on the property. And that doesn't account for... And that was with a conservative 2,500 square feet of impervious structure per structure. That doesn't account, then, for all of the square footage of the actual commercial facilities that he plans to introduce to the property. So not only the impact... traffic, noise, and runoff that would be impacting the neighbors, but then impacting the property itself. And we do believe that the property does need to be regarded as a person would be. There needs to be equal deference to the needs of the city plan as a stakeholder, not a shareholder. And I believe you're being invited to take the perspective of a shareholder tonight in this conversation. As a stakeholder, what does it mean to have ecosystem preservation? As a stakeholder, what does it mean to have appropriate infill? What does it mean to have an enduring green network? Does it just mean a set of trails that you can walk on, or does it mean actual use of the property in ways that will allow us to have clean air to breathe and have property where the rainwater can stay where it falls. Will the current zoning accomplish all of that? No, but I believe that as a council and as a community, as a neighborhood, that we can do better. And what we are uncovering now and the questions that are being raised are things that need to be looked at, even if the property stays in its current zoning and any development comes forward. These aspects need to be examined not from a shareholder's point of view. but from stakeholder point of view, quality of life. The generations that live there are the children of the people that negotiated the zoning reluctantly that is now on the property. And I hope that... although the council has changed, some priorities appear to have changed, that we may realize that the neighborhood hasn't, and we as stakeholders want to work with you to make an appropriate use of this very, very valuable piece of green infrastructure that has endured. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Tom Overby, 1855 West Fayetteville. I attended three sessions with specialized real estate along with several neighbors Discovered we all have different opinions We tried to understand the proposals Asked questions expressed concerns it's fair to say that if Markham Hill could be preserved as a lot of nice folks here would like to preserve that'd be a wonderful thing and I don't know that that's feasible. I'm not speaking against it, but if it doesn't work out the proposal before you needs to be considered of course in that respect We asked for things that are of concern to us with respect to the current proposal Specialized responded they filed with you guys last meeting a series of changes that it's not everything we would like to have but were were some of the things those included a reduction of 80 used in certain in the PZD except for the part north of Markham those six lots are so there a more detailed definition of special events something which could be understood and perhaps enforced in the future as opposed to their initial very loose definition A reductions on the events with outdoor amplified music. And also the inclusion of public trails within their bill of assurance for the RA area. This was not part of their proposal and was initially resisted by them and I'm glad to hear with our input and I'm sure Matt's input and everybody else's that asked for it that they are now agreeable to the public access. That is a potentially important area to integrate the trail system in Fayetteville. Thank you. They also made an oral representation, which Specialized repeated this time, that they don't seek to have access from South Thing down to MLK. That's very important to the neighborhood. I'm sure there's other people who are going to speak more specifically to that. And as I said... These comments are, I'm not speaking for named people, but there are several who have been pleased with these changes, and they're not here speaking in opposition, which they would be otherwise. Some folks have their own minds as to what they're going to say, and you'll hear from them, which is great. Is this proposal perfect? No, it's not. But then again, if I gave a piece of paper to everybody in this room, we'd all have all those different ideas of what we'd like to have. you have to consider what's before you. There are things about it beyond what I said that I personally would like to do differently if I were king for a day and owned it and had enough money and time to do it all, but I don't. It's their proposal. I don't mean to give you a mixed message. I've walked out of several meetings, particularly the one at the craft place and the last one I had the day before they filed, and I said, good project if it does everything you say. Thank you. Marquette Bruce again, 741 North Lewis Avenue, Mayor Jordan and Council. The train is coming and it's delivering more people, fleeing congestion elsewhere, bringing more pollution, greenhouse gases, warming, coming with extreme weather, dumping four to six inches of rain in hours. The train is coming with more developers, infrastructure, impervious surfaces, runoff roads, and more destruction to Fayetteville's natural habitat. In our zeal to limit sprawl with density and infill, are we forgetting the dire need for green pockets? Are we losing our sense of place? We're Fayetteville. in O'zarkinsaw. What's special about us? Well what's special about us is our natural resources. Will this zoning bring about the best use of our city's resources? This owner and developer are not just gambling on their three million dollar investment. They know that if the current zoning holds, they will profit. And with the current zoning They can develop 50 acres and 94 will remain intact. If the owner and developer prevail and Markham Hill is rezoned, 44 acres will be spared and 100 acres will be developed with commercial development and impact problems occurring with the addition of 520 to 800 units depending on the ADUs. irreversibly altering and destroying this sanctuary. When will enough be enough? Yes, this developer has a LEED platinum reputation. Ecoflats and Uptown with Juice Palm have many eco-friendly amenities. Everything they do does. Fayetteville has depressed areas, gapped areas like teeth missing, long-ago abandoned areas and compromised areas where the environment is mostly destroyed. These are the areas where density and infill can vitalize and limit sprawl. Not on 100 acres of pristine, I think it's heritage land. That would not be infill. I'm Scottish. That would not be infill. That would be sprawl. I've been hearing, well, the owner and developer has such a large investment they need to profit, and the city needs more tax revenue, more housing. In the spirits of Fay Jones, Cy Sutherland, James Lambeth, and John Williams, this city does not need more of the kind of housing that's going up on North Street adjacent to Harps on Garland or Mission Heights. That is where we need responsible infill like Specialized REG can provide. Collectively, the city and the University Heights have the larger investment in Markham Hill. What kind of appraisal value can be placed on this hill? We don't own it. No, we don't own it. But it breathes us and sustains us along with all life on or near it. Can a monetary value be placed on this priceless lifeline resource? Is this council the guardian of our city's resources, the guardian of our city's future? Let the current zoning stand. Owner-developer will profit. The neighborhood will survive with more of Markham. The city will retain its green resource. More parties will be more nearly satisfied. Friends of Markham will continue to look for a miracle, like the ones that saved the land north of Lake Louise, East Mount Sequoia, and Mount Kessler. University Heights is being squeezed by the university and Interstate Highway 49. Ideally, everyone should be able to walk from their home to a city park. Time, time, time. Where's our Gully? Where's our Wilson? Thank you. Who would be next? Hello, Mayor Jordan and council. I'm Don Bennett. I am a longtime resident of Ward 2. I live on 1231 West Dean Street, and I've been in Fayetteville for 37 years. Like many of you, I've seen a lot of changes in almost four decades here. Some are good, some are great, and some are disasters. For some of those, there's no going back. I have no doubt that our future portends inevitable transformations of neighborhoods, especially the urban ones, and some of those developments we will scratch our heads about. My fear is that Markham Hill would be developed exactly as it is currently zoned, by a developer only consumed by number of units. I fear that someone might try to squeeze every house possible into every single acre, creating few possibilities for preservation. We have all witnessed what happens when the footprint is sprawled and we've witnessed the bait and switch and promises that are not kept. My comfort, however, is in sharing my trust and support to people who I've known for almost eight years now. The Specialized Real Estate Group is made up of professional people who I've come to know and love through a relationship of respect and collaboration in growing our community for all of Fayetteville. I've seen with my own eyes that Jeremy, Seth, Sarah, Danny, Oliver, Hunter, Zach, and Donna, to name a few, make up an organization that is dedicated to development of inviting and accessible Fayetteville places and neighborhood communities. They have proven to me that they share a love of Fayetteville as a home and a love of all people who live here as neighbors. I am convinced through my personal experience that the people of Specialized Real Estate Group are dedicated to responsible community development. After many questions and scrutiny of their 20-year vision of Markham Hill, I'm convinced that this change in zoning will counterintuitively through density change. Not just spare, but celebrate the eras and the histories of Markham Hill. Their vision will appropriately respond to the flora, fauna, and environment teeming with wildlife because they had promised to do so. I believe them when they offer a continuous stewardship and connection to the land. to the context of the physical neighborhood, and to the neighbors, both current and future, reinforcing the integrity of Markham Hill today and tomorrow. I believe with my heart and my own eyes that Specialized will honor Fayetteville now and in the future through their culture, who I've come to know them as humans. I believe through greater density and access, Specialized will create a community gym that we will all be proud of to enjoy together because of what they intend to preserve. and conserve while simultaneously contributing to the complex needs of a progressive and growing city. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Good evening. I'm Len Wade, 100 North Sang Avenue. I live there with my wife, Elaine. I'm also speaking on behalf of Sue Williams, John Williams' daughter, who lives at 140 North Sang. First of all, we thank you for your attention to this matter. Part of what I'm going to ask is for a slow process. I think with unquestionably whatever sign anybody might be on, this is a special piece of property, and it needs to be conserved, preserved, and used in as many appropriate ways as we can. I think we could do some studies environmentally. I'm hearing runoff issues. Archaeological study wouldn't hurt. We could take our time, be sure what we're doing before we destroy part of this. The existing CPZD may appear a little strange to folks, but the reality is it sort of presents the same issue, and that is that when the archers came in, we were talking about the a usage and a single family residence area that was not going to be compatible and with unbelievable traffic issues so because of that we negotiated and i say we i mean the architects the developers the archers the city the staff lots of folks over a long long time that's why i'm asking for patience we addressed issues of hours of operation The restaurant capacity, the number of gatherings, the barn occupancy. The barn was a major issue and developed over a period of years without, perhaps without proper permitting and was extremely disruptive. So it left us with this need to have these conditions addressed. One of them was vehicular ingress and egress, not to come on South Sang from Markham onto the property. Why? Because South Sang in that stretch curves up the hill. There's no curb. There's no gutter. There's no sidewalk. There's only a ditch on each side. There's a spring on the west side. There's a drop-off on the east side. There are new tenants in Sue Williams' house. Since September, they've been in the ditch twice. All of us who live on the hill have been in the ditch at some time or another. So we would really ask for consideration that anything that's done protects that so you don't have 18-wheelers coming up with construction supplies and really jamming up the neighborhood. We appreciate the no plans to extend South Sang. The other thing about the existing CPZD, we were able to keep – by an agreement, an area that's green. It's still green. Units were not to be developed there. Now we can call that not a proper conservation or whatever, but everybody understood it was green space. And in fact, folks had bought into the property thinking that's what they were getting. I realize my time is getting a little short here. What I'm concerned about is we're looking at creeping commercialism with this proposed plan. Again, when I first heard about it, there was going to be perhaps an additional 20 motel units. Now we're talking 80, plus another 20 cottages, plus seven that you've already got. You can figure, what, three, four people in each of those units. The housing units, I don't know how many we're talking now, 200 to 500 units. Folks, if you have a convention center and all this there, you're going to have an unbelievable amount of traffic. You do not have options for roads. You're going to be forced at that point to consider other access. And when you do, you are going to destroy Markham Hill as we know it. Wynn Sutherland spoke at the Planning Commission and said that, and I think this is absolutely the truth, Markham Hill is what it is because there's no through street. If we get a through street, or frankly, if you have streets on top of the hill connecting one, two, three, or four of these pods of houses, you're going to disrupt the traffic flow considerably. Any proposal that you might come up with, we would request, please, conserve as much as possible. I wish we had a benefactor in our time. Mr. Mayor, my name is John Elrod. I live at 2715 North Sherwood in Fayetteville. I love Len Wade. He used to babysit me. And our two fathers probably did as much for Northwest Arkansas as any two other people in the last hundred years of politics in Little Rock. What we do know is there's 1,000 people a week moving into northwest Arkansas. What we also know, I think, at least what I believe, is that it's unreasonable to believe that forever, over 100 acres of land sitting in the center of Claytonville will remain undeveloped. It's a question of when, not if. And when responsible people like Seth and Jeremy, based on their track record and everything that they have done successfully in this part of the world, step forward, we should grab them. The previous ownership was not able to make it work financially. It's got to work financially. It has to. The other thing I would say, Mr. Mayor, is that the Planning Commission of the City of Fayetteville and the planners of the City of Fayetteville have a reputation in northwest Arkansas. that they are the best. And they have given this project their scrutiny. It's been through the planners, it's been through the planning commission. Seth and Jeremy have spent countless hours working and reworking this project in order to satisfy the planners of Fayetteville, Arkansas. So we urge your consideration, thank you. Thank you. Okay, yes please, come up. Mayor Jordan, City Council. Thank you for hearing me. I'm Leanne Whitaker. I live at 445 North Mock Avenue in Fayetteville and am for this project and I'm against this project at the same time. Part of me that is for this project says that they are entitled to develop and they shouldn't develop. I believe that Specialized does good work and that they could be an asset to this parcel of land. However, I am concerned that, let me back up a minute. I appreciate the idea of an enduring green network as proposed. And however, I'm seeing this 44 acres zoned rather than as permanent open space. It's a question more than anything. What should it be zoned as? Yes. So out of the 75 acres that would be left at four dwelling units per acre, 257 units. The thing that I'm missing to go from four dwelling units to the acre to something like eight dwelling units to the acre or something that could be greater in a cluster housing type scenario is a master plan. We haven't seen a planning consultant or a proposed planning consultant. And to go from, to upzone from four dwelling units to the acre to RIU with no density cap, which there's not one proposed on this particular item, is something that concerns me. Because in the words of one of my professors in architecture school, we don't know what we don't know. I think that that's the struggle here, is that without some kind of a conceptual master plan, that it's hard to approve this. That master plan could include things like detention retention basins, concepts of low-impact development that address drainage, buffers that would give... landscape buffers that would buffer raw development, raw new development, which we know in time can be mitigated visually. Some of it cannot, like the apartments that you can see from MLK that are built south of MLK. But it would show some of those things. The idea of cluster housing is a good one. The idea of it is to preserve open space. We haven't We didn't hear that discussed tonight, but we did hear it at the last city council meeting by the applicant. So I think that their idea to support, I am in support of the land swap, basically, of their location of preserved land from the east to the west. I think that's very wise. I think they're reading the land well to propose that. So that's a good thing. I am concerned that there are no conditions on this particular item. I don't see a condition for a traffic study on this particular item. The traffic study could, the housing development could be as impactful as the hotel in terms of traffic. depending on how many units that ends up being. Again, we have no cap on RIU. So I would encourage that. I would also encourage that with something of this nature, that there is a pedestrian circulation diagram. Part of the idea of mixed-use and traditional town form includes the ability to walk to daily needs, such as the grocery store, services, things of that nature, that would reduce daily trips. So where do people walk? Okay. So I have hit my major points, so I'll leave you with this, and thank you for your time. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, I'd like to address some of her points, if I may. I'm sorry. I'd like to address some of her points, if I may. Yes, sure. Thank you for your comments, Ms. Whitaker. I want to call your attention to the Bill of Assurance that was given to us with this proposal, which actually delineates the conservation area. In RA, the proposed zoning district would be the appropriate zoning district for such conservation. The Bill of Assurance also limits it to 476 units total for the property. And because this is a land use decision, and we're just strictly looking at the zoning, we're not actually allowed to to look at specific development proposals such as the pedestrian diagram, the stormwater information you're requesting. All of that will come later at the development process. So that's why we're not seeing that at this point. Okay. Who else would like to address this? Okay. I'M AT 16 NORTH SANG. I WAS UNABLE TO BE AT THIS MEETING, PREVIOUS MEETING, BECAUSE IT CONFLICTED WITH OUR JEWISH HOLIDAY OF YOM KIPPUR. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. I MAY REITERATE THINGS THAT WERE SAID AT THAT MEETING BY OTHERS THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AGAINST THE REZONING APPLICATION. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME OF THE Several things, well, let me, as a preamble to my comments, Seth Mims has been very easy to communicate with, and if this development goes forward, or any development, I'd prefer that he was involved rather than other people. But having said that... I view this area on Markham Hill as a gem for the city. If we were to look forward in 100 years or 150 years or 200 years and we had an area that was still undeveloped as this presently is, we would have a gem for the city. If we look forward in 150 years, 200 years, and we have a development, no matter how aesthetically pleasing it is and wonderful, it will not... it will not stand up to the same kind of beauty that a pristine area so close to the center of the city now holds. Let me back up a second. Years ago, the mayor may recall, we spent a good bit of time in discussions about the present PCD. And at that time, one of the major concerns of many of us was what happens when there's a change in ownership of the land. And at that time, we were led to believe, well, it doesn't matter, the PCD is in place and nothing will change. And yet, now as we come to this point, it appears to me that the needs of the city or the needs for that city area of land have not changed dramatically, but what has changed dramatically is that there's a new owner for the land. So I find that rather troubling. Let me mention concern with the specifics, and I may have mixed up the two proposals, but in the proposal, as I was reading it, the noise of the land is not a problem. It ordinance previously, the noise restrictions in the previous PCD that's presently intact, permitted no outdoor amplified music. And as my reading of this is, there is a proposal for two I think two occasions where there can be amplified outdoor music as well as conditional use for outdoor music. Perhaps I'm a bit cynical, but the idea of conditional use seems like maybe it's a bit of a carte blanche for outdoor amplified music. I would ask the mayor and the council to consider the fact that it does not seem to be a paucity of venues for amplified outdoor music. And so I would like to see the preservation of this area without amplified outdoor music. Let me mention one more issue that's a technical issue, and perhaps, again, you've addressed this, but as you're aware, there's a problem of water pressure up on the hill, and I fear that this would become problematic with a large increase in building in that area. And the last thing I would like to mention is that it seems that the, proposed number of occupants particularly in things like the hotel we will have changed from a small in with What seven or eight rooms to what I would classify as a large hotel? Accommodating a hundred or so people and I think the whole character would change dramatically. I hate to see that kind of influx Thank you for your time. Thank you Hi, I'm Sarah Lewis. I live at 1908 West Berry Street here in Fayetteville. My husband and a little boy and I. And thank you for the chance to speak. I guess what I would like to suggest is that this land use decision is too important to leave it to just a rezoning discussion. It's a large piece of property. that has remnant forest on it with large trees, one of the last in our community within the city limits. It's an area that has an opportunity for protecting our water supply. It's within the White River Watershed, the Beaver Lake Watershed, which we have a commitment to the Beaver Water District to protect create protections for our water supply. Also, there's an opportunity to really look at availability and access to parks in this area. I didn't really think about it before, but now that I have a two-year-old and I'm trying to walk to parks because getting him in a car right now is so hard. We don't have a park to walk to in that area. And so not that this is the answer for a park, but it is certainly a potential area for a beautiful park for our community in that area. And also, this is a chance to build on the connections between the university. The university uses this land for their sports, and then there's, as well as, and building on that idea of a park. So how can we work with the university to leverage this land to build benefit for the university and attract athletes to our top-rated track program? How cool would that be? So I guess what I'm saying is this is too much of a big decision to leave to just this one idea. Seth and his team do amazing work in understanding our 2030 plans and what our vision and mission are and what we want to do and they get to the heart of what we want to do in Fayetteville and they can speak the language and it can sound very appealing and it is a really cool development idea, but it's one idea. And this is an amazing piece of property that is accessible to the whole community. And what if we had a master planning event for this area to hear from others about what could potentially take place on that land? So I don't have the answer. I just would put out there that I hope that you'll consider tabling this for the time being. So you can really come up with something that could get more types of ideas for this property. Protecting. the existing forest resources that are there, the existing land and space that are there for the community, and really providing more opportunities than just to one developer to the whole community that potentially could be developed, but to do it in a way that hears from more than just one idea and discussing one idea and hearing about other opportunities benefit the community at large. So thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Mayor, only have about one more spring left before I couldn't get up out of the chair. Paul Milam, longtime resident, Mayor Jordan, Council Members, Kit, thank you so much for allowing me to speak. Almost went here. I had some problems this year with cancer and... blood clots and strokes. So I'm so happy just to be here, period, in this beautiful city that I grew up in. I felt compelled to speak and tell you my thoughts, which are going to be very brief. But Markham Hill, Mrs. Markham, have always been special to me. I used to ride horses up there. Maybe some of you older members did too. Camped out, hiked. Fortunate enough, when I was riding horses, usually on a Saturday morning with Mrs. Markham, to share a lot of her philosophy and her thoughts about the hill. She loved the hill. She loved nature, loved the horses. It was a very special place for her. She and her mother built a place up on the water tower, not the present water tower, but the old tower that was up there, wooden, they could climb up to and watch the stars at night. What a great place to watch the stars. I think, in my mind, she would say no. I know progress is progress. I know you've got to look to the future and not to the past. I was talking to Donna about that earlier. But for Mrs. Markham, she would say, gosh, preserve the hill the way it is, if at all possible. I think in Fayetteville there are Beautiful things have been accomplished in the city. Dixon Street, the university has expanded, but there are certain things that are out of scale. And I would hate to see Markham Hill become one of those things which is out of scale. I think those are basically my thoughts. I'll be very interested to see how you vote, see what you think. I would encourage you just to go up and, if possible, walk around in the hill and get a feel for it and see what it says to you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hi, my name is Josh Williams. I live at 509 West Spring Street, Suite 406, if you need to know that. I'd like to take this time tonight to possibly give a different point of view on the Markham Hill project, a point of view from someone that could very well see themselves living in such a wonderful community. I've lived in Fayetteville since I was seven years old and have grown to fall in love with the city that I now call home. For the last few years, I've had this thought that Fayetteville needed a place that was altering the status quo of what community living really looks like. In my mind, I could never really put words to what I felt was right, but it would be a place where homeowners could maintain and worry about less yard while still having ample space for a small garden or their dog to run around, but also having access to unique neighborhood amenities. This has been done in a few areas across the country. The best example is Serenbe, located in Atlanta, Georgia, which I believe Seth and his staff at Specialized have looked up to a lot in forming this plan. Not only focusing on the development project, but also protecting mature forests. It has become clear to me that individuals of all ages have started to believe that small is the new big and truly want to live in a place that focuses on community development. In today's stage of living, neighborhoods have morphed into a place where homes are placed on square lots, forcing limitations on community living and causing everyone to live their own separate lives. What I would love to see evolve is how we live and interact with each other in our living communities. It's an amazing thought that my future wife and I could have a timeless home and our own vegetable or fruit garden and the ability to walk out our front door and have access to trails, coffee shops, and preserve forestry. Whether someone is looking for a starter home or a family is looking to settle down, I believe Markham Hill could be that place. This project is giving Fayetteville the unique opportunity to take a large stride in urban living and give individuals and families the ability to experience true community living. Please consider how this wonderful project can not only better Fayetteville in the short term, but for many decades to come. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Okay. Thank you. I'm Lisa Orton, and I live at 1663 West Hustle Road, and I have a handout. I oppose the rezonings. The number of signatures on our petition so far against the rezonings are 2,766, and the number of comments on the petition are over 180. And please consider each individual letters to you opposing the rezoning. And in my handout to you, I have a table that... It summarizes the current zoning and the rezoning, and I put them side-by-side in bullet form so you can compare exactly the numbers of how many acres are preserved, how many are semi-preserved, and how many are developed and how they're developed. And then I have a long list of benefits of the current zoning and the harm of the rezoning, and they're lined up side-by-side too. And I hope that you will have time to study this. And... And the handout is an estimate. My estimates of the traffic on Markham Hill and Markham Road, if it's resound and I have my tallies up there on the on the page and in summary, if you lived on Markham Road between four and eight thousand vehicles would pass your house each day. Because of this massive, dense commercial development up there. And then I have a map of the current zoning where you can, it's a picture, an aerial view. And it shows you the 72-acre PZD and 72-acre RSF4. And I think if you read my table here. the handout, you will understand why the people opposing the rezoning are very much in favor of preserving the 72-acre PZD with all of its urban forest and the meadow for the the wildlife, and also it preserves the two historic properties that are on the register, the Markham Camp, 46-acre, on the Arkansas Register, of course, historic places, and the Evangeline's House. And also it preserves at least half of the Native American sites that are unsurveyed yet. Anyway, there are many reasons why people really would like to preserve the 72-acre PZD They're more interested in doing that than preserving the 44 acres on the far west near the highway. And in this table, you'll see that there are a lot of serious issues with the rezoning. The density is just horrible. It doesn't fit in. It's incompatible to the surrounding low-density residential areas. The traffic will be horrendous, and the traffic jams. There's a fire hazard because there's only one way in and one way out of this community. The water pressure is inconsistent, so the fire hoses will not work well, and so on. The developer bought the property with the current zoning, and anyone is free to ask to rezone their property, but no one is entitled to it. The developer can develop the RSF4 area right now. And finally, I just want to read on February 4th, 2016, in federal court under oath, a lawyer asked Seth Mims concerning the West 72 acres, what are your plans with that property? And Seth Mims answered, we plan to develop a single family neighborhood, a series of clustered single family homes, little pocket neighborhoods, if you will, intertwined by walking trails and green spaces. And this tells me that Seth Mims, under oath in federal court, promised they were planning to develop the 72-acre RSF-4 area with single-family homes, and the total number of homes would be low enough that there would be green space between groups of them. So specialized real estate groups' development plans are not following what Seth Mims swore under oath in federal court. Okay. Who would like to be next? Thank you. I'm Kenneth Smith, and I think you probably have a copy of a one-page letter that I addressed to your board. Do you have that with you? If you do, you can read along with what I'm going to say. But I'm going to turn around and talk to the people. No, you need to keep talking. My neighbors. No, no, no. You've got to stay with me. No, no, no. You've got to address me. Yeah, you need to address me. Or am I on camera? Yeah, you're on camera. Oh, my gosh. No, no, no. Stay with me. I still hope that you hear me all the way to the back. I am deaf, so I did not hear or understand anything that anyone said up till now. But I do think that I need to let everyone know, you back behind me, know what I think. I will read the letter. I was not thinking of zoning so much as the specific... building that Specialized Real Estate Group was proposing. So here is what I say. I agree with the following proposals made at this time by the Specialized Real Estate Group. One of them is the additions and modifications of Pratt Place Inn. The next one is residences that they proposed to build along Markham Road on the east side of the hill and Sang Avenue. I see those as not interfering or in any way dealing with the main bulk of the hill, which they cooked up with the... the zoning changes. Finally, I said that I agreed with their proposal, their meaning Specialized Real Estate Group, for their proposal for the natural area reserve, which is labeled on their plan as preserved, 44 and 101 hundredths acres, that will be essentially wrapping around part of the south and west side of the hill. I'm fully in agreement with that, too. That leaves the rest of the hill empty. I presume there's no specific proposal other than zoning changes. There's no proposal for whatever they may think of building sometime in the future. But what I've seen on their plan, which I've just described, I do agree with. I lived on that hill for one and one-half years at the invitation of Evangeline Pratt Waterman Archer, who was a dear friend of mine. And at that time, back in the 1970s, I had a chance to wander, hike, stroll, scramble all over that hill, so I'm familiar with it. Earlier than that, before 1974, for more than 10 years, I was an engineer, civil engineer and park planner with the National Park Service in many places. But during that time, I was also very much involved in the planning of the original proposed Buffalo National River. And I have remained involved one way or another with Buffalo River ever since. I am down to 84 years old, so I'm not going to have much more time to talk to you anyhow. Thank you for listening. I want to start out by saying that I think we owe some gratitude to the city council and the mayor because for years, every survey that I see, Fayetteville, Arkansas, continues to be one of the top 20 places to live in this United States. And I think because of the safety, the environment, the people, all those things combined together make this such a great city. And that says a lot about you and prior councils. I grew up on Markham Hill. I also rode my horse all over Markham Hill, through the Panangus Ranch, through Mount Kessler. I know that hill quite well. So I hate to see it be developed, of course, because it's part of my childhood. But I always knew that someday it would be developed. I chose to live where I do because of Markham Hill. I built a house over on Halsall Road. Could I get your name? I'm sorry. STEVE GARLANDER Yeah, Steve Gwynn. So I've always assumed that this area would be developed. The proposals I've seen from Specialized is a very large proposal. Do I want an 80-room hotel a block and a half away from my house? No. Do I want another 500-plus houses High density houses in my area, no. And most of the neighbors that I talk to in my area are also very opposed to the high density developments. However, most have come to understand that there is going to be some sort of development in that area. It's a beautiful hill. I mean, if you haven't been up there, take some time, go up and visit that hill. The ideas of possibly having it as a park, that's great. I don't own the property. Specialized owns the property, and I have no more right to tell them what to do with their property than they do to tell me what to do with my property. But it's a large development, and it does affect everyone in that area. Okay. I just would like to see, as someone else made a comment, more than one proposal on how this area could be developed. Do we really have to have such high-density housing, hotels, grocery store, retail shopping, all the things that Specialized has brought to our attention? You know... I've heard that we can be driving down the interstate and see Markham Hill on one side, Mount Kessler on the other. When I'm driving down the interstate, I'm just going across the interstate. I don't really pay attention to what the mountains look like, nor am I going to pull over off the interstate to take a picture. I don't know. I've heard comments from specialized. You can't see the development from where they're going to be putting all their units. But just because you can't see it doesn't mean that the damage is not there. It's like you can't see the forest through the trees. I've also heard if you don't like it, you don't have to come up there and see it. But this is our residence. This is where we live. And it's important to everyone in that area. So I don't get involved in city council meetings. I never have. I just go out and I vote and I pick the people that I think are going to best represent me. And so I hope that with everyone coming up here, you will make the correct decision. Just like I make my correct vote, I hope you will make your correct vote too. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? My name is Brian Nolan. I'm a resident at 1652 West Markham Road. I'm here in opposition to the proposed development of Markham Hill by a specialized real estate group. We request that no changes be made to the current PCD and RSF for zoning. The existing zoning saves approximately 94 acres and will allow for 50 acres of development. Approximately, we feel that the proposed development is incompatible with the existing nature of the surrounding property and current land uses. The past negotiation allowed the previous property owner to have the current PCV limited the uses of the property commercially and retained medium density housing allowed with RSF for zoning, which we feel is appropriate. Your consideration on this request is appreciated this evening. I just want to take a minute here. Going through this has given me a greater appreciation of the challenges my father faced when he was serving on the same council. He did this for a number of years and was also mayor for six years. Just tonight, y'all approved the continuation of his term. Polar and wastewater treatment facility with a let confirm that y'all approved for work and I know you all are tasked with making many tough decisions for this great city and My predecessor that was up here previously as you on the Lisa her mother was also on the same City Council and also served as mayor of this great city and I just want to thank use this opportunity tonight to thank all of y'all and for your service to the city, and that includes you too, Kip. Y'all do a great job. Thank you. Thank you. My bottomless heart. Robin Karas, 1666 West Hall South. I think Ethel and I were on the same page, but last meeting when we were up here, we thank everybody for your time again and respect everybody's opinions. But looking at these city plans, 2050, 2030, I just kind of want to go through those. Start with the 2030 plan. I'm not sure when that came up or when you guys made that. The mayor, I'm sure, knows. But I'm sure it was at least 10 years ago, if not longer. Okay. And going down the list, not necessarily in order, urban sprawl, when I was here last time, I looked up the definition of urban sprawl, and it describes the expansion of human populations away from the central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional, and usually car-dependent communities in a process called suburbanization. To me, that's what this project looks like. We'll go to another point on the city plan 2030 and during green network. It endures it somewhat. I don't I think the way it's owned currently endures it better when and with more land like the last two people have said there's more acreage set aside. Attainable housing. Yes, I do agree that we want attainable housing. I want more neighbors. I welcome more neighbors to the area. I just think it's too dense currently. You know, if there is a crisis in housing, like it said, then then why are we? putting 20 acres of it to a large-scale commercial hotel why not put that into 40 more houses if that's the case if we need more houses i don't see on the 2030 plan any need for a large-scale commercial hotels and neighborhoods matter of fact i think that contradicts or the traditional town form what is it up there we'll wait for it to come up the traditional town form the standard It's coming up here. There we go. We will make traditional town form the standard. Well, any town I've been in, we haven't had hotels in our neighborhood. So that one, livable transportation network, I really think there hasn't been any city studies done on this project for transportation, traffic counts, things of those sort. If they, I don't know if there's usually or don't know beforehand, but you would think on a large project like this, a traffic count would be indicated. And then appropriate infill. I think that's two words, right? Appropriate infill. I think the property here tonight, the large green space, allows for appropriate infill elsewhere through the city. I think infilling in such an area here, to me, does not seem appropriate, and that that's what allows for all this infill more in the urban areas around town, South Fayetteville, and things like that. So these are just your 2030 plans up there that I thought I would contrast my view. I would also like some transparency. I do appreciate the other project that this Specialized has done through town, and I do welcome more neighbors, like I said, but I'm not sure. I don't get all the details. I've asked my councilman who is RMD, the owner of the property. I think there should be good transparency in government, and if we don't know who the owner is, how do we know? One of you aren't the owners of RMD or planning somebody on planning commission or somebody on city planning. I'm not, you know, that's not speculating. I'm just giving an example. Who is RMD and what have they developed and where are they? That's what I think nobody has answered yet appropriately. Okay. Next off, the 44 acres that they are giving away, I appreciate that it's in a conservation easement, but it's also the bare minimum as the hillside preservation requires 30%, and that's approximately what the other 10 or 15 they're going to give in the future. That will hit their 30%, so that's the bare minimum. The last time they rezoned this property, they got a seven-bed hotel, seven-bed bed and breakfast, and they... they held 72 acres where you couldn't develop them. So I don't think that that's a minimum. I would like to see more acreage in a future proposal. That's where it goes. I also worry about the large changes and fairly sudden changes in zoning. It was probably when you all made the 2030 planning where this got rezoned, and I think that drives speculation, which drives prices, which makes houses unaffordable for local Fayetteville folks. And I also think I worry that it sets a precedent for the other large scale or the other large properties in the area on the hill. There's, I think, three other properties with 15 or more acres. I think another one with 10 acres. Are those going to be able to have time? Can I have two more minutes? Can we have a vote on it? If they want to give you more time, the council can. John. Mr. Mayor, I'm moved to give you two extra minutes. Okay. Do we have a second? Kyle? I'll second. We have a motion to second for two extra minutes. Senator, would you please call the roll? Okay. Sorry. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. You have two minutes. Thank you. It shouldn't take that long. Next up would be to say I'm not afraid of future prospective buyers, and that shouldn't be something that looms in anybody's minds. I think this kind of was under the radar, obviously, this whole deal, and that there's family members like Mountain Biking, and Lisa Orton's earnest prayers could be answered, and anybody should be afraid of that. And... Also, the last point I would like to make is the 36 proposed events. You know, I don't know if that would like just for example, if one would be every weekend on a Saturday, that's 36 weekends out of the out of the year plus six football games plus bikes, blues and barbecue plus Walmart shareholders plus graduation. It's almost every weekend we would have major events going on, could possibly have major events going on. And again, that's where I don't think large-scale commercial development fits in the neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, who else would like to address this? Good evening. My name is John Coleman. I live on Washington Avenue, Tennessee. One of the things I love about our community is the healthy discussion that we have around projects like this. I think it's part of what makes Fayetteville great. I work for a local energy and sustainability consulting firm. We've done a lot of work. We've specialized on several projects. We're not on this particular project, but we did do some early review and feedback, so I'm familiar with the project and what they're doing. Yesterday I was listening to Ozarks at large and part of the discussion was around the population growth that we're seeing in Northwest Arkansas, a thousand people a month. It was a statistic that Kyle Kellums threw out there and I think we can all agree on one thing. If Kyle says it, it's probably true. But that's an incredible pressure that's being created on the region, and I think city councils up and down the corridor are dealing with this, and it's probably the most critical responsibility of the council to look at these things and understand how to absorb this population growth while retaining our quality of life. I've engaged a lot of people in the region about this discussion and how to do this because it's not easy, it's nuanced and it's complex and a lot of people, a lot of longtime Fayetteville residents talk about their wish to not have growth in the community and when I think about that, I think about myself. I mean I moved here in 2007. I have a wife and three kids So we're part of that growth we We bought a house in Washington Willow. It's a 1,900 square foot home. We live a block off of College Avenue. And, um, when I walk my daughter to school in the mornings, it's like a Norman Rockwell painting out there. There are people riding bikes up and down the street, um, walking kids to school. Um, you have people walking their dogs. Um, it's something out of a painting. And over the decade that we've lived there, uh, you know, our home has continued to appreciate and value, um, We had a lady that came by last weekend during Bikes, Blues, and Barbecue and was looking at houses, even with all the bikes roaring by on College Avenue, she was still really interested in our neighborhood. And we see this every weekend. So when I think about Markham Hill and what I've seen, I think the potential for this neighborhood and what they're planning, it could be another iconic neighborhood like Wilson Park, like Washington Willow in the community. and without College Avenue running through it, without Mission Boulevard running through it. So you're talking about a lot less traffic, but still a high quality of life in that area. I think Washington Willow is around 220 acres. We're looking at around 145 here. So the comparison is appropriate. It's sure, you know, Kessler Mountain, Millsaps, what's happened with those is incredible. And if something like that were to occur here, it would be a great option. But those are really rare. And I think what Specialized has done is they've gone out and looked at neighborhoods around the country, those that are doing it really well, and those that have made mistakes, and they're bringing those concepts back to this design. And I think it could be a really positive thing for the community in the long run. so I support it thank you thank you who else would like to address this friend Alexander Fox Center Road I've changed this comment several times already tonight. I'm reminded of a friend of mine who has had a rough time in life, and she said when she gets to the pearly gates, if she gets to the pearly gates, she's going to cut in line because she's got questions and she wants them answered now. And that's kind of the way I feel about the process that we're going through. Again, I've been up here many times over many issues over many years, 32 exactly. And I want to know, these are things that we don't deal with and we don't really know. Why do neighbors have to continue to defend their established property from major impact because another landowner wants a rezoning? We need to really ask ourselves that. Why does a developer who buys property in an established residential zone get to turn around and throw people into major upheavals? by proposing to drop a small town with heavy traffic right in the middle of where they live, is in this way they are actually telling us what to do with our property. We're so hung up on not telling somebody what to do with theirs that's bought a new property. But by changing the zoning, they're telling us what we're to do with our property and how to change to fit around them. Why would the city's planning commission approve a development that is not compatible with the surrounding neighborhood of RSF4 density and allow for commercial development in the neighborhood? This commercial development is the big issue, the biggest issue of what this zoning would allow and change everything up there. And why would they believe that green space being proposed to the west would, of the impact of 476 houses, really stands a chance of supporting what's going on up there on that hilltop? We have experience with that with Mission Hills, which is at north and Mission, that Development was allowed to gouge out the side of the hill, which is essentially like knocking the legs out from under a table, and the homes above it are slowly subsiding down, as well as the street, which the city, Arlington Terrace, which the city has paid to repair, is. And I urge all of you today in an email to be sure and go to Mission Heights, which is down Mission Avenue, because there are 14 or 15 houses built already there, which would give you an idea of what the... the density could possibly be if you're going to squeeze another 476 houses on Markham Hill. You need to look at that. You need to stand in the middle of it. You need to experience what that is and take that 14 houses and multiply it up in your mind and in your vision and see what I'm talking about. This is not an enduring green network here. This is paving and rooftops and crowding, and there's no space for enough greenery to sustain that mountain. And if you studied enough environmental consequence of building on this kind of hill, you would understand that. And it's not the function of that hill to hold up that many houses. Uh, we don't know about the geology. We don't know about the water systems. We don't know. There's been no studies that I know about the wildlife and the ecosystem up there. Um, and if it's a fantasy to say that saying will not go on to MLK eventually, I've had a developer, not a developer, a planner in the city tell me, oh, sure. One of these days it'll connect. So anybody living under the impression that saying won't go from, um, MLK, well, from Whittington through to MLK is not realistic. And finally, I want to say that Once upon a time, they wanted to tear down Old Main and build a parking lot or anything else that they could think of at the university. And a lot of people thought that you want to tear down Markham Hill for a few houses, too many houses, and destroy the greenery there, that it's sustaining that mountain. And I really think it's the wrong thing to do. And we really need to understand your guidelines that you're supposed to go by that you're And what spot development is and the eight things that the appellate courts of Arkansas have recommended when you consider rezoning. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor Jordan, my name is Joe Paul. I live at 668 Gray Street. Are we allowed to ask a few questions of you? You can. Okay. If they're wrong or inappropriate, just stop me. Can SREG still responsibly develop the land that is in the RSF4 zoning right now? Can they responsibly develop it? No, I think they can, can't they? Certainly. It's zoned RSF4. It's got a hilltop, hillside overlay district zone. They would have to meet all the requirements. They would have to go through subdivision process. They would have to meet our tree ordinances, our storm drainage retention requirements, and the lot and block sizes that are required. Okay. Follow-up question to that. Can the developer ask for variances along the way as he builds this development? I'm sure he can, can't he? Yes. The short answer is yes, but the regulations are specific with regard to what the Planning Commission can vary and what the Board of Adjustment would have to hear. If the rezoning fails, how soon could the developer ask for another rezoning hearing? In about a year, can you? Well, if the – no, you can actually ask for another rezoning almost immediately as long as it's a different rezoning. You can't present the same proposal. That's right. If it's the same proposal, it will take a year. Whether the rezoning passes or fails, may the property be sold the following day? I don't know. Certainly it can be sold at any time by the owner. Could it be sold in part or in total? The owner can sell part of his land, doesn't have to sell it all. And he could do it tomorrow morning if you guys pass the rezoning tonight? Whether or not anything was passed. Okay. That's all I need. I'm against the rezoning. Leave it like it is. It's just fine for the neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Who wants to address this next? Mayor, City Council, I'm Ann Noland. I live at 1652 West Markham Road, which is a beautiful street right now. But if the rezoning is approved... There will be between 4,800 and could be up to 8,100 cars passing by daily, which would be like a Razorback game on a daily basis. I believe that we should not overpopulate an older neighborhood with a new urbanism development that would eliminate a dwindling mature tree canopy. I believe that appropriate infill would not be achieved by allowing the development to go through on Markham Hill. and having a build-out of homes and commercial structures that is not compatible with the surrounding land uses. This wooded property should be preserved as much as possible for the entire community and future generations to enjoy. When I spoke last time, I challenged each of you to take some time and go to Markham Hill and take a stroll on some of their great trails and just see for yourself I hope that you've had that opportunity, and if not, please try to do that. And I appreciate your time and efforts. Thank you. Thank you. May I give this to the clerk? Sure. My name is David Williams. I live at 547 North Gray here in Fayetteville, and thank you for the opportunity to speak. One of the main reasons I'm opposed to any change in Markham Hill PZD and RSF4 current zoning Because I think the current zoning does a better job of protecting us from the risks of economic environmental and quality of life losses Due to urban canopy losses looks to me like we lose fewer trees And we preserve more acres of urban forests and natural habitat by keeping the current zoning and that's crucial for the city and for the neighbors and for the area to get the benefits of of our urban tree canopy. My perspective on how important preserving and growing our UTC has been greatly influenced by the findings of our City of Fayetteville 2012 Urban Canopy Assessment. In 2012, the assessment established Fayetteville's tree canopy at 36 percent. It also documented a 10-year trend of losing 1.5% of the canopy, 90% of that loss due to development and impervious surface cover. And it identified six vital areas of urban canopy benefits. So these may be familiar to you, but I'm going to go through them real quickly. In 2012, our 36% tree canopy was identified reducing urban heat island effect and reducing cooling costs, improving air quality, water quality, and groundwater discharge, decreasing stormwater management and infrastructure costs, providing wildlife habitat and protecting biodiversity, improving property values and increasing tax revenues, and expanding recreational opportunities, public health, and well-being. In addition to finding these as the major benefits of our urban tree canopy, the assessment estimated the annual financial benefit of just the air quality and stormwater savings together of our 36% tree canopy was $67.6 million. If it declined to 30%, the value would drop to $46.9 million. If it increased as recommended to 40%, it equals $69.5 million. The urban study also said that the residential properties in Fayetteville make up a third of all the UTC coverage. They are the best area to invest in maintaining, preserving, and developing our urban tree canopy. I want to acknowledge what great work our city has done. in outreach and education in plannings and valuing and protecting our tree heritage that's part of the tradition here that's part of what you have done that's core to your values and i'm extremely grateful for that for me this exercise of looking at zoning options is essentially a risk management exercise in the midst of a lot of good going on from my point of view If we stick with the current Markham Hill PZD and our SF4 zoning, we lower the risk of significant economic, environmental, and quality of life benefit losses, and we increase the chances of our urban forestry continuing to benefit us big time. So I encourage you to stick with the existing zoning. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, who would be next? Mr. Mayor, members of the council, my name is Steve Clark. I live at 438 East Fairway Lane here in Fayetteville. I'm here tonight to express on behalf of the chamber our thanks to you, the members of the city council, and you, Mr. Mayor, and our admiration. This is a night about managing change, pure and simple. Managing change is very difficult. Managing change takes into account all the competing interests of a city approaching 90,000 people in population. Managing change takes into account wondering what tomorrow will be, not knowing what it will bring, and not having any real absolute guarantees. But yet you ran for these offices, and you agreed to do this very important job, and we thank you and we admire you for doing that. When it comes to this change... Like other changes that I've been up here before to talk to you about, it's going to come. It's just going to come. There are lots of times I wish it didn't in my life a number of times in my job and the job that I have and being a resident of this city. But change is coming. It has to be managed. And change, at least from the perspective of the chamber, is best managed by making informed and balanced decisions. and thoughtful decisions. That doesn't mean decisions that please everyone. So I live up on the hill where the country club is on 24th Street, and my neighborhood showed up, and we said, you guys can't do this. You're going to ruin everything we have in the area where we live. And we got you to come out and walk the hill, and we had a big crowd, and we told you that you were making a huge mistake if you let this change come. Well, the change came. I think it was unanimous vote, by the way, but the change came. Nothing's changed in my life. Nothing. So what I say to you in managing change is there's no crystal ball to get the absolute right answer. The answer comes from the advice that you get from your professionals, like Garner and others. The change comes and the advice comes from people whom you've listened to, and I know you've listened to lots of people. But eventually that is your decision to make. We have no opposition to this change. It might not be how we would have designed it. It is easy for us to critique particular proposals of the change because that's doing change by committee and not by the direction of, in this instance, the owner and with the guidance and the help of the city. So to us, change is coming. The things that have been mentioned tonight are absolutely critical and crucial to creating and continuing the sense of place that's failable. So eloquently, the previous speaker talked about our canopy coverage and the importance of that, and it is. And this change takes into account those issues. Maybe not exactly like everyone else would want them done, but it does take that into account. That's important to us. A changing city is important to us. Just this past weekend, we had ink and art. I suspect many of you did not attend. I did. I do not have a tattoo, but I did. I did. Somebody said to me, why in the world would Fayetteville have a celebration about ink and art? People between the ages of 15 and 59, 48% of them have some body art. It's not a tattoo. It's body art. And that's the talent we're trying to recruit. This area that's being developed is about recruiting, and you just heard John speak about recruiting people who are talented to our community. So I say to you that this change is difficult, but this change is one that I believe in goodness and fairness and in balance to the things that happen in our city is one we can embrace and accept and our city can move forward. Thank you. Okay, who would be next? Mr. Mayor and Council, I want to thank you for the great work that you do for this wonderful city of Fayetteville. I'm Alan Smith. I don't live here. I live in Little Rock. But I am an Arkansan, and I'm very proud of northwest Arkansas and Fayetteville. We drive a lot of people up here to take a look at it with our television shows and what we do. I have – my career has been based on conservation and preservation. I have a large organic farm, and we promote that in all that we do. I come to this really as a – Having a different perspective. I've had an opportunity for the last two years, over two years now, watching over the shoulder of what Specialized is doing, interfacing with a lot of the experts they've brought to this property. And it's been really quite an exercise. I work on properties around the country. We have a couple going on in Louisiana, one in Mississippi, one in Georgia. I've been to Serebry more times than I want to count. And I'm telling you that what they're doing here is they're trying to craft a new model. Mr. Clark very eloquently pointed out the need for change. Change is inevitable. Change will happen. that property will be developed. How will it be developed? That's the question. Now, I have been a part of walks and talks and talked to ornithologists, herpetologists. We've talked to ecologists, environmentalists, archaeologists. They've had them all up there. Of all the projects that I've been involved with, I haven't been involved with one that has thoroughly looked under every rock on that property. Now, when you talk about conservation development, go back to Seth's original presentation and look at what they're trying to do in the way of conserving wildness. We're not talking about open space. We're talking about what Thoreau talked about as wildness. This has been a part of every conversation that I've been involved with. They've had experts from Canada come. all over this country to come up and to look at this properly. You, as a community, are lucky to have a group that wants to take such a responsible approach to this development. The other aspect of it for me, personally, that I've been interested in is not only the interface of nature and having a light hand on the environment, which is at the top of every conversation that they have, But how do we bring the generations together? I'm very interested in multi-generational connectivity. We have to make a place for our seniors. I'm interested in active adult, 55 plus, assisted living, independent living, and memory care where people can live out their lives in their community. And these are trends. Just like Mr. Clark said, they're coming. And we have to be ready for them. It excites me to think about this community. I've been privy to many of the charrettes and exercises where and which model houses have been drawn, all with great sensitivity to the environment and to the community, and they're really trying to create a model. We need a new model, not only in Fayetteville but in Arkansas. We need a new model in this country for development. What I don't want to see is more what I see out there on Weddington, more suburbs, good land gobbled up. They have a very concise and deliberate approach to what they're trying to do with this property. And I think you've got an opportunity to have a model here in Fayetteville that the nation can follow. They have been all over the country and looked at these properties as I have. And they come with this, come to this, with a great deal of expertise and a great sense of stewardship, not only for that piece of property, but for the entire city. And I hope you will consider their proposal for developing Markham Hill. Thank you. Who would like to address us next? I'm Robert Kosar. I live at 1777 West Tossall Road. And I... Kind of want to distill what I've heard this evening. It appears that there's going to be development, and there needs to be development, but I'm not sure this is the right plan. I think that it would be better for all if we maybe downsized the request at this point and made it a little bit at a time, because all you have is a plan at this point. You have your PCD that restricts development at this point. Now you're throwing it wide open. There's got to be a middle ground here. I think you're trying to bite off too much at one time. I would suggest that you take this back and come up with maybe a smaller first step on this property. You're going to develop it while you take the time to evaluate the traffic, evaluate the resources, the utilities, what the total impact is on this area and on the neighborhood and on Fayetteville as a whole. Think you're rushing too fast too far with this proposal. I think it needs to take smaller steps Take it back do what you need to do to make it Economically viable for the property owner at this point, but don't take it all in one big step Design it like it's a project. All you have is both of this point. You don't have a plan you got bill of assurances from the developer and But you don't have any limitations on the property. You don't have anything about green space. You don't have anything about buffers in those villas and jerses. So please take it back. Come up with a real plan. Come up with something that we can all live with and be happy with. That's a better thing for Fayetteville to take your time. You don't have to rush into this. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Who's next? My name is Doug James. I live at 2604 East Goldenrod Street. You didn't say it, Bill. And I taught at the University of Arkansas for 24 years, and I'm now retired. And I used to take my ecology classes up to Markham Hill, and it was very enjoyable. And the problem is that the university would clear out areas that I used. When I first arrived here in 1953, I was mammal trapping. And I found an area to set out the traps on the slope opposite the science engineering building. But when they built the science engineering building, they cleared out that slope. And then I had to move to six different places. to find an adequate habitat. And the last place was the grove of trees in front of the president's house. And I picked sites that were within walking distance of the class. So I frequently visited and set up my environmental measurements instruments That would measure the temperature relative to humidity, et cetera, on the ground and off the ground, so that we would get a profile of what the temperature was on the ground versus off the ground. And so in my 24 years, I had to use six different places that... That suited me. One of the places was the scrub at the end of the stadium. And when they built the stadium parking lot, that cleared out. So I constantly had to find new places that fit my criteria that was in walking distance for the class. The, uh... The last place I used was Markham Hill. And now I think that the university property, I don't know where it is, actually. One of the maps that Seth showed did show the university property. And that's the area that I was using at the end. So I'm sorry I'm handicapped because I had... I've run three miles a day for most of my life, and I wore out my knee cartilages, and I had to get knee replacements. And I'm still recovering from that. Well, that's my story. And I enjoy Markham Hill. I've been up there constantly. And I've studied the botany up there as well as zoology. And there was some endangered plants up there on Markham on the Kessler Mountain, but I'm not talking about Kessler Mountain today. And fortunately, Kessler Mountain has been preserved thanks to Lionel Jordan. What? Oh. Oh. Okay, my wife tells me the time's up, and she wrote down my address because I've moved three times in recent years, and I can't remember which address is appropriate. And another thing, what happened to McDonald's running courses up there? I used to run with his track team. Interesting. I found that the athletes were hanging their sweatshirts on a fence across the pasture where the red barn is now. And so I borrowed a brassiere from my wife and hung it on the fence. Well, I don't think anyone's going to beat that, but who would like to be? Okay. This is quite a thing, seeing the people on both sides here. I mean to be speaking and to start off for Markham Hill to be in the hands of a specialized we couldn't ask for it to be in better hands. But to be speaking against Ken Smith is just doesn't really make any sense at all in my brain so I'm having trouble kind of going with that. You know, Arkansas is a natural state, and Fayetteville carries the torch for that. And Markham is the heart of that. The history there, there's so much up there. If you've never walked in those woods and you're making this decision, you're really missing out. I mean, you've got to walk into the woods, not just the trails, off the trail, into the woods. That's important to get into this space. And it's important to have these spaces where you can walk off, maybe get a little turned around, not little chopped up areas. Yeah. I think a lot of the plan, I completely agree with. I think 500 units is way too much. I think that's just not, even if you cut that in half and half again, I think that might be a little bit more appropriate. But if you look behind you, the logo behind you has mountains behind it, and it's probably inspired by Markham. That's an inspiration. Yeah. and it's important to hang on to the things that make Fayetteville Fayetteville, and that's about all I've got right now. Thank you. Thank you. What's your name? Oh, Trey Marley, 1440 Markham. Who else would be next? Okay. Nobody else? All right. Okay. Keaton Smith. I live on 4th Street in South Fayetteville. First, I just wanted to acknowledge that a lot of folks I really admire have spoken on this issue tonight. You know, David Williams, Fran Alexander, Ken Smith. You didn't get a timer going. And those folks have contributed so much to the quality of life in Fayetteville, and a lot of other folks that have spoken have as well. So I just wanted to acknowledge them. But I'm speaking in support of the rezone request. And I spend a lot of my time advocating for housing and for the environment. And those are the two reasons why I support this rezone. Like has been said before tonight, we're growing. And our choice is where do we want to grow and how do we want to grow? And I think adding... The units where we can is the responsible thing to do, both for housing affordability as well as the environment. I acknowledge the environmental benefits of tree canopy, of CO2 sequestration, of stormwater management. Those are very, very real concerns, and I'm grateful that so much land is being permanently conserved as a part of this proposal. People want to live in Fayetteville. People are going to continue to move to Fayetteville. People are going to continue to buy houses in Fayetteville. And locating those housing units in close proximity to commercial opportunities, close proximity to our major employers like the University of Arkansas, it's a much more environmentally sustainable way to develop our town. Because if it's not, if we don't add the housing units there, they're going to be added elsewhere and eventually, most likely, on the outskirts, which would increase transportation costs, city public infrastructure costs, greenhouse gas emissions from single occupant vehicle transportation. So... affordable housing and environmental concerns are the issues that I care most about and spend a lot of time working on, and that's why I support this rezone request. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Sonia Gutierrez, 127 East Connor. I spoke last time to... in opposition of the rezoning, and I'm going to stick with that. I did follow up Mayor Jordan with Specialized, and I had a meeting with them and asked them a lot of questions. They were very open and honest about all the questions I had, even the hard ones, and I love their projects. I love what they do in Fayetteville. I'm a big fan of Uptown Project. But when I asked about affordable housing, the truth was that the land is so valuable that it actually doesn't fall within affordable. And I'm concerned about the traffic. I'm concerned about the density. I'm here in solidarity with the residents who live in their place, understand this feeling and this quality of life that they have, this culture that they have. And I feel that that's what they've built, where they've lived, and what they deserve to keep. I do think there's some development that probably would need to happen there. I do. I think something more reasonable could potentially be there. I don't think that one of the interesting comments I heard tonight was that rezoning would help financial success of the barn. And I don't think that's a really positive way to spin that. You know, rezoning hopefully is financial success depends on business planning. So that's not a good reason for bringing that up. My fifth and sixth points are these. Think about Fayetteville 50, 75 years from now. What decisions that we make now, how's Fayetteville going to look in 50 years, 75 years? And the decisions that seem quick and short now. How what is that going to look like to the next group of people? I'm asking you guys to raise the bar about what we want for development. I love what Specialized does. They're amazing. Can we ask the bar to be raised? That's all I'm asking. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Mayor Jordan. Mayor Jordan. Friends, neighbors, I've lived in Fayetteville. My name is Christine Haller. I live at 1659 West Maple Street, right where it dead ends, near Markham Hill. I've lived in Fayetteville 30 years and my home now for 25. I think it's difficult to be talking about specialized real estate because I feel that they seem very honorable. I really appreciate the developments that they've done. I trust that they really believe this is a wonderful thing, but I do think the points that people have made about thinking down the line, 50 years from now, you have a place that's zoned for a hotel. So could that be Aramada Inn? Yeah. All of us, you know, we have a certain shelf life, and so we all pass on one way or the other, either move away or die. But the things that we decide now will be something that will be affecting this community down the line. So this zoning is going to stay in perpetuity as well or until something else gets changed. I think that the comments made about... Roads having to be connected. I think there are a lot of roads eventually that are going to have to be connected up to come Through the neighborhood to support something like this So when and the other thing is that there is a lot of wildlife in Around that neighborhood when you have a lot of homes or even one home all of a sudden the animals and plants that I mean the animals that were there now become pests so and the deer are things that you would like to say, hmm, maybe that could be barbecue or something like that. Or the groundhogs that are coming into your nice garden you've planted are, you know, something that your dog is running out and trying to kill. Your cats are going out and killing the birds and things that are there. And you have, you know, 500 or so houses 50 years down the road, they're going to be saying, well, you know, we've been here and those things are coming in. And They're eating our landscape and they're eating things. And so I would say, you know, advocating for the fact that the things that are there now will become pests for the people that will be living there. So I would be for continuing with the same zoning that we have now. So thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, who else would like to address this? Hi, good evening, Mayor Jordan and City Council members. My name is Teresa Turk. I live at 1408 West Cleveland. During the past couple of days, I have reviewed the City Council's decision and processes concerning the creation of the PCD in 2005 and also the decision to allow three lots to be partitioned off the original PCD in 2012. As is today, there was a great deal of concern from the neighborhood on the number of vehicles, traffic congestion, and the changing fabric of the neighborhood. In 2005, a decision was agreed upon by the city council to establish the current PZD, and that the remainder of the property would be Zone SF4. It was really a compromise between Jillian Archer and the University Heights neighborhood, and it was endorsed by the city council. The surrounding neighborhood around there from at least a five-mile radius is almost all SF4, and some have less than one dwelling per acre. But the intent of that agreement in 2005 was very clear. Markham Hill would continue to have this PZD and the SF4 zoning for a very, very long time, not for 13 years, as is we're here today again, but for a long time. That's what reading the documents showed to me. It sends a strong message that that was the decision and the pledge to keep this hillside and its historic components mostly rural. The current proposed rezoning is not compatible with the surrounding rural areas and is not encouraging conservation or preservation despite what we've heard today. I think we can do much better. I agree with Sonia. We can raise the bar a lot higher. We also have the opportunity to include and expand our green network and the ecology of the area. Just recently, about six or seven months ago, the city council actually passed the energy action plan. I think it would be great for you all to go back and review that because what you have here, what you're planning on doing with this rezoning is going against much of that energy action plan. So I'd really ask you to go back and look at that. The other thing is, is that. If this rezoning occurs, it will create huge traffic jams like we've heard before, congestion issues. It will increase the noise. It will destroy potential archaeological sites and will likely end the National Register designation of the Archer Cottage and the Arkansas Historic Register designation of the Hilltop. That's not preservation. That's going backwards. That's not preserving our history when there's a tremendous amount of history. I've just named a few of them. But, you know, the dean of the law school, I mean, you've heard from many members in the audience tonight how they've been up there, how they've done their research, how they've ridden their horses. There is a great deal of Fayetteville history on that hill. It is a special place. It deserves special consideration. Thank you. It deserves rethinking this, having this a much broader, larger plan with a lot of details, not just going through the typical process. This deserves special consideration. In the past, when we've decided to preserve certain structures like Old Main and like Cardinal Hall, those have actually helped our city. That's why we have a livable city. That's why people want to be here. People come here to stay in Cardinal Hall. They love it. But both of those structures were threatened with being torn down, with being changed forever. So I know Markham Hill is different than these two historic structures, but there's a lot of similarities in other ways. That is a historic area that is the very fabric of our city. So please, please, please take your time. Consider a lot of alternatives. Do not rush this through. I think Fayetteville deserves, and the citizens here deserve, to have all things considered. So thank you very much for your time and attention. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Okay. Well, I'm going to bring the first item back to the council. And so we have another one after this, so what's your pleasure? Sure. thank you yeah i just have um a brief i think a brief question um we heard a little bit about archaeological sites from a couple commenters and just briefly too and i'm wondering if the applicant has any has investigated that at all if you could inform you about it thank you mr mayor uh in response to alderman petty's question um yes we have been to see dr uh brandon at the Arkansas Archaeological Survey and because we're the property owners he was able to actually release to us their internal documents Stating what was found and the short version is there were two sites that have been studied Numerous times I believe five or six times each and they keep going back and not finding anything again We would be ecstatic if we could find some awesome artifact or relic that would really add to the interestingness of the neighborhood and the historical story layers. So we certainly intend to get to the bottom of, if there's anything, but the concept of sacred sites or burial sites. So we've spoken with the Arkansas Heritage, Arkansas Natural Heritage Association, which is a state agency that governs our state parks and historic resources. And they've also indicated in a report that we forwarded to you guys a couple of days ago that there's really nothing of dramatic interest up there, and they have no reason to believe that there are any sacred or burial sites at all. I had one more question. Maybe this is for you, maybe this is for staff. Someone claimed that there wasn't a density cap, but reading of the bill of assurance was that there was a limit on the number of units offered by the applicant. Has that changed, or am I just wrong about it? No, the bill of assurance does provide a density cap of 476 units. Okay, thank you. Mr. Mayor, I remember there was a question about whether we had sufficient water pressure up there. I know we have a representative from our water department here, and I wonder if you could answer that. Sure. Yeah. So the water pressure on the hill is determined by the water elevation in the tank, and so there is some fluctuation as the water inside the tank fluctuates. But we have to maintain a 20 PSI. is a minimum for State Department of Health requirements, and we're at our lowest. We're about 30 PSI at any time. If there was another major develop there, would there be any issue about sufficient water or water pressure if there's 500 houses there? Water pressure is going to stay the same based on elevations, and I think we have adequate distribution system to accommodate. All right, thanks. Thanks. Well, I got a lot of people calling from that area who don't think they got good water pressure. So anyway, I'll just leave it at that. Oh, good, John. I think John, though, has the floor next. And then Mark. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This will be a question for the applicant, Mr. Mims. You've held several community meetings prior to filing your rezoning request. Do you know the date of your first meeting? Approximately? Yes, they started in April. this year yes sir okay well those are the official meetings mr. mayor that started in April we met one-on-one with several different neighbors in their living rooms over the last couple of years thank you yes sir we recently approved the 20-year plan and in that water plan it's recognized with growth in that area and looking at the engineering behind that plan there should be adequate water pressure okay Adele Mayor, I would like to move us to the third and final reading. Second motion, Mayor. Okay. We have a motion and second to go to the third and final reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? Oh, sorry. No, just this one. I'm going to take them one at a time. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. That motion passed. Okay. An ordinance to rezone that property described in rezone petition RZN 18-6317 for approximately 119.43 acres located west of Markham Road from RSF 4 residential single family 4 units per acre and CPZD commercial planned zoning district to rezone approximately 75.42 acres to RIU residential intermediate urban. approximately 44.01 acres to RA residential agricultural subject to a bill of assurance yes thank you mayor we've heard a lot tonight and I don't want to take everything point by point although I you know of course I got opinions a lot of different things but I want to try and just address a couple of things and then make my final point which is about preservation first I'll say I intend to support the project, the rezoning request. But before I explain the core reason why I wanted to address a couple of things we did here, first is about traffic. So while we were hearing about traffic, and I expected to hear a little bit about traffic tonight, I was surprised we didn't hear very much about it at the last meeting, while we were here I started looking up traffic counts. Every year the Arkansas Department of Transportation does traffic counts. And they do them not just for state highways but also for city-owned streets, not every street but many streets. And so some of the claims we got that there could be as many as 6,000 more vehicles per day were striking to me. I don't generally put a whole lot of faith into traffic studies because having read so many traffic studies and talked over drinks with traffic engineers, I think it's very easy to make a traffic study say whatever you want. But I wanted to at least get a comparison against some of the numbers we heard tonight. So I looked some up. West Dixon Street, more or less our main street in the city, West Dixon Street, sees a little bit more than 9,000 vehicles per day. I know very few people want to live next to West Dixon, so just take that as a benchmark. West Lafayette, one block to the north, direct to the University, sees 4,900 per day. West Cleveland, cut through Cleveland, the hill part, where it's almost impossible to hold to the speed limit. West Cleveland only sees 3,900 per day. I say only, I don't say only because 3,900 is a very small number, I say only because I'm trying to compare it to the 6,000 figure that's been thrown out at us tonight. But what was most striking to me in some of the numbers I looked up was East Maple in the heart of the Washington Willow Historic District, which sees 13,000 vehicles per day. 13,000 vehicles per day in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city where homes still have incredible resale value, where people still want to live. I'm bringing this up because I worry sometimes that make predictions based on the facts we know today, but the predictions might get overblown. And I think some of that's happening here. I think that this could be a very nice neighborhood. I think that... For those of us that will still be around after it's finished, we might really enjoy taking a stroll up through there on new public trails or a run or taking our kids out to what feels like a parkland with so much open space being preserved. And I want to come back to the open space in a second. The second thing I want to talk about was Mount Sequoia, another hill. Fayetteville has been a city of hills. Mount Nord was the first hill that got developed. Then it was the square where we are today and the university. Okay. concurrently and then mount sequoia in mount sequoia there's a uh an old church camp at the top that's no longer church affiliated the assembly and that's 36 acres and it has a hotel on it still operated as a lodging house it's five stories wesley hall it's got the tallest roof we think in the state of arkansas but certainly in the city on this I think that's somewhat commensurate. Mount Sequoia also has all the cottages that they use to host weddings. I think it's very similar. The Mount Sequoia woods just to the east of the assembly are 70 acres of preserved woods. They didn't get preserved through a rezoning. They got preserved through a permanent transaction. Also on Mount Sequoia, just west of the assembly down the hill, you have duplexes and fourplexes. There's a multifamily condo project. And still, Mount Sequoia uphill and Washington Willow downhill are two of the most desirous neighborhoods in the city. They weren't ruined. They weren't ruined. It wasn't like a bomb went off in the middle of the neighborhood. I don't think this will be – I certainly don't think this will be as wildly detrimental as we have been asked to believe. I don't even think that this will be bad. I think it would be quite good in my estimation. And that brings me to the main reason that I support the rezoning, and it's because of the plan to preserve the side of the hill on the west. People keep telling us, trying to convince us, that the PZD has preserved so much land, but it hasn't. This is going to come up over and over again until a council in the future has such extreme housing pressures or such extreme pressures for other things that they do a rezoning. And probably not to something that is as thoughtful as this proposal. The only way to preserve property is for the city to own it or for it to end up in some kind of conservation easement or a land trust or some similar entity. That's the only way. You have to have some kind of contractual obligation that goes in perpetuity for land to be preserved. Rezoning doesn't do it. That's just kicking the can down the road to a future council and a future fight. So that's why I'm supporting it. This is a permanent action. Whether or not a specialized project succeeds or even begins, we get that preservation. They could sell it tomorrow and we'd still have that preservation. The hotel could fail and we'd still have that land preserved, for real preserved, not in a tree preservation ordinance where it gets closed off and nobody gets to experience it anymore, but actually preserved, actually committed to being open space, actually committed to letting us put public trails through there. That is something that is wildly advantageous, I think, to future generations. We should make those kinds of commitments. That's why we preserved Kessler. That's why we bought land next to Goldie Park, just to make stuff like that permanent. Absolutely permanent. I think anybody that believes the rezoning today has preserved anything is being too hopeful. And I really believe in the power of hope, and this community has a lot of it, but it is not enough to actually preserve woodlands. And I think this will. So that's why I support it. Okay. Sarah. Thank you. Thank you. I also strongly support this development. I think we've been hearing a false dichotomy in the community about, you know, we can develop it or preserve it. But as Council Member Petty stated, you know, there is no preservation. It is just yet to be developed. And if you look at the development potential, what is possible now by right is far worse from an environmental and community development standpoint than the proposal on the table. What they are proposing to do is instead of litter the entire hillside, the most ecologically sensitive and significant portion with single-family homes, instead they want to preserve that and move the development to the previously disturbed top of the mountain. And that in itself is a win for the environment. But secondly, the proposal to go from RSF4, which is only single-family homes, to the RIU, which allows for diversity of housing, is really important for the changing demographics of our community. And thinking about, you know, as the population of that neighborhood ages, there will be a point when many people in the neighborhood are no longer able to maintain their large single-family homes. But maybe they'd like to stay in the neighborhood. Right? You know, I think it would be fantastic if there were ADA accessible cottages up on top of the mountain or retirement facilities where people who have always lived on the mountain can continue to live on the mountain. Where people who have different family structures than, you know, what has been traditionally by... Within five years, we're looking at over 85% of our households having no children present. So we already have a vast majority of single and one- and two-person households. And so we need smaller housing types, and that is how it becomes more affordable. And the idea of having apartments, row houses, a diversity of housing types to meet the different needs is really important as our community changes. Okay. I think about, there's a lot of fear about the potential for hotels and multifamily, but If you look at examples from around the country, like the village at Grand Traverse Commons in Traverse City, Michigan, started with a lovely historic facility that was restored and turned into condominiums, and now there are opportunities for all different types of people to live there, and it's a beautiful highlight of their city. I look at developments such as the McMinimins in Troutdale, Oregon, which is a lovely retreat center, a very popular destination for tourists. all sorts of events. I think about Mount Sequoia here in the city of Fayetteville and a lot of the educational conferences that have been there. I mean, recently I was speaking on energy issues at a summer energy academy there. It would be great if our community could host more of those types of events in this lovely retreat-like setting. That could be a really beautiful addition to our community, right? And I know that there's a lot of concern about transit and traffic, but thinking about, you know, this is less than a half a mile to our largest employer. That's walking distance. I walk four times that distance to work each day. And I think that many people who live on that community will do so to take advantage of the opportunity to engage in active transportation and walk to the university, whether that's to teach there, to be an administrator, or to be a student. and by having that density on the top of the mountain, it will make it feasible for us to serve it with transit so that perhaps some of the elderly residents who can no longer drive after dark, they don't lose their ability to be independent, you know, to go and take in a show at the Walton Arts Center and have a safe ride home that's independent, and maybe that's Also, you know, the ability to get on a transit bus and get to the doctor or for the people that clean their houses and take care of their yards and maintain their homes to have access to them without all having to drive single occupant vehicles. I think that this is a wonderful opportunity for our town and that. That. Instead of viewing this as bad development and more houses, that we need to think of this as an opportunity to be a welcoming city, to welcome new neighbors, new friends, people that want to live in the same type of places that we love and enjoy, that appreciate access to trails and green space and being able to walk to their jobs and go to a lovely farm-to-table restaurant. I would love to have these amenities in my neighborhood. Okay. So I'm going to support this, and I'm looking forward to the beautiful development on top of Markham Hill. Okay. Kyle. Well, I don't really want to talk about this so much. I don't know that there's a lot left to say. We've heard a whole lot about it. This is maybe one of the hardest things, decisions that have come up for me since I've been up here. So I'm not going to try to convince anybody how to vote. I just kind of want to. Share where I'm where I'm thinking right now because there's a lot to think about there's a lot of big issues We've got trees and traffic Property values neighborhood memories. This seems to be the big one But also need for housing. I Would love to just leave this the way it is. I Think that that would be fantastic. I But every time I think that, I find myself wondering if I'm able to stick to the sort of policy directions that I've said are important to me. I can't stop running the numbers, and I think that growth is probably one of the biggest challenges out of all of those that we've got to deal with. So I'm not sure where this falls in the balance between the preservation and the growth and the existing neighborhood. I'm hopeful, Mr. Mims talks about taking a slow deployment, kind of doing this over many years that we're gonna that the neighborhood development process may outlast some of the neighbors in the neighborhood. So I'm counting on him to stay sensitive to the site even over time. It's not a proposal versus perfect decision. It's not even a proposal versus now decision. I think it's got to be what's in front of us versus what's possible if we don't. And tonight we saw a potential alternative reality that, quite honestly, kind of made my stomach sour. Just the possibility of what happens to the west side of that mountain under the under RSF for I Mean that's that's my neighborhood out on on the other side of the highway And I don't think it fits there. So The RIU doesn't scare me so much. I think It's a good opportunity for variety. It's just the big change and I think that's gonna be tough for everybody Well Kyle I've been at these tough decisions a lot longer than you, and this is a hard one. It is a hard one. But I think we as a city are very, very lucky to have a developer who has not done the quick and short. You know, it may seem like it's short, but you've heard several tonight saying they've been visiting with Mr. Mims for two years. And I know that that is true. I know that he has spoken to... anyone that he thought could give him information that he needed to make this the best development for the city of Fayetteville. And, in fact, as Mr. Allen has said, a new model, which is needed. And I think it's exciting, once again, that Fayetteville gets to be first on something. We get to have a new model. And I won't go over all of the amenities that Councilwoman Marsh has talked about. All of those sound wonderful, especially as we think about a retirement place. So I just think there are a lot of good things that this development could bring to us. And I agree with Councilmember Smith. I'd love to just leave it. But, you know, it's like I've said to the mayor, we cannot buy every beautiful hill in Fayetteville like we did Kessler. You know, we just cannot. And so we have to depend on forward-thinking developers who can – Do as I think Mr. Mims has done, and that is consult and consult and consult and do the very best he can for this with this development. I love the idea of a lot of diversity in housing, and I think there hasn't been enough said about that tonight. and I've heard some of these young urban folks talk about, we have way too many three-bedroom, two-bath houses in Fayetteville. And as we've heard, we're not going to be needing those. We need different kinds of houses, whether it's townhouses or apartments or whatever. And I know that's what we are going to have in this development. So I will be very... excited i agree that we do need to um uh keep that 44 acres and and we're just going to have to shoo our wildlife over there when the deer start when the deer start eating our uh start eating the landscaping on the top of the hill but there there will be plenty of acreage for the wildlife and you know wildlife might not want to be um but that'll be plenty of room for them. You know, we've heard a lot about, well, I mean, we had this PZD for ever and ever. Folks, it's not that way. Our city attorney has told us so many times, we as a council do not tie the hands of future councils. Past councils have not tied our hands and cannot because of change. Change is so important. And, you know, I've seen a whole bunch in my years. And there's going to be a bunch more change. And that is what we're talking about tonight. It's painful. But we have to have faith that this developer who has consulted and consulted to make it the very best, he's going to do that. So I hope that we can... all come together and realize that this is going to be good for Fayetteville. And I will be supporting it, even though I know that it's very difficult. And thank you very much for all of your input. Okay. Sir? Yes. You know, growing up in Fayetteville, I have sentimental memories. you know, memories of Markham Hill, like many of you that even if you don't live there, we've all been there, we've hiked there, we, you know, some of you rode horses there. So this is really challenging because in my... In my heart, I would love to see, now that I'm here and I have my home, I'd love to see things stay the way that I'm used to seeing them. I guess that's because I'm getting older. I don't know. But I like to see the historic district look the way that it did when I was in high school. And I like to see things, you know, stay the same. But in my head, I know that's not possible. There's always going to be change. And I think that the sentimental reasons that I would not be in support of this are outweighed by what I think can be possible on this property. And do I have concerns? You bet I do. Am I... You know, I'm just, like Adela said, it's an imperfect process, but I have hope and faith that we can plan the best we can. And we have these challenges that we have to take on all the time, and it's not an easy decision. I've read all your letters. I've read your emails. I've talked to many of you on the phone. You know, it's not an easy decision because you all have very heartfelt reasons why you think we should not vote in favor of this. And some of those I kind of share a little bit myself. But I do believe that the best way to preserve this land, the only way to preserve this land, is to go with the 44 acres and the permanent action that we're getting with the bill of assurances and everything. I don't see any other way that we can, if it's left RSF 4, it will be developed at that. I don't see how we can say that it won't be. I think that's, like Matthew said, kicking the can down the road. I like the fact that most of the development stays on top of the hill. That's the land that's already been cleared. That's where buildings have already been. That's where they will be in the future. I like that idea. There's a lot of concern about the commercial that could be built there. or that will be built there as part of this proposal. And I have concerns with that also, but I live on Mount Sequoia. And, you know, many people have mentioned what I still call the Methodist Assembly up there and the buildings there. And, you know, they're all – I've been to events there. I've swum in the pool there. I'm still able to run in that area and walk my dog in that area. And there's still lots of trees and there's lots of – You know nature in that area and I think we can preserve and maintain that here and still have the development I do have concerns about traffic Anytime there's a development that goes in it does it increases the traffic and I understand that the streets are very narrow but we don't widen streets unless there's And add sidewalks and all of these things unless there's a demand for it and that usually is is very you know, brought about by a subdivision going in. So streets in my neighborhood, streets in your neighborhood, if you live in a developed subdivision, you might have a street widened when more houses are built or improvements made or a stop sign or a stoplight or something. So to help with the flow of traffic. These are all possibilities at a later date. You know, I'm just, you know, I just, I'd love to, I wish that we had just a big sack of money that we could just reach into and take it out and just sprinkle it here and have all the things that have all this wonderful maintained green space and still have affordable housing and still have maybe not so affordable housing for people that want to move here. We need all types of housing. And, you know, it's just a hard decision, but I'm going to vote in favor of this. Thank you. Okay. John. I can find my button. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I really do appreciate everybody coming out tonight, even though it does make for a very long city council meeting, but that's why we make big bucks, right? We come and listen, and we do want to hear you. And we did hear you tonight, and all of your concerns – I've thought about them. I've read most of the emails, although I generally have an office policy in my office. If it's longer than two paragraphs, it doesn't get read. So if you want to email me, try to keep it short and concise, and I'll read it all. I know the general tenure of the emails that are coming in, whether you support it or whether you oppose it. And I'm sensitive to all of those things, but I'm conflicted. You understand? Yeah. I'd love to vote with my neighbors and say, this is what you want. I represent you. I'll vote this way. But sometimes leadership, if leadership is anything, it has to be more than sticking your political finger into the wind to see which way it's flowing. Sometimes you have to jump out in front and say, this is the way we should go. And that's the way I feel about this project. Several of you expressed an opinion that the proposed development would not be compatible with the existing neighborhood. But Garner Stahl and his planning staff, our experts, say it is. Some of you said it'll kill the environment up there. Yet our Environmental Impact Committee voted unanimously that it wouldn't. So I'm conflicted. I have said before, I'm on the Equipment Committee, subcommittee of our city council, I can look at a backhoe for three weeks or two months, and I couldn't tell if it's worn out. I'm not trained to know if a backhoe is good or bad. I'm trained to fight the IRS on tax matters. I have to rely on other experts to tell me the track code is bad and we need to replace it. It's the same with our experts in planning. It's the same with our experts in environmental matters. I'm not a chemistry major, and I couldn't balance an equation now in chemistry. I had one high school course in it and decided I didn't like it and went into business. Those are the things that we have to do as city council members. We have to depend on our experts, and they're paid for that. They have experience in these areas, and that's what I'm trying to do tonight. Steve Clark made some very good points. Change is coming. The word is out, folks. This is a good place to live. For the same reasons you want to live here, a thousand other people every, somebody said per week, somebody said per month. I don't know what it is, but a lot of people are coming, okay? But that's good news for you and me. It presents problems, but those are good problems to have. Don Moore and I were sitting at the Arkansas Municipal League in the big room where everybody eats and all the exhibit hall is. And he was telling me, when we talk about traffic in this environment right here, he said there are probably 1,000. The Arkansas Municipal League is where all the mayors and city council members from all the little towns around Arkansas come. And we're one of the largest cities there. And he was saying, there are probably a lot of people sitting in this room right now that would love to have a traffic problem. They don't even have a red light in their town. He's saying, I try to emphasize that. I don't like traffic. I try to plan my day around traffic. And I'm sure many of you do also. But it's a good problem to have. I'd rather have that problem than no traffic at all. That means nobody would want to live here. So we need to look to the future, as we were challenged to do by a couple of the speakers today. Steve Clark did a good job saying change is coming. We need to embrace it. We need to move along with it. He also gave a good example. When some developers wanted to develop right near his neighborhood, up near the country club, I went and I walked that land. And we had a field trip with the council members, and we all went and we looked up and down the street, and all the neighbors came out to tell us what a bad idea it was and how it was going to be horrible. And now Steve is admitting no change. it didn't adversely impact his property values or his way of life. And I think pretty much if there is change here, I live in that neighborhood, and if there is change there, I think it will be a small change, not a big change. But I think it will be a good change, actually. I'm looking forward to having those nature trails and opening them up. Several people, several of our speakers tonight invited us to go and walk that land. I thought they were inviting us to trespass. We don't own that land, and they don't own that land. Somebody else owns that land. But with the proposal, we will own part of that land. It will be public access. So that gives us an opportunity to enjoy that natural setting. Trees. It's a big issue with me. I know you're surprised at that. I like trees. I plant trees in my yard, but I tend to like private property also. Many of you want to preserve trees. What makes you think that the developers don't want to preserve trees? The more trees they leave on those lots for houses, the more money they can get for those lots. Just like you like trees, everybody moving to Fayetteville likes trees. That's why they come. So the developers have an economic incentive to preserve as much tree canopy as they can, and I think they've done an excellent job choosing the majority of the development to be in an area that's already been cleared by someone else. They're not clearing a lot of the existing trees. Matthew Petty made a very good point. Traffic was sticking in my mind. I was thinking, how are we going to... People who came and spoke were saying they'll increase our traffic count by 6,000 cars or there'll be 6,000 new trips taking every day or periodically. Well, it dawned on me, and it's exactly what Matthew Petty did. He looked up the traffic counts. I thought, 6,000, is that big or small? I don't know if that's a lot or if that's a little. And I started wondering, I wonder how many people drive past my house. It could be 6,000 also right now. And I didn't know that, but he put it in perspective for us. that many of our most desirable neighborhoods have higher traffic counts than that. So just having an additional 6,000 trips, if in fact it does result in that increase, it may not have an adverse effect on your property values or your way of life, much like we've seen in the other parts of town. So for these reasons, and I am torn. I realize this is a political issue. It's going to cost me some votes, okay? But I have to do... what's best for the city, what I think is best for the city, not necessarily what's best for the people who are voting for me. So I want you to know that I'm sincere. I refuse to be called a politician. I'd rather think of myself as a statesman. A politician sways with the wind. A statesman lives and dies on his principles. So if I die, I die. But I'll stand by my principles. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. Anybody else? We have another one of these, so I guess we'll have time for more public comment and final discussions. So any other final comments? Yes, Adele. I move that we move to the third and final reading. We're there. We've already done that? Yeah, we're taking final statements now. Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you. Okay. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you all. Number two, an ordinance to approve a commercial plan zoning district titled CPZD 18-6318 for property located at 2231 West Markham Road. reducing the existing 68.99 acre commercial planned zoning district to 24.06 acres while retaining the existing uses and adding up to 5,000 square feet of event space, 12,000 square feet of restaurant or commercial space, 80 hotel rooms, and 43 dwelling units. I'm going to take a motion to go to the second reading. Matthew. So moved, Mayor. John. Second, Mayor. We have a motion to second vote. Second, Ray. Senator, would you please call the roll? Oh, sorry. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Marsh. Kenyon. Yes. Kennedy. Yes. Kennedy. Yes. McTier. Yes. Smith. Yes. Yes. In order to approve a commercial planned zoning district entitled CPZD 18-6318, for property located at 2231 West Markham Road, reducing the existing 68.99 acre commercial planned zoning district to 24.06 acres, while retaining the existing uses and adding up to 5,000 square feet of event space, 12,000 square feet of restaurant or commercial space, 80 hotel rooms, and 43 dwelling units. Okay. Anything new from staff on this? We did get to see it. Okay. Does the applicant have any statements to make on this issue? Mr. Mayor, I will spare going through all the points where I felt like misinformation was quoted. I'll just... Just two, please. First of all, I want to make it very clear that the existing PZD is down to 69 acres, the one that Dr. Archer put in place. And we're telling you that the total... of these two land use proposals is 143 acres and we're committing to 50% preservation, permanent preservation of open space. So half of 143 is 71 and a half. And so our proposal really does permanently preserve more land than what folks thought was preserved with existing zoning. And lastly, I just wanna make it clear that We keep hearing a lot of people say, this is a great project. I just would like to see it somewhere else. And I really think that could be rephrased as, this is a great project, but I don't want it in my backyard. And I just want to make that statement that I'll leave it there. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. All right. Any questions from the council for the applicant or the staff? Okay. Let's take public comment again. Everybody gets one turn into my five-minute list. The council gives you more time or asks you questions. Stay on topic. Keep your comments addressed to me. And name and address, I believe that pretty well covers most of you here for the last public comment. So who would like to address us again on this? Anybody? Robin Karras, 1666 West Markham. I'm disappointed. I worked hard. We worked about a month and a half. To vote on the second reading, I think, is an insult. You know, the makeup of this council does and will change. It could change 50% in a month. I would think that people are... I don't know what else I want to say. I've got five minutes. I'm going to take my time here. Grind you guys down. Yeah, I mean, I have a question. So you say city planning makes the decisions, but I talked to city planning, and they said if they pass something and then it gets voted down, then they change the way they zone things or the way they think. So really, it's driven by city council. You guys drive everything. You appoint the city planning. I don't know about appointing city planning. You appoint planning commission. How they get appointed, I'm not sure. Sure. but you also steer and guide with your votes on their projects, whether you override them or vote for them. So basically you guys are leading this. So I don't think it's correct to throw the experts approved at, where you appointed and you guide the experts. I really think looking at the city plan 2030, it was not followed. I think... This project 13 years ago helped push Fayetteville in a good direction, and it helped push the mayor to become mayor. And I'm not sure how many terms he was in ward for. I think he's three terms now as mayor. So I really, really am disappointed in this, and I guess we'll see you all at the election. That's all I can say. Okay. Who else would like to address this? Can't bring him back to the council. Sure. Sure. Teresa Turk, 1408 West Cleveland. I just want to clear up a couple of things. First of all, I said potential archaeological sites. I too have talked to Dr. Jamie at the survey. I actually have done a lot of cultural resource work and have a master's in anthropology. So there are a lot, there is potential for a lot of archaeological sites up there. There may only be two sites right now, but it's because nobody is surveyed. So I just want to bring that up. I think there also should be really some investigation about endangered species. I too am disappointed. I don't think the council is listening to their constituents about this. Sure, change is hard. We are going to grow. But you know, the current planning right now, the current PCD allows for that kind of growth. So I would just like to say once again, why go forward so quickly? I really think that this place is very special. I don't think that you should rezone it. I think you should leave the zoning the way it is. And I just think things could be done better than they were tonight. Thank you. Okay. Who else would like to address this? Trey Marley, 1440 Markham. I was just looking at some of the promotional material for this right here. Can we put the other graphic up? Do we have the ability to do the graphic? So I'm just kind of looking at this and looking at the promotional material here. I mean, you see Mountain and you see a couple buildings here. This is what they're selling here, but it's going to change. I mean, this will change and it won't be the same. You know, one of the main things, the city, the number one thing is the infill. The key word is the appropriate infill. This is not appropriate infill. I mean, so here's the number one, appropriate infill. What caught my eye was the graphic here. This is the graphic for appropriate infill right here going between two houses there. This is the city's stuff. This is what we're talking about. This and this is not appropriate infill. So you can't take that tact to say that it's appropriate infill. You can call it a lot of other things, but it's not appropriate infill. And, I mean, this section here, I'm good with. I mean, it's just the other larger section that I believe you've already voted on is it's going to change Fayetteville forever. So, thanks. Okay. Who else would like to address this? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the council. Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Thank you, John. Second motion, Mayor. Okay. All right, we have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. All right. Okay. Motion was by Sarah and seconded by John. Seconded by John. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. An ordinance to approve a commercial planned zoning district entitled CPZD 18-6318 for property located at 2231 West Markham Road. Reducing the existing 68.99 acre commercial planned zoning district to 24.06 acres, while retaining the existing uses and adding up to 5,000 square feet of event space, 12,000 square feet of restaurant or commercial space, 80 hotel rooms, and 43 dwelling units. Okay, what final comments do we have, Council? Well, I do want to talk a little bit about my thoughts. part in this. In 2005, I was representative of Ward 4. We worked on the first rezoning of this property, and we worked six months to seven months on it. We got input from the citizens. I don't know how many Ward 4s. Shirley Lucas and I were council members out of Ward 4 at that time. We worked together on this. And at the end of the day, the thing that concerned me at the time was that at that time they could put 270 houses up there. And the traffic count by the planning department of the city of Federal was 2,000 trips. It was 1,000 trips for every 100 units. That came from Jeremy Payton. That's in the minutes of the 2005. So that concerned me. He also wanted to put in a barn and an inn. So we worked with this neighborhood, and we said, what would be palatable to you all? And we came up with the zoning that we have today. Now, there's nobody left from that council but me. And John, you talk about principles. He basically gave this neighborhood our word at that council at that time that we would change this. Now, the PZD, I have to tell you all, I know you all think the PZD was forever. That's not true. Jeremy Payton, the minister, also said a future council can change that PZD. So don't think that it was going to be in perpetuity. I tried to get a conservation easement out of the property owner. He said no, and we never got that far. So we came back to the council. Now, nobody from here was on that council, so they're not bound by their word, but I am. Now, I've got a lot of weaknesses, but when I tell folks I'm going to do something, that's what I do. Now, I know that don't mean much, but it means something to me. So with that, that's my part of this. So I will leave everybody with that. And so let's vote. Senator, would you please call the roll? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. On to new business. A resolution to express the intention of the city council to to divide the current payment for services to the Walton Arts Center and to three equal payments to the Walton Arts Center, Theater Squared, and to the city for infrastructure improvements in the entertainment district parking district. Matthew, I believe this is yours. Yes, thank you, Mayor. So I brought this forward because we had the results of a parking study that called for new... infrastructure improvements with respect to lighting and walkability and unifying the parking districts and we didn't have a way to pay for it in addition to ongoing maintenance in the district concurrently Martin Miller at Theodore Square reached out to me and expressed a request That they be considered for some of that funding at the time I told Martin I'd consider the request but I needed to be honest with him that I thought that I We had greater needs with respect to our infrastructure, and I thought that perhaps this funding source should be dedicated to that over time. But that also was prepared to bring forward the resolution before you today because I thought this was the most politic way of getting us some dedicated funding, some ongoing funding for the infrastructure improvements called for in our parking study. while maintaining a portion of the funding that we already send to the Walton Arts Center for their contracting services and giving TheatreSquared a new opportunity to provide similar services at their location. That's really the whole story. I know that there may be a suggestion that this was all done to support Theater Squared. That's not the case. My interest is really in the parking infrastructure. and primarily and secondarily to make sure that we have a strong theater district and a robust theater district. We're the only city in the state of Arkansas that has a proper theater district, or we will soon, and I think it's something that we should invest in quite carefully. You may have also heard rumors that, or suggestions that soon the council will consider expanding parking hours to include the morning and lunchtime hours. and that the Walton Arts Center themselves suggested that perhaps we shouldn't take this action, but should instead rely on that increased revenue. I think that's halfway to a good idea personally, and I think this resolution would be adaptable. So if indeed we do see new revenue in the future, I would hope that if this resolution passes, that the intention holds and that we would continue to split up whatever new surplus we may have. The last thing I want to say is to highlight maybe a curiosity in our revenues. I'll say the next last thing. And that is we heard from Paul Becker tonight that HMR revenues are up. I know anecdotally from talking with people who own bars that beverage sales are also up, but curiously parking revenue is down. That says to me that while our bond, while our debt obligations are not really under any threat, the nature of our downtown and the way people access it and enjoy it is changing. There's a new trend and I think it's one that we need to be cognizant of. At the agenda session when I introduced this resolution, Paul Becker again advised us to remember that we had always promised and tried to manage the expectation that parking revenue first went to debt service, second for managing the program and maintaining it, and lastly towards supporting these kinds of contracted services. And it's in that spirit that I offer this now. Okay. I know that we're into October now. The city has been in the midst of budget discussions since June or so, preliminarily. I first brought this up with the administration in July. And I know that the Walton Arts Center and Theater Squared are probably substantially into their budgeting processes at this point. But I hope that nobody has counted on next year's funding for this because that was a decision that had not yet been made by the council. And the grant-making organizations that I work with, I know this isn't a grant, but I'll use this for a comparison. We always counsel people not to rely on our funding until a decision has been expressed. So I hope that this doesn't put anyone in a perilous position and that with... At least three months left in the year, there's time to adapt if this council supports this resolution. So in any case, the point of this is parking study infrastructure and ongoing maintenance and trying to do this in a way that is not too hasty. Okay. What questions do we have from the city council about this? Anything? Okay. nothing okay well i'm sorry okay as we're discussing this and we're going into our budgeting we still have a lot of room to make final decisions once we're in budgeting this is a resolution of intention so that we can with intent discuss the opportunity of a change so uh As I would support this and I will it's with the intent to support it so we can have good discussion during our budget process Alan Long brought something up about animal services I can't remember what it was but there was a certain amount of money but we didn't really dedicate any of the money until we got into budget discussions so we can pass any resolution we get down to the budget discussions eventually so that's not really binding our hands Yeah, I just wanted to underscore what Mark stated. This is drafted as a resolution merely stating intent to maintain the flexibility of the administration to move forward with, if we pass this, with developing a contract for services with Theater Squared and adjusting or responding to this resolution with a new within the contract for services that we have with the Walton Arts Center. Do not take this, you know, it says the intention is to divide the excess parking revenue into three equal payments. I do not intend that to be a strict direction given to the administration. I expect that we'll see something come back to us if we were to pass this and it would be a It would be a smart and carefully developed proposal in triplicate with respect to each of the areas this is referencing. If that's your intention, then this resolution needs to be changed because it says express the intention of city council to divide the current payment for services into three equal payments. That's the direction to our budget to do that. So if you just want to say to consider... different payments or different changes, then that's what the resolution ought to say rather than divide it into three because that's pretty direct and explicit. I don't know. Maybe we'll get through comments and I'll make a motion to amend after that. Okay. Kyle. Yes, sir. Do we know what impact this will have? If you have conversation with the Walton Arts Center about their fiscal year and how it winds up, I'm a little concerned. I think that they're July to July and we're planning in December, so they may not actually have the three months left that we're talking about to make a budget adjustment. Yeah, I reached out to the Walton Arts Center, but the only communication I received in response was the letter I think we all received. days later, almost a week later. Once again, I'm not trying to be hasty with this. If we need to delay implementation until their fiscal year is over, with respect to all that, I have a strong desire to implement the recommendations of the parking study. We have no permanent, ongoing source of revenue to do that. I think parking revenue very well goes with parking improvements district improvements that make parking more accessible for residents especially those that may be choosing come downtown maybe insisting on very particular spaces because they're worried about safety on unlit walks they're frustrated by disparity between the downtown and the entertainment park Thank you. I really appreciate the spirit of this resolution and I'm inclined to support it. And I really appreciate the idea of thinking of this as support for a holistic theater district. But one of the things that I feel that we've been lacking as a city, especially now that we have our new Fayetteville First Economic Development Plan, that designates arts and culture as a primary growth sector, is I would really like to see us work towards developing an arts and culture master plan to help us be more strategic in our investments in the arts and culture. So just for staff to note that and us to make strides in that direction. And with that, I look forward to any public comment or discussion. Hey, Justin. Hi. well i don't really support this for many different reasons but i'm not really going to get into that i just want to ask a question probably to city staff i guess or or to uh the city attorney if the resolution is expressing intent to however we want to word it possibly divide the current payment does that mean that that payment is locked in and could we not change it at the budget meeting anyway without this resolution Certainly you could. We do have a contract with the Walton Arts Center, which you can't change anything until the expiration of the contract, obviously. During budget, though, you certainly have wide discretion on adjusting the budget, including the budget here. So you don't need any resolution saying you might adjust it. You certainly have the right to adjust it as you see fit. So if this had never been brought up, In the budget conversations in November, it could have been brought up and placed in the budget. That's correct. Yes. So then I would ask, well, you may be answering the question before I ask, why is it brought up? Yeah, so I had early conversations with the administration, and they said this was a good idea, and then it would take council leadership, and it would be best. Well, I didn't remember telling you that, but the chief of staff may have anything to be changed here in the budget process. Yes. Yeah, I understand. I was just – I'm more curious than anything. I would have much preferred to have this done without a council discussion at this level about it whenever we're just – I think negotiations could have been begun. Okay. Well, I mean, I think in the spirit of partnership, when you have a partnership for as long as we have with the Willard Arts Center, I think – This seemed, you said it wasn't done in haste, and I take it that word. So it just seemed like it was. But if we're changing this, because this seemed very exact to me, that we are going to have the intent to split it into three ways. And I know you said at agenda session that you weren't necessarily set on the three equal payments. So I don't doubt that either. I was curious as to why that. So thank you. Yes, you know, Justin brought up a good point. You know, we've had a relationship with Walton Arts Center for a long time, and things have been done a certain way. And I kind of, you know, I'm kind of hesitant to just, I know this is not a gigantic amount in their budget probably, but it's a substantial amount. And I hate to just... in a couple of months pull something that they might be depending on. And I don't know when their year ends and stuff like that. I'm not really sure about that. So I'm a little, you know, I have some questions there. What other comment do we have on this? Good evening Mayor Jordan, wow that's really present, and city council members. Martin Miller, I'm the executive director with Theater Squared, LeVon Rogers Drive. Just wanted to provide some context from our perspective in terms of how these conversations began and why I'm grateful that the council is taking them up in earnest, although I understand it's been a long night and it's actually been inspiring to listen to this amount of participation just as a citizen of Fayetteville. It's one reason why I love living here. Just to give background, I know I've reached out to several city council members, initially spoke with Ward 2 council members and with Alderman Petty about, actually we have been considering for some time how we program a future for Theatre Squared as a public trust for the citizens of Fayetteville. We're moving into facility owned by the city of Fayetteville in perpetuity now, We feel a strong obligation to make sure that the citizens of Fayetteville can come in the doors and see a show. So we, about two years ago, received a grant from the Walmart Foundation for around $75,000, which they have renewed, which is funding about a third to a quarter of the cost of an ambitious program we're calling Lights Up, where we distribute free tickets to clients at places like There's a long list of Seven Hills Center, Single Parent Scholarship Fund, folks at Hillcrest Towers, Canopy Northwest Arkansas, Ozark Literacy Council, Veterans Healthcare System, Ozark Guidance, Center for Quality, Lifestyles, Feed Fayetteville, Full Circle Food Pantry, and also where we give $5 tickets to anyone with a SNAP card. They're great programs. We've seen a lot of use of them and also youth programs, education programs for students coming to shows or just getting student prize tickets. It's pretty great for us to stand at the back of the theater and see that diversity in the space. As we expand our capacity moving into this new theater, we also really want to expand our pathways for access. So basically what we felt the responsibility to do was come forward and say, okay, We are already starting to provide these services to the citizens of Fayetteville. We think they deserve to be grown as we move into a new facility. We are taking on a lot of new financial responsibilities in that move as we grow up as an organization. We had 45,000 audience members last year. It's been a ton of growth. If we become an institution that closes the doors to people while we have that growth, I don't think it will really reflect the desires that the city had in entrusting us with that land and the investment the city has made. So we're seeking the city's support as a match in part for that Walmart Foundation support for those programs for access and education. Now, I know there's a lot of our friends and peers from the Walton Arts Center here tonight, and I want to be the first to say how valuable their programs are as well. Their educational programs, their outreach programs, which have been a trailblaze for us and an inspiration for us. And so they have grown to be not just a major regional, but a major national institution, which is... as someone who grew up in Fayetteville, I love to see. So I know that as we made the case to the city, I think our responsibility was to say, here's the programs that we can grow, and they won't grow unless we find a way to pay for them because it's not free for us to put the shows on or to put the classes out there. So we have to find a way to subsidize access for them. And so really, we respect that it's the city's responsibility and choice to determine whether and to find how to fund those programs. But we think they're a real value for the citizens of Fayetteville. We hope that in the long term that can be accomplished by somehow growing the resources that are dedicated to supporting these programs. I know that there are a lot of really, really high priorities in terms of funding. And so that's a challenge. If there is an avenue for funding through the city, we will make a case that we have a role to play in it. So we're happy to do that. But we hope we can do that alongside our peers, including the Walton Arts Center, and being able to offer. offer all those programs. So thanks for your consideration. I think this is the, you know, very healthy start of the conversation. I'm grateful to Alderman Petty for bringing it forward and to all of you for always being ready to have a good conversation, sometimes hard conversation. Thank you. That was a nice tour yesterday too. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Nobody? You're all kind of moving slow tonight. We are. I'm Steve Clark. I live at 438 East Fairway Lane, Fayetteville, Arkansas. I am a member of the Walden Arts Center Board, so you should know that. I think this proposal cannibalizes the efforts of this city to advance as an economic development tool the arts. And so I can tell you that over in our shop in the chamber, we have a fab lab. It says STEAM, not STEM. It says STEAM. So I have a thing called a composite collective, actually, and we do it by seasons. 36 squares, and anybody in there can paint in a square. I've got about 24 of the first 36 painted. We think that's real important to innovative, creative, entrepreneur-type actions by people whether 7 or 77. We believe and tell you at the chamber that arts will be a part of the foundation of the future of this community. partially because that's true in the region, but partially because we're doing some things that aren't being done anywhere else, including the creation of a new school of art, a new school of art which will have 27 or 30 new faculty members hired at the very same time, which will be funded at a higher level than any school of art in a public university has been funded in the history of the country. And we have a new art district being developed along MLK and South, which is good to the development of the south end of town where I happen to live. But what I tell you is that we don't need to cannibalize funding for the arts. We need to support it full and full-throated, and with the reasons that it works for us in ways of economic development. Cannibalizing it is taking some of somebody's money and giving it to somebody else and say, you guys be happy with this, and we're going to keep the other part for ourselves. If we believe in the arts, fund the arts. If we believe in parking, fund parking. If we're worried about people not driving cars, blame technology. Accept that walkability is working. Accept that technology has changed the way we can get from point A to point B without the necessity of having a vehicle. Be excited about the bicycle program we have. So what I say to you, I think this is a very bad idea as a resolution. I think it sends the wrong message for the city of Fayetteville. It says that the city of Fayetteville, which has been priding itself on its support of the arts, then it says, you know, it's an easier thing to do to just kind of divide the pot and not increase it than it is to face that maybe we need to increase it. And we may have to increase it at the expense of something else. But the effort and the message sent here in my perspective is not a positive one. And it's one a little difficult to defend because, And so I urge you not to accept this resolution. You have the power at budget to do whatever you want to do. You don't need a resolution. You just need somebody to say, I've got a motion. And if they get a second and you get a majority, it's done, over, complete. And that's done in a way that doesn't put a headline in the flyer or somebody else's that Fayetteville is trying to decide how it might be. to cannibalize the funding that it has, to direct it to a couple of sources rather than just one. And one of those sources is outside the framework of the arts. And so to me, it's just bad policy, and I urge you to vote against it. Okay. Who else would like to address this? Good evening mayor city council. My name is Jamie McGaugh 1372 East Masonic. I'm the director of development for theater squared. I just wanted to take a quick minute and read a letter that we received from Solomon Birchfield, who is the director of operations for seven Hills homeless shelter each year for the past two years we've hosted what we call a picnic and a play. on a Saturday in May where we bring a number, quite a few of the homeless clients from Seven Hills. We provide them with a free lunch. We provide them with tickets to the show. So they have a day to just be a citizen of Fayetteville. And I just wanted to sort of bring this down to a personal level as far as what our Lights Up programming actually brings. So this is a letter that Solomon sent after they saw the show this year. Dear Jamie, I just wanted to say thank you again for T2 providing our Seven Hills clients with an opportunity to experience the theater. I also wanted to share with you what one of the clients shared on the ride back to the day center. When asked if they enjoyed the show, all three men said they loved it. And then Jeffrey, who was one of our hardest cases, shared it was the first normal thing he had done in probably 20 years. As we discussed yesterday, there will always be a homeless population for various reasons, and that one of the things we can do to treat them as humans with dignity. What T2 has provided to them through this experience is a definition of that. For them to sit in theater and enjoy a world-class production, and maybe not be defined by their homelessness for at least a few hours. Please relate my sincerest thanks to all the staff at T2 for this amazing gift they have given to those who need it most. Just wanted to share that with you. Thanks. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Hi, I'm Sarah Lewis. I am a board member of the Walton Arts Center Council. And also thank you for having two of my favorite topics on one city council meeting, forest preservation and the arts. So I appreciate that. I want to say that I would like for all of us to not get confused on this. My husband and I have been longtime supporters of Theater Squared. Our names are on the program, all of that kind of thing. I don't want this to become us versus them, and that is what this resolution is doing. And I'm sorry that I wish that it wouldn't have been brought forward because I feel like that's what it's doing. And I think that we have an amazing arts culture in our community. And the thing that this does, or I guess that this does, is potentially create that divide. And there's always going to be competition for resources. That's the way we all know how this works. But having to defend one entity's programs versus another entity's Let's collectively decide that we're going to invest in the arts and move at it in that way. The Walton Arts Center funding, this funding, what it goes to are things like putting those school buses in the Walton Arts Center parking lot and bringing all those kids to arts theater performances at reduced or no cost. It also provides arts with education, something that I participated in as a teacher and is the reason I moved to Fayetteville. It was an amazing experience. It funds things like 10x10 making arts more accessible. It funds free Artisphere events. If we want to talk about the things that changing the funding can do, it can have real effects. And so that's why I really encourage us to be careful of the message that taking away funding from kind of this incubator organization for building our cultural arts, our arts culture in this community, bookending us in our region around the arts, and helping us compete nationally, I think that that sends a really sad message to the community about what we value and what I hope we can put forward is that we collectively are investing in the arts together and here is a bulk sum that can help provide resources to all these different programs without taking away from existing programming. So thank you. Thank you. All right, who else would like to address this? Good evening. My name is Casey Hamaker. I'm at 308 East Spring Street. Last year, I was appointed by the City Council to serve on the Walton Arts Center board, and so I come to you as a city appointee, as well as a Walton Arts Center Council member. Just to briefly Let us all remember that the history is that the Walton Arts Center and the City have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship over the past 26 years. As partners, we've watched the arts grow and thrive in Fayetteville, providing both cultural and economic benefits to Fayetteville. And we've heard about those cultural and economic benefits from previous speakers. The Walton Arts Center depends on these public and private partnerships to thrive and to provide high-quality programming to all the citizens of Fayetteville. I think I really appreciate that we've talked about all of these different communities that the arts serve, and I think it's important to underscore that last year, 27,000 students attended arts, learning, and engagement programs at the Walton Arts Center. And of those, almost 8,000 were from Fayetteville. And that's fantastic if you think about the number of students that are in our K-12 programs. And of course we all know that every public school student in K-6 attends at least one Walton Arts Center program each year. from this $250,000 that we're talking about, that this has been a partnership with the city since 2009. And so with those dollars, the Walton Arts Center has been able to support school children's access to art performances at the Walton Arts Center, and it's directly tied to curriculum and to the Common Core, and we're able to see arts in education. I've been watching this Vision 2050 guiding principle of... quality public schools and I love that we're able to tie that to the arts. We've also been able to use those funds to offset the costs of resident companies, one of those being Theater Squared, one being Sona, Trek Theater, and the Community Creative Center. And we all agree that all of those partners have made Fayetteville what it is in terms of a thriving cultural destination. We've been able to provide access for all of Fayetteville residents to the 10x10 Art Series, Artisphere, which is free for many, the Take a Seat program, and free admission to the Joy Pratt Markham Gallery. It's also, I think, really important to note that those services are not 100% covered by that $250,000. That in total, those services provided by the Walton Arts Center were a $578,000 budget item for 2017-2018. I really, I think it's difficult and I agree with other folks that have spoken that we need to look at other methods besides just taking from one to give to another. That also the Walton Arts Center has programming in place that's supporting our school children and we need to consider that, that their budget cycle is July to June and not a calendar year. This is really such a successful public and private partnership that we have. And so I believe that if we all consider funding arts organizations to be a priority, there should be a way to do that without hurting one organization and that we should all be able to work together. Thank you very much. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Good evening, Council. Good evening, Mayor. My name is Bob Ford. I'm the Artistic Director of Theatre Squared. I live at 785 Missouri Way here in Fayetteville. You'll have to pardon me. My head is swimming a little bit. This proposal and the conversation goes so much to the heart of what I've been doing for the last 15 years here. And I am so thrilled at the opportunity to just speak to it briefly. Theater Squared has always been, at its core, a theater that wants to be accessible to the citizens of Fayetteville. And the programming that we started really... from the beginning to make that happen is finally beginning to get supported. As my colleague Martin Miller mentioned with a Walmart grant starting a few years ago that covers about a third of the cost of doing these programs that we do. The one thing I want to say just to come back to is that when I read this resolution and the intention behind it, it to me, is a celebration of what is starting to explode in Fayetteville. It's also a celebration and acknowledgement of the fact that Theatre Squared is going out on its own, becoming an independent entity, taking up its own site on what is going to be the most amazing arts corridor in four hundreds of miles. That's the way I see it, and yes, does it then adversely imply that we all Feeding at the same trough? Yes. But I do want to say that my feeling of where this comes from is, again, a celebration of a huge move forward. And I will, as we all will, respect your deliberations and your budget conversations and figure out how to respond to that. But, again, just wanted to quickly express my appreciation for where I think this sprang from. And thanks for this opportunity to address you all. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Good evening. I'm Scott Galbraith. I live in Springdale, but I work at Walton Arts Center. I'm the Vice President of Programming and Executive Producer. Thank you for the opportunity to do this and to address this here this evening, or this morning. At this point, your show has run longer than mine, which I think is kind of fun. YES, WE HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE $250,000 A YEAR SINCE 2009. THAT'S BEEN A FLAT AMOUNT DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD, DURING WHICH TIME THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES HAS ONLY INCREASED. CURRENTLY THE 2017 NUMBER WAS $578,000. SO WHEN BOB SAYS THAT WE ALL ARE AT THE SAME PROFIT, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. WHAT WE'RE TAKING DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING AND IN FACT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE ORGANIZATION IN TOTAL FAR EXCEEDS THAT WHICH WE'RE TAKING. SO LET ME ELABORATE THAT A LITTLE BIT. THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE PER THE CONTRACT FOR THE $250,000 INCLUDES SUPPORTING FAYEVABLE CHILDREN, SCHOOL CHILDREN AND THEIR ACCESS TO WALTON ARTS CENTER PROGRAMS. AS YOU HEARD EARLIER, IT'S 27,000 CHILDREN A YEAR. 8,000 of which are coming from this community specifically. We offset the costs of resident companies in order to help them thrive and grow. We're talking about the Symphony of Northwest Arkansas, which had gone bankrupt. We helped reconstitute. It is now healthy. Theater Squared, clearly they've made an argument, and we are very thrilled at the growth that they've seen. Creative Community Center, as you may be aware, they recently invested in a fantastic mobile art endeavor that is now expanding, taking the arts out of their own physical space into the community. And more recently, Trike Theater in Bentonville. We have worked with them in the past to create shows, digging up Arkansas specifically, that we have toured to every county in the state, which is to say the monies that you have helped provide have in fact impacted children across the entire state, not only in our own community. And that continues because we are now hiring them specifically to create shows for Wild and Art Center stages. We also hire Sona to do specific projects. So that $578,000 of... expenditure is, as I say, more than what we're taking in. And further to that point, the Walton Art Center generally, well, I should say the resident art companies, by the way, they have seen a 98% increase in attendance in the nine-year period that we're talking about. So the city investment is allowing us to have a $16 million economic impact on Fayetteville. That's not a number we made up. That's according to Americans for the Arts, AEP5 economic report, and that is up from $10 million just nine years ago. So a $6 million increase, and the contribution of the city has remained flat. So we're very grateful. Don't get me wrong, but it is. As we perhaps talk about a larger plan, we'd like to make sure that that is something that's taken into consideration. Another point to the parking, when I came here tonight, I was able to pop a quarter in the parking meter, and I've now been here for five hours. When somebody comes to a Walnut Center show, they pay $5. They're typically there for three or four hours, which is to say their hourly rate is anywhere from $1 to $1.25. The monies that are brought into the parking fund disproportionately come from Walton Art Center patrons. That is something we believe should be taken into account. When a plan ultimately comes through and funding is discussed for Fierce Square parking initiatives, and we would support others, we believe it should be based on proportionality, perhaps based on seat capacities, actual attendance, things of that nature. The specific programming that we provide We believe Theater Square does provide fantastic programming and educational services for students and for the community. We have similar programs in some places. The program you just heard about is not dissimilar from our Take a Seat program, which allows us to bring in folks from across the country from across the community who are disadvantaged. But one of the things that we do differently is we provide educational services for kindergarten up. And they're not just theater. They are theater, dance, music, puppetry. It's multidisciplinary. It's not just U.S.-based. It comes from across the world, across the country. We bring in companies from Scotland, from Africa, from Australia. So when we have a community that is so celebratory, and rightfully so, of a welcoming Fayetteville plan to defund a program that actually provides younger students with an opportunity to interact with a culture that is a global culture, Seems like a complete disconnect. In closing, I just want to say we are supportive of funding the arts generally. We just think it needs to be proportional and appropriate. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? I would tell you that it's way past my bedtime, but I'd be lying because we still have a show at the Walton Arts Center. We have one here. I know. Yours is televised. Ours is not. Hi, folks. I'm Peter Lane, President and CEO of the Walton Arts Center, and I live at 401 Watson Street, and I want to thank you for taking an inordinate amount of time to listen to all the voices of Fayetteville. I think it's one thing that does differentiate this city from others I've been in. I think a lot of points have been raised, but I think, The big point that I would just leave with all of you is that I think the Walton Arts Center is one of the most special places in the country. Let me just say that again. I think it is one of the most nationally recognized top 50 arts organizations in the country in a community of about just over a half a million people. And one of the things I asked the mayor when I first came here, when he said, what can I do to help? I said, no. We need some kind of dedicated funding as a small amount to help signal to our funders, to our patrons, to our sponsors, that the city is committed to arts and culture in this community. And the mayor and all of you help support a process in which Paid parking revenue could be used to put a small fraction at that time, represented just under 3% of our budget, to great use. And it was a contract for service. It is a contract for service to help children, to provide access, and to make sure that we can help those art makers like Theater Squared and Symphony Orchestra of Northwest Arkansas Community Creative Center and trike theater. It is an unusual arrangement where an arts organization has received for the last nine years this funding. And yes, Matthew, we have actually have it in our budget. We do because we believe that the partnership with the city has been so strong and we've had an excellent rate of return on lots of metrics per the letter I sent you in response to your note that I had gotten yesterday. about this proposal. And so I brag about our relationship with the city to my colleagues at our conferences, all of our team does, because it has generated so much growth A little bit of support allows us to go to other funders to say the city believes in what we do. They help us with parking buses. They find ways to accommodate patrons. They are looking out for making arts an important part and a defining component of how we define our community and how we define ourselves. And so to that end. A dedicated stream of funding, whether it's from parking or some other way, is really perhaps the conversation we need to be having now. There are lots of arts organizations that need funding. Theater Squared has a new home. Their operating costs are going to grow. They need funding. We're going to help them with their ticketing system. We're going to do everything we can to support them and continue to do that. And I hope the city does the same. But also for Symphony Orchestra of Northwest Arkansas, our largest professional orchestra and one of the best in the state. Community Creative Center, one of the best hands-on art and now mobile throughout Northwest Arkansas. And Trike Theater, where their performance is happening in Fayetteville, their education process happens in Bentonville. We want to grow that and continue to add to that. So some kind of dedicated funding will allow us to do that. I don't have the answers. I know what the problems are. But I think taking from Peter to pay Martin or some formula that way is not the answer. I think there's a better way to deal with it. Thank you all for your consideration. Kyle, you have a question for me. Sorry, Peter. You said originally that the money from the city was about 3% of your overall budget. What is it today? It's just under 1%. So the Wal-Mart Center budget is now a $28 million operating budget. And there's a perception that the Wal-Mart Center is rolling in great amounts of money because of the Walmart amp. Well, it is partly true in the sense that We have two business units. One is the Walton Arts Center, and one is the Walmart Amp. And the Walton Arts Center, as many of you know, and Casey, who is chair of our finance committee, can attest, is slated to lose just under $970,000 this year with support from the city, funders, donors. The Walmart Amp business unit is slated to just make just over $970,000. We call it Rock Pays for Bach. So the net revenues allow us to cover and find that balance of zero. But it's a combination of ticket sales and fundraising for both of those business units that allow us to find this unique business model that we're very proud of and one that allows us to do all of those access programs, the 10x10 and all of those programs. So it is a drop in the bucket. but it's an important catalyst that leverages all of the other donors as well as the programs we discussed. Yes, sir. That was mine. Okay. That was mine. All right. Two and one? Got it covered. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. All right. Who else would like to address this on this? Okay. I'm going to bring it back to the council. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I'll be the first to say I've enjoyed some of the community program the Walton Arts Center has done, and they've certainly done a fantastic job with it. I also feel a need, with all due respect, the only people characterizing this as taking from one to do the other or cannibalization or saying it's going to send the wrong message to the broader community or to all of our partners across the nation that watch Fayetteville and rank Fayetteville. or the walton arts center leadership or people that they've recruited for tonight i don't think that's the right message and that's certainly not the message that's been intended and i don't think that's the message anybody would have taken away um if it wasn't being deliberately presented here um you know you heard it here that 250 000 started out at about three percent and it's now down to uh about one percent because the walton arts center is doing such a successful job I don't have any interest in ceasing funding entirely, and in fact I have some other sources of revenue that can be permanent that we might be talking about in a number of months. Hopefully everybody will be excited about new permanent sources of revenue for the arts whenever we get a chance to talk about those. Raising the specter that Fayetteville doesn't support the arts if we pass this, I think is a little, I'm not sure it's even-handed. After $8 million or so to the Walton Arts Center and a bond issue to fund the renovation. After $3 million from one entity and $3 million from another entity to Theatre Squared, after what's turned out to be a $50 million capital campaign for the library, which I think is a source for artistic inspiration and access. After a $120 million raise for a school of art and another $40 million raise for a proper arts and culture district on the south end, I think anybody who looks at Fayetteville, regardless of the vote tonight, up or down, concludes Fayetteville loves and supports the arts and supports access. to the arts for absolutely everybody. I think with, you know, if you examine the year-over-year revenues, as anybody can, and as Peter Lane was transparent with us, they're doing very successful. And with what I think will be Honestly, a marginal improvement, but an improvement nonetheless of parking revenue if this council decides to expand the early morning and daytime parking hours. I don't think the impact will be as much as everyone fears that this would be. But more than that, maybe some criticisms of process or some questions about process are warranted. Changing things like this is always uncomfortable. But more important than the process is the impact of this decision, if we are to take my suggestion and support it. I don't think it's the Walton Arts Center that provides the majority of parking revenue. There are close to a couple thousand seats at the Walton Art Center and tickets that can be sold, but that pales in comparison to the number of football fans that go to Dixon on a weekly basis. The football fans, young ladies holding their keys in their hands because the streets aren't lit. There are a lot of other people in the community that need support too. their access to our new theater district, to our arts and entertainment district downtown, needs to be improved. We can talk about implementing all those changes in a bond program and taking on debt to do it. And there's a proposal right now in front of us, we reviewed it once at the Transportation Committee, that includes some money for walkability and lighting improvements downtown. But that vote is far from certain. First off, and second, we have a source of revenue today that can be used for precisely those kinds of improvements. Parking revenue should be for district improvements in principle. We should have a dedicated source of funding for arts. We do a lot of arts funding at the Advertising and Promotion Commission. In terms of public art, we established the first fund for public art over there. We make small grants every year, some larger grants we've granted to the Walton Arts Center many times. And I think we are perpetually interested in a conversation with any capable organization that has a rich history of successful programming and having a conversation about permanent sources of funding. Tourism dollars belong in some way. to an arts purpose, to an arts and culture purpose. Parking revenue is, it's a weak link. It's a weak link. And I think for those of us that were still, that were here when we passed paid parking, we know that a big piece of the conversation was, what do we do with the excess revenue and how can we use it to get our stakeholders on board? And that's how we ended up here today. And it's been worth it, absolutely. It has been worth it. But we don't have an infinite pool of money. we have to make tough decisions i don't think it's right to characterize it as trying to cannibalize a program or to rob from one to pay for another i think Once we get through a process of developing contracts and renegotiating contracts and looking at what two organizations can provide in a district atmosphere after we have our cultural arts corridor built and so on and so forth, we end up with something that is much greater than the sum of its parts. Much greater than the sum of its parts. And I wouldn't be surprised at all given the success of both of these organizations. If a year from now, if we were to pass this and see the changes in place, that we would see the same level of community programming or better. That's what we've seen over the past four or five years, hasn't it? We've maintained the same level of funding, but the community programming has grown. I think we're so dedicated to the arts we can make that happen. And in the meantime, I think we have acute needs downtown that need to be paid for today. People aren't safe, or they don't feel safe. and that amounts to about the same thing. Okay. Bill. Well, I cannot support this resolution because as everyone knows I'm a huge fan of both of these organizations so I would not for one moment take a dime that I think the Walton Arts Center is counting on having. I think we have a contractual relationship it's been a good relationship for a long time and I wanted to stay just exactly that way. I am, however, very, very supportive of Theater Squared and for lighting downtown so people feel safe. So I feel that, you know, we've just got a lot of work to do when it comes to budget and to talking about the bond program. And, you know, it's one thing to say, we're going to have an arts corridor. But, folks, it has to be translated when we go talk about budget, too. And that's what I'm prepared to do. And so I won't be supporting this, although I really – Like I say, I support all three of these These things very very much and I'll be doing everything I can to find find the money to do just exactly that Thank you Thank you, um, I regret that we have such a limited amount of funding because I would love to You know give to all of these programs, but in light of the fact that we do I You know, in looking at where we can make the most for our budget, I think about how the ANP leverages their money and how they support an event a few years in a row, but then they expect it to be self-sustaining, and then they move that support onto the next venture. We've been giving to the Walton Arts Center for over 10 years now, which I think has been a great investment and I think that we should continue to do as much for them as we can. But they've had time to build their donor base, to grow their operations, to become a more self-sustaining operation and now it's time for us to give a boost to Theatre Squared and hopefully they can take that money and build on it in a few years. We'll have an opportunity to support the next thing. I really hope that we can get an arts and culture master plan so that we can be more strategic in how we are investing in the arts. But overall, I support the spirit of this resolution. I don't agree with the specific language of it in terms of dividing the payment into equal parts. But as we enter our budget process, I would like to see prioritization for some funding to support Theater Squares operations, as well as much-needed improvements in our downtown parking district. Okay. Justin? Thank you. Well, I always respect the conversation up here and the people that make the points. A couple of points that were made that I think I have to mention. It was brought up that the Walton Arts Center people were the only ones speaking in a certain way. They're the only ones that stand to lose anything here. And Theater Squared, of course, are going to speak positively because they don't currently have this money. And, of course, they should speak for it. And the Walton Arts Center should speak against it. So I don't think that's really a valid point. Neither is the valid point that when we talk about the WAC patrons having the lion's share of parking and Razorback games brought up, I'm not thinking about Razorback games. I'm thinking about the percentages and the differences between the WAC parking patrons and the Theater Squared parking patrons and the percentage just by seats alone. and tickets is going to be a higher percentage. But I don't know that higher percentage because I didn't really have the time to delve into it. I'm sure we could do that, and I think that that is certainly something that we can do. I'm also a little – I'm still a little confused about my question about why this is even needing to be brought up. Something mentioned about the city administration. The mayor said I didn't say anything, and Don Moore said it. He's not here. I can't ask him. I don't know if Don said it, but I know Matthew – I didn't say we couldn't bring it up here in budget discussions. You guys can work out whatever you guys talked about. I'm good with it. But I do think that that's – that's a little bothersome but the this is not against theater square although i respect sarah lewis tremendously and i think she's right when she said this shouldn't have been brought up and it is a one versus the other at least that's what it felt like when i read it and the calls i got that's what it seemed to most people um This has nothing to do with Theater Squared. As a matter of fact, I was the only one, I think, up here that voted against giving them one of their sets of money. And it wasn't because I don't like them or that I don't want them to succeed. Quite the contrary. I just believe in business plans. And that was a business plan that I wasn't sure was ready for what we were trying to do at that time. I respect Martin. Believe me. If I ever run for higher office, I'm going to ask him to be my campaign fundraising manager. because they are absolutely amazing at raising funds. So good for them. I wish them all the success because their success means success for our entire downtown area and our region. And it is true that we will have the greatest arts corridor anywhere. And I absolutely agree with Matthew when he says we need better lighting down there to make a safer area because just in the – issues that we had on West Avenue with a couple of acts of violence where the police have stepped forward and have really done a good job with it. I know that hurt people down there because people were scared to go down there for a little while. They're not anymore. But that just goes to show safety is paramount, and I know the administration thinks safety is absolutely paramount. So I totally agree we need to do that. I just think that the partnership that Adela mentioned is very important to bring up. I think that this is something that even if we say yes to this resolution of intent, it doesn't mean we're going to do anything. But I think it also means something if we don't vote for it. And it says a lot to the long-term partnership that we've had since the 90s. And I think that it just felt wrong to— All things that are even things that have the best intentions, and I don't doubt anyone up here as people. I know the people up here, and they're all great people, great human beings, and they care about their community. But in this particular case, I just think it was wrong to bring it forward. I think it sends the wrong message. And I think if we're going to raise other funds for parking infrastructure, there are ways to do it. I will be all for it. But this is not what I think we need to do right at this moment. So with all due respect, I will not support this resolution. Kyle. I think I support the intent of it, but I'm not sure that it covers all of the implications that we need to address yet. I am glad that this topic is coming up because I think it lets us talk about – Those of you that have put the budget together for several years understand why we're paying for the arts out of parking. It made sense when it happened and it's carried over, but when I've had people ask me in the Why are we paying the Walton Arts Center? And I find myself making the argument that, oh, we pay the Walton Arts Center because they bring us all those people to park in the lot across the street. And it's the wrong answer. We should be supporting the arts because we support the arts. And if we've got parking needs downtown, it makes perfect sense to pay for those with parking revenue. So I... I support the idea of reallocating parking funds, but I think before I'm ready to take the leap and vote for the resolution that I want to see the other end of where else can we find appropriate arts funding. Steve Clark made it sound like I could walk into the ATM in Paul's office and just ask for another half million or quarter million dollars, and I wish it were that easy. But it's not like we split the Walton Arts Center in half here when we got Theater Squared. We've got two amazing arts organizations, and I think they both deserve our support. I don't know how we do that yet, but I think that's the conversation that I want to have next. I'm going to kind of take a broad look at this, and I don't think we need the resolution. I like the idea that we're discussing... the intent of supporting three vital needs but I think that we need to support safety and infrastructure on its own merits I think that we need to support the Walton Arts Center activities on their own merits and I think we need to support theater squared on their own merits initially when I saw this I certainly wanted this discussion to be moved forward because we do have I think that our intent is to support all organizations so that they can be successful. And as we move into our budget planning, then we need to be very seriously about how we're going to do this. But I'm not certain that it should be the revenue from parking. The more I think about it, the more I feel real conflicted about that. So let's just say from my point of view, We'll move into the budget discussions and understand that there's a need for all three of these elements that are mentioned in this resolution of intent and move forward with the intent to see how we can fund them the best. So after this discussion here, that's how I would support the – resolution as it's written and I would move forward with my personal intent and my personal commitment to finding funding for all three of these needs. Thank you Mr. Mayor. My hopes of getting out of here before midnight are quickly dwindling. I didn't expect this issue to be controversial. I have a 15 year old and have a 25 year old. The 15 year old lives in my home. I provide housing, food, clothing, other essentials. The 25-year-old doesn't live in my home. I don't pay for her housing, her food, her gasoline, her insurance. I guess I do pay. No, you all pay for some of her insurance. She's not 26 yet. We have an insurance policy to the city. You see the difference? I've kind of weaned the 25-year-old off of my support. I'm getting back to what Sarah Marsh said. I'm finding myself agreeing with Sarah Marsh more and more. It's kind of scary, Sarah. You know, we're talking about moving some of the funding from Walden Arts Center to Theater Squared. We're not reducing the funding for the arts. We're still supporting arts. So I don't want anybody to say we're reducing funding for arts, and with our budget discussions coming up, we might want to make the whole pie bigger, and that'll be another discussion. But I like the idea of building an arts... community, an arts corridor, making Fayetteville the artsy place to be. Like, do I want to go to Theater Square? Do I want to go to Walden Arts Center? Do I want to go to the next whatever theater opens up? We'll decide when we get down there because that's the place to go for the arts. You become an arts center. and we start bringing in tourist dollars. The value of most art, I'm sorry, I don't have the true religion, is lost on John Latour. I don't understand a lot of the modern art. Norman Rockwell, I love. Plays and acts, I'm kind of particular, but I like some of those. What I like and what I understand are dollars, and I understand this city runs, lives, and breathes on sales tax dollars. If we can become an art center, an art destination, we bring in tourism dollars. We bring people to stay in our hotels, pay our HMR tax. If they're staying in a hotel, they're probably not cooking. They're probably eating at a restaurant, maybe having a drink or two, and we collect tax every transaction. They come, they spend, they leave. We don't have to build infrastructure for those guys, and they help fund what we want to do. So I like the idea of being an arts center because it's going to bring in dollars to our city. From that perspective... We may have to argue at budget time, should we increase all of our spending for the arts? That might bring Walton Art Center back to the $250 that you're at now. But I do think, just what Sarah pointed out, we fund you at your beginning, we help you get started, and we'd like you to kind of wean off of our support so that we can fund the next good thing and help them get started and get them on their feet, and then you don't depend on us anymore. We have, like we're discussing, we have streets that people don't feel safe on. The young ladies get out holding their car keys in their hand for a reason. We need to be putting in lighting. We need to be spending money on infrastructure. I see that as one of our primary functions of the city. And if our citizens don't feel safe, we're falling short. We need to be doing something to rectify that. That's where I am. So I'll be supporting the resolution. to help the younger art-providing vendor along in their endeavors. Walden Arts Center, love you, glad you're there, want you to succeed, and we can restore funding here in a very short while through our budget process, but I think it's time to kind of start weaning you off like my 25-year-old so that you stand on your own two feet. Thank you, Mayor. Okay. Let's see. Kyle. Okay. I'll be real short. I'm going to make a comparison to another organization that asks for money two or three times a year. We talk about weaning an organization like the Walton Arts Center off, but I recently became a sustaining member of NPR. I didn't decide to continue giving them that same amount every month because I need to wean them off of it. It's an integral part of the community that deserves to be supported, and I think the Walton Arts Center... serves that same kind of role. Mayor, can I give one historical perspective here? Sure. As you remember, Mayor, a few years back, it was questionable whether the Walton Arts Center was actually going to remain vibrant and stay on Dixon Street. There was a lot of movement that it was going to go to Bentonville, and they were going to build a bigger facility there. And obviously both the mayor and I were very concerned about that because the Walton Arts Center has been such an integral part of Fayetteville sales tax, but more than that, part of Fayetteville too. And it took about 18 months of hard negotiations with Peter Lane, the Walton Arts Center, and the university. We changed the way it was governed, giving more power to the Walton Family Foundation to select members. Then we went through a process to enhance the Walton Arts Center Mayor did his part working for the taxes to do that and and The Walton Arts Center did their part in raising the money and it became a reality and now there's no more talk about The Walton Arts Center leaving Dixon Street. We worked and had a good agreement a good joining of hands We're talking about $250,000. That was millions of dollars, and every year worth millions of dollars to the city of Fayetteville. Perception is very important. I think that's what Peter Lane was telling you. The $250,000, yes, it's a small part of their budget, but the perception that the city of Fayetteville is behind them and supporting them, I think, is very important. and we are buying services for them. I made sure that was it because that's the only way you can do it legally. We don't give them this money. We buy services. What services do we want to give up? Now, the reason it was taken out of parking is because, in fact, they are the number one parking attraction on Dixon Street. Now, does that mean all the bars don't attract? No, they all. There are people down there all the time. Georgia's gets a lot too. But the Walton Arts Center, you can see when they are going to have a program The deck fills up. The Walton Arts Center parking lot, which I guess we're supposed to call it something else now, it gets a lot of action too. And so that was a justification for taking out a parking. Now, we didn't guarantee them it was going to be there forever, and we can't guarantee that. But I think we need to make sure and think about the perception of what the government of Fayetteville is doing now. And I don't think the perception should be that we're cutting funds for our major entertainment venue, the one that we have worked on so long, that we've paid taxes for, that our citizens helped build. I think that... I would, I just, I'm afraid that we'd be saying out the wrong impression if we passed this resolution and said that we're going to cut their resources or give part of their resources to someone else. And I'm a seasoned ticket holder to Theater Squared. I love them. I want them, and maybe we should be able to help fund them too. But I think it'd be a mistake to take it away from the Walton Arts Center so that we can fund Theater Squared. I think those are two different issues, and I'll be handled differently. And thank you. Okay. Sarah. Thank you. I want to talk again about the importance of developing an arts and culture master plan, not just for strategic investment, but also to help us identify dedicated funding sources. I think we all agree that we want to increase investment in the arts, but it's important. It's a good investment in the economic environment. and social value in our community. And other cities around the country have faced these same issues and come up with great solutions, and we need to be looking to those for good ideas. You know, building permits are up, way up. And a lot of communities have instituted a 1% for the arts that taxes new development to help pay for the arts. And maybe this is an opportunity for us to capitalize on our popularity as a community and tax those big developers a little bit to help us sustain the things that contribute to our quality of life. So I hope that staff will take a serious look at that issue. But ultimately, we're going to be facing more and more of these great problems to have as we grow as a community. And we need to be strategic in our thinking, find a dedicated funding source. But I think it's pretty clear from our discussion that we want to support all of the arts organizations to our greatest ability. Thank you. Anybody else? Matthew. Well, I can count votes as well as anybody and better than most. I move we table this indefinitely. Well, let me just say one thing before we table it indefinitely. We can't have this discussion at budget session. I want everybody to know that. I want everybody, if you want to split it, if you want to add more to the arts, that's fine. We don't have it. So I know that. I keep referring back to the album while we brought the dog thing. I don't think we actually voted that in, but we did have that discussion at budget session. So I want everybody to know that we will have that discussion. We need that. And that's kind of, some of that's up to you. I just present the budget, and then you go, well, I'd like to see it shifted here or there. So having said that, we will certainly have that. I'll make that certainly that a commitment. I'll second Councilmember Petty's motion. We have a motion and a second. It's tabled indefinitely. Any other final comments on that? Okay. Senator, would you please call the roll? Ray? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Petty? Yes. Pinnock? Yes. Bunch? Yes. Latour? Yes. Smith? Yes. Okay, moving along to number two. Do you all want a break? Okay. No. Yeah, you all get up and get a leave when you want to. All right, number two. All right, number two. Yeah, yeah, we'll probably be a lot more pliable as we go along the rest of these. All right, number two, an ordinance to wait requires a formal bidding and to authorize the purchase of additional Laserfish user licenses and models, annual software maintenance and future software and service needs through the end of 2022 from... M-C-C-I-L-L-C in the amount not to exceed $90,000 plus the tax kit. Whereas on August 18, 2015, the City Council approved the purchase of a new enterprise resource planning system from New World Systems Corporation, which included a new document management system called LaserFish. And whereas in 2016, the City Council approved the purchase of additional licenses, software modules, and maintenance, and whereas the City staff are confident that continued use and expansion of the later FISH system will provide significant improvements in document management and staff efficiency to justify the continued investment in this software product. And whereas Laserfish does not sell licenses or software modules directly and requires all purchases to be made through the original vendor, which is MCCI LLC, the largest vendor of Laserfish to government entities in the United States. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the city council of the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas, section one. At City Council, the city of Fayetteville Arc. So hereby determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical and therefore weighs requirements of formal competitive bidding and authorizes the purchase of additional laserfish user licenses and modules and annual software maintenance and future software and service needs through the end of 2022. From MCC I LLC in amount not to exceed $90,000 plus applicable taxes. Okay. Once again, Kit answered every single thing I had down on my talking point, so I'll just hear if you have any questions, feel free to answer them. Okay, do we have any questions for Keith on this? Do we have any public comment? Okay, bringing it right back to the council. All right, Sarah. I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. Kyle. Seconded. we have a motion to go to the second rate sandra would you please call the round gray yes marsh yes yes eddie yes yes yes yes yes In order to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and authorize the purchase of additional LaserFish user licenses and modules, annual software maintenance, and future software and service needs through the end of 2022 from MCCI LLC in an amount not to exceed $90,000 plus applicable taxes. And so, Kyle. I'd make a motion to suspend the rules and go to the third reading. Sir. Second. Second. We have a motion to go to the third and final reading. And second. Senator, please call the roll. Ray? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Eddy? Yes. Bennett? Yes. Bunch? Yes. Latour? Yes. Smith? Yes. Yes. in order to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and authorize a purchase of additional laser fish user licenses and modules annual software maintenance and future software and service needs through the end of 2022 from mcci llc in an amount not to exceed 90 000 plus apple taxes okay any final comments from the council on this sorry would you please call the Ray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Kenyon. Yes. Petty. Yes. Bennett. Yes. Patch. Yes. Latour. Yes. Smith. Yes. Okay, number three, an ordinance would competitive bidding and accept a repair quote of $14,570 plus political taxes from JCI Industries Incorporated to repair a wastewater pump used at the Greg Street sewer lift station. Kip. Whereas the Gregg Street lift station's four submersible pumps are systematically pulled for inspection and repairs, and whereas the vendor was required to take apart and inspect the pump for damage, it has determined that it is in need of a routine rebuild and minor machine work, which can be done at a cost of $15,990.58. Well, no, it should be $14,570, including sales tax. Okay. Whereas formal competitive bidding is not necessary for the repair of, quote, hidden or unknown damages. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby determines that because of the Arkansas Procurement Law R6, colon 19-11-203, subsection 14-EE, Repair of hidden or unknown damages, the repair of a wastewater pump does not require formal competitive bidding and therefore weighs formal competitive bidding and accepts a repair quote from JCI Industries in the amount of $14,570 plus applicable sales tax and authorizes the payment of that amount. Did I get the figures right this time? Sounds good. Okay. At one point, it was like $5,000 more, so we made a good deal somewhere along the line. We did. The parts were not what we expected they'd be, so it was a good deal. Kit went through all the details of this, and staff recommends that we approve the repair of the number four pump at the Gregg Street lift station, and this was at the September 11th Water, Sewer, and Solid Waste Committee meeting. Okay. What questions do we have from the council? Okay. What public comment do we have on this? anybody interested in the pump okay uh sarah i move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading we almost took it off the agenda wednesday so or last week so i'll second that okay we have the motion in the second to go to the second reading so please call the road right yes marsh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes And ordinance to waive competitive bidding and accept a repair quote of $14,570 plus applicable taxes from JCI Industries Incorporated to repair a wastewater pump used at the Gregg Street sewer lift station. We suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Second that. We have a motion and second to go to the third and final reading. So please call the roll. Ray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Inyon. Yes. Petty. Yes. Tennant. Yes. Hutch. Yes. The chair. Yes. Beth. Yes. Yes. In ordinance to waive competitive bidding and accept a repair quote of $14,570 plus applicable taxes from JCI Industries Incorporated to repair a wastewater pump used at the Greg Street sewer lift station. Any final comments from the council? Adele? Yes, sir. Okay. So, I'm going to wish the police to hold the roll. Ray? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Inman? Yes. Petty? Yes. Bennett? Yes. Bunch? Yes. Couture? Yes. Smith? Yes. Okay, number four, an ordinance rezoning that property described in the zoning petition RZN 18-6308 for approximately .39 acres located at 1424 North Grace Avenue from RSF 4, residential single family four units per acre to R I-12. Residential intermediate 12 units per acre kit. Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby changes the zone classification of the property shown on the map, Exhibit A, and the legal description, Exhibit B, both attached to the Planning Department's agenda memo from RSF 4, residential single family, 4 units per acre, to RI 12, residential intermediate, 12 units per acre. Section 2, that the City Council and the City of Fayetteville Orchestra hereby amends the official zoning map of the City of Fayetteville to reflect the zoning change provided in Section 1. Okay. Who has that one? I do. Yes, Mayor. This request is located at Greg Avenue and Lawson Street on the northeast corner. The surrounding land uses are duplexes to the east and to the south, apartments across Gregg. Apartments to the north, there's vacant property between the request and the apartments to the north. The future land use map designates this for city neighborhood area. It encourages a variety of building types, residential building types, increased density where appropriate. And they requested zoning. It's considered a form-based zoning district, which is also recommended for these areas. Issues. Mayor Lawson Street is substandard. It's narrow. It goes up a fairly steep hill. And the neighborhood is concerned about zoning creep into the neighborhood. The staff and planning commission recommended approval. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Okay, what questions? Is the applicant here? You've been long evening, haven't you? How did you get here on the agenda? I think my hair was dark when I came in the door. But I do have to say that I've never seen something like this. No, it's good to see. It's good to see. I'm thrilled that I got to have this opportunity. I've got just a few words to say, and then I'll... Kick it back. My name's Jim Bergen. And by the way, Mr. Williams, that's a U instead of an I, if that's critical to anything that's in there. And I appreciate. Well, that was certainly the planning department that messed up, not me. Well, I don't listen. I'm just trying to make it easier. OK, I thank you for considering our rezone. This is a three-structure, 0.4-acre piece of property. It's got two of the structures are serviceable. One of the structures is probably a teardown, and that is the main structure that's on there. I am the trustee. This is actually part of a trust, and I am the trustee. I have no desire to be a landlord nor a developer. So the request for the rezone is to give flexibility to a potential buyer in that area. Plus, it is very close to the University of Arkansas. We're going to get some pushback, I think, from the neighborhood, the VA Hill Neighborhood Association. So I want to just give you just a little bit of background real quick. Okay. First off, having served 22 years in the Air Force and supporting their rights to have their say, I think that they should have their voices heard. And I defend that. I will defend that right. One thing that I would tell you, and I know you've had kind of a long, hard night, but after 22 years in the Air Force all over the world, I came back to Fayetteville, Arkansas, because it's a great place to be. And I think, you know, you all have proven that. I hope that you have had good mentoring from your previous city councils because it's a good place. That's at least my opinion on this. There was a little bit of pushback on the Lawson Street entrance. Last time, during the planning commission, I went out and actually measured it today. Fortunately, there's not much traffic on Lawson Street, so I was able to put a tape measure across there. It is actually, let me get this right, it's 43 feet wide. and I didn't know if that was good or bad, so I went and I measured boardwalk that's right off of Crossover, and it's about 26 feet wide. So I was more worried about getting run over on boardwalk than I was on Lawson. There may be some other thing expressed by the VA Hill neighborhood community, but... I thank you again for listening to me, and I request that you approve this for the George Bergen Trust, my grandfather. Any questions? Yes. Do we have any questions for the applicant or staff? Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. What public comment do we have? Do I need to go over the rules again? Most of you have been here most of the evening. Well, anyway, let's do that one more time. You get one turn at the microphone. You have five minutes unless a council member asks you questions. Or by a vote of the council, motion in the second, and a majority vote, you can have more time left. They'll decide how much time that is. I would say it would be relatively short. Looking at the hours that we have been, keep your comments directed to me. Don't engage anybody on the council or anybody in the audience. Stay on topic and give us your name and address and who would be first. My name is Eric Parkinson. I live at 335 Hawley. I am the field captain for the V.A. Hill Neighborhood Association, which was formed in June of 2002 by former city commissioner Kyle Cook and Don Maher. The purpose of the VA Hill Neighborhood Association was to protect the status of this little area. It's four blocks. It's between North Street and Sycamore on the east – I'm sorry, north and south, and Greg Street and Woolsey on the east and west. There's 125 homes in the area. That's counting Mr. Birkin's property as one, even though it's three structures apparently. And as the VA Hill Captain, I – I'm the person that knocks on the doors and talks to people. We have 123 of the 125 residences that have opposed this proposed ordinance. The two people that were for it were just contrary because everybody else was against it. That's my opinion on it. There's a couple of reasons why we think this is a bad idea. First of all, I moved here in 2002 from Los Angeles. I looked at a lot of different cities, Austin and Asheville, North Carolina, Portland, a lot of different cities. And I chose Fayetteville because Fayetteville had a real charm. And they had the charm of having some historic neighborhoods that were preserved for single-family residences. We didn't want to live in a McMansion out east and we didn't want to live in a condo community. We wanted to live in a diverse neighborhood that had historic homes, medium-sized homes, small homes, but they were all single-family homes. And that four-block area, which is immediately north of Wilson Park, which is also the north end of Wilson Park, is also only single-family homes. Right. is what gives these towns some diversity and real feeling. If you lose the status of those neighborhoods, you never get it back. You can't just do random infill of apartments into areas where you've got kids playing in the street. Lawson Street's not 43 feet wide. If you look at the back of this petition here, which I have copies for all of you, It's 43 feet wide, only at one spot where it joins Gregg. It comes down to 10 feet, and you can't even pass two cars on it. It's also an extremely steep hill, and for those of us that live there, whenever there's snow or ice, you can't go down Lawson. You can't go down Hawley. You can't go down Woolsey Street. Your only way in and out of our neighborhood is to go south on Woolsey and then catch North Street as you work your way up to College. It's not the infrastructure just isn't there to handle additional apartments. And I think probably one of the things that a lot of the neighbors were most upset about was you're not being asked to approve a particular development. You're being asked to change the zoning of a neighborhood that we have all invested in so that one person can financially benefit and get a higher price. you're not approving a particular building. It's not like in Markham Hill where you've got a tremendously detailed plan, and you can look at it and you can pick the pieces apart. This is just changing the zoning because you just really don't care about the residents there. You're basically just saying, oh, one guy wants to change the plan. So our feeling is it should be a post, and at some point, if somebody has a particular plan, then you can look at it then. But I would like to get everybody the petitions, just so you can see it, and I yield the rest of my time to the sandbath. Okay. Who else would like to address this? My name is Danis Parker, and I've lived at 320 West Lawson for 16 years. My property is just east of the proposed rezone, and I finally paid my house off last year and hope to enjoy this unique neighborhood for years to come. Thank you. I'm concerned about what has been proposed to be built at the end of Lawson Street. Every year in the current dilapidated multi-resident dwelling on my street, there's two of them, a new group of renters move in with five or six residents and bring with them big trucks, parties, and piles of trash. Just two weeks ago, I tried to turn up Lawson to go home only to find 20 plus vehicles blocking the street, forcing me to back onto Gregg Street, go all the way to Woolsey, and then Sycamore to get home. Lawson Street is in horrible disrepair with crumbling hedges, deep ditches, and poor drainage. Most of the street can only accommodate one vehicle at a time to pass. By adding more multi-resident dwellings at the bottom of Lawson with the entrance being on Lawson or even Gregg, this would create more traffic up and down Lawson. Currently, it is very dangerous to walk around the block with my dog. Entering Lawson from Gregg Street going north is also very hazardous due to a crest on the hill right before Lawson. Every day when I go to work I have to accelerate my car as fast as I can to catch up with the cars coming over the hill, most of them in excess of 40 miles per hour. A few years ago, the carport on the proposed rezoning property was accidentally torn off the house because a vehicle could not make the turn of Lawson. And one last thing to mention, Greg Street seems to have an abundance of rental and lease properties between North and Township. So there doesn't seem to be a need... for multi-resident dwellings in this area. Before final decision is made, I would urge each of you to drive north on Gregg and turn up Lawson to see the current dilapidated multi-resident dwellings and the terrible road conditions. Please consider improving the infrastructure of the area like the streets, instead of building more trashy rentals in my residential neighborhood. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Thank you for letting us engage you this evening. I'm Mary Kay Crow. I live at 330 West Holly, which is a corner of Holly and Van Bitter Streets. My home has the holly tree the street was named for. I've owned my home since 2004. I'm a graduate of the University of Arkansas and I agree we need more housing for the university students. But I also agree that the infill should be appropriate. This is not an appropriate infill to suggest that we need four more housing units for students at the corner of Lawson and Gregg. I represent a lot of the neighborhood who are long-term residents. We support the community with our taxes and by maintaining beautiful properties. If you haven't been in the VA Hill property area, and I know many of you have because I've seen you there, we invest in our historic neighborhood and maintain lovely lawns. We're all taxpayers and supporters, and we're all voters. Yep. Okay. Our concern is that a non-resident of this neighborhood wants to profit with no regard for what happens to the integrity of the neighborhood by getting a higher price because he can then promote it as one that would have more units on it. I agree wholeheartedly with Eric and Dennis that we do not have the infrastructure to support this type of structure in the area. So what I request today is what we requested from the Planning Commission a year ago when they turned down wholeheartedly a cell tower, which would have been just directly behind this area. And the comment then of the chairman was it's the easiest no vote she'd ever made. We ask you to please protect the integrity of this historic, lovely, faithful, single-family neighborhood. and not allow a non-resident of the neighborhood to simply profit at our expense. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Hello, my name is Branton Moore. I'm a V8 Hill resident at 400 West Patricia Lane. My family has lived in the neighborhood since we began having a family. We moved into the neighborhood because we really liked just... The sense of community that we felt as we drove through, we could, as Mary Kay mentioned, we could see the... Just the nature of the upkeep of the houses. The houses were of a single-family nature, making it affordable for my family. And we wanted to move to a place where we could build a sense of community. Outside of these meetings, I have never met nor engaged with in my neighborhood members. Those persons attempting to rezone. I would love to also reiterate the concerns of traffic on Greg, not only as a concerns to this rezone, but also knowing that there's another large scale development of some nature. I don't know what it is directly across Greg area. from the top of the hill there. I can only imagine that's going to increase traffic even more, and the speeds coming over there. I drive it every day on the way to work. It is quite dangerous at times. Inclement weather makes it even more so. I think that some of the things that I've seen here tonight since I've been here, you know, I agree actually with with what the gentleman who is attempting to rezone this property has said. And Fayetteville is a nice place to live. It is a good place to live. At least, you know, I think that it will be. I hope that it will be, although my confidence has been rather shaken this evening seeing some of the things that have happened. I think that those are the main points that I would have wanted to make. I mean, just reiterating that, like, Adding more of the rental to this doesn't increase our sense of community. I do know my neighbors. I want to continue to know my neighbors. I don't really know the transient renters that move in and out. I'm not saying that all of them would be, but the majority of them are not engaged in my community. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address this? Love Shorter. Sarah Moore, I'm a wife to Branton. I live at 400 West Patricia and we're a long time Fayetteville residents We're some of those problem people that came to school in the late 90s fell in love with this city Decided that we wanted to contribute to the city and decided to really put down roots here and become really involved in our community I We're slightly dismayed in all honesty as we continue to age and to be intertwined in our community with the direction that we are seeing some of the things go. We know that we are having growing pains and that we want all people that come to Fayetteville to have a home, to have a place that's affordable. We needed that. I became a stay-at-home mom. The neighborhood that we live in, the V.A. Hill neighborhood, I follow a lot of groups on social media that have a lot of really good discussions about the economy, social status, racial issues, justice issues. One of the really interesting things that I do is just sit back and listen a lot of times. And I found it very interesting because oftentimes... Our observation of what folks would like in this infill environment tends to be, you know, this mixed where it's, you know, apartments or townhomes, you know, these rental type of situations are. But it was really interesting to hear recently that a lot of folks are saying, I want a single family home. I want to be detached. I want a yard. I want to feel like I can pay an affordable amount for my living wage that can allow me to be with my small family and maybe stay at home, walk to parks. The Vanity Hill neighborhood does that. We lived in downtown general when my husband and I both worked together. We had a large home. We had a lot of upkeep. We could have never stayed in that area. And some of the areas like Washington, Willow Heights, have those types of things as well. This neighborhood meets are really, we're right beside Wilson Park. We have all the amenities. We have all the community involvement. I know these people that are speaking here. I see them on a regular basis. I walk my dog past these people. It barks at them as they walk past my yard. We all know each other and we look out for each other. So I'm really excited to be here. Again, we haven't seen these folks in our neighborhood until this rezoning came up, and so it dismays me. One, I would have loved for them to have reached out to us, and maybe we could have come together and maybe come to some solution. And I'm sad to see that they're wanting the rezoning not to improve upon this property but to actually profit more from it because, again, Our thought is we try to be more community-minded and think about what's going to be best for the entire community. And keeping the integrity of this Fayetteville neighborhood, it is a priceless little gem, again, that is affordable in the middle of Fayetteville, which is something we're constantly striving for. And I hate to think that in any way we would give it any chinks in its armor by allowing something like this to be done. Thank you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us on this? Okay, seeing none, I'll bring it back to the council. Sarah. Thank you. I am in support of this rezoning. And, you know, I want to talk about when we hear negativity about renters. Over 60% of the households in this community are renters. And that's a number that's growing. So when you say that you don't want renters in your neighborhood, you're saying that you don't want the majority of people to be able to live in your community. Demographics are changing. Jobs are no longer secure. Young people are burdened with incredible amounts of student loan debt. Renting is the new reality, and we need to offer a variety of household types for people who rent. And if we want to have affordable housing, it is a lot more affordable to subdivide one lot into three separate units or multiple units to distribute the cost of that lot and land development over multiple units so that they can become more affordable. And if we look at where we need to put infill and density, Gregg Street is a minor arterial roadway. You know, it's one of the major north-south connectors in our town. And so having, if we're going to put density or denser development, locating it along a minor arterial roadway next to Wilson Park, you know, near where they can easily bike to the Razorback Greenway, is the right place to put it. We're not dropping this in the middle of a neighborhood. It's on a major... roadway. And the idea that apartments are incompatible with kids playing in the street, single parents need apartments to live in. And when you have families where you've got two low income wage earners, the working poor, they live in apartments as well. And so it's i think it's really important that we stop this bias against renters and that we are more inclusive of people in all economic demographics and in a variety of housing situations and this lot looking at the condition of the existing property it supports redevelopment and the We have much more opportunities for doing that in an affordable manner if we put multiple units on that lot instead of one single-family home. Thank you. Okay, Justin. Well, I wouldn't feel comfortable voting on this tonight. If the council wishes to, I wouldn't want to without putting some more time into this and seeing the location and actually looking at the neighborhood a little more. I know where it is, but honestly, I'm... I just haven't spent enough time looking at this particular spot and what it would mean to the surrounding neighborhood. So I would rather not vote on it tonight and probably wouldn't vote on it tonight even if the rest of the council did. But I would prefer to leave it at least for two more weeks so that we could – so that at least I could have some more time to look at the property in the surrounding neighborhood. I've got to mirror the concerns of the neighborhood here. Lawson needs some improvements if we're going to get more higher density there. I'm real familiar with the area. I live right over in that area. I don't have anything against renters. I think that I was a renter for a very long time, but in this specific area, It is a precarious entrance and egress that needs to be looked at seriously whenever we talk about rezoning it. So, again, I would suggest that we leave it on this reading and then come back and revisit this later because this is a very precarious street, very precarious, and I would hope that we would recognize that whenever we look at rezoning it. Okay, some of you all will just leave it here for a few minutes. Okay. All right, number five, an ordinance to rezone that property described in the zoning petition RZN 18-6330 for approximately 13.26 acres located at 1101 South Beachwood Avenue from I-1 Heavy Commercial Line Industrial to CS Community Services. Kip? Be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1. At the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, I hereby change the zone classification of the property shown on the map, Exhibit A, and the legal description, Exhibit B, both attached to the Planning Department's agenda memo from I-1, Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to CS Community Services. Section 2, that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, hereby amends the official zoning map of the City of Fayetteville to reflect the zoning change provided in Section 1. Yes, Mayor. This parcel is just west of Beachwood Avenue. It is south of MLK. The university owns this parcel right here and has built a parking lot for their students. The predominant recent development has been multifamily residential to the north, to the east. There is another project that's associated with this request immediately to the west, and if this were rezoned, they would add it to this multifamily project. It's presently zoned industrial. If you look at this map, you can see a variety of zoning districts in this area. It's community services, which is what they're requesting immediately to the north. That's where the apartment complex is. It is RMF 12 to the west, which is multifamily. It's I-1 to the south, I-2 across the street. The planning staff and commission felt there's sort of a transition developing from industrial to residential, and this follows that trend. The area is designated industrial in the 2030 plan, this lot is, and the Planning Commission staff recommended approval. What about that? Would you like to say something? Yeah? No? You're good. We can answer you, too. Uh-huh. We ought to at least have some questions for them and make them get up and talk. Well, they sure can. I guess not. I guess not. what questions do we have from the council nothing okay had his chance there you go do we have uh any public comment on this no all right i'm going to bring it back to the council sarah i move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading all right the motion in the second to go to the second reading Sandra, would you please call the roll? Ray? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Inman? Yes. Patty? Yes. Inman? Yes. Bunch? Yes. Latour? Yes. Smith? Yes. And an ordinance to rezone that property described in a rezoning petition, RZN 18-6330. for approximately 13 and a quarter acres located at 1101 South Beachwood Avenue from I-1 Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to CS Community Services. Adele. I move we go to the third and final reading. Thank you, Justice. Second. I have a motion and a second to go to the third and final reading. Senator, would you please call the roll? The seconder put, thank you. Sorry. Yes, we should have called then. Ray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Inyon. Yes. Petty. Yes. Hinnant. Yes. Bunch. Yes. Latour. Yes. Smith. Yes. An ordinance to rezone that property described in a rezoning petition RZN 18-6330 for approximately 13 1⁄4 acres located at 1101 South Beachwood Avenue from I-1 Heavy Commercial and Light Industrial to CS Community Services. Okay. Final comments from the council on this? Senator, would you please call the roll? Gray. Yes. Marsh. Yes. Hinnant. Yes. Petty. Yes. Hinnant. Yes. Batch. Yes. Latour. Yes. Smith. Yes. Okay. Number six, an ordinance repeal Article 28, City Board of Health, Chapter 33, Departments, Boards, Commissions, and Authorities of the Federal City Code. Yes. Whereas the Washington County Health Unit and the Washington County Health Officer have duties and responsibilities similar to the City Board of Health, and a duplication of efforts could lead to conflicting consequences in an event of an epidemic outbreak. And whereas the City Board of Health, which is optional under state law, has not had any agenda items for over a year, now therefore be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, At the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, our staff hereby repeals Article 28, City Board of Health, in Chapter 33, Departments, Boards, Commissions, and Authorities of the Fayetteville City Code and abolishes the City Board of Health. Nothing personal, Chief. All right. Chief, how's that back tonight? Good? Well, after I stretched out back there on the pew in the back, it got a little better. Susan, would you set that timer for 45 minutes and then stop me when I get there, please? Okay. Thanks. That'd be longer than the last meeting we had. Yeah. With the Board of Health. Well, as Kit said, this is a staff recommends for the city council to repeal Article 28, City Board of Health, of the Fayetteville Code, and abolish the Board of Health. The Board of Health and the City Health Officer were originally required per state law for the city to create them. The City Board of Health was first created in January of 2003, just after passage of that ordinance. The General Assembly of the state made the creation of such a board optional rather than mandatory. There's currently a Washington County Health Unit and a County Health Officer with similar duties and responsibilities as the City Board of Health and the City Health Officer. This is a duplication of effort and could possibly have conflicting consequences in the event of an epidemic outbreak. In addition, the County Health Unit has a full-time administrator and staff to monitor and act on public health issues. They are continually on alert to address public issues. The city health officer has recommended abolishing the city board of health and that we utilize the county health unit and the county health officer. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Yes, what questions do we have? We haven't met in how long has it been, a year? It's been a year since we've had any agenda items, yeah. This is lean government now, right? Lean government, yes, sir. I guess we're not going to be quite as healthy, but anyway. Mark. I will just mention that today I was contacted by a person that is taking an issue to this city board of health. You're kidding me. I'm not kidding you. Okay. She's already been in contact with Dr. Crinton and Dr. Patton. So I'm just saying, there you go. You're going to get an item agenda, perhaps. Can her issue go to the county health unit instead? I'll tell you what it's about. It's about looking at our marijuana and health issue here in the city. And she thinks that they would have the... Maybe we should leave this on the first reading. Yeah, let's leave this on the first reading. So I'll just say, it's... Okay. The Board of Health is actually scheduled to meet on Wednesday. Well, hopefully she'll get her item on that and they will have a recommendation. Well, since we're going to be open for business, I suppose we should contact this. We'll just put it right on their call. Do you have something to add? I guess if you're going to have a meeting anyway, put this on their agenda and make sure the Board of Health feels okay about being abolished. Okay. The meeting's the 10th. So I'll notify the board that we have an agenda item. We must meet. There's a reason you stuck around so long. They can make their final decision. Yes, so both of us are probably going to meet on the end. I'll be there, Mayor. We haven't had a quorum for a while either. Okay, so it's tabled? Is that what I understand? Yes, we will. Okay. I know I'm dedicated. You'll be old business, though, next time. All right. Well, thank you for my position on the agenda tonight. Yes, you'll be right at the top of the list. All right, thank you. Hey, I almost pulled the fire deal a couple of times, so I was glad you were here, actually. I thought about pulling the fire alarm. Can we get a corn wash? Okay, very good. What announcements do we have? Mayor, I have a few. You have a few. I'm sure everybody will want to be up and at them to join Coffee with a Cop at Rick's Donuts at 7 in the morning. See you all tomorrow. See you in the morning at 7. Chief Tabor asked me to invite all of you. It's from 7 to 9, so if you want to sleep in, you might catch the second half. Also, tomorrow... Yes, it will be tomorrow. You all may notice your phones are buzzing. There will be a national test of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System in early afternoon, 118, 120. So everybody's cell phones and all of their wireless devices and everything else will be going off at that time. It's just a test. We're looking forward to our next Cultural Arts Corridor public input sessions. Those will be next Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday evening between 6.30 and 8.30 at Fayetteville High School, the presentations will be given by landscape architect Nelson Bird-Wolfe and our curation consultants, Forecast Public Art, and there will be public feedback sought. Tuesday evening at Fayetteville High. Announcements are on the website for location directions and where to go. It will be at the cafeteria and the idea is to park on the west side of the building and walk through the gate into the courtyard to enter the high school cafeteria that way. The second meeting when the consultants are here will be Wednesday, the 10th, at the Walker Room of Fayetteville Public Library. Continue to take survey results, survey input for the 71B corridor through the fall. There are two more bulky waste cleanups, October 22nd and November 3rd. And finally, the business license renewal period is open until October 31st. Thanks. Does anybody else have any? Everybody good? Uh-huh. Anything else to discuss? Want to stay any longer? All right. We almost made it to the coffee thing. All right. We're adjourned. Thank you all.
