Sandra, would you please call the roll? I'll ask. Yes Yes, thank you all next order of business is the report of the fireman's and policeman pension and relief fund In keeping with statutory requirements, I am presenting this report for 2016 on the local police fire retirement and relief funds for the City of Federal. Both of these plans were closed by law in 1983 and there are no longer any active working members remaining. There are currently 41 police and 47 fire retirees and beneficiaries in the system. A December 2016 projected expenses from the fire pension fund were approximately $1.4 million as compared to fund revenues of $1.4 million. Projected police pension fund expenses were approximately $1.5 million as compared to fund revenues in excess of $1 million. This is before adjusting investments to current market value. Actuarial evaluations are the responsibility. of the State of Arkansas Fire and Police Pension Board, Review Board. The last evaluations completed were as of May 2016 for the year ending December 31st, 2015. Based on those evaluations, The total pension liability of the police and fire funds were 18.4 million and 19.4 million respectively. The net pension liabilities for these funds were approximately 12.2 million for police and 15.7 million for fire. In the annual reports issued by the Arkansas Pension Review Board, neither the fire nor police pension fund were found to be axillary sound pursuant to established financial tests. The fire pension fund has been classified as projected insolvent since 2009. The fire pension board has been discussing the unstable condition of the fund and possible alternatives since that time. In 2015, the fire pension board brought forward a resolution to the city council requesting the city agree to consolidate the fund's lofty. In October 2015, Lafayette representatives came to the federal to discuss the condition of and possible solutions to resolve the fire pension fund financial situation. These presentations were made at special city council, at special city council meetings by Lafayette representatives, however, the issue is complex and solutions discussed are All had possible negative consequences to the city. The city attorney also advised the council that consolidation might be unconstitutional under the state law. The council and administration agreed to further study and discuss the issue again, but the fire pension board did not bring forward a specific request to the city council in 2016. The financial conditions of the fire pension fund has been relatively the same since those meetings, so no change has occurred to make the situation better or worse. However, the asset value of the funds continues to be under $5 million, which makes it subject to further investment restrictions. These restrictions no longer allow investments in individual securities. Investments will be limited to cash, cash equivalents, government bonds, and no low mutual funds. This means overall returns in the future are likely to be less than previously experienced, which could bring about depletion of the fund earlier than expected. The police pension fund is also considered actually early unsound, but not in immediate danger of becoming insolvent. The police pension board is also aware of the police pension fund status and has been considering options that would guarantee long-term solvency. I will continue to monitor these pension funds in the future and keep you apprised of any new developments if necessary. So that is the report. Any questions on that? Okay. All right, the next order of business we have tonight is the election of the vice mayor. At this time, I will open the floor for nominations for vice mayor. Justin. I nominate Allen Long. Is there any other nominations? I would nominate Sarah. Okay. Mark. Sarah. Is there any other nominations? Okay. All right, I will close the floor. Nominations from Vice Mayor. Is there any comments? Sarah, did you or Alan want to say anything? Okay.
 Yep.
 Mark. Well, I just wanted to nominate Sarah to continue a second year on this as a second term. And this is not a... position that is used that much but I do think that Offering her a second year would be appropriate. So that's why I nominated her anyone else Okay, there's no other final comments by name vote for who you wish to have as your vice mayor. Okay? Sandra, did you call the roll? No, I do just vote I think okay Unless they don't need to put. You have to do it verbally. Yeah. Because it's only the S-9. That's what I thought. Okay. Is it Alan or Sarah? Right. So just one of the other. Alan Long. John Latour. Alan Long. Alan Long. Alan Long. Sal, Sal Hickam. Adele Gray. Alan Long. Sarah Marsh. Sarah Marsh. Mark Kehan. Sarah Marsh. Betsy Petty. Sarah Marsh.

 Sorry. Under unfinished business, we have none. Under new business, number one, an order to sway the requirements for competitive bidding during 2017 for the purchase of asphalt materials for use by the transportation division, but to require informal quarterly bids or quotes. Whereas the crude oil market continues to experience price volatility, and whereas this volatility makes normal competitive bidding procedures unworkable, impractical, and not feasible, and whereas the Transportation Division proposes to solicit and accept bids on a quarterly basis without the need for further approval of the City Council through 2017. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Section 1, that the City Council, the City of Fayetteville-Arkansas hereby finds that such circumstances constitute an exceptional situation where formal competitive bidding is not feasible or practical, and therefore through calendar year 2017, Hawaii's requirements of formal competitive bidding for the purchase of asphalt materials and authorizes transportation divisions to solicit informal bids or quotes on a quarterly basis without the need for further approval of the City Council. Chair. Good evening, Mayor, Council. This is just a continuation. We've done this for the last several years in order to try and maintain the lowest price possible. And as Kit said, due to the volatility of oil prices, this could change more often than not during the course of the year. So it's just an option to, we still bid everything quarterly. We just get the bids that way and then don't have to come back each time. But it's a process that's worked well over the last several years. Okay. What questions do we have for Terry on this? Okay. What public comment do we have on this? Okay. Bring it back to the council. Sarah? I move we suspend the rules and go to the second reading. Adela? I second that motion. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Fetch. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

 Yes. In order to sway the requirements of formal competitive bidding during 2017 for the purchase of asphalt materials for use by the Transportation Division, but to require informal quarterly bids or quotes. motion to suspend the rules and move to the third and final reading adela second that motion we have a motion in a second to go to the third and final read Sondra would you please call the roll yes yes yes yes yes yes An ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding during 2017 for the purchase of asphalt materials for use by the Transportation Division, but to require informal quarterly bids or quotes. Okay, any final comments from the council? Senator, would you please call the roll? Batch? Yes. LeTierre? Yes. Long? Yes. Gray? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Higgins? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, number two. Thank you all. Number two, in order to waive the requirements for competitive bidding and improve cost share, drink with Mark's Wagon Incorporated for a water main upgrade along a portion of North Church Avenue between West Spring Street and West Dixon Street. with the estimated amount to be paid by the city of Fed will not exceed $103,665.15 and to approve project 10C an amount of $20,733.03. Whereas Mark Zweig Incorporated will be developing property located at 218 North Church Avenue, a project which has been approved by the city's planning division, And whereas during the course of design review by the City of Fayetteville, Marcus Weig Incorporated was made aware of an existing water volume fire flow issue with the current water piping. And whereas increasing the size of this approximately 625 foot segment From a 4-inch main to an 8-inch main will alleviate the current water volume deficiency, allow the development to connect, and also allow for secondary water loop to help prevent the possibility of residents losing water service in the event of a water leak in the area. And whereas the City of Fayetteville would benefit from the cost share as it will replace and upgrade aged infrastructure in the core of the city, providing improved service and fire protection for residents and businesses in the area, and will facilitate future development. And whereas section 51.112 of the Fable Code provides that, quote, the city shall pay the excess material costs of facilities of a size that is larger than required to serve subdivisions when such excess size is specified and required by the water and wastewater director for the general benefit of the water system, unquote. And whereas waiving formal competitive bidding will save time and cost by utilizing the developer's contractor who will be on site installing the larger line to the developer's project. Now, therefore, it be ordained by the City Council of the City of Fayetteville-Arksaw, Section 1. that the City Council of the City of Fayetteville are hereby determined that an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical and therefore waives requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a cost share agreement with Mark Zweig, Inc. for a water main upgrade along North Church Avenue between West Spring Street and West Dixon Street with the estimated amount to be paid by the City of Fayetteville not to exceed $103,665.15. And further approves a project contingency amount of $20,000 and $733.03. Okay. Tim. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council. I think Kit, as he always does, explained it quite well. We were approached by Marks & Wig Incorporated to request a cost share for upgrading the water line on Church Avenue between Spring and Dixon. The length at that time was approximately 295 feet to reach his property at 218 North Church. Upgrading this water line would provide for ample future capacity with not only the property that he is working on, but nine additional properties on that street. Additionally, the city decided to pay to extend the eight inch line an additional 330 feet to upgrade this four inch line completely from Spring to Dixon. This will create a larger capacity loop, allow for additional properties now and in the future to connect, and provide increased fire protection for the entire distance between Spring Street and Dixon. A bid waiver is requested so the city can utilize the contractor on site to continue to lay the pipe from Spring to Dixon. The utility engineer has deemed these costs appropriate for this kind of work. Estimated cost like kids said is one hundred thirty five thousand five hundred ten dollars for the whole project with the city's portion being 103 thousand six hundred sixty five dollars and fifteen cents with a 20% contingency to account for any unforeseen expenses Staff does recommend approval of this bid waiver and cost your agreement. What questions do we have for Tim on this? Okay, a public comment. Do we have on this? Okay, I'm gonna bring back to the council now. I Motion to suspend the rules and move to the second reading. Dustin? Second. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Batch? Yes. LeGerman? Yes. Long? Yes. Wright? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Petty? Yes. Bennett?

 Yes. Okay, thank you all. Number three, an ordinance to amend subsection one, rates for parking and city parking garages and of 72.58%. off street parking facilities rules and rights of the city code to allow more flexibility for monthly parking rates in the middle street parking garage kit whereas section 72.58 i1 of the city code currently sets monthly parking rates for the metal street parking garage at fifty dollars per space per month for the first and second levels and thirty dollars per space per month for the third level And whereas the administration is allowed to establish parking rates for up to $70 per month for space, and all other parking structures built or purchased after January 1, 2000. and whereas permitting similar flexibility in setting rates for the metal street parking garage as other parking garages will allow the city to respond to market demands and also provide incentives for access to parking on certain levels while allowing reserved spaces to be priced according to demand now therefore be ordained by the city council of the city of fable arkansas section one at the city council the city of fable arcs are hereby repeal section 72.58 I mean I won and section seventy two point five eight I to the payable code in an actual replacement section seventy two point five eight I won and I to as follows subsection I race for parking in city parking garages subsection one parking garages shall be rented monthly at a market rate not to exceed the amount of seventy dollars per space per month and Section 2 a single entry rate for the city parking garage and Meadow Street shall be set at a rate of three dollars per visit On the third level and four dollars per visit on the first level if entry is not restricted Okay Thank You mayor council So currently the monthly rental rates for the municipal deck on Meadow Street are set by ordinance $50 for the first level $50 for the second level $30 for the third level what this proposed amendment would do would remove the specific monthly rental rates and set a cap not to exceed $70 the purpose of this amendment is threefold one it would mirror existing language that's already in place for the town center deck two existing lease agreements that the city already has with the Chancellor Hotel ownership for the first and third levels at $50 per month per space. And lastly, it would allow the city to adjust rates and have more flexibility as the market demands. Now, I wanna make it very clear that there is no intention to increase any rates on anyone as a result of this proposed amendment. Currently, the second level of the municipal deck lessees rent and assigned space each month for that $50 And the deck is rarely half full so we feel like we can incentivize access at a lower monthly rate and perhaps increase revenue and increase utilization on that second level at the same time. But we're not asking anyone to give up in assigned space that they already have. We're not gonna increase rates on anyone. And as with anything related to parking revenues, this will undergo a strict financial analysis. And if it looks like this plan is to be anything but revenue neutral, we'll reassess and go back to the way we had it previously. I'd be happy to answer any questions. What questions do we have? Justin. I don't really have a question, but I want to thank you very much and city staff. The old saying is I'd rather have some of something rather than all of nothing. And I think if these are empty and we can lower rates and maybe increase in some way the revenues in there, it's good for everybody. So thank you very much for coming up with this. I appreciate it. Okay. John. Mr. Mayor, I really like the idea of letting the market set the price. Thank you for bringing this forward. Thank you for the work on it. And I think we need to be ready to raise or lower our price depending on market conditions, not based on our sterile decision here as a city council. You're in a much better position to do it than we are. Thank you. Okay, thanks, John. Anybody else? Okay, do we have any public comment on this? No, no, we'll bring it back to the council. Justin. I move we go to the second reading. Adela. I second that motion. We have a motion and a second to go to the second reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll?

Any final comments from the council? Senator, would you please call the roll? Thanks. Yes. LeTour? Yes. Wong? Yes. Gray? Yes. Petty? Yes. Tennant? Yes. Okay. Number four, a resolution to allow the City of Federal to enter into a partnering agreement with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department for improvements to Highway 112 between Razorback Road and Garland Avenue to approve the reclassification of Highway 112 between 15th Street... And Interstate 49 is a city street. Chris. Yes, thank you, Mayor. This is something we've been working with the Transportation Committee, the U of A, and the Highway Department on for several months. So for those of you who have been working on it, I apologize. I do want to go through a little bit of history. First of all, Highway 112, what we're talking about is a segment from 15th Street near Baum Stadium north to I-49, runs through the middle of campus. Several segments of that roadway have been widened and improved in past years through partnerships with the with the U of A the highway department the city we've received federal funds the highway department has included funding so all of those widening segments that have occurred through the past years have been done through those partnerships the U of A has maintained the landscaping on the south side of campus all the way through campus for those sections that have been widened and improved And so they've been a partner in the state highway as well. In 2014, we secured an additional $2.4 million of federal aid to do the Maple Street portion of Highway 112, basically from Garland to Razorback Road, including the Razorback Road intersection, signalizing that intersection. We've bid that a couple of times. Both times the bids have been over $4 million. So the city's cost was gonna be about $3 million in total for matching funds and we just were not able to afford that. So we began talking to the highway department about options for getting some additional funding from them. And so this proposal has come out of that discussion. And essentially the proposal is the Highway Department will provide the additional funding to complete these improvements on Maple Street between Razorback Road and Garland. In addition, they will provide funding for overlay of the rest of Razorback Road from the Maple Street intersection down to Leroy Pond, which has been widened and improved. and also overlay the widened section of Garland between Maple Street and North Street. That was the section that was done a little over 10 years ago and is now in need of an overlay. So essentially through campus, a new roadway all the way through. And then in addition to that, to widen and improve north of the uh the improvements that were completed by the city back about five or six years ago between poplar and i-49 and really all the way up to van ash so widen and improve that section of highway 112 at their cost so at no cost to the city In exchange for all of that, widening all the work done by the Highway Department, the city would agree to take over operation and maintenance of that roadway between 15th Street and I-49. We also included in the packet is a letter from the U of A that provides commitment to help us fund the matching portion for the Maple Street section and also to work with us to develop additional agreements for maintenance through the campus which they're already doing but since it becomes a city street then we would have agreements with the U of A and they would provide the maintenance for all the roadside items all the landscaping all of that sort of thing So, ultimately, this is about a little over $12 million of funding that the state is proposing to provide. At the city's cost for the construction will be about $500,000. Again, $500,000 each between the U of A and the city. Actually I think $479,000 is the current estimate. So this is a proposal that we feel like is a very good proposal. Again, we're getting about $12 million in improvements for a capital cost of under $500,000. um... we do need to say that the operational costs long-term obviously taking over four four miles of roadway uh... will uh... there will be an operational costs we don't expect significant operational cost until the overlaying it's time for an overlay in fifteen to twenty years so we are getting a new facility here uh... and so staff recommends approval we did have this at the Transportation Committee we had two members and actually had the Highway Department representative here to talk about it and So there's there's no recommendation from the committee, but I do know the committee is is Is familiar with this and has looked at it so with that I'll answer any questions what questions do we have Chris on this I? Matthew. Yeah, Chris, whenever we saw this at the Transportation Committee, you were still hoping to make a minor revision to the language if changes we made to the typical cross section resulted in cost savings, you didn't want to be penalized for them being a little different than the typical section. Did that language get changed to your satisfaction? Yes, we were able to get that done. Thank you. Thanks. Anyone else? Okay. Do I have any public comment on this? Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the council. It is a resolution. Allen. Motion to pass the resolution. Matthew. Second. We have a motion and a second to pass the resolution. Any final comments from the council? I certainly want to thank Chris's work and the staff's work on this. This was a pretty, and the university worked on it as well. Thank you, Mike. So it's a pretty good deal for us. All right. Sondra, would you please call the roll? Batch. Yes.
 Mr.
 Chair?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Okay. Number five, an ordinance to rezone that property described in zoning petition RZN 16-5664 for approximately .85 acres located at 1633 East Zion Road from RSF 4, residential single family, four units per acre to NS Neighborhood Services. Kip? BEING ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FAVORLAND, ARKANSAS SECTION 1, THAT THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FAVORLAND ARKS ARE HEREBY CHANGES ITS OWN CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROPERTY SHOWN ON THE MAP, EXHIBIT A, AND A LEGAL DESCRIPTION OF EXHIBIT B, BOTH ATTACHED TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT'S AGENDA MEMO. from from rsf4 residential single family four units per acre to ns neighborhood services section two that's the city council of the city of favor arcs are hereby amends official zoning map of the city of fables reflect the zoning change provided in section one Chair Baron counsel. This is a property a little under an acre in size It's located south on the south side of Zion Road just east of the Vantage Drive intersection was I am The sign road was approved in recent years from North College eastward to Vantage Drive including a traffic signal Those improvements were planned also to continue east across the subject property and then further on to Crossover Road as part of a Phase 2. Those improvements would build Zion Road in accordance with the Master Street Plan cross-section for Collector Street. Those improvements have been fully designed, but the timeframe for construction and funding is still yet unknown. This request is to rezone the subject parcel from residential single-family four units per acre to neighborhood services. Neighborhood services is a zoning district that allows for very small-scale types of non-residential uses, but also allows for the continuation of residential uses on the property. The uses, as you know, along Zion Road transition pretty quickly in this area. Just across the street and a little further to the west at the corner of Vantage and Zion is a commercial mixed-use center, medical complex. Restaurant and brew pub all sorts of different types of commercial uses a large park multifamily to the south residential To the east and so there's it's quite a transitional area We feel because of that that the proposed zoning would be compatible with the surrounding mixture of uses and particularly because the neighborhood services district limits building size to 3,000 square feet and There's already around a 3,000 square foot house on the property, so this potentially this house could be reutilized for a number of different uses or a new development could also be constructed that would ensure the scale of the buildings on the property would remain compatible. Staff supportive of the request to rezone the property to neighborhood services, the Planning Commission also agreed with that recommendation and voted 8-0 in support of the request. Questions do we have for Jeremy on this? Okay. Okay, what public comment do we have on this? Is the applicant here? I'm sorry.
 Okay. Well then, what public comment do we have on this? Okay. I'll bring it back to the council. Allen. Motion to suspend the rules and move to the second reading. Justin. Second. We have a motion and second to go to the second reading. Sandra, would you please call the roll? Vatch? Yes.

 Kinnett?
 Yes. In order to rezone that property is cried and rezoning petition RZ and 16-56 64 for approximately 0.5 acres located at 1633 East Zion Road Residential single-family four units per acre to neighborhood services. Okay Justin let us spend the rules go the third and final reading Adela. I second that motion We have a motion a second to go to the third and final read Sondra. Would you please call the roll? I? Fudge? Yes. Clature? Yes. Long? Yes. Gray? Yes. Petty? Yes. Bennett? Yes. In order to rezone that property, describe the rezoning petition RZN 16-5664 for approximately .5 acres located at 1633 East Zion Road from residential single family, four units per acre to neighborhood services. Okay. Final comments, Justin? Yeah, thank you, Mayor. Just one. I just wanted to say as this area of East Fayetteville continues to grow, I hope that we will continue to discuss in future meetings, whether it be budgeting or sidewalk transportation, a continued improvement of the sidewalks up and down Zion Road. I know we've made a lot of improvements already. this is another reminder that that area is growing at a pretty high rate all the way from 265 to college. And so to make that area more walkable, I think is very important. And I know we've talked about it a lot. We're not ignoring it. Sometimes it's a budget issue, but, I hope for those residents over there that are watching, I for one will continue to push for that and we'll do whatever I hope that we can in that area because it is a growing area. Thank you, Mary. Okay, anybody else? Okay, Sandra, would you please call the roll? Batch? Yes. LeTour? Yes. Long? Yes. Gray? Yes. Petty? Okay, number six an ordinance to amend chapters 160 161 162 164 166 167 and 169 of the Unified Development Code to create two new zoning districts residential intermediate urban and neighborhood services general and new use unit 12 B General business and to make further changes to incorporate these amendments into the Unified Development Code kit And if you thought the title was long just listen to the ordinance I Whereas the city of Fayetteville determines that there are gaps in existing zoning districts to accommodate a range of multi-unit housing types compatible in size and scale with single family homes that may help meet the growing demand for a walkable urban living. And whereas small to medium scale commercial and mixed use development that can exist to provide neighborhood services and goods without allowing undesirable unintended consequences may be facilitated by adding new zoning options.

Williams just read is to create two brand new zoning districts that we've built from scratch utilizing some of the Structure that we have within the unified development code as a template The first of those is called residential intermediate urban I This is a residential district that allows for single family, two family, three family, and also four family, which is something new that we haven't had before. We used to have just single family, two, three, and then it went up to multi-family. We've added a category for four family at the request of the Planning Commission. This is a transect diagram showing the general lot sizes, which I'll go into a little bit more in detail in just a second. And please forgive the RTU. We've gone through several name changes of how to get, I'm sure not, sure residential intermediate's still not the most sexy term to utilize, but it's what we ended up with, so that's what we're going with. But this shows basically that the idea of the scale, residential single family four units per acre, all the way up to downtown general, We've heard over the past year or more members of the Planning Commission, members of this council and also from residents and developers that some of our current zoning districts don't allow the flexibility that we need to meet our city plan 2030, particularly in those areas where we're trying to accomplish infill goals. We heard several zoning districts, for instance, come before you all. zoning request in walker park area or downtown where we had to look at very detailed bills of assurance to make sure that something that we felt The intent was right, but there were so many items within the zoning district that was being proposed that it would not have been compatible and staff did not support that. We believe the residential intermediate urban district accomplishes that, that missing middle piece of our residential structure and density, and likewise a new neighborhood services general district in a commercial form. This is, again, sort of a plan view of what the scale would look like from residential single family, which is our predominant zoning district throughout the city, through neighborhood services, what we're calling limited now, which will allow it to 3,000 square feet in size. That's what we already have on the books. A new district called neighborhood services general, which would be sort of in between neighborhood services limited and community services. We recently had a very long conversation about a zoning on Mount Comfort Road, which was ultimately turned down about community services and a lot of concerns about gas stations, lights from restaurants, the traffic and potential density that would create. This is a potential in-between that would still allow for some non-residential uses and more of a neighborhood setting and scale. And so we're hoping that this type of district can be utilized in in more places throughout the city to provide those support services But still keep it to a neighborhood neighborhood scale There's also a use unit being created, use unit 12B, and I'll go into that in a little more detail. The Planning Commission ultimately voted to recommend all of these amendments 9 to 0. It took two or three meetings, and we had some recommended changes, quite a bit of discussion about this. I do think it's worth going through the different changes, however, as we create these new zoning districts. So I'll just run through these very briefly. These are all in your packet. for you to review but as I mentioned creation of a new renaming of one zoning district RT 12 would be renamed residential intermediate 12 units per acre nothing changes about that zoning district in terms of its use residential intermediate urban would be a new zoning district so that means there's no properties currently zoned that someone would have to request that zoning in the future Likewise, we renamed Neighborhood Services to Neighborhood Services Limited and created a new zoning district again, Neighborhood Services General. The reason Mr. Williams had to read a lot of these, with a unified development code, everything's connected, so if you change one section, it changes many more sections. That's why we had 18 different sections we had to read to make sure this was incorporated throughout the code and why it takes such a long time to put some of these things together. To describe the residential urban district, it's very similar to residential urban. two and three family that we have today it's got residential uses accessory dwellings cottage housing the very same uses permitted uses so there's not a huge change there what it does allow for however is a much reduced lot width minimum 18 feet you can have a very small lot so this is more of a think of a townhouse style development a row home style development up to four units attached could be located on on these properties there's not a density a limitation We feel like the height of the proposal that's within the zoning district and the limiting factor being only four units attached will limit the size and scale to make it compatible within most neighborhoods. We've also changed in all of our multifamily districts and mixed-use districts to allow accessory dwellings. We used to have those in very specific conditional uses for single-family districts. We've gone through all of our districts and allowed those now by right or by conditional use where appropriate throughout the various zones. That's what I'm scrolling through here. The next major change, as I mentioned, neighborhood services general. Again, this is modeled after neighborhood services, what we call limited now, allowing virtually the same uses there. The distinction between the two is the size of the structures, non-residential structures that are allowed. So we're not concerned necessarily with the uses, in particular with these two smaller scale districts. Does not allow some of the uses that community services has, like gas stations, drive-through restaurants, that we hear a lot about as being a concern. So these are going to be, again, residential or general business. General business would allow up to 8,000 square feet in size. That's exclusive of any residential attached dwellings, so that allows for, encourages a mixture of uses as well. And the differentiation there being that neighborhood service is limited, the smaller one allows for 1,500 to 3,000 square feet. The types of uses allowed here are things like offices, studios, very specialized retail properties or developments, things of that nature. The last major thing I wanted to mention, and I've referred to it before, we have several use units that refer to our residential districts. So as an example, use unit 8 is all of our single-family dwellings. Use unit 9 are our two-family dwellings, our duplexes. Use Unit 10 to date has been three family dwellings. The Planning Commission requested, and we entirely agreed, that three and four, a four-family dwelling is a very traditional type of urban dwelling. We have several near our downtown area that were constructed decades past. But we're seeing a resurgence in interest in the market in developing these types of dwellings. properties and so we felt like inserting these and not only allowing them just in multifamily districts was appropriate they can very well be placed within our next two single-family districts if done correctly so we're recommending that use unit 10 incorporate three and four family dwellings as well I'm described general business already basically it's the same template as limited business allowing up to eight thousand square feet And we also modified the true preservation ordinance and grading ordinance to also be compatible with these particular changes to insert percent minimum canopies for those districts. IT'S TAKEN QUITE A WHILE TO GET TO THIS POINT. THE BETTER PART OF THIS YEAR WORKING ON THIS. BUT WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S ASSISTANCE, SOME VERY GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS, WE TOOK ALL OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND CAME BACK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDED 9-0 AND WE'RE HOPING YOU'LL SUPPORT THIS. WE DO RECOMMEND YOU LEAVE IT ON A READING TONIGHT AT LEAST AND ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THE to digest this information. We have presented, as I mentioned, a couple of different times at Planning Commission, but it's changed every time we presented it. So we always believe it's good to take time to look at this information. So with that, I'll take any questions. What questions do we have for Jeremy on this? Okay, John. Mayor, it's not really a question, it's a comment. Jeremy, I congratulate you and thank you for the hard work put into this. It takes Kip 15 minutes to read it, it takes a lot longer to write it. So thank you for writing that. The more planning districts we have, the greater options, the greater possibility we have that someone will build a development. We cannot know the next innovation that's gonna come in housing. And maybe that next innovation does not fit in one of our planning zones. So the more zones we have, the greater the opportunity is for that innovation to take place, for that development to be built. I'm all about people having options, and this gives us more options, thank you. Anybody else do we have any public comment because it's gonna probably be held for two weeks if I wish to comment on this Okay, so council do you wish to hold it right here? Do you want to go on another reading or what you want to do? Sold it right here Okay Okay, number seven a resolution to grant the appeal of City Council member of Della Gray and to deny preliminary Platte's 16-56 42 Park Meadows because such development would create or compound a dangerous traffic condition and violation of 166.02 See of the Unified Development Code Okay We'll start with staff Jeremy you want to take it? Yes, sir. I This is a preliminary plat that was approved by the Planning Commission. It contains 68 acres. It's on the east side of Morningside Drive between Huntsville Road and 15th Street. There's also a small portion or a small parcel that extends to the south side of 15th Street as well. You can see here on the map the area in green was recently rezoned neighborhood conservation. There's a small portion zoned community services all on the east side of Morningside Drive. There's also a protected stream area that the developer offered to protect during the rezoning process to zone residential agricultural, and that's reflected within the development plans as well. The proposal is to develop the site with 290 residential single-family lots in compliance with our Unified Development Code. The Subdivision Committee, Technical Plat Review, Planning Commission all reviewed this through our preliminary plat process. And at the November 28th Planning Commission meeting, several members of the public did speak about a number of issues, primarily centered around traffic safety. ultimately the planning commission after quite a bit of discussion voted to approve the project with a vote of six to three there were several recommendations for improvements as you can imagine with the 290 lot single family subdivision it does generate quite a bit of traffic this is currently an agricultural field there's there are less than four 500 vehicle trips per day on morningside drive so this will have a significant impact Staff was concerned about that. We looked at that in great detail as we do with all projects. We made recommendations to improve the length of Morningside Drive from Huntsville to 15th Street. So right now it's improved on the west side for the majority of that property, but on the east side it's still an open ditch. It's about 22 feet wide in terms of the pavement width. There's no curb and gutter, storm drains, or sidewalk on the east side. The Planning Commission agreed with that recommendation, and if this project goes forward, the east side of Morningside Drive will be improved from 15th all the way to Huntsville Road. On the south side of the project, Boundary 15th Street was recently approved in the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department's Transportation Improvement Plan for a widening to extend the improvements that they've had on Highway 16. I believe that project is slated to be constructed in 2019. Somewhere in that somewhere in that range and so dedication of right away consistent with our master street plan is what we recommended here Because the state will be constructing those improvements. I Much of the conversation ended up centering around the recommendations for Huntsville Road and that's really the basis for this appeal. Ms. Gray appealed the subdivision approval by the Planning Commission properly within 10 days and cited those specific traffic concerns on Huntsville Road as the reason for the appeal. Well, let me step back. The Planning Commission, the planning staff had asked for a traffic study. Anything over 100 units, we have a policy of recommending a traffic study be conducted to understand the impacts on the surrounding existing infrastructure by development. Unfortunately, that traffic study didn't come until very late. Basically after the agenda session had already occurred with the Planning Commission, we received that on a Thursday, I believe. We had essentially a day to review that before the Planning Commission, and so it was a rather rushed review. I think there was a lot of discussion around what the traffic study meant at the Planning Commission meeting, and it also was not finalized by the traffic engineer at that time. Part due to that and I think in part due to concerns of how many improvements were being required around the streets for this particular development on the Planning Commission ultimately disagree with staff's recommendation for continuous turn lane along the frontage of their projects Huntsville Road And instead just recommended some minor improvements at the Huntsville and Morningside Intersection as I mentioned that was improved approved by the Planning Commission with a vote of six to three and We did meet. The traffic study was actually completed after that meeting. And this item was appealed. Neighbors voiced their concerns about what their concerns were regarding traffic. And I think, honestly, that compelled the developer to sit down with us again even after their approval had gone through. They brought their finalized traffic study. And we were able to review that in detail and come to some conclusions based upon that new information What we're recommending now, and our city engineer here is as well to be able to discuss that in more detail, but we're recommending an extended turn lane. The developers agreed to do that from Huntsville eastward. I think it's about 200 feet. That would accomplish stacking and turning movements, turning if you're westbound on Huntsville Road, turning southbound on Morningside Drive. We also made a recommendation, which is reflected in the drawings, to continue the bicycle facilities that are within this area and to continue the pedestrian facilities that are in the area, the sidewalks that were recently constructed by the city's transportation department along the Huntsville Road frontage. So based on that meeting, staff and the applicant are in agreement with the recommendations here. We have provided Mr. Williams with some revised conditions approval should you choose to affirm the Planning Commission's recommendation. AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ALSO OUR CITY ENGINEER HERE IS HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STUDY. WE'VE ALSO ASKED THE APPLICANT'S ENGINEER TO BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STUDY AS WELL. IS THE APPLICANT HERE? Hi, Jesse. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Council. And thanks, Jeremy, for covering everything we've been through on this project. We did meet with city staff, the engineering staff. Our engineers and our traffic engineers came up to discuss this after the Planning Commission. There was some confusion, probably based on me pushing for this project to kind of get to the process, try to meet some timelines that we had. So I do apologize for that. But after sitting down and being able to look into this in detail, it was determined that the traffic The turn lanes on Huntsville Road were most appropriate there at the intersection. That's what we've essentially agreed to and what the Planning Commission supported. I think what the engineering staff has requested is that we extend the stacking distance within that turn lane, which we've agreed to do. We'll continue to work with the trails coordinator to make sure that those bicycle facilities stay in place, whether that be with the existing bicycle lanes or if they have some future plans to provide a side path, that we'd certainly be open to working with them on that. With that, we're in agreement and hope that you would approve our project and let us move forward with this. We're very excited about it. We think it's going to be a great development for this piece of property. As Jeremy stated, we've continued with our preservation of the two stream channels, as we stated we would, through the rezoning process, which was back this summer. I feel like we've continued to fall in line with all the requirements. Agreements and recommendations that we had again. We're excited our engineers are here if you have specific questions about the traffic study. Thank you Okay, Adele. Do you have anything? Actually not, Mayor. I brought this forward simply because there were a lot of residents who wanted to talk about it and were not happy that the decision was made as it was made with the Planning Commission. So I simply did it so that they could bring their ideas forward. Okay. All right. What questions do we have from the City Council for Jeremy or the applicant or anybody?
 Matthew. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I just want to make sure I got the bottom line of this right. So relative to what you recommended, the staff recommended, we'll see the trail right-of-way dedicated but the trail is not constructed, the street trails. The improvements to Huntsville Road are being limited to a turn lane at Morningside, 200-foot turn lane. and the traffic signal assessment doesn't come in until the final phase. That's correct. And the reason we're recommending that last one is simply because, Statutorily, if we take an assessment, any kind of exaction, we have to utilize that assessment for within a certain period of time, otherwise we refund those monies. This is a five-phase project, as you can see here on the map. Each color represents a different phase. The traffic study indicates that through the end of phase five, the traffic signal warrants still will not be met. And so we're recommending the assessment be done. be made at the last possible moment. Therefore, it will give us that five years following to continue looking at traffic in this area should the signal be needed. We've also committed, I met with one of the neighbors, and we've committed to continuing to look at that particular intersection regardless of this project and how fast it moves in order to understand when a signal can be warranted in this location. Okay, thank you. Okay, Sarah. Yes, this may be a stupid question, but I'm new tonight, so I'm going to ask it anyway. Did y'all go out on a tour of this? I mean, I've seen the property before and I just didn't know if you went out like with engineer and everybody just went through and looked at it like we used to on planning a I think the Planning Commission may have gone out to this one. The Council, I think, went individually for this site and the other one. We did discuss it at the agenda session, I believe, but I think the decision was made to just go individually. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay. So what we have is are we going to do an amendment first or are we going to? I'll be out here public comment before we do an amendment. All right. What public comment do we have on this? Please come up. Thank you, Your Honor, and thank you, Adela, for filing the appeal. We're concerned – I'm Ralph Nessen. I live on Morningside Drive. I've lived there for 37 years and have greatly appreciated the beauty of the Rose Farm. We've expected the property to be developed at some point or other. although the development will take place, we are very, very concerned about traffic safety. We're concerned about protection of wildlife in the 68 acre area. And I haven't heard anything tonight about the traffic light, other than that it would be postponed until some future moment. But if you come for a tour, and a visit to the corner of Morningside Drive and Huntsville Road at 7.30 in the morning, or at 4 to 4.30 in the afternoon, you will see that the traffic backs up considerably. If you're driving north on Morningside Drive and you want to take a left onto Huntsville Road, it's virtually impossible, and it's very, very dangerous. Cars speed down Morningside Drive. at much higher than a 25 mile per hour rate, which is the speed limit. And any vehicle that comes out of the development onto Huntsville Road, because there will be two entrances to the development from Huntsville Road, any vehicle that tries to take a left onto Huntsville Road at those times of days will be in considerable danger of an accident. So the residents of our Wood Avenue Morningside Drive Huntsville Road area asked that an additional warrant traffic analysis be performed to determine the amount of traffic speed and turning events on Huntsville Road and Morningside Drive we ask that the installation of a traffic light at the intersection of Huntsville Road and Morningside Drive be concurrent with the beginning of home construction and We ask that two turn lanes from Huntsville Road into the Park Meadows development be initiated and developed. We ask that a four-way stop sign be in place at the corner of Morningside and McClinton Street. One of the exits from the development on to Morningside is right at McClinton Street McClinton Street is a very narrow street with no sidewalks and the increase in traffic and we estimate that three to five hundred additional vehicles will be in the area and exiting the development when all of the 290 homes are eventually built and That street needs additional development and support to make it safe for the people who live on that street. We're very happy that there'll be trails developed within the development, and we're very happy about the park that will be there. We'll all enjoy that. We are also concerned about preservation of wildlife habitats and native plants within the development. You may not be aware that the American kestrel, a native falcon, nests in dead trees on that property. And if all the trees are taken away, there will be no habitat for that particular bird. We ask that a wildlife consultant be hired who can recommend proper habitat protection. And with all of these improvements, I think the safety of the neighborhood will be preserved, and we can all enjoy the beautiful neighborhood and community that we live in as long as it's safe intelligent planning is performed. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ralph. Kate. I'm Kate Conway. I live at 1007 Morningside Drive, and I have lived there for 37 years. Thank you all for hearing our appeal. I thank Adela Gray for... Submitting the appeal for our neighborhood. I want to also say that I appreciate the help sitting planning staff has given us as well as kit Williams help and explanation of terminology in the appeal process. I also appreciate how accessible the members of the city council have been, that I actually called the men and women on the council, and I was totally delighted that they actually answered their phones and I could talk directly to them. That was pretty amazing. encouraging in terms of their commitment. So Adele Gray, Matthew Perry, Sarah Bunch, Justin Tennant, and John Latour who called me back several times trying to get in touch with me, we were playing phone tag and he really wanted to make sure that we spoke. So thank you, Council Members, for your help and your concern. So I have some, I don't want to repeat everything that Ralph said, but I do have several concerns. I'm going to talk about three things very briefly. The need, as has been expressed for the warrant traffic analysis, I think that it's really important to have. a clear traffic analysis done. I would really like to, as Ralph did, invite all members of the council to drive down Huntsville Road during the high traffic time, to drive up Morningside Drive from north to south, and see what it's like to try to turn onto the street, as Ralph mentioned. Once you do this a few times, you will experience clearly what our concerns are. And this is before the addition of 300 to 600 new cars. in the area. So I think light is really absolutely needed, not later at the end of the construction, but well before that happens. The second concern about Park Meadows is the same again. Both streets that are already there in our neighborhood, Fair Lane and McClinton streets, will go into the development. And so there will be a tremendous amount of traffic coming in and out in our very small neighborhood. We have a little small neighborhood there from Morningside to Wood Avenue. It's a very walkable neighborhood. It's kind of a secluded neighborhood, which it's not going to be anymore once this happens, of course. But it's very walkable right now. And without sidewalks on McClinton Street, as has been mentioned, it will be very, very dangerous. And the walkability will be in question. So that, I'm very concerned about that. We'd like to see a four-way stop there at McClinton and Morningside to stop the traffic coming and slow the traffic down. And again, also the question of preservation of wildlife is my third concern. I brought this issue up at the Planning Commission meeting, and it was kind of turned into a joke. But I think anyone who lives in Fayetteville knows that the, the wildlife problem exists now already with increased development happening all over the city. Wildlife is losing its habitat and we really need to look at this issue. I think it's it is seen as a joke or it's ignored but It's happening. We all know that. We see deer in our front yard, fox in parts of town where there didn't used to be fox before. It's a huge issue, and something really needs to be done about it. So in the development area, in that 68 acres at the old roast farm, there are deer, fox, coyotes. There are geese. There are rabbits, possums, other small animals, and many, many birds because we're on a migration path right through there. So I don't think this can be ignored and the environmental impact really needs to be considered about just placing or killing many of these animals. I have a few other concerns I want to share with the council in regard to the Park Meadows development. I left the Planning Commission meeting on November 28th, and I have to say that I was really stunned not only by the decision of the Commission, but also that when the decision was made, it seemed that the main concern was the cost to the developer of taking care of some of these issues. And I don't think the developer having to pay additional money for safety features that were recommended by the city staff should be the main concern. What was stunning to me was that the planning staff does not seem to have the power or authority to require developers to put into place necessary needs for safety. This is an issue I believe the City Council should seriously consider. When it comes to concerns about safety and the environment, it seems that the city staff should have the authority to require developers to meet certain standards, regardless of the cost to the developer. As our city continues to grow, we need to keep our top priorities, these things as our top priorities, the issues of safety, the issues of the environment, and the beauty of our town. Thank you. Thank you, Kate. Thank you. Hi, I'm Kathleen Lehman. I'm a resident of the neighborhood that's been shown on the screen. I live on South Janelle Avenue, which is parallel to Morningside and Wood Avenue. So one of the intersections that I'd like to bring up, which hasn't been mentioned tonight, is the intersection of Wood and its suburbs. Still MLK at that point Huntsville, but it's that it's that main road That is right now a four four-way stop Intersection gets very backed up and part of what makes turning from Huntsville on to Morningside so difficult is that four-way stop just creates this one at a time trickle and which makes it nearly impossible to find a way in between those cars to turn on De Mourning's side during the times that Ralph already mentioned. So that intersection, if there is going to be more of a traffic study, I know Jeremy already mentioned that some of that has been done, but that intersection that includes wood, would be, would need to be looked at as well, because that's a very, it's very busy at times, and if you are coming from the south and turning west, the visibility on that corner is very difficult. So there have been times I've been at that stop sign and nearly hit, as someone doesn't either stop fully at that, at that intersection, or isn't looking, clearly. So that was one point I wanted to make about that intersection. That's another one to kind of keep on your radar as they're considering this. Another thing I wanted to bring up, I know that bike lanes had been mentioned as a part of the development or the neighborhood. That would also need to include McClinton. I live right on that corner, and the number of bikes that come through on McClinton, because it is a less busy road than Huntsville... It's a lot every day, especially on the weekends. We have groups of bikers go by so that right now as Ralph mentioned McClinton does not have sidewalks does not have bike lanes is a very narrow street But like I said because of reduced traffic compared to Huntsville right now it gets the bike traffic So however that is developed you'd want to make sure that the bike lists are still able to come through that way. I And the third thing I wanted to say, and Ralph and Kate have already mentioned it, but the section that we're looking at for development here is huge for wildlife. Deer, which come and eat in my garden, which I'm okay with, but deer live there. There's a lot of birds. I've definitely heard it's either coyotes or foxes in that area. the greenery as it is is really, we'll be losing something when we develop this. And like Ralph said, we kinda understand that development will come, or probably will come at some point, but understand that we will be losing some important habitat there. So thank you Adele for doing this appeal so that we could voice our concerns. Thank you. Okay, thank you. My name is Robert Billig, 539 McClinton. I've heard most of the discussion about getting in and out of the project and not very much about what the goal is of taking traffic in and out of there, and that is to get them into the center of Fayetteville, either to College or to 6th Street. The previous speaker mentioned the intersection of Wood and Huntsville Road, which is already a problem. More traffic is coming as... Communities to the east of us continue to grow. So Elkins and beyond, there is construction going on there, and those people are going to be funneling through the same place. There are only two routes into town, 15th Street and Huntsville Road. To provide entry and exit on Huntsville Road is essential. But what happens to all those cars? They come to the corner of Wood and Huntsville Street. And it's a log jam. Part of the solution seems to be to make McClinton Wood be a conduit, but it ends up at the same place. With no benefit to the residents of our community, these 300 houses can drive their cars through our community, becomes a throughway, excuse me, a thoroughfare. So what was a quiet, peaceful community becomes a heavily trafficked one. If you deny McClinton Wood as an egress, everybody still has to end up on 15th Street or Huntsville Road. It seems to Travesty to let all that traffic come through an established residential area. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Hello, my name is Stan Lancaster. I've been in Fayetteville since 1952. I've lived on Morningside Drive for the last 27 years. And I'm not anti-development. I knew when I bought the property 27 years ago, the same thing would happen there as happened to my family when they bought property on 15th Street back in the 60s. It was just a matter of time. And I am glad to see that it is now focused on single-family homes as opposed to a combination of apartments, which I just see as potential being slums of the future. But I do have some concerns, some already covered. I'd like to reinforce the utility of installing a traffic signal ahead of time now at Morningside and Huntsville because it is extremely difficult, as has been mentioned, to get out around that corner for approximately six to eight hours of the day. I have been— almost physically attacked. I had a guy run me off the road because I turned on the morning side when I could just barely see the top of, I mean, turned on to Huntsville, turning, heading west, when I could just barely see the top of his truck. I just didn't take into account that he was doing 50 miles an hour. And so it's a very tricky place to turn. And there is very little left in terms of common courtesy. Everybody's in a hurry. Nobody stops to let you out. I sit there every morning. That's how I get to work. And I have to jump to get out in front of cars and put myself at risk. Either that or I sit there for 10 minutes. And I think putting a light in ahead of time, It will save you time and trouble and money. Postponing it is, as the English would say, penny wise and pound foolish. It would also alleviate some of the problem at the four-way stop at Wood and Huntsville, which is also I go through every day That's a four-way stop So people already have to stop come to a complete stop to get through that intersection from all four directions If you put another three-way stop at Morningside It's just going to make that problem that much worse if you put in a light ahead of time that will regulate Traffic and allow the flow at the four-way stop to go ahead a bit more unimpeded the next issue I mean, I'm a squirrely guy. I like turtles, okay? I rescue turtles. I've got one in my house now that I'm wintering because it's a nice big female ornamental box turtle that was, her hind legs were run over and she was trying to cross Morningside Drive. So, and the wildlife, there are, as stated, there are, the coyotes don't come through near as much as they used to but they still come through some. Deer are constantly moving through there. I've seen foxes. raccoons, possums, armadillos, you know, some of them are nuisance animals, but roadrunners. I've seen various forms of bird life and I just hope that the city will allow for someone to assess what is best to maintain the viability of wildlife in that part of town. It's something I've always enjoyed. All the hawks as well. And something that's never been mentioned, I, you know, Fayetteville The Battle of Fayetteville came across that property up to the courthouse. And the troops fired down from where the old courthouse is now, down into Tin Cup and along Coal Creek, or the creek that runs through there. And with a 30-year-old cheap metal detector, a friend of mine found lead mini balls and artifacts civil Indian artifacts in my front yard I would like to suggest that someone do at least a cursory archaeological survey on that property just so we'll know what it is that we're we're putting under houses and Again, I do appreciate the opportunity to Address these issues. I Have a little bit of a jaundiced view as I say, I've lived on the south side of Fayetteville all my life It's been my perception and many of my neighbors, and it's been reinforced many times over the years, that the south side of Fayetteville generally gets kind of railroaded and gets a short shrift where we have other people making decisions for us as to what's best for us. And again, you know, that's just a personal opinion, but I would hope that we can continue to make Fayetteville one of the top growing, top desirable places to live in the United States. And it's the details that will make that more possible. So again, thanks for your time. Thank you. Who else would like to address this on this in the public? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the council. Let me ask a couple of questions here. Chris, let me ask you about the traffic light. Have you all looked into that? I should have already got you up here. Yes, the traffic study that was presented by the developers was presented by the developers. indicates that a signal is not warranted, so there's not enough traffic there for a signal. That's based on projected traffic counts. It's based on assumptions of where people are going to go as they enter and leave the development. So typically what we do in situations when we're making decisions as a city is, as we look at actual traffic counts. So as the development occurred, even though it shows that it's not warranted, as the development builds out, if we do see that a signal is needed there and it is warranted, it meets the traffic thresholds, then we could consider adding a signal there. Okay. Let's see what else. Okay. Okay. So do you think, in your opinion, that the improvements that we're about to make with the extended turning lanes, you think that will be adequate?
 Yes. Essentially what we looked at with the developer, what we asked them to do was ignore the fact that there are two other entrances on Huntsville Road. that people could turn left at. And the concern that staff had was the left turn movements off of Huntsville Road with 12 or 13,000 vehicles per day that travel through there. You have a two lane road, you introduce left turning movements and you have a lot of opposing traffic. Folks have to sit there for a while. You have an increased risk of rear end accidents. An increased risk of t-bone type accidents as well as people are trying to turn left in small gaps So this would you know if there is a situation where we do feel like there's a safety concern with left turns at these proposed streets We could sign that no left turn at certain times of day or all the time no left turn into those streets and And and have the folks go down to the Morningside intersection where they do have a turning line, so that was kind of a philosophy behind behind the additional turn lane length to provide for that if that need occurs Okay, just any of the council have any questions Yeah, John Chris. I want to go back to the red light issue. I How do we determine, is it a mathematical formula? There's so many cars and we have to have a light or explain that process for us. Essentially as there are multiple warrants that we look at and it's basically the amount of traffic that we have, it's on an hourly basis. So if it meets the traffic levels during a certain number of hours during the day, then a signal is warranted. And that's essentially what it is. It's a mathematical calculation. How many situations over the last year or two where we actually did the calculations and it indicated a light was warranted and we did not install a light? Have there been situations like that? I'm trying to think of a situation... where we do have locations where a signal may be warranted. I don't know of one where we actually did a study and there was a need for a signal where the signal was not put in. So we're pretty diligent. If our calculations say we need one, we'll get one put in. I would say typically yes. What's the lag time from the time we determine it's needed to the time it's actually operating? You're talking weeks, months? Yeah, I would say probably six months to begin design, get the equipment procured, get a contractor in place to do the work. If we do it in-house with transportation crews, they can do it probably quicker than that, probably three to four months. The equipment lead time and the poles typically take 90 to 120 days so that's our that's our minimum amount of time a typical red light cost how much money contractor price is about 150,000 if we do it in house with staff it could be more around the hundred thousand range those numbers always impressed me thank you okay yes Chris for you please do you Do you know exactly when the study was done? Because what I hear the citizens saying is, you know, it's the traffic times of the day that are so dangerous. Yes. Yes, the study, I don't know what the dates were, but it would have been at least a 24-hour count or maybe multiple days. I could look in the traffic study and give you better detail of when the actual counts were taken, but typical traffic study, we're going to take multiple days of counts and use those counts to do the analysis. And so you can assure us without any, question that the traffic times were looked at and considered yes yes okay thank you I think we have adequate counts yes okay okay any other questions for Chris may I ask one question sure do you look at the level of use of that intersection to like we've heard that it's very very difficult to turn left is that looked at in this particular study too about how what the wait times are Well, that's a different analysis than the signal warrant. You can look at level of service analysis, which is a measure of delay at an intersection. And that level of service is, again, just a different analysis than the signal warrant. I believe the traffic study shows that there are adequate levels of service even after the development. So that's what the study shows. indicates as a final analysis. But if we did another study after the development was actually there and they weren't just estimating, would that help us decide to do a traffic signal there if there was really inadequate service? What happens with this type of development, because there are multiple entrances and multiple exits, there has to be an assumption made as to which way people are going to go when they come into and leave the development. if those assumptions by the traffic engineer proved to be incorrect, if there's some reason that all the cars want to go some other direction and the actual counts are something different than what's projected, then we would look at that at that point. Okay. Anybody else? All right. Thank you, Chris. Okay. What do you all want to do? Well, if there's no further public comment, I did draft a resolution that was requested by planning after they basically came to a better agreement with the applicant. And so you all need to consider a couple things here. Number one, the burden is on the appealer in order to overturn the planning commission, which normally then the resolution always says resolution to approve the appeal and deny the application. In this particular case, I drafted a different sort of resolution to reflect the agreement with the additional conditions that Planning and the applicant have agreed to. And so if your decision will be to approve this resolution with the new conditions, then there needs to be a motion to amend to this. I will say if it's amended to this and then this resolution fails, then we're really back to the original amendment because I noticed we only have five aldermen left. I think Sickness, unfortunately, has encountered or taken some of the other aldermen away. You've noticed them sneezing and coughing. So we're down to five aldermen and the mayor, and it takes five, preferably, votes to pass any resolution. So it would require all the aldermen or four of the aldermen and the mayor to pass anything. So I just need you to keep that in consideration, but not to pass the amendment. The amendment can be passed. on a vote of four, four to two. So that you could pass the amendment without being able to pass a resolution, which makes me a little concerned because really the burden is on Adela Gray and as the appellant to win the resolution vote. I don't know what you want to do. And I don't know if, Jeremy, if you want to say anything else. I do think this is a, if you do intend to approve a change in the preliminary plan to what Jeremy has suggested, then you would need to amend to this resolution. And so, or do you? Jeremy, you don't have anything. I think the only thing I would add is that the recommended changes, The resolution adds conditions of approval that bring the project closer in line to what we were originally recommending. So there are additional improvements that are recommended with these added conditions of approval. The change, it does delay. We had originally recommended the traffic signal assessment be paid out over time. We're recommending it be at the end, so that we could hopefully utilize those funds to construct a signal if it's warranted within five years after that last phase. So that's why we're recommending these changes. You could certainly add these amendments and also vote the resolution down at some point in time, but we would recommend if that is the feeling, we go back to the applicant and discuss what other options there may be. particularly given that three older persons have left. Thank you. I guess I should say that actually right now you're in the driver's seat, Jesse. Until you get this appeal granted, then the planning commission's conditions will, they approved your preliminary plan, and so that would remain approved. Just so the audience might know, let me read a little bit of the body of this resolution where it was changed so that they know what you would be thinking about here. It says the City Council would grant the appeal of City Councilmember Della Gray, but approves preliminary plat 16-56 42 Park Meadows pursuant to the conditions approved by the Planning Commission except that condition number two will require that an extended turn lane shall be constructed by the applicant along Huntsville Road from the intersection with Morningside Drive toward the east and as depicted on the attached exhibit and as described in the most recent staff memo attached to this agenda item, and amends condition three to require the traffic signal assessment of $18,000, shall not be due until the final plan is approved for the final phase of the project. And as Jeremy explained, I actually recommended this delay in this $18,000 because I didn't want to lose the money. And our understanding was that the warrant to be able to build the traffic signal might not even be available and sufficient and proved yet. Even when this development's fully developed, and so if it, if we could at least then have that $18,000 if the warrant would be approved in the future after that. So that's why I recommended delaying it until the last time so we'd have that money as long as possible. But that's what the amended resolution would say in its body. That would be the operative facts. Mm-hmm. Jesse, did you want to speak? Just clarification. I was sitting back there and my head was spinning. I just wanted to make sure. On the resolution, that would be the first item that the council would vote on, and that resolution would be to approve the development with the planning commission conditions with the changes noted in the new staff report. The first thing they would need to do is decide to amend to that resolution, and then after that they could vote on it. It would be an amendment and then the resolution to approve with the new conditions. Okay. Thank you, Kit. Thank you. Well, Mayor, I would... Matthew's on the floor. Excuse me. Go ahead, Adele. Go ahead. I was just going to say that I would make the motion that we pass this resolution, which we have in our hands. No, you want to amend to the resolution. I want to amend to this resolution. Thank you. OK. John? I second that motion, Mayor. OK, we have a motion and a second to amend this to the resolution, correct? I want to be sure we're all clear on that. Go ahead, Justin. And then we will amend first. And then we'll decide. And this amendment was we drafted as soon as we could, as soon as we heard there was an agreement. It was sent out to you this afternoon. And then you have a copy in front of you. Okay. It's usually past the first meeting before I get real confused. But this one, first one of the year. Good to hear you, Wade. All right. All right, John. I want the audience to know that this is the best you can hope for. Well, I know you may not like it, but if we don't do anything, then the Planning Commission rules. That stands. So we need to move ahead with something to give you some relief. I'm sorry, but we're doing this to try to accommodate everybody. And it's hard to keep all the balls in the air and keep everybody happy, but we'll try to do that. Okay. Any other discussion on the amendment? All right. Sergeant, would you please call the roll? Batch. And this is just to amend the resolution? Yes, ma'am. This is on the amendment. Yes. Lutcher. Yes. Gray. Yes. Petty. No. Bennett. Yes. Yes. Okay, since it's not an actual resolution or ordinance at this point, the four votes win, and so it is now amended to the resolution in front of you. Okay. What discussion do we have on the amended resolution in front of us? Okay. Matthew. Yes, I have a question for Kit. Am I reading this correctly? Now with the amended version, if we grant the appeal, then the – plat approval the plat is approved we deny the appeal the appeal the plat is approved yeah it that's that's basically right if you if you don't want these additional conditions on it you can there could be a motion if you want to well I always put the burden on on the applicant because that's changing something which is right now the preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning Commission with the conditions that the Planning Commission set forward on it So if this resolution fails, just like if the first resolution had failed, then that will stand and these new conditions won't apply to that preliminary plat. So it's – I don't know if you – that's what you understand too, is that correct? Yes, and prior to amendment, if the resolution had passed, the plat would have been denied, correct?
 Correct. Yes, if you failed to approve the original resolution, the plat would still be approved. If you approved the original resolution that said it denied and rejected the plat, then, in fact, you could reverse the planning commission's decision, and it would be denied at that point in time. Okay, thank you. Okay, now let me get this straight. Now that this is amended, If we vote no and the appeal fails, then we go back to the original? No. If the appeal fails, then the Planning Commission's final decision will remain just as it left the Planning Commission. But if the amended passes, then we get changes to what the original said, correct? Yeah, but the amendment did succeed, so it has been amended. I know. And, you know, I guess there could be a motion for another amendment if there is simply, you know, if you believe that there should be a different resolution before you, Alderman Petty, I saw you voted no. So if that reflects your decision that you feel like the planning commission should be So anyway, this is... Okay. So vote yes is to approve what we just amended then? Yes. If there's a motion to approve this resolution, then it will be to approve the resolution as we amend it. I got it. So to be clear, Mayor, to everyone, you basically passed an amendment that does not allow the appeal to be denied. passing this appeal will still approve the thing with additional conditions. The only way for you to go back and have the option to either deny it or to grant it would be for someone in the majority to have reconsidered that last vote. That's true. Let me also say the reason it's worded this way is that if we don't grant the appeal, we can't change the conditions. So in order to change the conditions to what the planning department has negotiated with the applicant, we have to grant the appeal. Otherwise, It's just like the Planning Commission has decided. So if you wanted to change any conditions, the first step you had to do was to grant the appeal so then it's in front of you so that you can then change the conditions. And so you voted up or down? Yes. Everybody got that? Mm-hmm. All right. Yes, Adele. Yes, Adele. And Mayor, I want to make the point that the resolution and the changes and the discussion that has gone on is exactly the reason that I did the appeal. And so I feel very good about that. Thank you. Okay. Any other final comments before we vote? All right. Has everybody got it now? Matthew, I'm sorry. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I'm not sure at all. If I'm asked to vote tonight, what I would have done if I had the option to overturn the Planning Commission's decision. I don't, I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way this has developed through the amendment. I would greatly prefer to table this so that I'm not a swing vote, so to speak, because I would consider not voting given that the original choice has been removed. If I'm asked to vote tonight, I can only say that given the two choices, which is to impose one extra condition on the applicant relevant to what the Planning Commission said, you know, I would feel obligated to vote yes because it's better. This is highly unusual to amend an appeal like in this manner and I would prefer to table it so that I wasn't required to vote in a way that wasn't consistent with the way this was put on the agenda. So we could make a motion to table. I'll do so now to table it for two weeks. Okay. Do we have a second on the table? I'm not quite ready to second, but I'm not for rushing something through. And the more discussion we have, I think the better. But of course, we don't want to beat a dead horse, too. Let me ask you, is there a problem with the plat, Matthew, from your perspective? Yes. Okay. So you want to change the plat? I would have preferred from the very beginning to continue the process of negotiation. The position that we're in now is either vote to impose one extra condition or vote to go with the original planning commission conditions. When this was brought forward it was vote to overturn the planning commission determination or not to. You know, I've made the motion. If there's not a second, we'll have the vote, and I'll vote like I said. Thank you. All right. Do we have a second? John. Justin. well before i say anything i i do want to say that i talked to several people who were concerned about several of the details that would be discussed tonight and they appreciated adela bringing it forward and so uh i've already been on record saying that i was a little confused and That's not necessarily out of the norm, but I can tell you that I feel a little more confused than normal. And it's not that anybody did anything wrong, and I don't really feel that way. But I do think at this point that it warrants a full councilor, or at least more than what we have. to both discuss it and to vote on it. I would want to vote on this at a future meeting. I'm not saying it's a two week situation, but I'm hoping that this does not hurt the developers planning too much if they don't if we delay it for, at this point, indefinite amount of time, because I don't think you put a timeframe on anything. I think I said two weeks. Did you say two weeks? If you did, I didn't hear you. I apologize. But I would be willing to hear from the developer on the question of whether or not it was very detrimental to delay it for one more meeting. Hey, Jess, you're on the spot. Yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean, Extending the time of a project, and we started this back in October as far as the review process. So we're in our fourth month here, so it's certainly been kind of slow going. I certainly don't want the council members to vote on something that they're not comfortable with. What I would ask for, at least before the end of the meeting, is maybe some direction as to some changes maybe that we are overlooking or that we could discuss with staff or with the council. A lot of this from the planning commission, from some of the misunderstandings at the planning commission, was the amount of time that staff had to look, which again was my fault, how much time that they had to look at the findings of the traffic report and as it relates to the turn lanes on Huntsville Road. Once they had the opportunity to look at the warrants for the turn lanes on Huntsville Road and how much traffic is actually turning in, again, it's a handful of vehicles that would be utilizing these turn lanes at a cost of over $200,000 for these types of improvements. you know we all came to the same uh... nation that those traffic said or this the stern lanes really are warranted but to put one at at the intersection with a majority of traffic is turning as well as the term in the room be installing for northbound traffic on morningside drive provide a lot of benefit in that area uh... and again will we will be putting money towards the traffic signal at the points where hopefully we want to that money can be utilized so uh... that's in addition to the to uh... very that we'll be doing in Morningside Drive, etc, etc, etc. I don't want to beat a dead horse, as was stated earlier. If two weeks is what it takes, yeah, absolutely, it is difficult. When you're holding property under contract and you're trying to maintain that contract and meet those deadlines and you're spending money with your engineers, yes, time is a challenge. But if we can come to some sort of solution here and make sure that everyone's on the same page, I think we could live with two more weeks if we can get maybe a little bit more direction tonight. Have you got any direction for them, Matthew, and what you'd like to see? I'm sorry, Justin, you were... I'll just say really quick, I do appreciate what you've brought forward and the fact that you're willing to invest money, which you would necessarily have to do. So it's not that I don't appreciate it, and it's not that I don't think that this is a pretty good idea. 4 months is a long time. I would just say that if something happens in this location, it will change the landscape of that spot and that area for the next several decades. So I think it does warrant a couple of weeks. I will second this motion, but I want you to know in no way am I saying that this is that you haven't been very, very, very good at working with us. So I do appreciate that. Okay, so we have a motion to second the table. All right, Matthew, let's go back to you. Now we can discuss it, I assume. Yeah, I just, in answer to your question, I'd be happy to talk with you more. I have a range of concerns. So probably the best we can point and talk to Matt. Give me a call tomorrow. Okay, sounds good. Okay, Sarah. Oh, Justin, you're on the floor. Oh, I apologize. Okay, Sarah. i was going to say i i am in support of tabling this also because i feel it's an I don't need to hold this down the whole time. It's an unusual situation for me just coming on tonight, even though I've read over everything with the amendment and everything. It's a little confusing for me. And since we're shorthanded, I feel like I'm behind the eight ball to make a decision here, and I'd really rather table it. So I'm in support of that. Thank you. Okay.
 Adele. I'm generally in support. Thank you. I'm generally in support of giving plenty of time, but maybe it's because I'm in Ward 1 and I've gotten all the calls, but I feel like we've talked and talked and talked, and I think it's pretty evident that our attorney and the planning staff has reviewed all of this. And, you know, and I really... And furthermore, I won't be here in two weeks. So are we going to vote on it tonight for me or I won't vote on it if you vote on it in two weeks? And that's fine. I understand that. But I really do hate to hold our developer any longer that he cannot make a decision and move on with planning. I think what we see here is a development that we very, very much need in South Fayetteville. And none of us wants to give up beautiful green space. None of us wants to increase the traffic problems. But those are problems we have. And we have sat here meeting after meeting and listened about how we need affordable housing in Fayetteville. And this is affordable housing. And so I personally would like to see us vote tonight, but I'll, of course, do what the council says. Thank you. Okay. Now, Ralph, give one turn to Mike unless the council member brings you back up. Yes, Mayor, I would like to bring Ralph back. All righty then. Ralph, come right on up. I would like to thank the council for deliberating on this important issue. And to agree to discuss this within the next two weeks. I would like to ask on behalf of all the folks that are here who have spoken and who live in the neighborhood that a representative of the neighborhood, someone who lives in the Wood, Morningside, Huntsville, Road area be included in the discussions within the next two weeks Because it's people who live in the neighborhood who are directly affected by the traffic increase By everything that's going to happen. We know it's going to happen But we want it to happen in the very best way possible And if you would include someone from our neighborhood from the community in these discussions, I think it will be much better all around for everyone concerned. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Now we're, Sarah. Oh, sorry. Adele. No? Okay. Y'all are messing with me tonight. All right. All right. Now we're voting on the tabling right now. Okay. All right. Any other final comments? All right. Senator, would you please call the roll? Butch. Yes. Latere. Yes. Ray. No. Teddy. Yes. Kenneth. Yes. Okay, we're taking it. That passed. Two weeks. All right. All righty. Moving right along. And if you enjoyed that, thank you all for coming out. Okay, number eight. A resolution to grant the appeal of City Council Member Adele Gray and to deny preliminary Platte 16-5574 Mountain Vista Subdivision because such development would create or compound a dangerous traffic condition in violation of 166.02C of the Unified Development Code. staff I do like the item before this this is a property in the south side of Fayetteville North of the Fayetteville Country Club on the east side of Country Club Drive The property is about 54 acres currently contains a large single-family home it's owned RSF for which is residential single-family four units per acre and The property connects to Country Club Drive via currently a private drive called ASCU Drive. The entire property, as you can see on this map, is within the hillside, hilltop overlay district, which brings with it several different additional requirements on development. There's an additional tree preservation requirement. There's additional footing and foundation requirements that are required. All homes have to have an engineered foundation. There's also a required grading permit associated with these particular properties, and so it's a process we go through during the building permit process as well as the development process. The proposal here is to develop a 52-lot single-family subdivision. This is the plan for that subdivision located on the 54 acres. As you can see, the north and western sides, which are... here, quite wooded area, very steep slopes, in excess of 20% are – this large piece of property is planned to remain undeveloped essentially at this point in time. The lots that are planned to develop are on the flatter parts of the property. Access to Country Club Drive via that ASCU drive, which is the current access point, I'll show you in just a moment. The Planning Commission and Subdivision Committee also considered this item. There were several members of the public that also spoke. This particular item is not necessarily about the improvements that staff is recommending or the Planning Commission were recommending, but rather the real or perceived site distances and issues here relative to the proposed access to Country Club Drive. As you can see, the property also has an access here to South College Drive, which is a residential street located so this neighborhood would connect to the existing neighborhoods, which is part of the city's policies. Okay. The Planning Commission voted to approve this project. It was a split vote of five to three. And there are a number of conditions that were associated with that approval. There were a couple of variance requests for block length. We oftentimes see this in neighborhoods that are developed with significant topography. We did recommend street improvements, essentially off-site sidewalks, to connect to the existing sidewalks in the area and require this development to be connected to that as well. um parkland dedication fees in lieu are recommended for the new single family homes some new right of way dedication and then of course everything within the development would have to meet city codes As mentioned as the last item, Ms. Gray also appealed this particular pulmonary plat approval in a timely fashion to the city clerk's office on behalf of neighboring residents, and that information is included in your packet. We also included the minutes, as we did at the last item, about the discussion. It centered— around primarily two issues, water service, water pressure. One of the conditions actually that was added to this preliminary plat was prior to final plat, the water pressure shall be tested to ensure compliance with fire flow requirements. We have done that as a city staff on a couple of different occasions. There were actually significant improvements done at the bottom of this hill. in the very recent past to improve Pressure in this area and our utilities director can speak to that in more detail if you if you would like We also have our Marshall and fire chief here to speak to any of those fire flow issues should you wish to? Speak in detail, but suffice it to say it meets all of our requirements exceeds all of our requirements for a residential neighborhood development with regard to fire flow and water pressure and with the addition of the new homes that are planned. The second item that was discussed was the access to Country Club Drive. And I can show you that here. I think this – document. So country club, excuse me, drive as you go up, um, has a significant slope, particularly as you turn the curve here. This is the private drive of, um, ask you drive. This is also where the planned, um, access is. It's at the crest of the hill, which in theory is the best place. If you access further down the hill, which is where if you go further north, you continue following the hill downhill. the speed at which vehicles travel and at which the distance at which it's required to stop increases generally. And so that was the concern. We did review this based on the posted speed at the time of the Planning Commission. Our staff engineer, Corey Granderson, is here as well as our city engineer, Chris Brown, to speak to that in detail. It did meet the AASHTO standards for stopping distance at a posted speed limit. We don't have any specific city ordinances about that. These are simply guidelines based on road designs, but it did meet those guidelines as well. Part of the request following that meeting was to review actual speeds, because we heard from neighbors that there was speeding within the neighborhood. We did conduct some speed studies, Those did come in before this meeting, so we were able to analyze those and provide some information, and I'll have Chris do that at this time. Thank you, Jeremy. As Jeremy mentioned, there was our initial review of the stopping site distance at the intersection was based on the speed limit, which is 25 miles per hour. Stopping site distance was adequate. And for those of you who aren't familiar, stopping site distance is basically the distance that if there's an object in the road or some obstruction, that the time required, the distance required for a person who's driving on the street at a certain speed to see that object get stopped before they hit it. So that's essentially what stopping sight distance is. So in this case if somebody's pulling out of the this new street entrance and somebody's coming along Country Club Drive they see the car pulling out they need a certain distance to be able to stop so they don't hit that vehicle coming out. So, again, looking at stopping site distance for 25 miles per hour, which is the posted speed, there was adequate distance. We took some traffic counts and speeds on, let's see, December 20th through December 22nd of this year. Use those speeds those counts to determine the 85th percentile speed and that's defined as a speed At which 85% of the drivers are at or below so 85% of the people will be going below the 85th percentile speed Which for the northbound direction? It's determined to be 33.8 miles per hour. So almost 9 miles per hour over the speed limit and for the northbound direction. The southbound direction is 29 and a half miles per hour. So looking at that, the southbound direction, that stopping site distance is not a concern. It meets the requirement. However, the northbound, because of the higher operating speeds of vehicles, the measured site distance of 218 feet, and the required site distance of 228 feet. So more site distance is required than we have available and that's a situation where you can't have accidents if folks pull out. So essentially when you have a site distance issue, you have two things that you can do. You can increase the site distance with geometry changes, moving the street as Jeremy mentioned. to find a better place on the roadway or to decrease the speeds. And we have looked at some options to decrease speeds. I'm not going to go into detail of those unless you all would like, but I can answer any questions. What questions do we have for Chris? John? Could I suggest a third possibility, put a three-way stop sign in there? Make everybody stop, take turns. That actually was one of the items, and it could only be a, well, it could be a three-way stop. It would only be necessary to make it a two-way stop. So the northbound traffic and then the intersecting traffic would ask you. But, yes, that absolutely would resolve the issue. Okay. Thank you. Adele. Yes, Chris, would you please discuss with us any other speed control ideas? Sure, yeah, the stop condition, as I noted previously, is one option, basically add a stop sign. As a perspective, there is an existing situation on North Street and Hillcrest Drive. If you guys have ever driven that, that's a two-way stop. So one direction of North Street has to stop. The other direction does not. So this would be essentially that very same situation. Construction of a roundabout at the location could be done. kind of a little bit steep and kind of a small area. So some retaining walls and other things may need to be done. So the relative cost of that, you know, would be higher than some of the other solutions. But that is an option. And then other lane width reductions, other horizontal deflections, There are multiple things in the traffic calming toolbox that can be looked at to try to reduce the speeds coming down the hill there. I would not recommend vertical deflection, also known as speed tables, just because of the steepness of the street and the curvature. We don't feel like that would be a safe situation, but there are other traffic calming items that could be considered. And, again, as Jeremy mentioned, relocation of the intersection is a final option, but I don't really believe that's feasible because I think the more you move down the hill, the speeds are going to increase, which increases the stopping site distance, so you're kind of defeating the purpose. Thank you. Okay, any other questions for Chris? Mayor, I would like to make a point. There was some discussion about connecting to another street that the property has – No, that's what I was going to ask. Technically has access to. This is, I believe, 22nd Street, which dead ends places. It's only about 12 feet wide at the end of the street, but it does access the property. There's a gate at the end. However, as I had pulled up here – There's considerable slope. You can tell starting about right here, the slope gets really pretty steep. It's in excess of 22% to get down to that street. We would not recommend a street be constructed at that slope. So we don't believe it's a feasible connection nor a safe connection to get down to 22nd. So we don't believe that's an option that's on the table, even though if it were, that would be obviously another thing to look at. But we don't believe that's a feasible option that's on the table at this point in time. And Mr. Mayor, I need to say that even if that was an option, that would not deny the applicant his right to access 24th Street because he has a right to access 24th Street as a property interest just that we cannot take away without compensation. So any additional street access... Number one probably wouldn't be used since it's so steep But also it would not solve the problem that we're looking at right now with the intersection into 24th Street Okay, any other questions for Chris? I'd like to ask some questions about the water pressure. Who's got that? I've gotten several I'm sure you all have too about the water pressure. What improvements did we make and how is the water pressure in that area? Well, at the 24th Street Pump Station we did install three new fire flow pumps and two service pumps. Since we can't put an elevated storage tank because of the close, approximately to the airport we had to put just constant pressure pumps there. The highest point up there by the country club is where you would test the water for drop in pressure when you're opening fire hydrants. If you drop below 20 psi, then that is against the health department rules. You can't have a water system below 20 psi. We ran the fire flow test twice, opening up two hydrants. We only dropped by 20 pounds down to about 60 pounds of pressure, 40 to 60 pounds of pressure. So we didn't drop any danger level there. The fire marshal will have to speak to the fire flow standards. Okay. Would the fire marshal like to comment on that? Or the chief, however you all want to work it. This is Harley Hantz, our fire marshal, and he knows a lot more about this than I do. Okay. All right, Harley. Yes, sir. So fire flow? Yeah. Harley, for the folks at home, could you pull the mic up so it's close to you? Yes. Thank you. Is that better? Based on the water flow that we were provided from Tim and the water department, there's adequate flow to support single-family dwellings up there up to 3,600 square feet. Anything over that square footage, there's not significant flow for that. So the fire code puts... minimum requirements upon What water is available? And you have to stay underneath that square footage requirement based upon what water you've got available So so there is adequate flow up there to to the house of that size Okay up to 3,600 square feet. I You can away around that if you want to exceed 3,600 square feet Those houses can be sprinkled And then that that requirement is met through residential sprinkler systems, and it's certainly available There's adequate water on top of the mountain therefore to supply for residential sprinklers Okay, any questions for the yes, John I? When you say sprinkler system, you're talking about indoor fire prevention, not sprinkler system in the yard, right? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. Residential sprinkler system in the house, fire sprinkler system. Right, fire prevention. Good. How do you determine that... we can't go above we can't build over 3600 square feet is there a formula well there's a in the fire code there's a chart and it is based upon a formula based upon your construction type so typically single family homes or lightweight wood construction that puts them in a category and then it has a chart there with minimum fire flow requirements and then square footage across the top it's it's a basic Chart I presume that chart is based on physics. Yes, it's based on actual fire flow requirements Thank you, sir Okay Yes, I have there is one of the residents who has prepared a short electronic PowerPoint that I would make the motion that we See it at this time. We have a second. I We have to have a motion and a second, correct? And it takes Kit 2000. Yes, that's according to our rules. That's correct. Whatever we've got here. I'll second it, Mayor. Okay. We have a motion and a second to show the video from the neighborhood, correct, about the development. Yes. All right. Any comments on that or anything? How long is it? Yeah, how long is it? Let me read our rules here. A simple majority of the City Council members present and voting may authorize a representative of the Fayetteville Citizens Group opposing at the ordinance or resolution to present an electronic visual aid not to exceed five minutes, but no other electronic visual aid presentation will be allowed. Well, let me ask you a question. If the Council decided to do two of them, could they do that? The only way they could do that is by suspending the rules, which requires six affirmative votes. I see six people still here, so if everybody voted unanimously, you could suspend the rules. Okay, just checking. The evening is young. All right. Okay, we have a motion and a second to allow a video of the development. Who is the seconder? John. Yes, thank you, John. All right, we have a motion and a second. Bill, would you please call the roll? Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes. Who was going to present it, Adelan? There it is. Your Honor, members of the council, city staff, my name is Alex Mironoff. I live at 159 West 29th Court. And I'm in the unenviable position of having to challenge city staff on the question of stopping sight distance. Some of the introductory stuff that is on these early slides I think I can skip over because all of that has been covered by city staff already. But the basic idea here is that according to how we measured the stopping sight distance, a driver can't see over the crest of Country Club Drive until considerably closer to ASCU than 200 feet. If we can go to slide number two, yeah? Yeah. THIS IS COMING DOWN THE HILL AT COUNTRY CLUB DRIVE, APPROACHING THIS VERTICAL CREST CURVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HIT AT ASK YOU. SLIDE THREE. THIS IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SITE STOPPING DISTANCE PROBLEM TOGETHER WITH THE STANDARDS THAT WERE SET BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS. These standards dictate that an object two feet off the ground needs to be visible to an approaching vehicle at a driver eye level of at least three and a half feet. And that's a fairly low eye level. That's a Honda Civic coming over the crest. The minimum stopping site distance at 25 miles per hour per AASHTO standards is 155 feet and at 30 miles per hour is 200 feet. Depending on the steepness of the grade, this site stopping distance can be as long as 173 feet at 25 miles per hour or 227 feet at 30 miles per hour. Next slide. This layout pretty much summarizes the problem at the vertical crest curve between 26th Circle and Askew Drive. The distance between 26th Circle and Askew Drive is about 200 feet. This is per Google Maps. The point at which an object, and in our case in doing this test, a yellow ribbon on the ASCU drive street sign, when this comes into view, that should be at least 155 feet away to meet the minimum SSD requirements. However, we don't know if we have 155 feet of stopping site distance So we conducted a practical test. We drove the ASCU crest curve at 25 miles per hour and videotaped the view at driver eye level. That's three and a half feet. Here we've bottomed out at the dip on Country Club Drive, and we're about to cross 26th Circle, about 200 feet away from ASCU. Next slide. Here we're passing the hidden drive sign north of 26th Circle. No sign yet of that yellow ribbon on the Askew Street sign. Note the extent of the horizontal curve added to the vertical curve that we've got already. And a driver who is unfamiliar with this road coming down it may not even be looking in the direction where a vehicle would be emerging. Next slide. This is the point on Country Club Drive at which a driver, in the given case, who is actively trying to spot the object, first reports seeing it. Next slide. At this point, the full height of an object, 24 inches above grade, is visible to the driver. And the next slide. And here, the object is being passed. Next slide. So, at 25 miles per hour, it took about three seconds to pass the ASCU drive, to pass ASCU Drive from the moment that this target was first sighted. And we know this from the timer on the digital camera from which these stills were extracted. The car was traveling at 25 miles per hour. This I can vouch for because my wife never goes above the stated speed limit. In three seconds, at 25 miles per hour, a car covers 110 feet. At 28 miles per hour, it covers 123 feet. Even if we increase the time and say that this was 3 1⁄2 seconds and not 3 seconds, we're still looking at less than 155 feet of stopping site distance. In fact, it would take well over 4 seconds for a car traveling at 25 miles per hour to cover 155 feet. We don't know how the city measures stopping site distance or measured it in this specific instance. But we know that actual stopping site distance for this combined vertical and horizontal crest curve should be between 155 feet and 173 feet at 25 miles per hour to meet standards. And we know that our drive-by test suggests that we don't have that. We also know from previous planning commission meetings that at 30 miles per hour, using the city's own measurements, there definitely is not enough safe stopping site distance here. Next slide. So, you can question our measurements, but the City's measurements are also clearly questionable. Either way, the real question is how close do you want to cut this? How big a risk are you willing to take when it comes to public safety? What's it worth to the City to prevent a strong likelihood of frequent accidents at this site? and perhaps the six planning goals of the city should be expanded to include protecting the public from development that results in increased road hazards. Right now there is maybe one or two cars coming in and out of that ASKU drive a day at any given time. With this development, we would see 100 to 200 cars and service vehicles and city trucks and so on entering and exiting this particular drive. And this concerns not only cars coming out of ASCU Drive, but cars going in, because they also would have to be visible as somebody comes over that crest, given the data that I've covered already. So forgive me if I overstate the case, but we hope that you will not endorse the creation of a death trap as part of this development. Next slide. So, proposed remedies, and these have been covered in previous meetings and they've been alluded to here. A separate entry to Mountain Vista via 22nd Street, which would be an ideal solution in terms of taking pressure off of this particular dangerous intersection. Moving the Mountain Vista entry to an existing drive lower on Country Club Drive, 24th Street, I understand that bit of property, which is about an acre plus, does not belong to the developer, but the city does have the option of condemning that and taking that over. Option three is to add a merge lane for traffic exiting ASCU Drive. This doesn't unfortunately address the left turning southbound traffic on Country Club Drive, which can't be readily seen within stopping site distance by downhill northbound traffic. Option three is only a partial solution which helps with visibility of right turning downhill traffic, but not with the uphill left turning. The Planning Commission discussed several traffic calming mitigation measures. I fear these are only Band-Aids that don't solve the core problem. You have the opportunity to correct the dangerous access to this new development completely and permanently before it's built, and I urge you to do so. take action in that direction today, whether that means denying this or tabling the proposed development until suitable changes to the main access to Mountain Vista can be made. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Who else would like to? No, no, no. Everybody, come on. All right. Who would like to address this next? Mr. Mayor and members of the council, my name is Steve Clark. I'm appearing here tonight as an individual citizen in no other official capacity than someone who lives at 438 East Fairway Lane, Fayetteville, Arkansas, which is on the top of this hill, which in history has sometimes been called South Mountain. I'm here to tell you that I support this development as it is proposed with these plans with one major concern. And that major concern was just addressed by the previous speaker, and that is safety. And since I've lived at that address for more than 10 years, I can tell you when coming down off that hill, the reason you don't exceed 25 miles an hour much more than 27 or 28 is because you're riding your brakes, so you're not racing down at the bottom at 60 and then pulling out on School Avenue and getting hit. The reason that you exceed the speed limit going up the hill is because you've got to get up the hill. And until you get to 22nd Street, you haven't crested the hill. You're at the military crest. He's correct. But the military crest is not the crest of the hill. And a study that represents what the traffic count has been conducted in the week of the 20th through the 25th of December has no value. In my opinion. For the reason that from April to November, the Fayetteville Country Club operates every day of the week. From November to April, it doesn't. The week of December 20 through 25, the public schools are out. The school bus climbs that hill every day. 180 days out of 365. The people who come to the Fayetteville Country Club with its 400 members are often guests for major events, which I can assure you take up lots of parking in and around our neighborhoods, sometimes to our own irritation. And we might think that maybe the ordinance that you adopted last year that you have to give notice to people if you're going to have an event so they might block your street. We haven't asked that to apply to us, but we might think about that. But what I will tell you is when those guests are on the top of that hill, coming or going, and in some instances, some who have obviously had the opportunity to have an alcohol ingested into their system, come at a pretty rapid speed, twice what you found in the report that was there. There are traffic calming opportunities, but I do agree I think there are Band-Aids. There are other options, but if we can build... even though the cost would be substantial. If we can build a roundabout there, there may be other options as well. I just think that the information that was portrayed here tonight, and you all know that I try to keep up with what's going on in our city. That's part of my job for you to do that. and I try to keep up with my neighbors, and there was a meeting a week or two ago, and the developer was there, and I thank him for being there to answer these questions. But we just haven't found the right answer. I think this particular case presents something that this council might want to consider as a potential adoption for the future for your hillside ordinance. We're very proud of our hillside ordinance. You are and everyone else in this community. And we're proud of it because it recognizes that when you develop on a hillside, there has to be extra measures taken to preserve both the investment and those who the development might impact. So that's an engineer's report on structural base and foundation. That's more trees and all that. But this is a hillside development, and transportation should be a part of that. getting up and down the hill. And in this instance, this is a property that's the only way in and the only way out. So I've tried it without a four-wheel drive vehicle when there was snow and ice. And, Mr. Mayor, I particularly appreciate you because I have lived up there these years, and you seem to always get to our street pretty cotton-picking fast. I know, but I'm taking credit for that. So I want you to know that I called you and said, please come, but that's not true. I never called him ever, but you came to help us. But with one way in and one way out and one big snow or ice storm like we had the first year that our mayor was mayor and many of you were coming on to the city council, one catastrophe, not about water pressure, but two engines and a car lock up at the crest of that hill. There are no emergency responders get to the rest of us till that's relieved. And that's pretty important. Because I know when you developed a water tank and a tower over on the east side of Fayetteville, this city council said not one person will be put in jeopardy with their life if we can't have adequate water pressure. I'm just not going to do that. Well, in this instance, as it stands now, if you say, well, it meets the minimum standards, you subject at least to the residents on this hill. the jeopardy or the possibility of the jeopardy that there is a collision, not necessarily involving emergency responders, but just three, two residents and a guest. And then you're landlocked. And so then we have a difficulty of getting a wrecker up there, and those precious minutes are significant. So I'm here to urge you to approve the development. I think it's good for us that live there. I think it's good for Fayetteville. I think it's good for Steve Clark personally. My house will go up in value with that investment. What I also am here to ask you to do is to table this like you did before for some more deliberate discussion about the safety of this hillside development and the safety as it applies to the transportation and this will not be the only time this issue will come before this council as we continue to grow as a city and develop there are more proposals that are along hillsides and transportation is an important consideration from my perspective as trees and foundations Getting to and from. So the North Street example was giving and we all appreciate North Street because it's an east west connector from at least 45 to the west side of town. We all hate either setting on our brakes. We're on the downhill side waiting for the light to turn. or we all hate setting on our brakes when we're on the uphill side, trying to make sure that we're not looking at our phone and easing out into the traffic and losing our left fender wall. So if that were being designed today, that wouldn't have been our choice. As one of our previous speakers said, we have a choice now, we have a choice. We can develop the way you get hillside transportation, particularly when there's only one method of egress and ingress. And complicating this ever more, I live at the south end of the mountain. And at the south end of the mountain on East Fairway Lane, there's 55 acres up for development. It's commercially listed property, so it is intended to be sold. A willing seller is looking for a willing buyer for about 55 acres. That's not a lot. That's a development. That's going to happen. That's also probably going to improve my property values. But that's going to add a lot more traffic. So I see this as a situation that presents a clear and immediate concern today, intermediate and long-term concern for tomorrow, but one that should not be acted on tonight but should be continued for no more than 30 days with the message to everyone to come together and look for a better answer because the answer as it is now as a homeowner up there, I tell you, is incomplete and inadequate. It's not wrong, it's just incomplete and inadequate, and therefore it's not acceptable for best practices, best policies for our city. So I urge you to table this for at least 30 days, or no more than 30 days, so that the parties can get a chance to work with our staff. And we've got a great staff. You all know that. There are solutions that can come forward so the developer can develop his property, so the people who live on top of the hill can continue to think that they'll enjoy the things that they live there. And if you wonder why we're so passionate about this, There are more grandchildren on the top of that hill than there are children. And for those of you who are grandparents, you know how important that cargo is to you. And obviously when those sight lines are not as good as we would like for them to be, and you put at risk one of those grandchildren, we get rather pesty and testy. and really concerned that these issues could be avoided with just a little more thought and reflection. So I urge you to allow this developer to develop. Allow him to bring those homes there. Some of those homes may be in a seven-figure value. So, I mean, this is a great piece of property to develop. It will be great for our city, I think. It will be great, as I said, for the homeowners, in my opinion, that live on top of the hill, but not allow that to be approved tonight, finally, but to put, to delay for 30 days so there can be a better solution arrived to which we can arrive that will, take away the fear and the uncertainty, which is presently what is there with the development as it is recommended. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Now, I got a little ahead of myself. I know that we jumped out and did a presentation. I would ask if the applicant is here and would like to say something to the council. I should have already done that. I apologize. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm Jeff Bates. I'm the engineer on the project. The owner is also here. We feel like we've met all the city development requirements. I understand what they're saying. They really want another access off of the mountain, but it's not going to be through this site. The terrain won't allow it. The only place it would was on the backside where we did stub out, and it was still a 14% grade, which is steeper than the fire trucks want to go up. And we agree with city staff it's in about the best place it can be. There's not a whole lot of room to move it. We're also here if you have any other questions. We feel like it's going to be great for the mountain. It's going to fit in. They underdeveloped it. They could have put a lot more homes and a lot smaller lots, but they didn't. And if you have any questions, I'll be here. Yes. Hang on. What questions do we have? John, I see that you're on the floor. Please tell us what would it cost you to slow this down for 30 days? Is that a big deal or a little deal? I don't know the interest he's paying every day on all the land he's bought and the engineering fees. And I don't know that there's another solution. We've been working with city staff for 60 days. How do you feel about putting a two- or three-way stop sign in there? It wouldn't hurt our feelings any. It seems to me that that would solve the problem of traffic. Me too. It would stop everybody. But that might just be... We might just term that a band-aid. I guess people could run the stop sign. They could. We can't design for all the people that are breaking the law. Thank you. OK, any other questions? All right, now let's go back to public comment. Who else would like to address us? Yes, ma'am. Hi, my name's Rita Miller. I'm not going to repeat what anybody else has said. I've lived in that neighborhood since 1993. I was there when the road was straightened out and moved it a little bit away from the ASCU property. At that time, we were told that that lower access road was being put into the ASCU property Askew Private Drive looped around, went past some, what I believe were rent houses at the time on the Askew estate, and that was to connect to that. Shortly thereafter, people were dumping trash back there. I saw a couple mattresses go in, and they gated that off, and I think it was abandoned. So it's a bit of a surprise to me to find out that that property belongs to Jerry Sweets or that little crest in the land that that... Yeah, if you can get to it with, there you go. That that belongs to Jerry Sweetser. Not all of it, but just a little bit of it. And that in order to use that lower access point, the city would need to secure that property in some fashion. If I'm, I believe that Mr. Williams was on the city council at the time, probably knows much more about that in greater detail than I do. I'm going off old memory. We did. I was on city council, and like you all, we authorized the contract to build that, but we didn't get into the weeds on it. However, I've talked with Jeremy and Chris on this. I do think that if you can see that little hook there, I think that is still city property, which is the old road. However, I do think between the old road and the current road, I do think that that land went back to Sweetser. I think we took some land from Sweetser on the downhill side to straighten the curve out, and so we vacated the land up above it. But we still have the right-of-way on that curve, if I'm not mistaken. that is our property, and if it was decided by the engineers somehow, and you've heard them talk already that that was going to be a safer location for the intersection, we not only could use that little hook that we still own, but if we had to go across Sweeter's land, we would be able to obtain that land if through condemnation if necessary, if that was decided to be the safe location or the safest location we could get for the road. However, I think we've heard our city engineer say, well, that's not the safest location. I'm not the expert. I have to defer to our engineers. And we aren't experts, but those of us who live up there would respectfully disagree with that analysis. I understand the engineer thinking that as a general rule, because you're headed downhill, it would increase your stopping distance. But if you go there and actually look at that spot, You have buku stopping, I mean your visibility uphill and downhill, which I think is more useful to talk about rather than north and south because we can all immediately relate to the uphill and the downhill. If you are coming downhill and you crest the road there, as you're going by the existing Askew Private Drive entrance, the uphill entrance to Askew Private Drive, you've got tons of visibility. And if you're pulling out from that lower thing where the gate is now, if you were pulling out and you're looking uphill, you've got lots of visibility. So somebody who's pulling out of there to go on 24th Street is going to have ample, I think ample time to clear that intersection before a vehicle coming downhill would cause a problem, even in bad road conditions. Another issue I think that hasn't been addressed is The benefit to what the city did back in the 90s of taking out the hairpin turn and straightening the road was it enabled us to get uphill better because we didn't have to slow down for that any amount of snow would have cars pulled over at the side of the road waiting until morning to come back down and everybody was hiking up the road. We don't have so much of that now, but if you're coming uphill and you're having to stop for somebody making a left-hand turn into asking, you're going to lose that momentum and you're probably not going to be able to make up the hill if you've got any amount of snow or any slickness. a left-hand turn lane for people who were coming up the hill wanting to turn left into Asking Private Drive, regardless of what location you go in at. But even though it's downhill, I think it is a much safer, and I think most of the people who live in the neighborhood would think that it's a much safer entrance to ASCII Private Drive, which used to loop around and connect there, than using the one. You saw in the PowerPoint how you've got those retaining walls. That showed the view coming down, but if you're coming out of ASCII Private Drive, You better hope nobody coming from the left, heading downhill, is moving in a good clip. And I will tell you that although I hate the notion that we're going to invite you all to come up there and ticket all of us, or give us speed bumps, or otherwise punish us for objecting to this, which is the way it comes across to the residents, we do sometimes have people, in fact I think some of the folks here have been complaining about one of the school buses coming in and out of the neighborhood too quickly. As someone who personally, since the road was redone, was in a vehicle that could not stop at the bottom of that hill. I wasn't driving, but I was in the vehicle. I know it can happen. And we did have a collision. It is an inherently risky street. And I think the safest thing for all of us is, and I understand the problem with trying at this time to develop 22nd Street. And I realize that this isn't it. It is a perhaps a band-aid as well because we would like another way off the hilltop But I appreciate that it's not the developers perhaps not the developers role for to have But It's a reasonable compromise to move the access point for this, what I think should be a really good development, to move that main access point to the lower, to the downhill entrance to Aspey Private Drive. And I think the city should help the developer with that. I think you all should table this for whatever time you need to work that out with the developer in the city to get him that lower access point. which we thought the city had done back in the 90s. So thank you, and I thank all of you. Thank you. Who else would like to address us on this? My name is Jim Benton, and this has been a great experience, but I'm going to go home and eat dinner here in a few minutes. I'm here really to support Dr. Hayes and his endeavor to develop this property. I'd like to be a neighbor to y'all nice folks that live up on that hill. I've got a manufacturing company here in northwest Arkansas and I have talked with Dr. Hayes about possibly purchasing one of the lots up there and building a pretty nice home. But I think on the heels, the problem you guys have been talking about tonight is very valid. an extreme concern and needs to be addressed. But this isn't the first time that's happened. Things like this have happened in this city and won't be the last, and it's been dealt with very effectively in just about every circumstance as it's come about. But coming on the heels of Park Place and Summersbee and what's the one, Sherwood Lane, Dr. Hayes has got a great rapport with this city, has worked and built some beautiful neighborhoods in this town over 50 probably more years, and has owned probably more real estate than all of us combined in this room. And I just don't think that he's going to back away from an opportunity to – enhance really a landmark property for the city of Fayetteville. And I just think it's a good project, and it needs to be approved. And I think that the development is at a stage today where it can be compromises can be made to meet everybody's needs, and that would be my encouragement to the council and to the nice folks that live up in that area. I think it's a good project, and I look forward to maybe building a house out of it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Stay with us and you can have breakfast. Okay, who else would like to address us? Dr. Hayes. I'm J.B. Hayes. I've been a resident of Fayetteville for 45 years. I attended the University of Arkansas. I try to improve the city in whatever improvements I do. An example is Jim mentioned Park Place, Summersby, Sherwood Lane. plus many other commercial developments. And at their request, I met with a large number of the several homeowners in the Country Club area, in the Country Club recently, and listened to their suggestions and their ideas, and I followed some of these. Even some of them have mentioned one tonight that this will improve the value of their homes, considerably, I think. The newspaper made a little error, slightly. They said the homes were gonna be 85 to 155,000. The homes will be in the $450 million to $1 million range. That's what I expect. I think a stop sign might be the ideal thing to put as you come down the hill if it's needed. And the city has approved what we have suggested. Most of the people interested have no children. Then they may have grandchildren, of course, which I have. The ones that live in the area, there's four people that want to purchase for sure lots up in this area. and they live in the present Country Club area. This will help the tax base probably in the $250,000 to $300,000 range. It will also, the Country Club needs members. They want extra members. It's probably going to take three to seven years for the full development. I received three speeding tickets myself 15 or 20 years ago, so I don't speed very much anyway. But I think it will help the Country Club membership, and it It will help Fayetteville, and I think it will be one of the better subdivisions in the city. Thank you. Thank you. All right, who else would like to address us? John, I'm sorry, did you have a question for Dr. Hayes? I just want to say, Dr. Hayes, thank you for stepping out and taking a risk and building our city. I applaud you. Okay. Does anyone else like to address us on this issue? Yes, please, come on in. All right. My name is Greg Anderson. I live at 2941 South College Drive, which is about four houses straight north of the country club. And I would just like to express my – encourage you to approve this subdivision also for Dr. Hayes. I do have a question about the water situation, probably for the fire marshal. That'd be fine. Okay. address it to me and then I'll get you an answer because It's my understanding and this may be a question for the civil engineer, too That there's a water line a new water line in the new subdivision and it will connect to the existing water line on the backside That'll make a loop. That's true. That should improve the water flow situation. So the question is if Well, that solved the problem with putting out fires. Well, I think the fire marshal spoke and said that the fire protection was good. Is that correct? Yes, as it currently stands now, it's adequate for what's been proposed, yes. I think the additions that the water department made and the infrastructure, I don't know if that was a year or two ago. Yeah, a couple years. It has made that very adequate. I got a few calls on the water pressure, and so we – I looked back at some improvements in that area, I believe. I've been there 13 years, and the only time I've ever seen a water pressure problem was when the line broke at the bottom of the hill, and we didn't have any water. That will cause a problem. For about four hours. Well, yeah. Other than that, I've never had a water pressure problem. I know some people may have. Okay. But I've lived up there, like I said, 13 years. And for the last several years, I've been looking for a place on top of the hill. I love living up there, but I've been looking for a place with a really nice view that I can build a new house. And so when I found out Dr. Hayes was building this place, I called him immediately and said, you know, I'd really like to help out with this. So anyway, thank you very much. Thank you. Who else would like to address us on this? Okay. Okay. hello my name is todd diversary i live at 2555 south college drive probably the only one speaking tonight where my property actually adjoins what mr hayes is wanting to do i don't believe anybody on the fayetteville country club mountain is upset or wants to stop mr hayes from improving the values of everybody's home we're all pretty excited about it actually i think what you guys have seen and what you've heard from Numerous people that have spoken to you is a serious concern of safety. And, yes, I know that the current proposed engineer plans meet the minimum requirements given. But once you guys did a study for two days on speed and traffic, that minimum doesn't even come close. And that study was done on two days in which... literally nobody actually goes to the club or Travels because a lot of people that live there are on vacation elsewhere in the country So please for the safety of citizens on the hill table and require that the developer Find a different solution other than a stop sign on an incline that already has Dilemmas with people not being able to get up it when it's even raining a stop sign is not the solution to the problem at hand A roundabout might be. Access at the lower corner is by far the best solution with vacated land, which I know any person with the last name Sweets would probably be glad to donate to the city or even have it condemned. It just needs to be reviewed. There's a significant safety concern, and we just really appreciate you guys listening to us, and thank you. Okay, who else would like to address this on this? Okay, I'm going to bring it back to the City Council. Adele, I believe you have the floor. Yes, Mayor. I would like to make a motion that we table this item for 30 days. You mean actually to the first meeting in February? Yes.
 Okay. Do we have a second? Sarah, are you trying to get your... Okay. I'd like to second that motion. I'm trying real hard over here. I understand. We have a motion and a second to table. What discussion do we have on it, the tabling? Anything? Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought he was asking, it probably makes a lot of sense because it takes five affirmative votes to pass any resolution, so that would be almost, as you can count now, that would be a unanimous decision, which is pretty tough on the... Appealer here miss gray and the citizens, so I think it makes a lot of sense Thanks majority of the Alderman present and voting so require four votes now with with six people including yourself mayor All right any final comments Senator would you please call the roll on the table? Yes Yes, I count four votes so the motion table passed all righty All right. Well that concludes our business tonight. What announcements do we have Don you have an announcement? Yes mayor want to remind citizens that those that have a real Christmas trees that they sitting is accepting those through the month of January, put those out with your on the day of your recycling and trash, and they'll be picked up as a part of your yard waste program included in your fees that you pay. The city also issued its latest edition of the city newsletter. It's on the city's website. You can see that in the city news section. So I encourage you to take a look at that and the happenings that are coming up. Okay. Mr. Mayor, I have one announcement. Well, let's let everybody clear out just a minute. Okay. It's really not much of an announcement. It's just a welcome to Sarah Bunch as our newest member and apologizing that you had to vote first on every item, including difficult, complex parliamentary stuff, and it's not my fault. It was the clerk calling on you first, not me. But I think you did a fine job, and welcome to the city council. Or you could have been voting last. Thank you all very much. All right. Anything else? All right, good work, you all. We're adjourned. Congratulations. Wow, we were here.
