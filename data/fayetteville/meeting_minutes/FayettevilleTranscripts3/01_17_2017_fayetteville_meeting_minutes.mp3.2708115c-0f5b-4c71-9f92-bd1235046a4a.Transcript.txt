The next order is to have now is the presentation the city of federal Martin Luther King Brotherhood Award by kit wait Thank you very much mayor Jordan City Council since Martin Luther King Day in 2002 I have been privileged to select a and honor a City of Fayetteville employee to receive the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Brotherhood Award. This award is given annually in recognition to that city employee whose service to our city and our community best exemplifies Dr. King's dream of equality, justice, and brotherhood. This year's honoree joins a distinguished list of over a dozen city employees who have embodied Dr. King's dream and have helped fulfill his legacy of hope and service to the community. This year's honoree also has exemplified Dr. Martin Luther King's spirit of equality and legacy of service. She has worked for the last decade to help those citizens most in need in our community. Her successful efforts are dear to my heart, Because when my daughter was born six weeks premature and very ill, my daughter's life was saved in part by a blood transfusion. Most city employees know who has spearheaded every city blood drive for the last decade here. Bonnie Bollinger, administrative assistant in the mayor's office. Thank you, Bonnie, for helping so many of the city's generous blood donors to provide the gift of life. Bonnie has organized and chaired the city's United Way campaign for the last decade and has been instrumental in accomplishing an overall increase in the city's giving. Bonnie has also organized and chaired the city staff participating in the annual Heart Walk to raise awareness and funds for the Heart Association. Bonnie has ensured that many city staff have donated and are dressed in red clothes for the National Wear Red Day to raise awareness of women's heart and stroke health issues. We fill up the main staircase in City Hall every year to show off our red clothes and our commitment to women's heart and stroke health. Bonnie handles many telephone calls and walk-in visits from our citizens to the Mayor's office. Her politeness and tact help keep everything on an even keel in the Mayor's office. Bonnie's kind and consistent service to our community exemplifies Dr. Martin Luther King's dream of equality, justice, brotherhood, and service to others and our community. It is now my honor to present the 2017 City of Fayetteville Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Brotherhood Award to its worthy recipient, Bonnie Bollinger, Administrative Assistant to the Mayor's Office. Thank you again, Bonnie. Thank you, Bonnie. We told her tonight she had to take pictures. Well, the mayor gave you a state of the city, so you don't have to worry about that now, Bonnie. Congratulations. Well deserved. Thank you. Okay, the next order of business we have tonight is the State of the City given by the Mayor. This is my 2017 State of the City. I'm entitled at the soul of the city, past, present, and future. So to the City Council, City Attorney, City Clerk, honored guests, and citizens, this is my State of the City. For the past eight years, I've happily reported to you that the state of our city is sound. This year, I want to go a step further and let you know that due to the city of Federal's economic prosperity, smart growth, ability to continue new infrastructure projects, and the increasing diversity of our people and workforce, the state of our city is strong, stronger than it's ever been before. We've had a steady climb over these years to create the economic and social underpinnings that make our city great. We've learned which paths to take to keep our bold dreams alive, as we strive for all of us to thrive and prosper together. As Ralph Waldo Emerson explains in his essay, The Oversoul, we see the world piece by piece as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree, but the whole of which of these are the shining parts is the soul. The state of the city is about the soul of the city, this unique and eclectic community that has chosen to live together in one of the most beautiful places on earth. It is because of our collective efforts that we have built this purposeful city, and it will be through this soul of our community that we will keep it moving forward. My friends, I will remind you again about the unique place that we call home and the soul of our community, a community whose strategy historically and will always survive uncertainties and gain strength through adversity. In our world, it still seems that we are living in the best of times. There is so much more opportunity that awaits us. We will keep that faith, stay strong together, and continue to progress with the principles that have defined our culture, despite, or more importantly, because of what may happen outside of the parameters beyond our control. It will be our priority to maintain our local control, to keep our momentum moving in a progressive and positive direction. Tonight I will spend only a few moments reflecting on the City of Federal's 2016 accomplishments, and then I want to elaborate about our objectives for 2017 and beyond. Our competitive advantage in 2017 stems from the advantage of our current position and our unique talents combined with unwavering conviction. We are fortunate to have the best city staff to make this city function like a well-oiled machine. We're fortunate to have an abundance of input from a very active citizenry, one who is not afraid to vote to spend their tax dollars wisely. And we are very fortunate to have a city council who are each committed to moving this city forward. The city attorney's office continues to provide sound legal advisory services to the city council, the mayor, and the various operating departments and divisions within the city. Kid, I want to thank you for the work that you do for this city. The City Clerk's Office continues to be a great source of information and record keeping for both the general public and the city staff. Sandra cannot be here tonight, but Lisa is here. I want to thank you all for your work and efforts in the City Clerk's Office for all the work that you do. Now, what did we actually do in this city to achieve our successes? We had a vision for the infrastructure and we built it over the years and years with balanced budgets. We built the Van Asch Extension. renovation of Walton Art Center, Kessler Mountain Regional Park Phase One, restoration of historic bridges at Maple and Lafayette, Rupel Road from Martin Luther King Jr. to Persimmon Street. We dream big in this city. We dreamed of preserving Kessler Mountain and building a regional park that could compete with the best in the state and within the multi-state region, and we built it. We dreamed of an arts facility that could help bring the type of programming here that attracts talent to the area, has a positive impact on quality of life, and introduces the arts and creativity to support a well-rounded cultural experience, and we built it. We dreamed of an expansion to the world-class Blair Library, and the citizens of this city decided they wanted to build that too. Dreams of expanding the Federal Public Library became a reality this year when the community passed a millage supporting library operations and the construction of an additional 80,000 square feet. We've been able to build an enormous amount of infrastructure in the past few years due to our strong sales tax revenue and smart money management. 2016 was a strong year for economic activity in Federal. We have several master plans in the works that will guide us as we set our goals to build new infrastructure. The federal mobility plan, the recycling trash master plan, the economic development plan, and we will have plans to update the city plan 2030. Also, I plan to have a strategic planning session with the city council during the first quarter of this year. As you recall in 2016 budget due to the increases in population service area calls for service and response times we asked for increases in staffing for the federal fire and police departments. I want to take this time to report on the impact this strategic decision has made in our city. With the addition of a rescue engine fire company on April the 11th 2016 the federal fire department now deploys 10 active fire companies This action, along with a few other improvements, has resulted in a 3.2% improvement in response times. Also, the police department added seven new officers. These officers were hired, trained, and placed on patrol in late third quarter of 2016. Year-to-date results indicate priority one response call times have improved and are down 7.6% from 2016. Recruitment with a focus on diversity and training of personnel will continue to be a top priority for the police and fire departments. Fire will pursue a number one ISO rating from the Insurance Services Office, which can mean lower insurance premiums for homeowners and businesses. The police department will continue with proactive steps of reaching out to business, civic, public, and faith-based organizations to build relationships. There's nothing more important for our city's future stability and our abilities to keep our freedoms and enjoy our diverse culture than the work we do to keep our people out of harm's way. I know our citizens appreciate these efforts. I'm deeply proud of the service of the individuals in our fire and police departments, and I know our city council feels the same way. While we remain very proud of all the accomplishments of 2016, I want to take a moment to close out the old and look to the new year. What do we have to look forward to in 2017? My priorities are in these five main areas that we will be discussing tonight. Implementing the federal first economic development plan, paying down the debt. Three, infrastructure planning. Four, engaging in a lean government review. And five, improving operations and technology. Number one, implementing the federal first economic development plan. The federal first plan provides several calls to action in strategic focus areas. The city is contracted with startup Junkie Consulting and the Chamber of Commerce and is currently in the hiring process for a director of economic vitality and internal city staff position. A focus area is to further enhance the arts and cultural environment, pursue grant funding and encourage public art installations. and support the Cultural Arts District development. Some specific action items are to extend support to the Federal Library, Walton Arts Center, and Theater Square, all within a single Cultural Arts District. Pursue grant funding and opportunities. Work with the University and community to exhibit public art in more locations. Work with artists to increase public art projects around city facilities. boost efforts to ensure high-value artisan food and craft beverage companies to flourish in Federal. Another focus of the Economic Development Plan is to support, retain, and attract business, improve the business perception, and meet property needs of targeted business sectors. To meet this goal, the Chamber of Commerce will maintain and communicate with business sectors when property, equipment, or staffing needs are made known. Create an inventory and analysis of the area's retail base and gaps, identifying trends and targets for growth opportunity. Focus efforts on legacy industry, regional headquarters, and our entrepreneurs and startups. Continue its employee retention and expansion program. Additionally, the City staff will continue regular communication sessions related to development. construction and permitting review, process improvements and development challenges, improve customer service with a new position in development services devoted to customer service interaction, conduct a lean government process in development services focused on process improvement, research and develop incentive opportunities, parameters and funding mechanisms and targeted areas of interest, There are many parallel activities included in our economic development plan, not the least of which is our focus on workforce development. We must ensure workforce talent is attracted, developed, and retained. We have always had strong partnerships with the University of Arkansas and the federal public schools. I want to thank Dr. Wendt for being here tonight. Thank you, Dr. Wendt. And the city depends on those partnerships and relationships. The talent pool may be developed, within the city or region through career education and counseling secondary schools. Recruited from higher education institutions are drawn from the existing regional or global workforce. For many professions and employers our workers may come from that population of new Americans, immigrants who are increasingly becoming a vital part of the state's overall economy. We will, Strengthen lines of communications with UAE MS and its continued dialogue to grow in federal Create a welcoming city plan to focus on inclusion and integration of new Americans and federal Work with engaged Northwest Arkansas and the Northwest Arkansas Council on a welcoming regional plan developed the city as a role model and workforce strategies by establishing diversity as a key pillar of to our talent management strategy and development of leaders who reward high performance. A new compensation classification salary study is forthcoming so that we can implement competitive salaries across all departments when financial conditions will allow us to. In the coming years, we will be highlighting Federal as the startup city of the South. Our focus will be to embrace our entrepreneurial system and support startup companies and the culture to retain them long term. Increase high tech job growth through university partnerships, innovative spaces and programs to support entrepreneurs and expand entrepreneurship education programs. To meet this goal, the city will create the Federal Innovation Council to establish a collaborative environment that addresses the needs and challenges of entrepreneurs and innovators in federal. Anyone interested in an entrepreneurship will be able to find notable successes, best practices, entrepreneurial initiatives, a calendar of meetups, events, and educational mentoring opportunities and technology support networks on a new start-up City of the South website. Our city needs space for entrepreneurial programming and for creative ideas to occur. This year, we will formally launch and sustain Center Space as a free, co-working, and entrepreneurship space open to the public, located on the second floor of the East Square Plaza. Over the next year, a recently formed Millennial Advisory Panel will meet monthly to recommend policies, education, and development practices to create an environment that attracts the new millennial worker and our business owners. Also, we will continue to focus on improving the outstanding lifestyle quality in Fedville, support attainable housing development, enhance and support public transportation, energize and support downtown Fedville, explore redevelopment opportunities, and seek development of a hotel conference center. To meet this goal, the city will continue to explore affordable housing developments. continue to support public transit, using the mobility plan and participating in a region-wide transit development plan to understand the needs and improvements that can be made to public transit, as well as what funding needs and sources are sustainable. We will continue to install wayfinding signage throughout the city to assist visitors. Create a downtown business association that works to support all of the properties and interests in the downtown area. Create a marketing campaign aimed at the startup culture to energize the federal environment. Invest funds to complete pedestrian improvements along 71B and identify potential redevelopment opportunities. conduct research to understand the capacity level and need for a hotel conference center located in federal we will focus on enhancing federal's public profile as a dynamic business location build the federal first brand pursue recognition in key rankings and increase publicity about key economic development efforts to meet these goals the city will Release a new redesigned website in the first quarter of the year improving navigation by prioritizing content based on analytics that reflect our citizens most frequently used online services. Our analytics report for 2016 indicates that nearly 2 million page views by almost 500,000 users of whom nearly 60% come from outside of FedMul. The top four of these outside users are in Dallas, Springdale, Oklahoma City, and Bentonville. Nearly half our viewers use a mobile device or tablet, which makes our efforts for a mobile-friendly website increasingly important. A new brand, streamlined graphics, and local photography will bring a clean design for enhanced readability and a sense of place to identify FedVol first. Also, the new site is designed with accessibility standards which will optimize the web experience for people with disabilities. Create a new federal-first marketing video that highlights the strategic focus areas of the economic development plan. Develop place making and marketing materials to showcase federal's quality of life. research options to create an open data financial transparency portal, which will focus on providing the public access to financial and operational data. Finally, we will organize and capitalize on federal sustainable environment, promote a plan for the future of sustainability, and support the local food economy. The City of Fayetteville is focused on becoming a community of livable neighborhoods that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. We will focus on economic, environmental, and social policy development and project management and stay involved with local, state, and national organizations on environmental protection, transportation, green building and energy issues. The city will use feedback from the recent community survey to guide quality of life initiatives and to stay and lay the foundational work for a 2018 star recertification with the goal of becoming a four-star community. Develop a community energy action plan. Designate Federal as a solar-friendly community so that residents and businesses can install solar more easily on their property. Explore the potential for expanding the city's successful investment in the Ozarks Natural Energy Solar Array. That investment generated 54,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity per year. We will encourage the City Council to adopt expanded recycling programs for organics, composting, small multi-family units, and construction debris opportunities. We will work with the University of Arkansas and other stakeholders to develop and implement a community bike share program and install bike racks in public buildings where needed. Explore employees' sustainability initiatives. Support a local food economy working group. support creation of a regional food hub, and explore potential for local food production and consumption. The next point I want to talk about tonight is paying down the debt. For those of you who may not remember, in 2006, voters approved a bond issue for road and trail improvements. These revenues combined with federal, state, and private contributions funded the major infrastructure projects I previously mentioned. Completion of all bond projects is expected to end by 2018. If sales taxes continue to hold strong, it is my plan to pay down the city's debt so that we can develop a new capital package to take to the citizens to help us sustain the quality of life that has made this community the third best place in the United States to live. These new projects will be prioritized through strategic planning with City Council Members and citizen engagement. This comprehensive plan will be presented to the voters when the current sales tax bonds are paid off. The current estimate for that payoff is the third quarter of 2019. Over the years, citizens have mentioned some large capital projects that will be certainly under consideration. We, of course, will also bring forth recommended transportation projects from the mobility plan. The third point I want to talk about tonight is is infrastructure planning. To sustain our progress in infrastructure development, we will focus on items identified in our master plans. I've been working on building the city's infrastructure from the time I was on the city council with the then City Street Committee through my two terms as mayor and I'm going to continue to add to that infrastructure in my third term. As we wrap up the major transportation projects, The city outlined through previous master planning efforts, we look forward to the federal mobility plan, a transportation master plan that will outline a blueprint for long-term multimodal mobility in the city of . The plan will establish mechanisms for funding local and regional projects with the latter feeding into the Northwest Arkansas regional transportation. Some specific areas of interest for me, the near term R2. Continue the extension of Ruppel Road. Add signals to the intersection of Ruppel and Martin Luther King Jr. and Persimmon. Begin construction for the next phase of the Ruppel Road improvements from Starry Night View to Mount Comfort including straightening, intersection alignment, and a traffic light. Add the leg of Ruppel to Howard-Nickel Road and complete the arterial loop. Bring a new list of projects forward, including ones to enhance our east-west connectivity, impact mobility, and alternative transportation, and grow our multimodal network system of roads, trails, and sidewalks. Our goal with the mobility plan is to constantly improve driving, walking, biking, public transit, and parking in Fedmoor. We also realize that to make our city's mobility network more accessible to all citizens, we need to do a better job of addressing public transit amenities. As part of our economic development strategic plan, we depend on the growth of alternative transportation to provide the mobility choices the emerging workforce expects. Transom provides commutes to distant job sites and workforce training opportunities to fill the increasing number of jobs available. We will continue to work with the University and ORT to improve the city's transit infrastructure. Our mobility plan also offers an analysis of the city's parking strategies and we anticipate changes to be implemented too. Streamline parking rates and time limits to create a unified parking approach in the entertainment and downtown districts and create uniform signage. Support strategies that provide greater pedestrian access by improving sidewalks and lighting in specific areas. Support the city's downtown master plan by working with area businesses to ensure parking requirements are successful. For our roads and trails network, staff has provided the list of projects already on the books. They're coming within the year. They are. Sane Vantage Connection will provide an alternative route to the Joyce and College intersection. O'Wire Road from Mission to Ashe and from Ashe to Stanton will be improved with bike lanes, curb and gutter, sidewalk and trails. Design a roundabout to replace the existing four-way stop at 15th Street and Razorback Road intersection. include overlay and widening and signalization at Razorback Road and Maple Street, Highway 112 improvements from Poplar to Van Ash, and College Avenue rezoning to support form-based walkable redevelopment and sidewalk enhancements between Maple and North. Some major trail improvements will be completed in 2017, the first two of which provide major expansions west of I-49 and connectivity for alternative transportation routes. The leg of Calabria Creek Trail, east from Ruppel Road to Holcomb School, is being completed. In 2019, Calabria Creek Trail is planned to extend to the east from Holcomb School to the Razorback Regional Greenway. The Cato Springs Trail will extend from south to the new Kessler Mountain Regional Park. The new Neocoska Creek Trail will connect along the east side of Old Wire through Gully Park to Mud Creek Trail and Old Missouri Road. We will also develop and implement protected on-street bicycle connections. This connectivity, among other green spaces, will make our parks even more attractive. As I previously mentioned, if we are able to pay down the debt as I expect, I also plan to move forward aggressively with the next phases of the Kessler Mountain Regional Park. The opening of this park signifies why building infrastructure and preserving open and green space is a priority in this city. We're extremely proud of the 400 acres of mountaintop preserved this year on the south side of town at the Kessler Mountain Regional Park. I will work to add to our inventory of preserved open spaces throughout my tenure with the city. We will focus on three main things in building the city's digital infrastructure. Broadband connectivity to city-owned facilities and public parks to improve city staff's productivity and establish more Wi-Fi hotspots around the city. Policy development to pave the way for smart city design. A digital inclusion plan to close the homework gap and provide affordable internet access to all. The city will solicit proposals for internet access and building network connectivity through an RFP process. We will continue to support diversity and equal rights for all residents. Specifically, I have several new goals this year to address these main areas. The welcoming federal plan will ensure that with intentional efforts, that intentional efforts are made to further the city's support of this diverse community. We will develop and work on adoption of a plan that improves equitable services and access for federal citizens. Housing assistance. Through the Community Development Block Grant, we will invest $500,000 back into the community to assist low- to moderate-income residents. And the transportation program. We will assist an estimated 110 elderly and disabled residents with taxi coupons. And we'll assist an estimated 350 individuals with transit passes and qualified individuals with paratransit passes. Through the HEARTH program, our goal is to house 100 homeless individuals as we did last year. Rangers Pantry will continue to assist citizens experiencing financial hardships with pet food. Strategies for affordable housing. The city will invest up to $1 million in the houses at Willow Bend, and attainable housing development in the Walker Park neighborhood, and continue to explore other opportunities for attainable housing. Digital inclusion. I believe in the necessity of broadband access for all, but I know there's a balancing act we face. The more tech-focused the city becomes, the more stark the divide is between the tech savvy and those left behind. We must focus on providing access for everyone so that high-speed broadband becomes a leveler across our community. We will explore options to increase the availability of competitive broadband internet to attain one gig of bandwidth across the city at affordable prices. We will be forming a task force to develop the city's broadband plan. I'm happy to work in partnership with the Federal Public Library on this component. The city's digital inclusion plan will take a comprehensive approach to community connectivity and will invite community members to take stock of their current broadband assets, access, and applications. and identify opportunities to the next steps for increasing access, adoption, and use. The fourth thing I want to talk about tonight is engaging a lean government review. I've asked all departments involved in planning, development, and building permitting processes to peel back the covers and take a look at their processes and procedures from a customer's point of view. Development services will focus on process improvement and will assist developers by providing resources such as A manual on small lot single family home design. Flowchart detailing the development process. Zoning brochure to enhance understanding of various zoning districts in the city. Continued community meetings. The use of technical urbanism to implement quick, low-cost intersection or street improvements. In planning, we will make available online submittal of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and gas permits, and an online payment of re-inspection fees. The Utilities Department will streamline the internal plans review process between city engineering and water sewer metering and backflow processes. Number five, improving operations and technologies. All departments and divisions will streamline work flow and processes, creating better customer service and efficiency in all city interactions. We will implement additional technology improvements to enhance customer and city interaction. Several departments are migrating through hand-held devices for field work and maintenance work. Our parking management division will expand payment options The Parks and Recreation Department will add software to increase the department efficiency. Planning will install large display touch screens for customer interaction with zoning maps, code searches, business and other license registration and citizen review of project files. Information technology will implement the final phase of the Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP, software that will significantly upgrade utility bill paying options including real-time balance information. In closing, my vision for this city is to remain a top-tier city across the country. a city that has a vibrant business economy that welcomes millennials, next-generation workers, immigrants, and new Americans, and provides an environment where existing citizens and newcomers can thrive. We will continue to maintain our quality of life through smart growth and focus our efforts in making Fedmo a progressive city for economic development and one that is responsive to our citizens' needs. And as always, We will make every effort to retain federal's unique eclectic identity and culture as we call upon our community to strengthen the connections between our people and places to create our collective vision for the future. We will continue to reject policies that treat segments of our community differently. To quote John F. Kennedy, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future and we are all mortal. You see, my friends, we are all part owners of this city together. Regardless of the color of our skin, our religious belief or who we love in understanding these principles will help us all understand what makes us strong. We will find opportunities and security for all of our citizens. We will maintain the soul of our community and make it stronger every day through deliberate and intentional actions. With the great confidence the voters displayed for me and this administration in the last election comes with it equal responsibility and humility to uphold the principles of our community. I believe our commitment to these principles is validated and shared, and I will do everything in my power to maintain those. That is the state of my city, and the state of this city is strong. Thank you all. Thank you. Hang on, I've lost my agenda. Okay. It's kind of warm in here, isn't it? I believe we're on the consent agenda. Number one.

Okay, Jeremy Aaron counsel. Thank you I present this item at the last meeting requested that you leave it on that first reading to allow Citizens or anyone interested to review the information we had This proposal in a nutshell is to create two new zoning districts that could be part of our toolbox tool of options I'm in our toolbox the neighborhood services general district and We would rename one of our districts to Neighborhood Services Limited and also to create a new district called Residential Intermediate. We changed the name of that a few times. So Residential Intermediate Urban, which would be, again, a missing middle piece of our residential districts. It would have an unlimited density, but really the density would be limited by the height limits. other needs for the site that are required for residential development. We're excited about these changes. We believe this provides certainly something the market is demanding in terms of what we've heard from the development community and also in just zoning decisions and actions that you all have taken here at the council level. There's a litany of other changes within the code that are required to enact these districts, and that's why so many code sections are being changed. But I'd be happy to take any questions that you might have. Any questions we have for Chairman on this? Anybody? Okay. Do we have any public comment on this? Okay. We'll bring it back to the council.

Constructing that trail what we're trying to do with this particular amendment and the the amended document that you have in front of you is Simply go ahead and have that portion of trail constructed along a little over 200 feet here a essentially the length of the turn lane plus some additional space there. Staff would work out the details on the crossing at Morningside to have a protected crossing already constructed as well as transition from the bike lanes and to the trail at the time of construction plan review. But we're excited to have this portion of the trail be constructed with the project and we'll certainly work out any specific construction details during the time of development review. I would ask, however, just for the purposes of making sure it's a clear exhibit, that you amend the exhibit that's in your packet if you agree that this is a better scenario to have the applicant construct the trail as opposed to the bike lanes through this turn lane section. Okay. That would be to amend to put the trail in instead of the bike lanes, correct? That's correct. And that would be as identified on the exhibit that was provided by Mr. Fulcher and Krafton and Toll. The resolution does not need to be amended, but the exhibit does. That's correct. Okay.
 Okay. But that doesn't necessarily mean that... We're going to be putting the trail in instead of the bike ones. No, you can see as shown on there that there is actually going to be a portion of the trail constructed along the northern side of their development. Is that right, Jeremy? Yes. I wanted to be sure that I was clear on that. Okay, so we need an amendment to add the image of the trail. the document that you have before you. Sarah? I move that we amend to include the exhibit. Okay. I'll second that. We have a motion and a second by Councilmember Kenyon. All right. Any discussion on that? Okay. Lisa, would you please call the roll? Lutcher? Yes. Marsh? Yes. Kenyon? Yes. Petty? Yes. Unch? Yes. Okay. All right, thank you all. Okay, is the applicant here? Would they like to say something tonight? Thank you, counsel. Real quickly, is there an extra copy of that? I appreciate being back in front of the council getting to discuss this project. I just quickly wanted to go over, I think, how we got here. My understanding for why this was appealed from the Planning Commission meeting was kind of the speed of the discussion, the traffic study that the Planning Commission staff had received just prior to the Planning Commission meeting where they recommended approval of the project hadn't provided a lot of people the time that they felt was needed. So I feel that the appeal was an opportunity for us to continue to work with staff and provide some more information to the neighborhood as well as to the recommended street improvements. We've continued to work with staff for the last, I'd say, maybe four weeks, maybe a little bit longer, to kind of work out exactly what those improvements would be. We've extended that turn lane there along Morningside Drive, and working with Matt Mihaljevic, the trails coordinator, we felt it would be a much better... solution over the long term to go ahead and look at the trail improvements along our property versus Constructing bike lanes that I think the intent is to have those removed in the future currently on the north side of the warnings The north side of Huntsville the bike lane just kind of stopped So I think the long-term plan is to get everyone on the south side of the road onto the trail system Hopefully get those trails Constructed on the west side of morning side and on the south side of Huntsville to get those folks back into the Walker Park neighborhood So we appreciate staff's time with that. Hopefully, I think we're all in agreement with what those improvements are. Again, those improvements are in addition to the money that will be contributing to the hopeful future installation of a traffic signal at Huntsville and Morningside. And then the full improvements along Morningside Drive as well. You know, in regards to some of the concerns I know that the neighbors have had that they've mentioned at the meetings about traffic congestion and speeding along Morningside, I just want to kind of reiterate that those are conditions that exist today. It has nothing to do with this development. Those, the congestion, I'm aware of, I used to drive in on Huntsville. I'm certainly not as aware of the neighbors that go into it every single day, but I was doing it a couple times a week coming in the morning. So I do understand that the traffic does back up there. It's difficult to turn off a morning side drive currently. I think it's on us as the development group here to how can we help that situation? I think that's what we've been trying to show both through the traffic study and through the improvements we've shown on our plans So that the turn lane on Huntsville Road will allow those left turn Movements to get out of the through traffic lanes that will help with that congestion that they're experiencing currently even with the addition of some traffic that will be from our development and We'll also be constructing a turn lane on Morningside Drive so that northbound traffic, if they want to take a left to go into town, they aren't slowing down vehicles. They simply want to take a right, which is a much easier turning movement. There's a benefit to the congestion issues that are there currently with with the development of this neighborhood And and then the third item is a speeding on Morningside Drive Certainly that's a condition that exists today and how we can help with that condition is provided on street parking That's one of the best things that you can do as you notice in your downtown areas That's where you have your on street parking and it's very difficult It makes people very nervous to drive at high speeds when you have on-street parking, and that's something that we're going to be providing along Morningside Drive. So we're not creating these problems of congestion and speeding. Those issues exist. I think it's our job is to come up with ways to help those situations and not make them worse. I think we've shown that. I think the traffic study shows that, and I think staff's recommendation of the improvement shows that. We're just looking at this point for final approval on this project. As I said at the last meeting, we started this back in October as far as the submittal process. We're into mid-January, and we're hopeful that we can move forward with this project. We think it's going to be a great project in this area. Hearing some of the mayor's comments, I think, speak to the city plan 2030 goals. I feel confident that we would check every box of those goals with this development, both in its location, the type of development that we're providing, and typically the price point of product that we provide in the market. And so I'm confident that we would check every one of those boxes. Again, I think we've done a really good job in addressing some of the concerns from the neighbors, concerns that exist today, and then how we can benefit those. And I feel that we do have the support of the staff and would look for the council's support tonight. Thank you. Okay. What questions do we have for the applicant or chair meal? Ms. Mark. Remind me again how we're going to move forward with guaranteeing that there will be a stoplight at this intersection. Well, we're not actually guaranteeing there will be because it still has to meet warrants, which means enough traffic to justify it. This will certainly add some traffic in that direction, potentially. And at that point in time, certainly it will be up to city staff. City staff generally uses a national standard, I think, in order, and we've got Chris Brown here to explain it, to explain when we can have a traffic signal there. And because of that, since we generally require enough traffic to justify it, it's hard to guarantee that there is going to be sufficient traffic there. I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeremy? I can add a little bit. As was requested at the last council meeting, some citizens were interested in a full warrant analysis, essentially is what is the type of analysis we utilize in an intersection that uses a number of different criteria to establish certain thresholds about when a traffic signal is warranted. We did ask the applicant to provide that as part of their traffic study. Their latest traffic study that was sealed by the engineer did provide that warrant analysis and indicated a traffic signal would not be needed with just the development of this project. However, we also anticipate that this is a fast-growing area of our city. There will be other traffic, other projects, and so what we committed to at the last meeting as internally as staff, rather than wait for that next project, we will plug this into whatever the most... the timeframe that we need every other year or every year, whatever that needs to be as directed by the mayor and transportation director and city engineer to understand, do our own warrant analysis, to understand if the traffic is needed. We know it won't be for at least a few years because this project will take several years to even build out to have homes on the ground and traffic being generated. However, we committed to the citizens that were at the last meeting of the council to plug that into our normal operations and understanding that this is a project intersection that will need something in the future. Thank you. Okay, any other questions for the applicant or Jeremy? Okay, thank you, Jason. Now we'll open it up for public comment. Everybody gets one turn at the microphone and keep your comments addressed to me and don't engage anybody in the audience or a council member. Everybody be courteous to one another. Okay. Please introduce yourself. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. My name is Curtis Hogue. I am the appointed trustee for the Charles P. Rose Testamentary Trust, which is the owner of this particular property. While I am the trustee, the beneficiaries, well, now there's surviving beneficiaries, there's two. One of the beneficiaries, you all may know, Kenneth Rose. Ken passed away recently, but there are still two surviving beneficiaries, these ladies up in years. It is important for them to try to get this resolved, in other words, be able to close on the sale of this property to the developer. We believe that certainly we won't see the property sold and see the property developed, but that the developer has met all requirements. As a matter of fact, been very diligent in meeting requirements by planning. And would be entitled to approval of this project. My clients are, well, they've beneficiaries. I am the trustee. Have waited quite some time for this to close and have been, certainly anxious for for this to be resolved and we know this process takes some time but at this point in time the beneficiaries this trust are up in years and Really no longer able to maintain this property is a large tract and so certainly be beneficial and Would encourage that there be approval to get this matter closed. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any questions from? Alright who else would like to address this? Good evening. I'm Ralph Nesson. I live at 1007 Morningside Drive, and I so appreciate the discussion and Concern and the work of the city staffing staff and making improvements. I would like to remind you that the city staff initially recommended turn lanes from Huntsville Road into the property to turn lanes and if traffic driving west along Huntsville Road in the morning rush hour, in the afternoon when traffic is leaving. If people wanna take a left into that property, it's going to hold up traffic considerably. There will be up to 600 new vehicles in that development, which means a lot more traffic and a lot more people driving onto Huntsville Road. We also mentioned at the last meeting the concern of residents on McClinton Street. One of the outlets from the development will go due west along McClinton Street. If any of you have driven that street, it is narrow. There are children playing. There is no sidewalk. There is a need for a sidewalk along that street from Morningside Drive to Wood Avenue. There is a need for a stop sign at Morningside and McClinton Street to enable traffic to flow and for people to slow down. So in the future, when the development is in process and that traffic starts to build... And people come back and say, we need those turning lanes. We need that stop sign. We need that sidewalk. I hope you'll remember that these concerns were mentioned at city council meeting and unfortunately weren't given attention. But we do appreciate all of your... I'm patient with the concerns brought to you by our neighborhood and we look forward to discussing this in the future as the development proceeds. Thank you. Who else would like to address this tonight? Okay. I'll bring it back to the council. Matthew. Yes, thank you, Mayor. Kit, would you mind refreshing us on what a vote up or a vote down means? When a preliminary plan is presented for review either by the planning commission or on appeal to the city council, what you are required to do by your own ordinances that you all have enacted into the Unified Development Code is to look at the factors within the Unified Development Code to see whether or not it must be approved. I think it's clear that all of the conditions of the Unified Development Code have been met, with the exception of an argument that traffic safety, that creating or compounding a dangerous traffic situation is what Alderman Gray did bring forward because that's the only possible issue to be able to be discussed. I will note that at this point in time, after a traffic study has been completed, that both the city staff and city engineers and planning staff has agreed that, in fact, this is not going to create or compound a dangerous traffic situation. Many things have been done or will be done by this developer to try to alleviate the potential traffic problems that are already there. I also need to point out that it's not traffic congestion Traffic congestion can be considered during a rezoning But not during the approval of preliminary plat because this land has already been zoned for high density residential And so that decision has been made and so we can't really consider about whether 290 homes here are appropriate or not and so the Supreme Court has said that a If a developer has fulfilled all the requirements, development requirements that the city has set forth in its code section for us, that's Unified Development Code, then the development must be approved. And to not approve it would be arbitrary and capricious and incorrect, and they have reversed a city that decided because of substantial opposition. to not approve a development even though it met the conditions, regulations. So that's an improper course of action. So the only thing you could consider in this particular case is traffic safety. I think that the experts have all agreed that traffic safety is not an issue in this particular case. I think that this developer really has gone beyond what is normally required to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars of improvements for the bike lane, for the turn lanes, for the complete correction of Morningside on its side of the street, including parking, which I think has been recognized as something that helps moderate traffic speed. And the other thing, of course, can be done is what was done on Huntsville Road right near this intersection where the police have pretty effectively slowed the public down because I used to drive that a lot. And it's nice and wide open there, and I never really thought 25 was right, but it's amazing how many people drive 25 now because occasionally the police are sitting out there. sometimes giving tickets, but just oftentimes presenting their appearance. And I think the same thing can be done right on this block on Morningside, which I agree with some of the neighbors. I've driven Morningside many times too, and it is a straight stretch with one side being just a pasture, which encourages you to drive faster because there's nothing on the west, on the east side. And so I think that when there will be development on the east side and with the actions of our police department, I think we can maintain the proper speed limit on that particular road. And therefore, I think that this development has gone a long way in improving this and certainly has not compounded, I think, a dangerous traffic situation. If that is true, then your course must be to approve the preliminary plat. In this case, a vote no would be to the project would go with the way the resolution is worded. The project would go forward and the approval of the Planning Commission, missing the turn lane and the trail, and a vote yes would include those items. Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. If an alderman wanted to actually attempt to reject this preliminary plat, even though, There might be some question about whether that would even be possible, but if you wanted to, you'd have to make a motion to amend the resolution to approve the appeal and deny the preliminary plat. I do not recommend that. I think that would be somewhat dangerous with the facts that we have in front of us, but that's the only way to actually turn down the preliminary plat. I just wanted to get a little... I'LL GET A REFRESH ON WHAT YES OR NO MEANT WITH THE RESOLUTION BEFORE US. I SAID LAST TIME EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT THE PROCESS WAS UNUSUAL, BECAUSE WHAT WAS BEFORE IT WAS BETTER THAN WHAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAD ENDED UP WITH, THAT I WOULD VOTE YES. AND I THINK WE'RE IN MAYBE MARGINALLY BUT IN AN EVEN BETTER POSITION THAN WE WERE TWO WEEKS AGO. SO THAT STATEMENT STILL STANDS. with the reservations I had last week, maybe slightly reduced. I do want to say though in my comment that I think some of the suggestions from the neighbors particularly with McClinton and a stop sign there at that intersection and a stoplight at Morningside and Huntsville are prescient. Sometimes, you know, it may be the case that the system for calculating warrants is miscalibrated. And if we look historically at a lot of the intersections in the city, we find a lot of intersections that have today warrants. traffic signals or stop signs that would not meet the warrant conditions that were required to follow now. They were installed at a time when either the warrant system wasn't in place or the requirements were simply different. And I think we miss sometimes whenever we focus these site discussions so much on metrics We missed the opportunity to have a conversation about what those kinds of infrastructure improvements may mean beyond traffic control. There are lots of cases where adding a stoplight to an intersection like this with so many new developments planned around it may be an economic development opportunity for the parcels at the corners. But we're not able, for one reason or another, whether it's legal or cultural, to have those kinds of discussions. We should have those kinds of discussions. So that doesn't change my vote. I'm still going to vote yes, but I'm left with a feeling that something has been missing from this. Okay.
 Sarah? Can you clarify that one more time? So if we vote no, then we're not granting the appeal, whereas if we vote yes, we're granting the appeal? I'm just confused about which way we're supposed to vote. Yeah. If you vote yes, then you are granting the appeal and adding all these new conditions. Okay, with the new conditions. Okay. If you vote no, then the resolution that was an appeal is denied, and so the planning commission's decision will be put back in place. Okay. Thank you. Anybody else?
 Sarah? I did want to comment that in hearing from the neighbors, there doesn't seem to be much of an objection to having more people and homes here. But the primary objections are to the traffic that this will generate, specifically the vehicle traffic. And one thing that I would like to see more developers address is having an alternative transportation master plan, something that is incentivizing people in their development to use alternatives to single occupancy vehicles. Because this... This entire neighborhood is within easy biking distance. It's pretty flat to get to the South School and MLK business districts. But I just don't see a lot of emphasis on the part of the developer in getting people to utilize alternative transportation. So going forward, I hope that we'll see more attention to that from developers, especially in conditions so ripe for alternative transportation as this lot. Anybody else? Okay. I'm going to make a motion to approve the resolution. I'm wondering with so few council members here, do we need to wait for Alderman Latour to return? I'm afraid he has left. He said he had a commitment at 645, and so I encouraged him not to leave, but he left. Okay. Well, there you have it. And it only takes five affirmative votes to pass a resolution. The mayor is allowed to vote? I'll make the motion to pass the resolution. Sarah? I'll second that. Okey-dokey. Any final comments? All right. Lisa, would you please? Sorry? You made a motion. Do you mind? And Sarah? Sorry, I just didn't click the button. Thank you. Everybody good? All right. Lisa, would you please call the roll? Lutcher? Marsh? Yes. Kenyon?
 Yes.
 Eddy?
 Yes.
 Munch?
 Yes. And Mayor, do you care to vote? Yes. Okay, the resolution passed. Okay. All that concludes our business. What announcements do we have? Mayor, I have a few announcements for our citizens. Those of you who haven't yet taken down your Christmas trees, you have until the end of January to have your Christmas tree picked up at the curb by our recycle and trash folks, same day as your normal trash service. Last week, the mayor and several of us were able to attend the Arkansas Municipal League, and I wanted to hold up on behalf of Fayetteville citizens the seventh in a year Volunteer Community of the Year Award that the mayor received from Governor Asa Hutchinson. This represents 747,000 hours of community volunteerism, an economic impact of $17.5 million. So once again, thank you for this community to have such an impact. Absolutely. It is fabulous and it's a great elite group that the mayor gets to join down there in Little Rock picking up that award. I also wanted to let you know that we, another award that was received today, was received by our wastewater utility provider, CH2M, and they received an award from the Arkansas Department of Labor and several other state organizations for having ten years in a row of work for the city with no injuries on the job and a really great workforce safety plan. So that was a big deal for them. Also, finally, the... Ladies DU, Ladies Duathlon, the registration is now open for the Ladies Duathlon that will be held this summer. So that's all I have. Thank you. Yes. I should let the City Council know that the oral argument for the Arkansas Supreme Court has been scheduled for February the 2nd before our next meeting, so I will be going down there and presenting the case of the citizens who passed the ordinance, even though it's been challenged, of course, by the Attorney General as well as another group. Okay. Anything else? Thank you all very much.
