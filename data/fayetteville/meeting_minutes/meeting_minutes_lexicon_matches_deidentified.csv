We will continue to install wayfinding signage throughout the city to assist visitors."
01_17_2017,homeless; affordable housing,"Through the [ORGANIZATION] program, our goal is to house 100 homeless individuals as we did [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] will continue to assist citizens experiencing financial hardships with pet food. Strategies for affordable housing."
08_04_2020,housing crisis,"One is a teardown in a floodplain, and the other two, they're not really great options either. And so...  in thinking about you know why two hundred thousand dollars that's about the cost to just construction costs of a two bedroom one and a half bath home um and to put that into perspective to purchase a two hundred thousand dollar home um a person would need forty thousand dollars down and an income of over fifty eight thousand dollars a year meanwhile that's far above the average household income in the city of [ORGANIZATION] So when we talk about having a housing crisis in this city, that's what we're talking about."
08_04_2020,housing insecurity,"The pandemic has opened our eyes very wide to the gaps of care and, you know, the fact that there's food insecurity and housing insecurity. Yeah, we knew that, but like it is eyes wide open right now. I hear Deputy [ORGANIZATION]."
10_02_2018,housing crisis,"And that's something that we have to really take seriously in a legislative manner. So I really feel like this land use plan is adding housing supply to the city's urban core, and that really combats the housing crisis that we're having. So traditional town form is what else we're supposed to do."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"It's hard to see how commercializing that hill is going to make a difference in improving the green network. Attainable housing is another thing, and I hope that when we talk about attainable housing, we mean housing that is affordable. Our neighborhood is not well known for its affordable housing."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"Because if it's not, if we don't add the housing units there, they're going to be added elsewhere and eventually, most likely, on the outskirts, which would increase transportation costs, city public infrastructure costs, greenhouse gas emissions from single occupant vehicle transportation. So... affordable housing and environmental concerns are the issues that I care most about and spend a lot of time working on, and that's why I support this rezone request. Thank you."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"I love what they do in [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a big fan of [ORGANIZATION]. But when I asked about affordable housing, the truth was that the land is so valuable that it actually doesn't fall within affordable."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"I just, I'd love to, I wish that we had just a big sack of money that we could just reach into and take it out and just sprinkle it here and have all the things that have all this wonderful maintained green space and still have affordable housing and still have maybe not so affordable housing for people that want to move here. We need all types of housing. And, you know, it's just a hard decision, but I'm going to vote in favor of this."
10_02_2018,homeless,"I'm the director of development for [ORGANIZATION]. I just wanted to take [TIME] and read a letter that we received from [ORGANIZATION], who is the director of operations for [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] DATE0 for [LOCATION] we've hosted what we call a picnic and a play. on DATE2 in [LOCATION] where we bring a number, quite a few of the homeless clients from [ORGANIZATION]."
10_02_2018,homeless; homelessness,"As we discussed [ORGANIZATION], there will always be a homeless population for various reasons, and that one of the things we can do to treat them as humans with dignity. What [ORGANIZATION] has provided to them through this experience is a definition of that. For them to sit in theater and enjoy a world-class production, and maybe not be defined by their homelessness for [DATE]."
10_02_2018,affordable housing,"Young people are burdened with incredible amounts of student loan debt. Renting is the new reality, and we need to offer a variety of household types for people who rent. And if we want to have affordable housing, it is a lot more affordable to subdivide one lot into three separate units or multiple units to distribute the cost of that lot and land development over multiple units so that they can become more affordable."
01_04_2022,homeless,"Number two, a resolution to authorize an agreement between the city of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and GPE2. [ORGANIZATION] to provide tennis programs for federal residents in [ORGANIZATION] with automatic renewals for up to four additional [ORGANIZATION] terms at a total estimated cost of $61,000. Number three, a resolution to approve a proposal from ORG1 in the total amount of $218,[ADDRESS] improvements bond and park improvement bond project number four a resolution to approve a contract ORG3 to provide funding assistance in the amount of forty thousand dollars for maintenance and repairs at FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_04_2022,affordable housing,This is a strategy that works toward [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] plan for affordable housing. It works toward a wider range of housing options. There are already many standards which protect the city's interest related to property density and the rules that would keep a neighborhood in its own personality and what makes this neighborhood special.
01_18_2022,affordable housing,"I think looking at the city's [ORGANIZATION] plan and reading all the information on the city about planning that we need more density, we need more inflow. We simply will never get to affordable housing if we can't increase the number of units. And providing more options beyond just multi-story apartment complexes, I think will help get us closer to this goal."
01_18_2022,homeless,"but but we gotta add more houses um i know a lot of people want to protect the integrity of FAC0 but basically you can protect the art integrity of FAC0 or you can help homeless you can't do both and i know a lot of people are trying to say let's be creative  No, if you just don't allow houses, then you have decided houses should be more expensive or you've decided that you want people to [STREET] through your city."
01_18_2022,affordable housing,"And so the buy-write and expanding upon that, I think, is one of some of my concerns. Thank you. Well, what other discussion would the council like to have?  on this where you are this is an ordinance it's on the second reading or another discussion or action items from the council like I just uh I just have a comment you know I do think we need to come back to one of our core tenants that we've been working on for a while is creating affordable housing and having a house with an apartment or another rule you know space in it would have been really helpful for me when I was looking for a space for um  you know, my mom that had dementia."
01_18_2022,affordable housing,"So this is, and this is unfortunately a giant, you know,  thing that plagues are, plagues people. And I think a lot of people would like to be able to have their ailing family members or aging family members, maybe disabled family members, have a private space amongst their space. So it's not just only about affordable housing, but it's also about just taking care of people."
01_18_2022,homeless,"Okay, thank you all. Let's go to number two. a resolution to approve a budget adjustment of twenty one thousand four hundred and forty two dollars to partially fund emergency shelters for homeless persons provided by [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] continuing their care when when FAC0 when the ORG1 shelter and other shelters are fully occupied during dangerous cold nights [ORGANIZATION] i believe this is yours"
01_18_2022,homeless,"And this collaborative is made up of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG6. And they have made tentative plans to assist the homeless residents of [ORGANIZATION] when it is too cold for them to safely sleep outside. And of course, that temperature will be 15 degree wind chill or colder."
01_18_2022,homeless,okay go ahead hi there uh [ORGANIZATION] seven hills homeless center
01_18_2022,homelessness,"um this is a this is a great opportunity that um several of  the organizations that are working to end homelessness and provide for those that are suffering from homelessness have kind of come together in this collaborative to ensure that there's a gap, especially when it's extremely cold outside in [TIME] shelter in our community. So coming together, several organizations are able to kind of build a plan, rotate staffing, ensure that these individuals who in our community are most vulnerable are provided care during that time. So I'm...  the the uh the collaborative's uh case for support uh has been made available and i'm happy to answer any questions um i know that um you know in the past  This has been kind of a goal of ours, this collaboration, and it's something that we've kind of built up to."
02_02_2023,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], we have provided funding to [ORGANIZATION] and other groups who work directly with this population. Through the Pick Me Up program, people in our unsheltered community are employed to clean up litter in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], participants cleaned up 66,000 pounds of litter."
01_18_2024,housing crisis,"So overall, this project, if you look at it from a big picture, this project is more of a microcosm of [ORGANIZATION] that has...  PERPETUATED INDIVIDUAL SITE PAD DEVELOPMENT AND HAS LED TO, HAS NOT HELPED [ORGANIZATION] THE CITY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LIFE, SAFETY OR WELFARE OF THE CITIZENS OF GPE0. IN CLOSING, JUST BECAUSE A GAS STATION CAN BE BUILT THERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT A GAS STATION SHOULD BE BUILT THERE."
11_07_2024,homelessness,"probably would be more along the lines of those that are battling homelessness and mental health issues. Absolutely, so my final point is that the it comes down to collaboration and so you've seen it sounds like you've seen a lot of success with collaborating with drug [STREET] and mental health facilities and so that's that's that's also great because I  We recognize that collaboration is key as it relates to solving this crisis."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"i i  I think that there have been a lot of good points made around this, but I want to kind of recenter us to the investment that we've made in this corridor as we're kind of considering this, that we really were looking to really create, you know, a very, you know, an area that would have transit with lots of density of individuals that are, you know, walking to like services and thinking about sidewalk cafes and coffee shops. And so, you know, I have hesitation and concern when I think about the considerable spend that taxpayers are making where we really want to have, you know, bodies there in commerce versus storing goods and the fact that we store in our housing crisis."
11_07_2024,affordable housing,"Many of my classmates and friends are in the same position wanting to stay and contribute to this community but facing limited options. The city has so much to offer yet affordable housing options are scarce, especially for those of us starting out. I believe that projects like this one can make a real difference by giving people a better chance to stay in [ORGANIZATION]."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,All of the requested variances are reasonable and necessary for developing this land to its highest and best use. And any project that would get built or proposed on this property would likely need at least the forbearance of being asked by this project. Our city is currently dealing with a housing crisis as declared by this very city council DATE0.
11_07_2024,housing crisis,No. but we can't let perfect be the enemy of good when we are in a declared housing crisis i ask that you please deny this appeal and let this project move forward thank you thank you who else sorry good [TIME] my name is [ORGANIZATION] i live at [ADDRESS] i retired to [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] after spending DATE1 in real estate and multi-family property management we welcome infill in our neighborhood we just want to protect  a new development from adversely affecting our single-family homes.
11_07_2024,housing crisis; affordable housing,"First of all, I am for infill, quality infill. That's properly done. I think there's a lot of good things about this project, but  I keep hearing the argument tossed around about affordable housing, infill, and how this is going to solve the housing crisis."
11_07_2024,affordable housing,I had five calls [ORGANIZATION] This it is disingenuous It is it's really not telling the truth in my opinion took all this affordable housing or to imply that somehow this is going to be  magically cause additional cheaper housing to spring up elsewhere in walkable neighborhoods.
11_07_2024,affordable housing,"And the idea that they are going to be able to enforce any kind of parking, they would have to have a force patrolling the streets day and night.  making 800 more car trips probable in our neighborhood will not do anything to help [ORGANIZATION] or especially our neighborhood, but [ORGANIZATION] on the whole. Whatever they say about affording affordable housing, $1200 a month  For I would know last meeting they were mentioning senior citizens It's not something senior senior citizens are going to want to do this is being marketed mainly to Transients I mean, you know, I don't mean like bombs."
11_07_2024,affordable housing,"But I happen to love [ORGANIZATION], and I happen to love that neighborhood, and I walk around it a lot. You talk about affordable housing. Well, $1,200 isn't."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"This project is in alignment with the city's goals outlined in City Plan 2040 and conforms with the recent rezoning of FAC0. We're in the middle of a housing crisis. Some may not think so, but we are."
11_07_2024,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [ADDRESS] in [ORGANIZATION], and I just want to reiterate that we're not against  [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. We're just against the size of this and how it fits into our neighborhood."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,There may be some of your neighbors that are currently in your neighborhood [ORGANIZATION] that would struggle to afford to come back into your neighborhood. I couldn't afford to buy in your neighborhood [ORGANIZATION]. And that's because we do have a housing crisis and we have a lack of inventory.
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"You probably know of people that want to live in the downtown area, that want to be close to amenities, that desire to have a certain lifestyle that they're not able to have. There was talk about safety and quality of life. We've listened to stories while we declared a housing crisis of individuals that are having to make safety choices staying with domestic partnerships where there is violence because they don't have housing they can get to."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"I don't know any [STREET] we don't support this project if we really believe that we're striving for equity in [ORGANIZATION], if we're trying to make a [STREET] for everyone, and we think that we're in a housing crisis. It was mentioned by one resident, the concern that because we're in a housing crisis, that might make us make certain decisions. I want to say yes, it does make us make certain decisions."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"And if they are, please hold me accountable.  and send me packing. But I just, when I look at this, I don't. And as I said earlier, I ran, we have a housing crisis."
11_07_2024,housing crisis,"I think they're great and I will advocate for that and I will help you with that. I will help advocate for a parking district. But at [DATE], we have a housing crisis."
01_31_2017,homeless,"The only item that we have here before us [TIME] is under new business and it is an order to waive the competitive bidding to approve an emergency [ORGANIZATION] purchase of services contract with [LOCATION] homeless center with possible extensions of [ORGANIZATION] and to approve a budget adjustment kit. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] has operated a daytime facility to serve numerous homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents for over [ORGANIZATION], relying upon the support of several local churches, charities, and charitable persons, as well as some governmental support for veterans, etc.,  And whereas through generous contributions by the [PERSON] family and others, [PERSON] was able to construct and operate the [PERSON] family residential community complex for transitional housing for homeless residents of [ORGANIZATION] on leased city property south of FAC0 for [PERSON],  And whereas [PERSON] is currently suffering an operating income emergency, it is in dire need of temporary assistance from the City of [ORGANIZATION] to be able to weather the storm and continue to offer vital services to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless residents during DATE5. And whereas if [PERSON] could no longer operate its [PERSON] Family Residential Community Transitional Housing facility, currently housed citizens might become homeless again and have to live on the streets or in the woods during these harsh [DATE]."
01_31_2017,homeless,"And whereas if [ORGANIZATION] could no longer operate its [DATE] facility, the large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing hot food warm [STREET] to stay during [DATE], as well as access to a telephone and other job assistance services could not find such comparable services elsewhere. and whereas the facility and services provided by [ORGANIZATION] need to be continued and should be temporarily supported by the city taxpayers to prevent our homeless and needy residents from suffering undue hardship and deprivation during [ORGANIZATION]. Now, therefore, it be ordained by [ORGANIZATION], Section 1, that [ORGANIZATION] hereby determines that the facts shown above...  constitute an exceptional situation in which formal competitive bidding is not practical or feasible and therefore weighs formal competitive bidding and approves the attached emergency purchase of services contract with [ORGANIZATION] Homeless Center and authorized Authorizes mayor [PERSON] to sign this contract section 2 that ORG3 city of [LOCATION]-[LOCATION] hereby approves the attached budget adjustment"
01_31_2017,homeless,"And on behalf of our entire board of directors, most of whom are here, and our committed and dedicated hardworking staff, quite a few of whom are here, I just want to say thank you very much for all that the city has done for us in the past and for even considering this additional emergency funding. Thank you. I think it's important for you to know that the homeless population of [ORGANIZATION] has grown exponentially faster than the population in general, and we do not see an end to the increased need for the kinds of services we are providing, some of which are unique to [ORGANIZATION]."
01_31_2017,homeless,"We believe that what we provide is essential to the overall system of supports providing care to our neighbors in need while they move toward recovery and self-sufficiency. To cut to the chase, let me say that despite the growing need, our organization has reached the point where we can no longer maintain the full range of services for people who are homeless. We have been working diligently.  to avoid having to cut services and we have made tremendous progress."
01_31_2017,homelessness,"Closing both these facilities will have serious consequences for other organizations in [ORGANIZATION] that depend on [ORGANIZATION] to support a client or family's transition to self-sufficiency. It will also impact other programs that offer some services during [ORGANIZATION], as the demand for these services will increase greatly. As a lifelong citizen of [ORGANIZATION], I absolutely believe that all of us must work together to raise awareness of the issue of homelessness in this area and do something about it."
01_31_2017,homeless,yes yes yes  ordinance to waive competitive bidding to approve an emergency [ORGANIZATION] purchase of services contract with [ORGANIZATION] with possible extensions of up to [DATE] and to approve a budget adjustment motion to suspend the rules and move to the third and final reading [ORGANIZATION] second
01_31_2017,homeless,yes yes yes yes an ordinance to waive competitive bidding to approve an emergency [ORGANIZATION] purchase of services contract with [ORGANIZATION] with possible extensions of up to [DATE] and to approve a budget adjustment
01_31_2017,homeless,I'm sorry. I'm emotional [ADDRESS]  I was homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. I gave up.
01_31_2017,homeless,"Who else would like to address us? If you all want to speak to us, would you all start to key up at the mic?  Mayor and [ORGANIZATION], my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am homeless."
01_31_2017,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I came to [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and I was homeless, had no [STREET] to go. [PERSON] helped me get an ID, they helped me get an apartment, showers, everything."
01_31_2017,homeless,"I think I know the answer, but this may be a question for Ms. [PERSON]. I don't know. Is there a homeless center?"
01_31_2017,homeless,"so I will be voting in support okay [ORGANIZATION] I want to also express my appreciation for the services that they offer and the the admiration I have for the challenges that are faced by this board as [ORGANIZATION] said there are some people that have a perception that  there there's a struggle a continual struggle with this board and my comment is there is a continual need for this service and so again let's all unite and  and let's step up to the plate and let's make certain that the services that are provided by seven hills are available and continued without disruption so uh out of deep respect and admiration and realizing the challenges that this organization has faced for [ORGANIZATION] and will continue to face as we see this uh homeless population and people who need these services increase  I'm very happy to support this and I do hope as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and PERSON3 said this is a call out for the community to step up to the plate also you certainly seem to have the support of [ORGANIZATION] that reflects the compassion of [ORGANIZATION]  now we need to expand that out into the community and you can see by the people here and the letters that I got we do have the support in the community and people are willing to help when they know that there is the need so I'm happy to support this and I look forward to the  the prosperity, if I can say that, for the board so that we can get these services guaranteed in the future without an emergency situation."
01_31_2017,homeless,"And we believe in one another and taking care of one another and being sure that everybody feels like a partner in this city. No matter if they're homeless or the color of their skin, the religious belief or who they love, we are all one people in this city and we support one another and we're going to support [ORGANIZATION] and we're going to take care of the homeless situation in this city.  and with that [ORGANIZATION] would you please call the rope yes [PERSON]"
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"One of them was that this type of project, a house would cost maybe $10,000 more  and it would sell for $100,000 more. I can tell you with all the people that are behind me, if that were the case, they would be doing so many of these you cannot imagine. But even if that were true, even if that were true, I tell you that you have abandoned affordable housing in this city."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"And it doesn't matter whether affordable housing is on the west side of [ORGANIZATION] or whether it's in these downtown areas. We don't have the right.  to tell people that they have to give up those property rights, which may, in fact, increase the cost of building that home so they can't build there. We say $10,000 like it's nothing, and yet we sit down with people [ORGANIZATION] and we realize that families cannot afford to take that next step because of $10,000 or less."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"If he could build them for $180,000 and make a profit, he would do it. They would sell like wildfire, but they're not. So this ordinance effectively removes affordable housing for the working people."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"At the first meeting, [ORGANIZATION]...  stepped in and said, this will affect affordable housing. The firemen that were here [TIME], the police, the EMTs, the nurses, we're going to price them out of living in [ORGANIZATION]. And I think that's a crime."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"I spoke last time in relation to how this affects the banks and what the process was, but I wanted to read a statement prepared by [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] opposes [ORGANIZATION] proposed driveway and garage ordinance. [PERSON] banks recognize the housing affordability challenges facing the country and how important it is that Arkansans have affordable housing options."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"Nearly one-third of American households devote more than 30% of their income to housing. According to [PERSON]...  SB 170 Act 446 was passed by [ORGANIZATION] in the spirit of ensuring persons from all economic segments can own a home. Experts like ORG1 say affordable housing shortages are due in part to zoning and other restrictions, and ORG2 opposes any ordinance adding additional prohibitions that may result in raised housing costs."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"Right on, [ORGANIZATION]. Good point. The vision of the proponents, I don't really know what the vision or the purpose of the vision or the purpose of the ordinance was for to begin with. Whether it's affordable housing, whether it's putting eight houses on an acre, whether it was trying to minimize the footprint, a concrete footprint, whether it was to do stuff."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"I really don't know what it was.  that you were trying to do. If it's affordable housing, we have the ability to do that already. And there's zoning ordinances that you can input in these areas that you have identified that would make affordable housing just probably not popular."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"But we've heard here [TIME] that at least for some, that's true. The unintended consequence of this ordinance, in my opinion and in the opinion of the chamber, deals with workforce. And workforce is shaped by affordable housing."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], we're going to have to have about 25,100 new households, about 2,600 for seniors, about 5,500, 5,600 for students. And when you look at what the benefits are that this community or other communities in [ORGANIZATION] offer to builders, offer to those who provide affordable housing, the answer is zero. And when contrasted with the regions we benchmark against, [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, we don't have density bonuses."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"We don't have any of those things. And those are things that can help make affordable housing actually truly affordable. When you do look at the programs that are offered by the four large cities, [ORGANIZATION] will by far list the most."
11_05_2019,housing crisis,"and we're revising this to make higher quality neighborhoods, safer neighborhoods, neighborhoods with more eyes on the [STREET], and neighborhoods that contribute to a sense of [STREET] rather than just being another any town [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. you know we have a housing crisis and we need to build more people are moving here we have over 50 people a month moving to northwest [PERSON] and so we're going to have to build closer and when you have when you build closer to one another you have to be more considerate of your neighbors um"
11_05_2019,housing crisis,"We have to be more efficient. And if you really wanna attack affordability, we need to be raising wages. And I hope that our president of the chamber will work harder to bring more high wage jobs into this community because we have a wage crisis in addition to our housing crisis."
11_05_2019,housing crisis,"And so I'm really hoping that  the builders can come to us and say, hey, these are things that we could do that would give those protections without costing as much. I've mentioned I would love to see more PZDs, so tell me what you're going to do. But I have to support protections because I also feel like I have to vote for up zones because we have such a housing crisis."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"and i hope where there is a division that there can be some sort of bridging of a better process in the future for this sort of thing does not happen i think i think another big issue that was brought up i tell you a concern of mine now is that when we talk about affordable housing  I look at a city that has 2.6% unemployment and a 19% poverty rate. Yes, [ORGANIZATION], you're right."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"so i get it on affordable housing in fact it was such a good house i still live in that house DATE0 on the south end of town and the [ADDRESS]. It goes to a carport. Now, was there fancier houses I could have bought back then?"
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"No, because I couldn't afford it. I had to buy what I could afford. And that's why affordable housing is so important."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,"So we need affordable housing. Stormwater issues are issues. And that needs to be addressed, and I want you all to understand this."
11_05_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"Number five. the ordinance commend chapter 159 fee exemptions of the federal unified development code to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees water and wastewater impact fees police and public safety impact fees and fire protection system impact fees kit Whereas presently [ORGANIZATION] exempts affordable housing projects from paying building permit fees, water and wastewater impact fees, police and public safety impact fees, and fire protection system impact fees,  And whereas recently Mayor [PERSON] became aware that homeless shelters are not exempt from paying these fees and directed staff to prepare an amendment to [ORGANIZATION] to treat homeless shelters the same as affordable housing projects with respect to the payment of permit and impact fees."

11_05_2019,homeless,"construction of single-family, non-profit, multi-family supportive housing and homeless shelters funded wholly or primarily by federal [ORGANIZATION] grants, non-profit service organizations such as [ORGANIZATION], housing and urban development housing loans and similar programs designed to provide affordable, owner-occupied single-family residence to low-income individuals,  Nonprofit multifamily supportive housing and homeless shelters shall be exempted from the payment of impact fees pursuant to this ordinance by the impact fee administrator. Okay. Mayor and [ORGANIZATION], this is a minor code amendment related to Chapter 159 of our [ORGANIZATION]."
11_05_2019,homeless; affordable housing,"We were working with a local nonprofit on a [INSTITUTION], and they asked if they had to pay fees, and we said yes. And we read through the code, and they technically are not exempt, although the council has exempted affordable housing. So this is really just clarifying that homeless shelters are also exempt from those impact fees."
11_05_2019,homeless,"but I was just wondering if  Well, since we've not had to do it before, we've never collected anything, and this will just ensure we will not collect anything from a [INSTITUTION]. So I don't think it really will happen very often. Okay."
11_05_2019,homelessness,"Hello everybody, I'm PERSON0. I wasn't planning on talking, and also don't want to delay things, but I just want to thank you and staff for finding these opportunities to help people in need. My family goes to church, to [ORGANIZATION], with a lot of people who live in poverty and experience homelessness, sometimes for short periods of time, sometimes for long periods of time."
11_05_2019,affordable housing,PERSON0. PERSON0. well it's a real shame that all of the people who are so concerned about affordable housing are not here to advocate on behalf of this
11_05_2019,homeless,"yes yes yes yes And in order to amend Chapter 159 fee exemptions of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees, water and wastewater impact fees, police and public safety impact fees, and fire protection system impact fees."
11_05_2019,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION]? Yes. At [PERSON], amend Chapter 159, fee exemptions of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees, water and wastewater impact fees, police and public safety impact fees, and fire protection system impact fees."
11_05_2019,homeless,"okay any final comments from the council i would like to note one statistic i want to be sure that we remember that when you look at the homeless population about 30 percent the homeless population of veterans about 30 percent of children so two-thirds of the homeless population that we see in this city see their veteran or child and this is one of the ways that we can help relieve a little bit of that  Need and I want to thank you all Okay, at least would you please call PERSON0 yes"
11_05_2019,homeless,"I'm wearing my flag in honor of the veterans, and I'm glad we passed the [INSTITUTION] because veterans are one of the primary recipients, hopefully, of what you all have done. So I won't see you all [ORGANIZATION] unless you're out marching around somewhere. Thanks for that reminder."
01_05_2016,affordable housing,Yes. I just want to say thank you to the developers for all your hard work to build some affordable housing that meets our [ORGANIZATION] city plan goals. I think this is a really good compromise.
01_03_2023,homeless,"Number nine, a resolution to approve a [ORGANIZATION] extension of the contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $590,789 for rehabilitation of sanitary sewer manholes throughout ORG1.

I'll entertain a motion to accept the consent agenda is read."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Our women after they finish our [ORGANIZATION] program are really struggling to find safe and affordable housing. in this community that they want to stay in, that they have flourished in. And this is gonna give them [LOCATION] to save money, build their credit, and get a little further away from their charges and their criminal background, which unfortunately causes a wide number of folks who own properties to not rent to them, especially in the safe areas we want our women to continue their recovery in."
01_03_2023,unhoused,And that's incredibly important. We we also recognize and know that we have a growing unhoused population and that's not OK for us. And so I would really like to put a friendly proposal forward that we.  uh tabled us until our [ORGANIZATION] meeting we have a conversation about how we spend the remainder of these dollars
01_03_2023,homeless,"and people who are employed, and people who don't want to become homeless, and don't want to go stand in line at the pantry line. And so I need you guys to think very broadly that this is people. These are jobs."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And we also, after thinking it through and speaking with some of you, we had kind of thought that we would also like to pledge, and I don't know exactly how we'd go about that, but we'd like to pledge 20% of this project to affordable housing. That's kind of something that after discussing back and forth with the partners, which I'm one of, we thought that it would help bring in for the community. After listening to you guys [TIME], we've heard multiple times people speaking of the need for affordable housing."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"So with that being said, this is not exactly set in stone, but this is something that we kind of [TIME] that, you know, for the affordable housing to go in the back back there for [ADDRESS]. So the four units to the south would be the affordable housing. Is that correct?"
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Well, 20% of the project. So if we got more, obviously, as developers, we'd love to have more to try to make it more feasible. But as it sits right now with 10 units would be two of them affordable housing."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And I've had the opportunity of visiting the property with you. Yes, sir. And so thank you so much for what you said about your commitment to affordable housing."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And 20% affordable housing is a start. However, we are talking about doing something, you know, it's very counter to what [ORGANIZATION] would do by lifting a tree preservation. You know, it's not incumbent upon, you know, the council or city staff to make sure that you as a developer, you know, prosper or make  profit, right?"
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And so one of the discussions that we did have was about making sure that there's a win-win situation because we want local developers to continue to look at projects like this in the future because we have a crisis on our hands for affordable housing. And 20% again is a start, but what I really want to understand with you is how open and movable are you on the possibility that more of these units would potentially be in more of a rent controlled environment, potentially tied in with one of our city programs that assist some of our very vulnerable community members. So,"
01_03_2023,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] has to win. We've got to win. Affordable housing has to win.
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Definitely keep the property a lot cleaner and it would add to the trees for sure. PERSON0, I have some questions and comments. My first question is, have you applied for a bill of assurance as it relates to affordable housing?"
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"So that was another goal that we had by getting more units would also add more to affordable housing for you guys on that side of things. So in another essence, a win win for everybody. But we have not talked to anybody going forward on that at all."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Okay, and I think we talked about this, but just to make sure, what definition do we have as it relates to affordable housing? So you know, Miss [PERSON] and I kind of talked about that and I had the exact same questions and I know that there's certain city organizations that I believe that we can put this into that fall in this."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"The best trees are along one side, but there's also some good ones at the front of the property. And I am just not really in favor of taking this tree preservation easement off of this property. I think, and I think when we talk about, you know, I think affordable housing is like waving a little carrot in front of everybody."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"It sounds good, but what do we give up in order to get two or three apartments that are supposed to be affordable housing? And the replacement properties are  are not the same. It's not, you know, they're not equated to this because they don't have oak trees on them."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,And I know about affordable housing and I understand we have a shortage of homes. I understand that completely.
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Is it the responsibility of the new owner kit or? Well, we've got great difficulties with proof and so  This might, if you, if [ORGANIZATION] decided because a tree preservation area has been somewhat denuded of its trees, not taken care of, and even maybe actually had trees cut down, and then comes to [ORGANIZATION] and says, well, we don't have very good trees here, so now let me put affordable housing there. If we fall for that, then we're going to probably endanger many, many tree preservation areas all over town.  where they could be developed with new housing because then the tree preservation area for some reason that it's very difficult for us to prove no longer has a lot of good trees in it."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"And so when somebody can bring up a proposal that is attractive in some ways, like promising affordable housing, which I don't know what that means, and we would have to have a very, very strict definition. We'd have to have rent control basically And the state law doesn't allow us to impose rent control in [ORGANIZATION]."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"I don't think we can include any conversation, quite honestly, with affordable housing, using it as a carrot to  uh take away the preservation issue because we don't know what affordable housing is we can't i mean sitting here we can't give you a definition of what affordable housing is so how can we hold a developer to create affordable housing to get his tree tree preservation through i don't think that's fair to anybody it's not fair to the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] it's not fair to developers certainly not fair to staff because who's going to monitor that so i think we've got to look at that and um  In this situation, I just don't think it's a good thing. Although I'd love to approve it because I think a property owner has the right to develop it as long as it's prudent."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Well, I don't know who determines what's a good tree and what's not a good tree. And we're not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes and try to, you know, give you apples for oranges. We're just trying to,  develop a piece of property in an area where housing is still needed and yes if it was going to be more palatable palatable to do something from the standpoint of affordable housing and mr [ORGANIZATION] called [ORGANIZATION]  to ask them what um what affordable housing was so I think that somewhere in this town there is a definition of affordable housing it's not something that I get to to determine or you all have to determine but [ORGANIZATION] itself has one"
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"When you talk about affordable housing, you do have to define affordable for who. [ORGANIZATION] has guidelines. The public policy rule of thumb is your housing expenses shouldn't exceed 30% of your income."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"Mayor, my name is [ORGANIZATION] for [ADDRESS]. I'm also the third partner in this project and I'm the one with that does most of the numbers. So when to answer Mr. [PERSON]'s question, when it comes to affordable housing, we had gone and contacted the housing authority."
01_03_2023,affordable housing,"So for the definition of affordable housing and what we're proposing was the guidelines that [ORGANIZATION] provided and is on their website and sent to us and  We came up with the 20% number because we pretty much lose $100 a month on those two units. And with the rate of interest of where you're having to borrow money nowadays at 7.5% to 8%, we would potentially make it up with the eight other units by renting them out at premiums to students. If we were able to get 16 units, we could feasibly do four units in the  at that $750 range for a one bedroom and make up for it on our 12 other units."
01_03_2023,housing crisis,We have a housing crisis. That's the reality. But you can't break your word.
01_15_2019,homeless,"A common thread that runs throughout our goals is to do more for those in need. We depend on our community development block grant funding and city operational budget for housing and transportation, assistance programs, homeless services, case management, and to aid numerous agencies that serve several similar missions for our neighbors who have difficult hurdles to overcome. We will continue to work with and support the private and nonprofit options for housing through staff support, development policies, and partnerships with public lands to help foster more attainable housing."

03_19_2024,affordable housing,"The only thing I would like to say is that, unfortunately, I don't see it as being the answer to affordable housing. even these little houses cost money to be built and once you put a new piece of Once you develop your land Your property tax get gets redone and you get evaluated at current market value so for instance if I put three or four or five or six or seven or eight and nine or ten of these on my property  I would instantly see an enormous tax increase, especially if I held on to the properties and just held them as rentals."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"You're not going to be able to stick with your old tax rate and your old, you know, 5% per year if you're a homeowner, or 10% per year increase of its investment property. It'll start.  up at the top so i don't see them as being the answer to creating affordable housing but i love the program"
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"But what I'm the most excited, we've had conversations since our [ORGANIZATION] workshop for [ORGANIZATION] and talked about as we tackle some of the things that are outlined in our city plan, you know, being very thoughtful about that.  tying back to what those goals are and so clearly so clearly additionally on that page it's very clear from anybody in the public to be able to see exactly where that ties back to so i really applaud that additional effort and thank you um i wanted to publicly acknowledge that i also did want to speak to the comments that were made from the public about that this isn't the silver bullet for affordable housing  you know that's that's true we don't know this is a pilot and a test i think we've we've known in other areas where they've gone with limited designs that maybe they've only ended up over [LOCATION] with a handful of production units"
03_19_2024,homelessness,"People came in large groups to talk about their skyrocketing rents, their struggles with homelessness or being at risk for homelessness, and what it means for them to be pushed further and further out of our city. We heard from [ORGANIZATION] residents, those who used to live here but no longer can, and from those who are shut out from moving here. It was a powerful moment for residents from all walks of life to share their common issue of finding and keeping housing in our town."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"It was then decided by this coalescing group of people to host more events and invite more of the public to participate. We worked with [ORGANIZATION] to host a second housing town hall on [ORGANIZATION]. This second event was an opportunity for us to come together as a group to acknowledge the crisis we saw in the first meeting, and secondly, to brainstorm potential solutions to the housing crisis."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"HOWEVER, THE MOMENTUM AND ENERGY THAT HAD BEEN BUILT BY OUR GROUP P[LOCATION]HED [LOCATION] TO GET IT DONE. THE RESOLUTION THAT WE RESIDENTS WORKED ON TOGETHER IS BY NO MEANS A FIX ALL FOR OUR HO[LOCATION]ING CRISIS. BUT IT CONTAINS IN IT THE HOPES OF"
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"But first, I'd like to say thanks to each of you for serving as council members. I know it must feel strange to be counted among the people responsible for tackling a housing crisis. You did not create, but on the contrary, have all worked to address in one [STREET] or another."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,What does that tell us? It tells us that there is a giant lack of affordable housing in our city right now. The definition of affordable housing means that one's mortgage or rent is less than 30% of their income.
03_19_2024,affordable housing,Let's choose to be a leader in the state. Let's choose not to displace people. Let's choose to include them Let's choose how to figure out how to provide them with safe clean and affordable housing Thank you for all you do for the city.
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"On the panel was a real estate agent, a staff member from [ORGANIZATION], the affordable housing group at [ORGANIZATION], sitting next to people who lived in public housing and people who stay at ORG2. So there's the learned expertise and the lived expertise together coming up with solutions. Some of the solutions that folks came up with were like,  Could we inventory the city-owned land that could be evaluated for use in partnership with affordable housing developments?"
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has passed this. What about [PERSON]? Could bonds that would be issued through [ORGANIZATION] be part of financing affordable housing in [PERSON]?"
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"Many people don't know that [ORGANIZATION] was originally titled [ORGANIZATION], and it is authorized to issue revenue bonds to finance residential housing, health care, and related facilities to persons of low or moderate income and the elderly. Okay.  Have we run this idea out yet? What about creating a housing trust fund, a fund with dedicated revenue sources that could aid in producing or preserving our affordable housing stock?"
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"I'd like you to imagine a task force that has people from every domain, learned expertise and lived expertise. A task force with city staff from [ORGANIZATION], with a representative from the city attorney's office to vet the legal side of things, a representative from an affordable housing developer here in northwest [ORGANIZATION], and the foundations whose mission is to  accelerate and produce affordable housing, specifically [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and nonprofit developers like ORG2 and [PERSON]. These are the people that could look at a package of policies and say, this kind of reform would make [PERSON] the most appealing [STREET] to develop affordable quality housing."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"Those experts alongside a representative from the university, since university growth and  is certainly part of the crisis we're facing in housing. And students at the university are part of the lifeblood of [ORGANIZATION] and deserve to have safe, decent, affordable housing while they're advancing their education. Alongside these experts from learning would sit people who are struggling to pay their rent on the edge."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"It is my belief that [ORGANIZATION] cares for its hardworking citizens. The actions speak louder than words. If this council truly values its residents, I urge you to vote in favor of the housing crisis resolution crafted by the very people that bring our community to life."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"One, implement the [ORGANIZATION]'s growth concept map. Two, develop and maintain key performance metrics that will help guide and evaluate future actions. Three, develop a community education campaign to address the issues of affordability, such as loss of existing affordable housing and rising costs, including transportation."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"Four, create affordable housing projects on publicly owned land and establish partnerships with developers to provide flexible, affordable housing. affordable workspace and housing. And five, create a real-time database of available affordable housing units, services, resources, and incentives to strengthen the process of connecting qualified buyers and renters with affordable housing."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,I have received a beautiful gift in the fact that I've gotten to work within my community and with multiple nonprofit organizations to help those and support those within our beautiful community. We are in a housing crisis. Thinking anything else simply ignores the available data and we want change.
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"Even further, tying up money that should go towards actually helping our city. I want to continue to be proud of this city. Please vote yes on declaring a housing crisis and working with the community you represent to see that same community thrive."
03_19_2024,housing crisis; affordable housing,"We can only do so much planning with what very little we have. I do ask all of you all to declare a housing crisis and come to a solution together to not only ensure the students, but the residents that do live here [ORGANIZATION] for safe, affordable housing, as well as holding landlords accountable for  to provide said safe, affordable housing. Thank you."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,I've seen friends and I've seen neighbors have to move out and have no [STREET] to go. My next door neighbor just recently moved out because the house was barely habitable. and now it's just sitting there she got an electric bill for over [ADDRESS] to sustain that i know that's not part of the conversation but the people are saying this is a crisis that's why it is called the housing crisis resolution and the people want to be part of the conversation so here we are the people um it takes a village and we are all the village  So please vote in support of the housing resolution.
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"It's something to think about. I do think we need affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And if you don't like the word crisis, call it challenge."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I'd like to start off by thanking [ORGANIZATION] Members [PERSON] and [PERSON] for proposing the approval of this resolution. Where to start?  As I've looked over the political landscape, I've become very involved in watching what's going on over [ORGANIZATION]. It's evident that the whole nation is facing a housing crisis in one form or another."
03_19_2024,homelessness,"Some have proposed to take care of this issue by criminalizing homelessness and trying to move people out of encampments, which I feel is very shameful. Personally speaking, I hope that y'all go work on this, that y'all pass this resolution, and that you're very vigorous about doing it. I can speak mainly for myself, anecdotally."
03_19_2024,homeless,"And there are people who are waiting for that, people who need that, people who, with the lack of a housing, are out in the elements. And I know this isn't all that's needed. It won't solve every homeless situation, but I just hope you do."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"Housing crisis, it's a housing catastrophe. So as a resident of [PERSON], I can only pray that this resolution gets passed immediately. Thank you."

03_19_2024,homeless,"You know, so I, you know, I see it and it just really makes me sad. It makes me sad to hear people say, we're going to go help people that are homeless and without food in other countries and they're not looking in their own back door."
03_19_2024,homeless,"Just like we heard, moving is expensive. You've tied up your life savings in [ORGANIZATION], you know trying to make this [STREET] a better [STREET] And you don't have a [STREET] to live so I was essentially homeless for [ORGANIZATION] I was leaving living on couches and spare bedrooms at the at the behest of good friends and  just so I could focus on growing my business."

03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I live in FAC0 at [ADDRESS]. I've dealt with the increasing housing crisis for [ORGANIZATION] now. I've lived in roach-infested apartments where the management was apathetic to the problem, but no less demanding for the rent payment [DATE]."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I've experienced sexual and domestic violence in [ORGANIZATION]. I would say I've put myself in scary situations with abusive partners, but the reality is that the housing crisis did this. Where do you go when you can't afford a one-bedroom apartment alone, but you can scrape by as long as you walk on eggshells and bite your tongue?"
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I know I'm not the only one who has experienced this due to the housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. I've been fortunate to crash on couches several times, and I'm grateful for the friends and community I've found that have helped me escape these situations. We won't find solutions for problems we aren't willing to talk about, and we must be honest and call these problems what they are."
03_19_2024,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Everyone deserves safe, healthy, and affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. Please vote yes on the resolution to declare a housing crisis. Thank you."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"And most of those people used to be service industry employees here, my friends that have moved to [ORGANIZATION]. So it's a crisis of people not being able to afford to live here and literally finding that one of the biggest cities in [PERSON] is more accessible to live in, which is kind of crazy if you think about it. I really just would love to see a housing crisis declared because it's only going to get worse as things..."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I live off of FAC0 in Ward 4. I am one of hundreds of [ORGANIZATION] residents currently staring down the barrel of what should officially be named a housing crisis. I have spent more time than I cared to count trying to find somewhere, I have spent more time than I cared to count trying to find somewhere  in the city that is affordable to my current income levels, and I have been deeply challenged in that search."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"Since I have a little bit more time for myself, we've taken in multiple people over the course of [ORGANIZATION] while they tried desperately every waking moment to find housing and holding them while they cried. Not a single human being deserves to be that kind of scared. Please vote yes to declaring the housing crisis."
03_19_2024,homeless; housing crisis,"I have called [ORGANIZATION] home since [ORGANIZATION], and I've experienced the housing crisis firsthand. In [LOCATION], I found myself needing to look for an apartment on short notice, ending up being homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and living with friends while I searched for an apartment that I could afford, was close enough to campus, and was actually livable. Even back then, apartment hunting was a bleak experience."
03_19_2024,unhoused,"We pride ourselves on being a proactive and progressive city, and there is a lot that our city has done, but that doesn't change that we are in the middle of a crisis still. If you're more well off, crisis might seem like a strong word, but try telling one of the growing number of unhoused people in the city or a single mother that is part of the 16,[ADDRESS] [PERSON]"
03_19_2024,homelessness,"And I want to emphasize to everybody that there are a lot of solutions being developed out there in the world. Cities that are facing difficulties far greater than ours,  are developing solutions that are dealing with housing and homelessness problems that deserve to be looked at because there's stuff out there that we can use in order to actually begin solving for this issue. And there's a lot of reasons to think that a task force and good staff like we have and that I hope that we will get more staff with good expertise on this issue  There are a lot of things that can be done and we're not talking about [ORGANIZATION] of people and I can GPE0 where they have you know 200,000 people on the streets."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,There is still time for [ORGANIZATION]. There is still time for our city to not fall to what has gotten other places. I stayed in a home with my abuser for too long because I couldn't find affordable housing.
03_19_2024,homeless,"Paying rent has been a struggle. Luckily, I have the support of my family, but if I didn't, I would definitely be homeless. I believe in the people and community of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"Keep housing affordable for the people of [ORGANIZATION] and the surrounding communities. I myself have experienced a housing crisis. Not knowing where you're going to be able to afford to live is terrifying, and no one should have to deal with this."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"I was born and raised in [ORGANIZATION], and I feel like I'm being pushed out. We deserve affordable housing. I can't afford to live in [ORGANIZATION] anymore."
03_19_2024,homelessness,"Mayor, you said you didn't want a whole lot of emotional stuff earlier, and it's an emotional issue but I'm going to try and I'm going to stick to the numbers for a little bit. But first, I do want to thank you all for the work that has been done by the city to address housing and homelessness. A couple of versions of that list going around, and by my count, there's nine different things listed on that."
03_19_2024,homelessness,"That work deserves to be recognized, and I'm glad that that will probably happen [TIME]. But I want to look a little closer at what's in there. Of those nine items, three address homelessness, four are specific for low-middle income residents."
03_19_2024,homeless,And your housing report has those numbers. It really gets the scale of what we're talking about. The [ORGANIZATION] pit count had 302 homeless people in [ORGANIZATION].
03_19_2024,homeless,"I'll add to that, the schools reported another 2,600 homeless students. Their definitions are a little different. They include folks who are doubled up."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"People have said before me that they hope we declare a housing crisis [TIME], but what they're really saying is I hope that you will work [ORGANIZATION] to fix the housing crisis. So vote yes, name it, and then let's get aggressive on solutions. Thank you."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I've chosen to move to [ORGANIZATION] twice, largely because of the cost of living in [ORGANIZATION], and it's more expensive now than it was then. I am here to support the resolution. I think it's important for the city to go on the record declaring a housing crisis."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"All of this is wonderful, but I believe that it is piecemeal that we have had somewhat slapped together, or not slapped together, but piecemeal approach to this, and that we need an all-hands-on-deck approach at this moment. So I would really advocate promoting a coherent and rigorous attempt to deal with the housing crisis. Thank you."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I live right off FAC0, [TIME] walking from FAC1 there. I know you've heard a lot of stories about struggles within the housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm going to try to keep this brief, but let you know, building off of the pandemic,  This sort of metaphor I heard from a previous speaker that I am in the river right now."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"And these are not just teenagers, these are [ORGANIZATION], people who have been working and saving to try to get a home for a while now. I really appreciate that the council is listening to us on this. I really appreciate that this resolution has been put forward to declare a housing crisis"
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"and I hope that you will vote in favor of it. But whether or not you vote in favor of it, the housing crisis exists. It doesn't matter what we call it."
03_19_2024,homeless,"A crisis is what it is by definition. 22% that is the number of students who are classified as homeless in [ORGANIZATION] according to the data that we received [ORGANIZATION] in our staff training. If that isn't a crisis, I don't know what is."
03_19_2024,homeless; homelessness,"I'm the CEO of [ORGANIZATION]. I reside at 708 [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. First and foremost, we are grateful for the city of GPE2 for being a leader in Northwest [PERSON] and showing a commitment by providing financial support to our community members that are experiencing homelessness."
03_19_2024,homeless; homelessness,"I would love to spend a lot of time [TIME] talking about the success of the shelter that we've opened up where we've got 16 people who are thriving and 16 more coming in, but I'm here to address the original resolution and the homeless side of it. Because homelessness was in there in what we've seen, what we're experiencing as an organization. You've seen [TIME] there's a broad narrative of housing."
03_19_2024,homelessness,What's the definition of a house? A house. What is homelessness people who are unsheltered people who are in school people who are doubling up all of those things?
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"To be housed and to be able to reengage in society and the community, that's our number one priority. Yes, there's a nationwide housing crisis. I moved here from [ORGANIZATION] and experienced it, but the ecosystem was different."
03_19_2024,homeless; unhoused,"As an organization that serves the homeless, we are required or strongly encouraged to participate with two [ORGANIZATION]-funded entities for funding and collaborations to help our community, housed and unhoused. That's [PERSON] and ORG2. Both of these entities could better serve the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] were they functioning at a higher level."
03_19_2024,homelessness,"People may have houses now, but if they're not and we don't have that ecosystem and that net, we're in trouble. Key responsibilities of local housing authorities as shared on their website include workforce housing programs, rental assistance and housing vouchers, private landlord incentives, fair housing and anti-discrimination efforts, and community development and planning. Of the [ORGANIZATION], it's to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and it's designed to promote community-wide planning and strategic uses of resources to address and prevent homelessness, as stated on the [ORGANIZATION] website."
03_19_2024,homeless; unhoused,"I'm a bike commuter. I bike in from [ORGANIZATION]. And because of that, I see the unhoused, the homeless camps that are off the trail when it's snowing, when there's ice and rain, when it's 100 degrees."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"As one of the resolutions reiterated, the housing crisis is a systemic issue. We know it goes well beyond [ORGANIZATION]. However, I have a lot of faith in this council and in our city because climate change is a global issue, but we excel at being environmentally innovative and proactive and I think even recently got another award for that work."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,The other language that I hope that you support is having the task force. I already know that it's important to this council to address affordable housing in our community. I've been to several meetings where there have been many long nights of people saying that we know that it's an issue that we want to tackle but this perhaps is not the solution as they debate how to use grant money and whether to apply for grants.
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"During COVID-19, there was a health advisory board that was created to address the pandemic. And so again, I feel that there's precedence for these two things. So thank you for considering these and please consider declaring the housing crisis a public emergency and having a task force to help address it."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,But this city cannot afford to put its head in the sand any longer. We're going through a housing crisis. Whether or not this resolution's wording is approved.
03_19_2024,housing crisis; unhoused,"I'm here representing the most vulnerable, which to declare a housing crisis, we have to have vulnerable and that would be the children and the unhoused and we have all that. I was most recently unhoused myself. I slept on bathroom floors in tents."
03_19_2024,unhoused,I sat next to many of these unhoused and ate with them [ORGANIZATION]. And I can tell you that they are the most vulnerable in the community. And they need our support.
03_19_2024,housing crisis,I'm so proud of living here in [ORGANIZATION] and a large part of that is because of you. I'm here to express my full support of the [ORGANIZATION] Housing Action Coalition's Housing Crisis Resolution. I'm a clinical social worker and I have a private practice at [ADDRESS].
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I'm currently seeing the impacts of our housing crisis on my clients and on members of the community from a range of age and socioeconomic status. It has become so pressing to a percentage of my clients that I've had to open a food pantry in my office recently.  because so many of my and my colleagues' clients are food insecure for the first time ever. Obviously, [ORGANIZATION]'s hierarchy of needs, people are really unable to receive the full benefit of their therapeutic services if they are struggling with housing and food costs."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"We all love and support our [ORGANIZATION] and we know that you've both done so much work on this, each and every one of you, and we need more support to help combat the crisis that's threatening to choke our lovely city. You know, also I'll say this earlier, there was a comment about making sure we don't get emotional, but this is emotional. The housing crisis is emotional."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"Still though, I feel lucky because without my father's land, I know we would never be able to afford a home here. effectively forcing us out of our beloved city. I have seen so many loved ones and friends, long-term residents included, move out of [ORGANIZATION] because of housing prices, driven to rent and buy in less competitive areas, leaving the city and even the state they love because they simply cannot find housing, let alone affordable housing."
03_19_2024,unhoused,"Often when I explore [ORGANIZATION] with my daughter, I am hyper aware of the dichotomy that exists here. A beautifully charming FAC0 with tents visible through the trees. An affluent [INSTITUTION] with unhoused persons hiding from the elements."
03_19_2024,affordable housing,"The gorgeous houses that line [ORGANIZATION] with the shabby apartment buildings with [ORGANIZATION] long waiting lists not even a mile away. I call one of those shabby apartments home and over [LOCATION], it took my partner and I [ORGANIZATION] of searching and applying to finally find an available apartment. The search for affordable housing has only gotten harder."
03_19_2024,affordable housing; unhoused,"Lack of affordable housing leads to more unhoused, leads to dropouts and job loss, leads to crime and increased drug use, and leads to a community in an ever-growing crisis. this council has an opportunity to lessen the suffering of our community [ORGANIZATION] is in desperate need of an actual plan for all residents this resolution is the start to that actionable plan vote yes thank you thank you [PERSON] go ahead PERSON2"
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"And I've heard many of us here in the council use the term housing crisis. I think at one time or another, all of us have. And.  I want to say, you know, there's no shame in accepting that term and there's no blame in accepting that we're in that situation."
03_19_2024,homeless,"I'm happy to. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] acknowledges the staff who currently work together in support of increasing the housing supply under the direction of the Mayor and Chief of Staff to identify opportunities for improved public engagement through city growth master planning processes at the local and regional levels,  appropriate infrastructure cost shares and economic vitality initiatives in the following areas development services long range planning community resources economic vitality public works and water sewer infrastructure. And whereas [ORGANIZATION] also recognizes that the ORG1 has taken substantial steps to assist residents, including entering into a [ORGANIZATION] lease of ORG1 property with ORG2 for emergency sheltering, providing $337,000 in maintenance funding to that facility, and providing an additional $801,926 in financial assistance to [ORGANIZATION] services to homeless residents DATE2."
03_19_2024,homeless,"Administering a housing rehabilitation slash repair program and housing redevelopment program. Designing a permit ready building design program soon to be implemented that will reduce costs of construction for property owners in the program area. Administering the [ORGANIZATION] program, which has provided $2,576,580 in assistance [ORGANIZATION] to provide permanent supportive housing and ongoing counseling, life skills training, and advocacy services to formerly homeless individuals and families."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"There was a validity question of why call it a housing crisis? And to me, I was gobsmacked because I feel like we've said housing crisis in this chamber so many times. And I did find that in reviewing the record."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"I was just gonna say, we had a big meeting and we've been working on the public housing crisis. We had quite a few people here. It's rezonings like this, this may not be perfect."
03_19_2024,housing crisis,"and but you know in reference to you know how do you solve a housing crisis well we do need density i think that this goes along well with the new development happening on old [ORGANIZATION] right at the end of old wire next to FAC0 you've got a you've got a neighborhood right here where those kids can walk  The kids up on [ORGANIZATION], we had, even when cows were there, I don't think they'd allow this now, but when it was cow fields, they had little stairs that went over the barbed wire fence."
01_16_2018,affordable housing,"A focus on business retention and attraction, desirable new retail shops, entrepreneurship, and innovation, education and workforce, arts and culture, quality of life, affordable housing, and sustainability are anchors to this goal, all delivered through a strong marketing and communications plan. We will show data-driven performance matrix to track business and job growth  wages, growth in sales tax generating businesses, and inquiries from prospective employers. Also in support of workforce development, our city's welcoming plan will foster a more vibrant and diverse community."
01_16_2018,homelessness,"Our [ORGANIZATION]  through the federally funded ORG1, continues to provide services for [ORGANIZATION], housing rehabilitation for low-income citizens, and transportation assistance for seniors and disadvantaged youth. We have phenomenal volunteers and staff who operate ORG2. In [ORGANIZATION],  we reunited 725 pets with their owners and we found new homes for 1,140 animals."
01_16_2016,homeless; affordable housing,"Our goal of [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] is to assist homeless persons to obtain affordable housing and assist persons at risk of becoming homeless to secure affordable permanent housing, particularly disadvantaged citizens and persons with special needs. We held the fifth DATE1 Festival in conjunction with First [DATE]. Festivale is a celebration of the many cultures of the [ORGANIZATION] and provides exposure to many organizations, groups, performers, and artists in our region, our ORG1."
02_01_2022,homeless,"an ordinance to waive the requirements of former competitive bidding and to approve the contract with [ORGANIZATION] center in the amount of 113 thousand four hundred dollars service to homeless and needy residents in federal in [ORGANIZATION]. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] has operated a daytime facility to serve numerous homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents for over [LOCATION], relying upon the support of several local churches, charities, and charitable persons, as well as some governmental support for veterans, etc.,  And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] City Council approved a funding request for the [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] to maintain the operations of [ORGANIZATION], and although funding for the center by donors has improved, a shortfall still exists that jeopardizes its ability to continue to offer vital services to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless residents. And whereas if [PERSON] could no longer operate its [LOCATION],  Currently housed citizens might become homeless again and have to live on the streets or in the woods."
02_01_2022,homeless,"And whereas IF-7 [ORGANIZATION] could no longer operate its [DATE] facility, the large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing, hot food, and a warm [STREET] to stay during [ORGANIZATION], as well as access to a telephone and other job assistance services, could not find such comparable services elsewhere. and whereas the facilities and services provided by [ORGANIZATION] are required to be continued and continue to be supported by the City in order to prevent our homeless and needy residents from suffering undue hardship or deprivation. Now therefore it be ordained by [ORGANIZATION], Section 1  that ORG2 of the City of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], hereby determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical  and therefore waives requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a contract between [LOCATION], [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] Homeless Center in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and [PERSON] residents and authorizes Mayor [PERSON] to sign this contract."
02_01_2022,homeless,"Yes. In order to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And this is an ordinance that's on the second reading."
02_01_2022,homeless,yes [PERSON] yes [PERSON] yes PERSON2 yes  in order to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of 113 thousand four hundred dollars for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION].
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"Their position was based on similar compatibility arguments of staff and also an understanding that it is very difficult currently to find land for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].  uh in terms of public comments on the request uh we have received some uh [ORGANIZATION] it wasn't at the meeting but uh prior to the meeting there were several inquiries about the request uh but no statements of support or uh or opposition and with that i'm happy to hand it off to [ORGANIZATION] and i'm available for questions thank you okay with the [TIME] like speak for the council you have [TIME]  Thank you. Mr. [PERSON], good to see you."
02_01_2022,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And we accomplished this vision by doing what we're doing [TIME], and that's bringing people together to build homes, communities, and hope. And after [ORGANIZATION], we certainly need more hope. As you know, [ORGANIZATION] is experiencing an affordable housing crisis."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"And more recently, I think it was in the news [ORGANIZATION], I think at least one council member and the mayor were there [LOCATION]. The consultant team worked on the FAC0 property, which is an affordable housing development out on [ORGANIZATION] that just broke ground. I do think it was [LOCATION]."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,You could get all different kinds of output drawings. And  We have a lot of building that's going on right now. There's also been a lot of studies that have been done in our area about the lack of affordable housing.
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"I like that song a lot. But with the options that I see that will be available, you'll go in, you'll go to planning, and it's not that much different than if you go into a subdivision where they have several different choices of designs and you get to choose, except there's going to be a lot more opportunity with this the [STREET] I understand it. If you can build a house and save some money, say you already have your lot, and you can get in there quicker, then I think that that is, we keep talking about affordable housing."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"and they don't end up doing anybody any good. So, to kind of wrap things up here, as a side note, I greatly understand the need for affordable housing, but at least last time we were here, my understanding was that these homes were going to be $350,000, which doesn't, I'm a PhD student at the university, that doesn't scream affordable to me. So to me the solution seems very simple."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"I know I don't want to waste my else's time, but you're also talking about affordable housing. You know, if you look at the seven homes that is surrounding the average price is 196 a square foot. So even if you put,  [DATE] was that [TIME] home with no group if you look at the map also none of my garage is none of that covered parking there's a single house in a mile radius that does not have that and it sits on four acres on the trail so it's not comparable to the entire neighborhood at all there's no parking inside and it's not affordable"
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"Yeah. So that's definitely a concern of mine. My other concern is that we are talking about affordable housing and our median income is $47,000 a year."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"And we're saying that this size home is going to provide affordable housing for people at what, $325,000, $350,000? I'm not really sure what the number is. It's bounced up and down."
10_04_2022,affordable housing,"And as far as this project goes, I've got to commend you guys, the planning, commissioners, staff,  past planning commissioners for the vision to create these opportunities for more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, that's why this cluster housing ordinance was designed, as consistent with future land planning and housing. Being a custom home builder, volume home building is not really what I do."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Let's go to number four. A resolution to approve and authorize Mayor [PERSON] to sign an [ORGANIZATION]-funded subrecipient agreement. with [PERSON] for supportive and affordable housing in the amount of $1,295,000 and to approve a budget adjustment."
04_18_2023,unhoused,"Not everyone has a child. This proposal [TIME] is to look at permanent supportive housing. We, at this time, really have no [STREET] that unhoused individuals really can be in the city legally if they're unhoused or camping, both private or on city land."
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"There's further pressure in our community with two large complexes that have historically provided some of our Section 8, telling this population that they most likely won't continue forward in [ORGANIZATION]. Additionally, individuals that are at our lowest income, unhoused, disabled, and chronically homeless unfortunately end up in our incarceration system, in the courts, and in arrest. At any time you can look in [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION], a hundred individuals will be listed as either unhoused or as [PERSON] as their address."
04_18_2023,unhoused,"The current programs that help this unhoused or housing insecure population, they're at capacity. They have long waits. Their lists are shut off at [ORGANIZATION] because of the wait."
04_18_2023,unhoused,"And so I really appreciate all of the questions and all of the time. I know that individuals have taken outside of council to go sit with people that are experts in this field and to get more information. And I'd like to really encourage you to support this particular project.  because it does help some of our most vulnerable, but it also is a more financially responsible [STREET] to spend the money because over time, the investment pays off after [ORGANIZATION] of the cost that typically folks that are chronically unhoused receive."
04_18_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"First off, I do want to say I got to have conversations with every single one of you, whether by email, by phone, in person, in [TIME]. I am so grateful for your attention to this critical issue, a crisis of affordable housing and homelessness. The conversation I hope keeps going."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"This is a great conversation about the spectrum of housing interventions. On the far left of your screen is the intervention of rental assistance, of distributing this same money to a broad group of people who need a little bit of help. And the same thing can be accomplished with affordable housing development financing."
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness,"Now, all the [STREET] on the opposite end of the spectrum is the [STREET] to spend funds in the housing intervention known as permanent supportive housing. It's not thousands of people. It's just a few of our neighbors, but it's people with long-term homeless backgrounds, like many at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], DATE2 of homelessness."
04_18_2023,homeless,"There's two ROIs. And both of these interventions are very effective for the target population. Our proposal was written to try to prioritize the people who are chronically homeless, and that's why we wrote it, to spend the funds on this permanent supportive housing."
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness; unhoused,"And those are funds we would use to fund the orange part as well as the private fundraising that our non-profit is committed to So it really represents some cost savings for the city to get an ongoing program For the cost of one large upfront investment next slide, please This proposal really is cheaper than leaving chronically homeless people unhoused um  The quote on the screen is from [ORGANIZATION], the federal entity charged with coordinating the resources available to respond in homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. Leaving a person to remain chronically homeless costs taxpayers as much as $30,000 to $50,[ADDRESS], to the emergency room, to the shelter, to the jail, to the [STREET], [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,unhoused,And so our proposal proposes to interrupt that cycle. We spend a lot of money leaving people unhoused and we propose these funds to instead step in and provide supportive housing instead. Next slide.
04_18_2023,homelessness,One thing that came up with many of our conversations was this need for a bigger picture master plan. a regional master plan to address homelessness. I loved that theme that was reoccurring in our conversations.
04_18_2023,homeless,"I'll tell you as someone who's worked in the homeless space for [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], I have never seen more energy, more collaboration, more focus,  around addressing this issue systemically. So with our partners at [ORGANIZATION], at [ORGANIZATION], faith centers like ORG2, through the [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care that coordinates the response locally, with [ORGANIZATION] Council in [ORGANIZATION], there is this energy and collaboration and focus. And we will add energy to creating that master plan."
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness,"I would like to ask you this, and I'm sure that we all know, but can you define chronic homelessness? There's a [ORGANIZATION] definition. Chronic homelessness is a person who has experienced [ORGANIZATION] as homeless or has had, uh,  four episodes of homelessness in [LOCATION]."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"Thank you for that. The last conversation that we had, there was a comparison or a reference made to those individuals who may need rental assistance. Can you, I think you, you did it earlier, but can you again, identify the impact that if, if we were to, um,  provide funding for those who are experiencing chronic homelessness as opposed to the rental  [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,housing insecurity,"RENTAL ASSISTANCE IS A GREAT [STREET] TO SUPPORT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOUSING INSECURITY. IN HOUSING, BUT THEY'RE ON THE EDGE. TOO MUCH OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET IS GOING TO THEIR HOUSING."
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness,"THE CHRONIC HOMELESS POPULATION WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THAT INVESTMENT. So it sounds like that individuals who are facing chronic homelessness, that there's an intersectionality of mental health and other issues that maybe those individuals who may need rental assistance, they may not be facing. I think that's correct."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Yeah. Yeah, I just think that there's a different ROI for chronically homeless folks. And there's a deeper impact, but a more narrow impact."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"There are just 125 people going through chronic homelessness in our city. And so the intervention that actually works is higher on a cost per person basis. [ORGANIZATION], what are some of the challenges or that...  individuals with chronic homelessness they face that we may, let's say the average person may not know that that is a challenge."
04_18_2023,homelessness,And I keep thinking about that. the lifespan of individuals who are facing chronic homelessness. What would that lifespan be?
04_18_2023,homelessness,Unsheltered homelessness takes off your life expectancy [ORGANIZATION] of your life. DATE1. DATE2.
04_18_2023,homelessness,"For eight people who move from [ORGANIZATION] to supportive housing, eight more people can move from the [STREET] into the bridge housing community. This is how we humanely,  and wisely address chronic homelessness. And I really appreciate your outline [TIME] and you educating the council and the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] because a lot of people may not know the difference between chronic homelessness and the lifespan and the challenges that they're facing."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Good [TIME], everybody. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I am a homeless man."
04_18_2023,homeless,"I don't take medication no more. Again, I'm a homeless man. I'm gonna live with that for the rest of my life."
04_18_2023,homeless,"The staff doesn't do it. So many people in the community come and they feed us. They take time out of [DATE] to come in and feed us, the homeless, right?"
04_18_2023,homeless,"I'm going to be homeless the rest of my life, so I'm never going to forget [ORGANIZATION] I lived out there. [PERSON] I starved, [PERSON] I didn't have dry clothing in wintertime or when it rained, or [PERSON] I didn't have a pillow, I didn't have a [STREET] to bathe, I didn't have a [STREET] to eat. So before you guys make your mind up, just giving money for housing, that's not what this is about."
04_18_2023,homeless,"I've become homeless since my grandmother passed. I'd also like to say that when I was homeless, it was a struggle for me because I had a lot of opportunities and goals I had to put on hold. But I am thankful to God and thankful to the people that did support me when I was homeless to be a part of it."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,But people had doubts in us that didn't think we would succeed. But we did because we stuck together as a community. But the reason why I feel about affordable housing is just a lot of us don't have the chance right now to better ourselves what we can do.
04_18_2023,homeless; affordable housing,"But so if y'all take into consideration affordable housing, not only are you helping people to achieve...  to the next level, but you're also helping people that's sick. You're helping people out there that's struggling, that ain't got it as easy as some people do when they're homeless. See, when my grandmother was living, you know, we had a band, me, my uncle, and two cousins."
04_18_2023,homeless,"But see, when I come homeless and she died, I had to put all that on hold. But since [ORGANIZATION] gave me the opportunity to get on my feet, things are better. You know, I made a lot of goals, were able to write music and, you know, work together as a community, like coming together, like doing chores and doing the things that people say they didn't think we could do."
04_18_2023,homeless; affordable housing,"So I'm thankful [DATE] for [ORGANIZATION] to give me this chance to get to this level and hopefully get to the next level. See, me and my wife, even though she's sick, too, we've been approved for housing, but we have nowhere to go. So affordable housing is very well a solution that you can really help this homeless problem, even though people out there are suffering, dying, and are very sick and really need this help."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"See, there's some of us in [ORGANIZATION] who want to move forward. We want to show that difference. But if we're not giving affordable housing that we want to get into, then how can we make this possible?"
04_18_2023,homeless,"See, everybody can have their doubts, but they don't necessarily make it true. So I'm thankful to God [ORGANIZATION].  that [ORGANIZATION], like I said before, gave me a chance to achieve my goals and, you know, to make a difference that some people didn't think we could do. But just because we're homeless don't make us helpless."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Because homeless is a serious issue here. But if you want to fix it, it want us to show to you how much progress we can make. Then give us that chance."
04_18_2023,homeless; affordable housing,"You know, affordable housing, you know, you got to start somewhere, you know? And I know as us as a community of new beginnings and some of the homeless out here can make a difference, but it's a problem I'm not saying you can fix overnight. But who doesn't deserve a chance to better their self?"
04_18_2023,homelessness,"hi i'm [PERSON] i live at one north school [STREET] in public housing and um  I just want to say, according to the description, I guess I was DATE0 away from chronic homelessness at one time. And I didn't realize I was that close. And I'm very lucky to have the support systems I have."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"But even if you can't imagine that, try to imagine living on $900 a month and knowing that affordable rent in [ORGANIZATION] is $1,500. So if we got this beautiful gift of [ORGANIZATION] start to get into affordable housing, I don't know where you'd go after that [ORGANIZATION]. It's not affordable for anybody that doesn't have it."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,real affordable housing which is saying you're going to pay 30% and [ORGANIZATION] has closed its doors to anybody they can't do it anymore They don't have those support systems and after talking to their [ORGANIZATION]. They're not doing anything extra and  Anything including a social worker is extra right now.
04_18_2023,homelessness,I don't want to see us looking at jails as our solution for homelessness. It's not a solution. There's no [STREET] for you to go from jail.
04_18_2023,homelessness,"I live at [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] here in [ORGANIZATION]. So I'm especially thankful for the back and forth that [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] had, because I think it's the most clarifying point for why this proposal has unique value. What you have in this proposal is addressing chronic homelessness  we all know that there's a wide variety of reasons why people are housing insecure."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"And as [ORGANIZATION] kind of mapped out on that first slide, there's a spectrum of ways that you address all the different reasons why people are housing insecure. So I think for that reason alone, this is a really, really good proposal to support because not only is it,  addressing that especially chronic situation in terms of homelessness. But it's also actually, although the cost is high upfront, is very cost effective."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"It will do nothing for the city long-term in terms of city costs. But if you put a million dollars into housing people who are in chronic poverty  situations of homelessness. You will ameliorate all kinds of costs, medical costs, police costs, city services."
04_18_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"And there are lots of ways to do that, but there's not a single entity in city government doing that. And I'd like to suggest that we seriously consider an office about affordable housing and homelessness.  that could begin to really kind of coordinate this. And if it was up to me, I would hire [ORGANIZATION], but I'm sure there are other good people that would be available too."
04_18_2023,homeless,"And for so many reasons that I should probably just say, yeah, what they said and then go sit down, but you know me better than that. When we talk about folks who are homeless, a lot of folks think about broken people. But I want to be clear that this is, when we have folks living on our trails, in the woods, in people's yards, that's about a broken housing market."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"If we expand our capacity, we make more affordable housing. That's what we need. This is a good [STREET] to do it."
04_18_2023,homeless,"uh i support [ORGANIZATION]'s uh proposal i'm not very good at talking to PERSON1 but uh it's okay as far as um the homeless community and whatnot as far as the new beginnings uh my friends that have been there they've i've seen their lives change right around just by being there the short time they have they went from having nothing and now they're like they're starting to become become in bloom i guess you'd say uh  As far as the trash and all that stuff that you guys have problems with, I'm in the trenches and I stay in the trenches. I don't live at [ORGANIZATION], but I'm in the program and going to be."
04_18_2023,homeless,"I've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] in northwest [ORGANIZATION], and I've lived here my whole life. Anyways, I'm from here. So I love the rivers and the bike trail."
04_18_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [ADDRESS] here in [ORGANIZATION]. Some friends and I are very concerned about.  affordable housing and homelessness.
04_18_2023,homeless,"We are very disappointed with the city's decision to clean up the trash on the trails, meaning the homeless. If they don't have anywhere to live, giving them [ORGANIZATION] to move somewhere else is not going to do anything. I have been wondering about that property on [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Could we do some sort of taxing on rentals that  on the ORG0 rentals that don't have anyone living there? Most of the time they rent them for three, four, [TIME] a month and make enough to make a profit on them. Can we tax those high enough to make them, one, less profitable, and two, to raise money to help address this homeless issue?"
04_18_2023,homeless,"and I trust you read my letter, so I'll try not to repeat much of what I said. But I've been thinking about the people I know, people who have been in my life, who have been homeless at one time or another. For a long time, when my father was little, my grandparents didn't have anywhere to live."
04_18_2023,homeless,"And my grandfather worked full-time, as many homeless people do. And they camped wherever they could, wherever someone would give them permission to camp. Not campgrounds."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] often doesn't become apparent until someone is a young adult. He has since experienced homelessness, arrests and hospital stays, but he has a safety net, a family who does the best they can to keep him housed. But many people don't have that safety net."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,Please support [ORGANIZATION] for some affordable housing. The [ORGANIZATION] funds give us a great opportunity to make some progress in this area. And then let's get to work and figure out what to do next.
04_18_2023,unhoused,"So I spend a lot of time in community and in conversation with my unhoused neighbors. many of them who are chronically unhoused, as [ORGANIZATION] gave us such an amazing definition of. And I'm speaking in vigorous support of spending ORG0 money this [STREET] because of a language thing."
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"And this is...  someone brought up the importance of being intentional with language [ORGANIZATION] and I just want to say that there's a difference in using the words homeless and unhoused because homeless is almost like a neutral thing like oh we don't know how they came to not be with a home whereas unhoused means it's a it's a conscious choice by people with resource and agency to be able to fix the problem choosing not to and  As I said, I'm in community and conversation with these people all the time, just walking down the [STREET], saying hello, asking people what they need, sometimes just sitting and listening to people. And almost every single one of these people that I know personally, I can think of like five that I see daily in my life whose lives would be transformed and turned around by a program like this."
04_18_2023,unhoused,Please protect the unhoused. Thank you. Thank you.
04_18_2023,homelessness,"The first thing that I want to say is that we all realize that homelessness is not a [ORGANIZATION] issue. [PERSON] is a regional issue. But I commend [ORGANIZATION] for all of the work  that you continue to do on behalf of those who are struggling finding housing, securing housing, and staying in housing."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"One of those things is collaboration. The continuum of care, our job, my job is to create a community response to end homelessness. My job is to look over our four counties, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and [PERSON], and bring agencies and cities and stakeholders and concerned citizens together and say, how do we end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]?"
04_18_2023,homeless,"My job is that one-stop shop where we get individuals, we assess them, we get their names, we get their information, we figure out what their vulnerability is. Since we started doing these assessments in [ORGANIZATION], we have done over 3,000 assessments. So over 3,000 individuals have at one point in time considered themselves literally homeless, not in emergency shelter, on the streets, somewhere."
04_18_2023,homeless,"These are individuals that are literally homeless at the time of the assessment. When their assessment score is super high, they qualify for what we call permanent supportive housing. That is that housing that we are talking about."
04_18_2023,homeless,"That is that housing for the chronically homeless individuals that we have in our area. Are the majority of our chronically homeless within the city of [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, absolutely."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So they sit holding the vouchers, holding [ORGANIZATION] money, essentially, that we cannot spend and become at risk of giving back to the government because we don't have the affordable housing with low barriers. Am I saying that, you know, six apartments, 60 apartments, 600 apartments is going to fix this? No, I'm not saying that."
04_18_2023,homeless,"But I am saying that we need to try. to at least put a dent in this brick wall that we have created, because on our by name list, we have over 320 individuals currently within [ORGANIZATION], who have identified themselves as literally homeless,  I have no [STREET] to send them. I can refer [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,homeless,"and I think we need assistance with case management and all that for people at risk of losing their housing. Absolutely. Absolutely.  for these individuals who are chronically homeless, they don't even have a house."
04_18_2023,unhoused,I was just speaking with my therapist DATE0 about how I'm three cataclysmic life steps away from becoming unhoused or experiencing houselessness or being housing insecure. A lot of that statistically has to do with the fact that I am disabled. But I say three for this reason.
04_18_2023,homeless,"and then that ended, they would be back out on the [STREET] homeless. [ORGANIZATION]'s plan deals with long-term care of these people. I think it's really important to fund."
04_18_2023,homelessness,"And so that is really important to not think of [ORGANIZATION]'s plan as the end, but it's the beginning of finding a [STREET] for long term planning to deal with homelessness here in [ORGANIZATION]. Thanks. Thank you."
04_18_2023,unhoused,"I worked for a long time in clinical settings with populations of folks who were unhoused. I'm still learning the vernacular. I don't look like it, but I'm a lot older than you think."
04_18_2023,homeless,"And what I discovered is that in all my training and all of the work that I've done, I developed this clinical language that kept the experience that homeless people actually had at a distance. I could use clinical categories to discuss things about them. I could use theological concepts like sin and fallenness and so on and so forth about them."
04_18_2023,homeless,And then one day I had a breakthrough. It changed my ministry and my approach to it. And that was I sat down with a homeless person
04_18_2023,unhoused,"This was when I was the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], and we focused on clients who could not afford psychotherapy. And we had a social worker who helped unhoused people find resources to deal with the situation they were in. But this is the first time I'd actually sat down with someone and said, what's it like to be you?"
04_18_2023,unhoused,"And when I've gone to bigger and richer cities that have more unhoused populations and less care for them, it has disgusted me to my core. PERSON0, I believe is your name, brought up the thing that brought me here [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] repeated on it. I believe [PERSON] did as well."
04_18_2023,homeless,"We see parking garages and hideous student housing and very little aid going to our homeless population. And to a person, everyone I've spoken to about this is disgusted and infuriated by the direction that this town is going in these aspects. We have an opportunity to do better, to be better."
04_18_2023,homeless,"I've seen advertisements in [ORGANIZATION] calling [ORGANIZATION] the next [PERSON]. But if that means in [ORGANIZATION] I see hundreds of homeless people shivering one block over from thousands of partying bar goers, I will be disgusted to call this [STREET] home. You do not make your home beautiful by decorating it with the corpses of the less fortunate, and I do not want to live somewhere that pretties itself by pricing up the poor and throwing them in prison."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Thinking back to what [PERSON] said earlier about how the [ORGANIZATION] funds are for those who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and those who have been historically vulnerable. Working in the housing sector for [ORGANIZATION], I have seen that with the specific subset of chronic homeless folks. As [PERSON] described it earlier, you know, with the eviction moratorium that happened, we've seen fewer and fewer landlords that have been able to work with different housing programs and vouchers because they've had interest to recoup as well."
04_18_2023,homeless,"If someone comes and asks for rental assistance, I can at least  share some agencies that can assist with that. I know that there are [ORGANIZATION] grants, things like emergency solution grants that can offer what we call rapid rehousing, which is to help folks for [LOCATION] before they can maintain on their own. Also homeless prevention programs, many agencies apply and receive those DATE2 and do a great job administering those."
04_18_2023,homeless,"And of course we could always use more. But this is really a unicorn of an opportunity because it's not something that we have seen to help folks who are chronically homeless with permanent supportive housing. And while there are wonderful transitional housing programs in our community, what we find is that they do try to target the most vulnerable in our community."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So when folks do, if they've been lucky enough to have a voucher because they were on the list before it closed, try to find affordable housing. But that doesn't. you're really for a one bedroom allowed about seven hundred dollars"
04_18_2023,homeless; homelessness,"so if you look on [ORGANIZATION] right now there are two apartments in [ORGANIZATION] that are seven hundred dollars or less um and whether or not they will accept a voucher um and accept folks who might have barriers to housing like something on their criminal background um etc you're filtering even more folks how  So all that to just say that I just want to reiterate, this really is such a unique opportunity and I am pro all housing interventions. But I would just plead with the council to consider approving this proposal because I can't recall in [ORGANIZATION] something similar to this. My guess is that a lot of complaints you get from community members about folks who are homeless fall into the subset of chronic homelessness because there just aren't any housing opportunities for those folks or places for people to move on to, even when they're doing everything in their ability."
04_18_2023,homeless,"And I wanted to just not repeat some of the many great points that people have already given, but also to just give you some of the maybe some of the county perspective as well. Because we know that folks who are chronically homeless, we've seen that the longer that folks are homeless, the more likely they are to be criminally justice involved. Okay."
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"So there's over 200 people in the jail sleeping on the floor. What we also know is that there are about, at any given time, there's about 100 people in the jail who are unhoused, who are homeless, who don't have a permanent residence. We also know that it costs about $30,000 per year, per individual, to house a person in the jail."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"For example, we've given $1.9 million to [ORGANIZATION], which provides short-term transitional housing for people that are getting out of jail. It fills a needed gap. We just sent $1.7 million from emergency rental funding to ORG1 to help construct affordable housing."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Now, we know construction of affordable housing isn't necessarily the cheapest [STREET] to go about housing people, but it's going to fill a needed gap. Right. So, you know, those are some of the things I just wanted to kind of give the council, you know, some information from our end of things, you know, because not everybody watches, you know, every quorum [STREET] meeting."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,I got a question for you. I'd like you to answer. You said that you all spent $1.7 million for affordable housing.
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Well, we said, if I'm looking at my numbers right, in [ORGANIZATION], we sent $1.7 million to  of our ORG1 funds to [ORGANIZATION] for affordable housing construction. But we got 5.7 million in all through the ORG1. So like the first round of that, I think the first 4 million, we sent to ORG2 and [PERSON] to use for housing stability during the pandemic."
04_18_2023,unhoused,and I want to express that I think [PERSON] is very compassionate and that we've demonstrated that over [ORGANIZATION]. And I think that everybody in [ORGANIZATION] and the administration really wants to house the unhoused and do it with integrity and compassion and all of those things that make a person whole and human and successful. Right.
04_18_2023,homeless,"I had multiple people talk about the city should have a heart. You know, I think the city of [ORGANIZATION] has the biggest heart in northwest [PERSON] because we are the only community that spends the amount of money we spend for the homeless community with the different organizations that are in our community, the church organization, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]. No other community has that."
04_18_2023,housing crisis,"It's not well. We need housing right I mean, let's get real here I'm looking I mean, you know, I don't want to sit around talk about a crisis on housing and then not talk I mean  we can't just say we got a housing crisis and then we turn down developments i mean"
04_18_2023,housing crisis,i mean i'm a i'm a little frustrated with some of it because we go oh we've got a housing crisis and then when we bring a development then everybody says well we don't want that development
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"But we can build infrastructure with our own money. So in order to have ARPA money go farther in a tiny home sort of situation, then the [STREET] up to it or the sewer line or whatever like that,  is within the city council's power to use general fund money for. You can't do it for affordable housing, but you can do the infrastructure that is needed for affordable housing."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And so I would encourage that you don't make a decision [TIME]. You've heard what the city council is saying. And I think, unless I'm gauging everything wrong, I think they're thinking more about a tiny home situation as opposed to  Going on to the economy and buying where it should be actually also reducing the amount of affordable housing Even though you'd have your people in it, but then they wouldn't be available for the market"
04_18_2023,affordable housing,The main [STREET] we produced affordable housing prior to the cuts in [ORGANIZATION] were basically through our [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 programs. And those were cut 65% in [ORGANIZATION]. And only the mayor is old enough in the room to know that.
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And so we have 24,000 students and 5,300 faculty and staff.  that are competing because they're not housed on campus. They're competing for half the affordable housing in three zip codes. They're no one's fault here."
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"I've met with more pastors than I cared to meet with, and it's not even [ORGANIZATION]. I have...  met with [ORGANIZATION] who was very gracious and drove down from [ORGANIZATION] to meet with me regarding her work with the continuum of care. And I met with the sociologist at [ORGANIZATION] who's our contract point in time person that counts homeless individuals on that famous night when we count those that are unhoused in our community."
04_18_2023,homeless; unhoused,"And I would be comfortable if we were to earmark these funds for a pot to address homeless services, unho[LOCATION]ed families.  sheltering long-term individuals and then allow a consortium of people to make application against that pot of money [ORGANIZATION] being one of those and that he could j[LOCATION]t like anyone else someone else finds a viable property I don't want to turn them down So I would be interested in [LOCATION] exploring that kind of alternative. And I even think [ORGANIZATION] would be supportive of that."
04_18_2023,housing crisis,I'm sorry. No worries. We've said several times that we are experiencing a housing crisis.
04_18_2023,homeless,"I want to remind folks while we do have time, the suffering in our community continues [ORGANIZATION]. If you don't have someone close to you that's been chronically homeless, or if you don't have someone close to you that stays on that bubble constantly from serious mental illness or something that they really can't prevent themselves, [LOCATION] that we don't make a decision, they continue to stay in the spot they're in now and potentially get to a worse spot. So I really am championing us to really take action."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"There's also a lot of concerns expressed about the property's development history, not just during construction, which was mentioned, but there's also a lot of concern that during the entitlement process, especially the zoning and conditional use permit entitlement processes, it was frequently mentioned that these units were intended or would serve as attainable housing or affordable housing. And there's been a lot of frustration expressed over the units and their ultimate sales price and also the potential that they will go immediately from or perception that they'll immediately go from newly constructed housing to the short-term rental market with nothing in between. There are also concerns noted about parking."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"However, later in the same meeting, they approved a brand new house and a brand new development. Also, affordable housing. Obviously, you know, affordable housing is a big issue."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"We're very sympathetic of that. We're unaware of any affordable housing requirements for short-term rental approval. Obviously, this neighborhood is in the heart of [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"It is one of the most coveted places where people want a home to be close to FAC0, the university, that type of stuff. So it's going to be very, very hard to have affordable housing in such a high demand neighborhood. to me that it was ever considered affordable housing with the price points and the [STREET] the markets control these high demand neighborhoods right in the heart of the entertainment district just seems to me that's a little beyond my comprehension there but  As far as density goes, I think you guys saw the map."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I don't really want to reiterate much, but I will say that I felt like we were...  pitched, sold on affordable housing, walkability, meeting new neighbors. And the short-term rentals don't do any of that. Really what they do is drop an upscale motel in our neighborhood without any staff to run it."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"We were told those we got those and  Those parameters in letters we saw them in meetings and it wasn't just one meeting. It was every meeting Every letter that I received from the developer Also said these things about affordable housing attainable housing we need homes that are close to the downtown so that they can walk to work and and such as that  I was sitting on my couch DATE0 morning and I heard some noise outside my window and I was like, oh, I wonder what that noise is."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And I know that has come up an enormous amount of times in the emails, and I haven't really had a chance to address it because I've,  um i just really wanted to talk about it but i don't i don't see that that is something a good you know i wouldn't have voted for it for it to be affordable housing unless it was a cobblestone project which we have had it was a set up and this the city knew had a guarantee that it was going to be of a certain price point so  in this current market there's just no [STREET] we could ever control the cost of those homes ever um so that i wanted to address that um and um you know i don't know legally kit if you could help me can we control what people do to their homes with their homes  after they've purchased it, is that something an ordinance that could be addressed as far as the home is only, you know, is [ORGANIZATION] and it cannot be turned into a short term rental?"
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think, and also with the affordable housing, I agree with you, nothing was presented that was enforceable. uh if you wanted to make it enforceable they would have had to give us adult insurance and saying it's going to be affordable housing we're not going to charge more than this it's workforce housing we're making sure that people work there and and instead it was puffery is probably the proper term which means it is not enforceable it is salesmanship"
04_18_2023,affordable housing,A two percent cap. We're not even halfway there. And we're concerned about affordable housing.
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So I'm appreciative of your admonition, Mr.  Well, I was concerned about affordable housing. Oh, yeah. I'm not— You can't consider that."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And I don't need to prolong this and keep anyone up any longer than that. That's all I can think of to say at this point, Mr. [PERSON]. [PERSON] [PERSON].  kid if I get this right if I build a house then you're pretty much saying I can tell the council that I'm going to make it affordable housing"
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"They have affordable housing, and they also say you can't do sprawl, which is where the cheapest affordable housing would be. So which one are you following? But compatibility has always been the key for any conditional use."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"So I had to zoom in. But [ORGANIZATION] and I wanted to have this discussion as this has been weighing heavily on us. I can go into details of affordable housing, but you've heard a lot of it this evening, which I don't have any idea how that plays ownership on me."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"And why have the meetings and all the discussion if what is said is,  It just has to be said, but it never has to be done. And that just doesn't make sense to me. And the affordable housing, okay, whatever, that's done."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"Somebody said that. How much do you make? I'm just, it's frustrating that it's like we are being targeted, that these were not made into affordable housing."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"It just slows people down. Now, one thing I did not take into consideration were any comments that happened in the rezoning of this property and the idea that this was going to be affordable housing because that ship has sailed. That's not something we're even considering here."
04_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think we need to fix. So, but the affordable housing, whatever somebody said [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION]. Unless you've got it in a bill of assurance."
10_01_2019,affordable housing,Thank you. I  I concur with what council member [ORGANIZATION] just said when I saw this I was pretty pleased I this is certainly a model of something that we need to promote as far as affordable housing in the city so thank you so much for being a leader in this arena thanks [PERSON] else?
01_02_2024,homeless,"any of you can we'll add it to here in a little bit everybody good all right well let's go to the consent agenda number one approval of the [ORGANIZATION] city council meeting minutes number two a resolution to approve an agreement between the city of [ORGANIZATION] and the city of [PERSON]  and [ORGANIZATION] for the administration of a railroad crossing elimination grant. A resolution to approve Amendment 2 to the Memorandum of Agreement with ORG1 for continuation of the litter abatement program through [LOCATION] in an amount not to exceed $100,000.  4. A resolution to waive the requirements of former competitive big end to approve a contract for ORG2 any amount of $119,400 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]."
01_02_2024,homeless,"But think about as well, [ORGANIZATION] we voted on [TIME] to give $119,000. And whenever I looked at the numbers in [ORGANIZATION], we had 81 folks that were in the jail that showed a homeless address. And about 23% of those."
01_17_2023,homeless; unhoused,"[ORGANIZATION] has worked with our partner [ORGANIZATION] to establish this very successful program employing unhoused city residents of five in teams of five to pick up trash from trails and parks on [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] and DATE2. About 30 people enter their names to be included in the pool, which are then drawn to see who will be able to work on those teams [ORGANIZATION]. and they're drawn from they gather at [ORGANIZATION] and their names are drawn there not only are these unhoused people paid twelve dollars per hour but [ORGANIZATION] provides a bus for transportation to work sites lunch on site and shower opportunities after the job as well as other services [ORGANIZATION] is paid two thousand dollars per month for administering this program and supplies a representative to oversee the program  The pilot Pick Me Up program, which was financed from a grant of about $30,000, authorized by Mayor [PERSON] in [DATE] from ORG2, was honored at [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], as the program of [ORGANIZATION]."
01_17_2023,unhoused,"This program has not only resulted in amazing amounts of trash being picked up and removed from city parks and trails,  It has given many unhoused residents a continuing opportunity to perform important, worthwhile work by earning a fair wage. The overwhelming desire of our unhoused neighbors to participate in this program is a testament to its value for some of our neediest citizens. It is my great pleasure to present our [ORGANIZATION] and Trash, [ORGANIZATION], as our worthy recipient of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG0."
01_17_2023,affordable housing,"We focus primarily on access to safe and affordable housing, protection of consumer rights, protection from domestic violence, and economic justice, which includes access to [ORGANIZATION]. Clients are usually at or below 125% of the poverty level. DATE0, we served 629 residents of [ORGANIZATION]."
07_07_2020,homeless,"At that time it was a set of three buildings and kind of a definitive [ORGANIZATION], PERSON1 influence. We all loved that house until it became unstable due to flooding. So what resulted was [PERSON] was homeless after [ORGANIZATION] in 10 [LOCATION]."
07_07_2020,affordable housing,"Just to clarify on the [PERSON], which has no limit to occupancy, the bill of assurance was put in for the single-family residence, which would apply the limit to occupancy, which I hope is, you know, I've interpreted that correctly, and I think there's a little confusion there. The other thing is... I do want to build smaller homes that are affordable housing, not multi-family attached units that would change the neighborhood dramatically."
07_07_2020,affordable housing,So that is just not the case in this neighborhood. I don't see how it can be economically segregating to a big degree if we're doing affordable housing. I always point to the south side of town where we were spot zoning one lot after the next under the illusion that there would be affordable houses down there because of density.
07_07_2020,homelessness,"The history is just there. The outcomes are there for us all to see. And I worry that we are so preoccupied with the politics  And so eager for compromise proposals that we have lost the plot of what our community needs to address issues like homelessness, like climate change, and like economic and racial segregation across our city."
07_07_2020,affordable housing,And I'd like to echo Mr. [PERSON]'s comments. I think that  this neighborhood has a lot of um it's has a lot of houses that frankly are becoming uninhabitable and i think that um the [ORGANIZATION] zoning um you know allows for additional density and uh affordable housing that the city has um you know made a a goal so i think ru is appropriate for for this
11_19_2024,housing crisis,"But I think, you know, it's, it's weighing, you know,  that we have so many folks that are coming to our region. And so when we reduce the number of units that happen within [ORGANIZATION], they go out to other areas that [ORGANIZATION] actually helps to subsidize, out to [PERSON], out to GPE2, out to [PERSON] and [PERSON], [PERSON]. And so when I look at this, you know, one of the considerations I'm also thinking about is that We know that we have a lot of hurdles with infrastructure going forward particularly in our roadways and our water and sewer One of the ways that we're going to be able to make improvements to create safety is by having more taxpayer base to be able to fund that  And so for me, I have a concern that we reduce the units knowing we need houses We're in a housing crisis knowing that we need the taxpayer base to pay for those infrastructure improvements  And, you know, the type of zoning that we were hearing and the considerations being made, and it's true this could get zoned and go to someone else, but it sounded like there was considerations to try to take into account what's currently out there."
11_19_2024,homelessness; affordable housing,"The first thing I would point out, this is subjective as a [ORGANIZATION] resident, not so much in my capacity as an attorney, but this property is not  advancing the ball on the solution to the problem of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] or the problem of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. That problem requires a deep dive that I know this council has attempted to do and is continuing to attempt to do. But on the subjective side of that, weigh what you heard [TIME]."
11_19_2024,homeless,"There has been some improvements made, but when it's that bad on the outside, I would suggest you consider how bad it is on the inside. I do not have an agenda against [ORGANIZATION], but as the founder of an organization that deals with veterans who are forced to live in rat-infested, bug-infested apartments here in [ORGANIZATION],  This is just another example of substandard landlords who say they're helping the homeless or veterans and they're allowed to go ahead no matter how bad it is. And there's some really bad ones out there if you ever want to know."
11_19_2024,homeless; affordable housing,"Also, after that, [ORGANIZATION] took that person in his car and drove her to [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION] so that she didn't get an [ORGANIZATION], I guess you would say. Personally, I am interested in this question of the extent to which what's going on at the ORG1 property is an overflow problem. To what extent is this rooted in a lack of resources or a lack of affordable housing opportunities for homeless people in [PERSON], GPE2?"
11_19_2024,homeless,"All of them at this point are residents who came in as homeless people and they are now housed because of this building. Some of them are very tidy, some of them are not so tidy, but they're all good people. Can I have the next picture please?"
11_19_2024,homeless,"For a long time, the [ORGANIZATION] webpage carried a map of our neighborhood with the adjacent properties next to it, which included ours, which is the one right next to it, as targeted for purchase. And we found this very distressing, and eventually, when public perception seemed to be difficult for them, they changed the label on that, but it's still that targeted for perception told us something important. And then when the homeless camp sprang up, there may have been things going on like interactions with people in the cemetery that should not have happened."
11_19_2024,housing crisis,"I understand we have a housing crisis and I'm usually up here saying housing, housing, housing. But this is one, when we have a staircase that is about to fall through and we have a fire hazard. And we have firefighters that will not go in there."
11_19_2024,unhoused,You heard the fire chief say there's nowhere else in [ORGANIZATION] where people live that it's this bad. So that says something. i understand about um unhoused people needing housing and there was discussion about that
11_19_2024,homeless,"I live at [DATE] FAC0. I just want to speak a little bit about PERSON0 and [PERSON] because I've known them for [ORGANIZATION], and I have been...  working with them at least for DATE1 on a housing solutions committee. And it's because they care so deeply about what is happening in the city with homeless, it's an increasingly...  serious problem throughout the nation because of economic stresses and rising housing prices."
11_19_2024,housing crisis,"I'm going to support this resolution. Because that is the only, I have a responsibility to make sure that our citizens are safe. And I don't believe that this has anything to, this doesn't impact the housing crisis whatsoever."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"You know I hear a lot about what we're not doing But I want to talk a little bit about what we are doing in this city, and I meet with people the city's  across this region they will ask me what is the number one issue they think in this region and i tell them homelessness also bring up the landfill but that's another story [DATE]"
11_19_2024,homeless; homelessness,"but i know that our city has spent 4.9 million dollars on homelessness 2.5 on homelessness in a low-income house and we're looking at some other issues [TIME]  and we have spent 1.4 million dollars on non-profit organizations so it's you know we are are trying we do the pick me up room thanks to [ORGANIZATION] um you know and what i was seeing along the trails and i've taken my share of hits on that but our citizens begin to show me pictures of what we have along just the town branch trail  which it looked a great deal like landfill all of it washing down in the creeks and i finally said enough we can't have that because it was a health hazard as i've said before we picked up two quart jars full of needles we had dog attacks stabbings i think we had a homicide i don't know the chief back there assistant chief can back me up on a lot of this we've spent seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for seven hills in [ORGANIZATION]  Try to keep people sheltered. I don't want anybody unsheltered, but it is it is going to take a region Working together to address this issue right now I think I would I would venture for you to get to look up what other cities are spending in the region on homeless programs and low-income housing and"
11_19_2024,homeless,"A resolution to commit ARPA funds in the amount of $71,411 to [ORGANIZATION] and to approve a budget adjustment. PERSON0, you have this? Yes, I do, Mayor."
11_19_2024,homeless,"As you said, we have $71,411 in [ORGANIZATION] funds that have been returned to the city. We need to commit those funds formally by [ORGANIZATION]. This item before you [TIME] will allocate those funds to [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"We were able to open that up [ORGANIZATION]. My favorite is Judge [PERSON] has reached out to us and we've actually provided two spaces for mental health [STREET] referrals. It's a little selfish on my part because we talk about homelessness, but really we're dealing with addiction and mental illness."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"Homelessness is sometimes just something that happens because of the mental illness and the addiction. So I believe, the staff believes, if we can get people on our sites or working with people who are struggling with mental illness, then we can potentially get them help and help them move forward. It's a process."
11_19_2024,homeless,And they asked us if we could actually hold a couple of beds or make spaces for [ORGANIZATION]  response and we agreed and that starts [ORGANIZATION] because we believe that the city of [ORGANIZATION] has done a lot to help the homeless and If you ask anybody we believe that you're the number one partner with us We couldn't do what we do without you and we're very very appreciative of that
11_19_2024,homelessness,"I mean, it was just insane, his story. So our case management team was able to work with his family and to reach out to make sure that if we really did send him on a bus to [ORGANIZATION] that he would have someone there to help him. We didn't want to exit him back into homelessness."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"Okay, what questions do we have? One of the areas we talked about was like regional collaboration. Is [ORGANIZATION] in the northwest [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care working on a regional response to homelessness?"
11_19_2024,homeless,"We see every [ORGANIZATION] person that stayed in shelter, and we see every person that stays at FAC0 all day long. That's 125 people a day. So we do intakes for them that go into [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homeless,"So we're the only organization doing intakes for people who are homeless and working with them for diversion, right, just because of the [STREET] the other programs are set up. So we participate. I don't believe that a regional response is to send people to [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homeless,I just want to clarify. We are not required to be a member because we don't receive funding from them. But we provide all of the information into [ORGANIZATION] that they require.
11_19_2024,homeless; unhoused,"We're the agency that's housing the majority of the intakes for people who are homeless. And so until change happens and conversations are had, that's where we feel safe being. And then the other question that I had that came from the community is that it's been reported that there are somewhere close to potentially 400 chronically unhoused individuals that might potentially be trespassed from [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,unhoused,Who would like to address us on this topic that's in the chamber? PERSON0 I would just like to recommend that you pass this I did an internship for a master's degree at [ORGANIZATION] they're great stewards of money they just really are prudent with it I think that they are gonna do great things they're going to make sure that as we grow that they help assist the unhoused population and this is just another no-brainer
11_19_2024,unhoused,i think it ends up being around 25 households give or take it goes back to the structure that [ORGANIZATION] gave us previously where [ORGANIZATION]'s group is given the funds and folks apply and are given [ORGANIZATION] my concern is just this there are individuals uh as much energy and effort [ORGANIZATION] does and i'm very appreciative in all of our organizations working to house individuals  We have more unhoused folks than shelter spaces available.
11_19_2024,unhoused,"We have more folks that are on the bubble of losing housing and yet there are less resources available while we go into colder weather [ORGANIZATION]. And so when this was, I was approached about this, it made sense to think about, well, we potentially could at least keep 25 housed because it's much more costly and difficult when somebody becomes unhoused to rehouse them. so that was why I wanted to bring that forward for consideration that we potentially keep some of these families, 25 households from burdening [ORGANIZATION] and other of our agencies out there who are going to end up having to send them into like 211 where, you know, it'll be hit and miss."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"I think that it helps people that are already housed, prevents them from going into homelessness and that's something that really appeals to me. To me, I'm trying to weigh out where I think it will do the most good. And when I see that all of these [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, these other groups all agreed to give this funding to ORG3, I have to take that into consideration."
12_01_2020,homeless,"Okay, thank you. Awe, number five, an ordinance to waive the requirements for competitive bidding and to approve a contract for [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and needy residents in federal in [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON0."
12_01_2020,homeless,"Whereas [ORGANIZATION] has operated a [TIME] facility to serve numerous homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents for over [ORGANIZATION], relying upon the support of several local churches, charities, and charitable persons, as well as some government support for veterans, etc.,  And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] City Council has approved a funding request for [ORGANIZATION] to maintain the operations of [ORGANIZATION], and although funding for the center by donors has improved, a shortfall still exists that jeopardizes its ability to continue to offer vital services to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless residents. And whereas if FAC1 could no longer operate its FAC2,  Currently housed citizens might become homeless again and have to live on the streets or in the woods. And whereas if FAC1 could no longer operate as a [TIME] facility, the large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing, hot food and a warm [STREET] to stay during DATE2, as well as access to a telephone and other job assistance services, could not find such comparable services elsewhere."
12_01_2020,homeless,"And whereas the facilities and services provided by [ORGANIZATION] are required to be continued and should continue to be supported by the city in order to prevent our homeless and needy residents from suffering undue hardship and deprivation. Now, therefore, it be ordained by [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], Section 1.  that ORG1 of [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], hereby determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical and therefore weighs the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a contract between [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] Homeless Center in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents and authorizes Mayor [PERSON] to sign this contract. Okay, [PERSON]."
12_01_2020,homeless,"Essentially, this is the same contract as we have had [ORGANIZATION] at the same funding level. We all know the situation with the homeless in [ORGANIZATION]. This is a request to continue to help fund [ORGANIZATION] to keep open daycare and run the FAC0 facility."
12_01_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION]? Yes. An ordinance to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_01_2020,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION]? Yes. An ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $113,400 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_01_2020,homeless,"so the homeless wouldn't be on the streets, homeless. especially during the [ORGANIZATION] periods of time. From that point in time, we discussed and talked to ORG0 about them attempting to get private funding and they didn't get some private funding to help  However, they've been strapped ever since."
12_01_2020,affordable housing,"The report notes that 80,000 new households are expected to move into [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], and at least half of our new units will need to be for workforce housing. In order to provide that affordable housing, we as a city need to be providing new homes in the total purchase price of $150,000 to $360,000. As you can see, especially in this neighborhood, current sales prices of homes are well over that total purchase price that would provide our much needed workforce housing."
12_01_2020,affordable housing,"Um, affordable housing is what actually drove us to this area. Um, so I do completely understand a house that supports the working wages. $300,000 houses do not support that."
12_01_2020,homelessness,"[DATE], an ordinance to enact Article 31, [ORGANIZATION] in Chapter 33, [ORGANIZATION], Boards, [ORGANIZATION], and [ORGANIZATION]. Whereas the city has had increased public interest in supporting low and moderate income residents with the challenges of housing affordability and low wages,  And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care of which the city of [ORGANIZATION] is a member has made a commitment of ending homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas [ORGANIZATION] has been supporting low and moderate income residents as a community development block grant entitlement city for [LOCATION],  And whereas 24 [ORGANIZATION] section 91.105 was amended in DATE2 to encourage greater citizen participation in the development of the CDBG plans and reports and expanding the committee to include diverse representatives of the community will be a great benefit to the residents of [ORGANIZATION], particularly the low to moderate income residents who benefit the most from CDBG funds."
12_01_2020,homelessness,"One, six voting members appointed by [ORGANIZATION] as follows. A, one member involved in housing services. B, one member involved in homelessness services."
12_01_2020,homelessness,So as opportunities like that come up I would like for the group to be involved in seeking those opportunities out and making the most of them. The other really main feature of this advisory committee that may be different from the others is the intentional inclusion of students  I do want to thank the board members who may benefit from these services. I did receive some questions from members of the public about why we didn't specifically include people experiencing homelessness.
12_01_2020,homelessness,One of the reasons that is not a reserved spot in membership is the goal of eliminating homelessness so that there would be no one eligible in our community to serve that role. people who are the sort of the next in line closest to that experience. Those are the direct service providers.
12_01_2020,homelessness,"I quite possibly am going to burst with pride that there is a city, a [ORGANIZATION] resolution that includes the [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care goal to end homelessness. I'm going to share that far and wide with our national partners because the fact that our council knows what that goal is  and is committed to that goal is inspiring and really does provide wind in our sails as we do this work. Many of you may not know what an important role the City of [ORGANIZATION] plays in the [ORGANIZATION]."
12_01_2020,homelessness,"And for that, we are very grateful. And [ORGANIZATION], if you ever, once you say continuum of care, you can say [ORGANIZATION] after that. We think that when you look at how CDBG is currently allocated, that we would love to see us consider a more progressive use of CDBG that would match the leadership that [ORGANIZATION] has provided and the commitment that they have to homelessness."
12_01_2020,homelessness,"Speaking of recovering from the pandemic, also want to commend the city of [ORGANIZATION] on the rental assistance program. [ORGANIZATION], we are not designed for emergency rental assistance, and city of [ORGANIZATION] was able to very quickly mobilize that funding and to be able to respond to a number of people's needs with emergency rental assistance that prevented a lot of people from losing their housing. So in addition to your commitment to ending homelessness,  we applaud the commitment of the staff to be able to quickly take advantage of that and also listen to comment and be able to invest money into the food systems."
12_01_2020,homelessness,"And I appreciate the thoughtfulness of looking to see what other areas of the country we're doing. Obviously, kind of to some of what [ORGANIZATION] spoke about earlier, I mean, we've seen ourselves, and we obviously have been addressing homelessness and have goals with the continuum of care to end homelessness. But the pandemic has really stretched homelessness."
12_01_2020,affordable housing,"And I just wanted to say that this is very exciting to see positive action being  on creating steps for more affordable housing. I would recommend, I wasn't able to hear the whole or remember the whole list of the people who are going to be appointed to the board, but I would recommend that you consider including small,  builders, small investors and small developers. We're the stakeholders who are working directly with the individuals who are using, looking for and need more affordable and low-income housing."
12_01_2020,homelessness,So thank you very much for doing that. Thank you. And I just say that it should be a point of pride for our community that we have as many people who are committed to tackling our homelessness and poverty issues as we do.
12_01_2020,affordable housing,"In fact, other neighbors with long-term rentals in the same community, which is an affordable housing community, have joined in and have started to actually improve and remodel their duplexes as well. It's actually helped in creating a sense of community and pride where people want to enhance the environment in which they live. And so I'm very proud of this, as you can tell."
12_01_2020,affordable housing,"So thank you. Since I also won't be here in [ORGANIZATION], I think what [ORGANIZATION] just said is  Really, honestly, the comments we heard [TIME] made that case that if we're going to serve our purpose in preserving the public interest and pursuing our affordable housing goals, that incentivizing taking more of them off the market is counterproductive to that. Just to identify some trends in the comments there, this was repeatedly called an overreach."
03_16_2021,homelessness,"And we left one term, excuse me, one position vacant on that, that was also ending [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION],  ORG2, one term involving housing services. [ORGANIZATION], one term involving homelessness services."
03_16_2021,affordable housing,"Using these estimates, $1.1 million could provide 370,000 meals or feed 125,000 people for [DATE] or 2,100 people for [ORGANIZATION]. According to some estimates, a tiny home outfitted with heat and air conditioning could be built between $15,000 and $25,000. Using the higher estimate of $25,000, $1.1 million could build 44 tiny homes, producing affordable housing and possibly sheltering those without homes."
03_16_2021,affordable housing,"Um, that's nearby. And I'm, I saw the flyer, I received the flyer and it's, um, a little misleading. I think on what [ORGANIZATION]'s  and totally different from what [ORGANIZATION] will be able to do or intends to do, but I do approve the re- I am in support of the rezoning because I believe wholeheartedly there is room for more affordable housing units on this block and that it can be done in a [STREET] that will maintain the neighborhood charm and can be done without harming the nature and the integrity of the area."
03_16_2021,affordable housing,I think that the people of [ORGANIZATION] need to be listened to and the priority of our neighborhoods. I believe that...  It is possible to preserve all of our natural areas in [ORGANIZATION] and to respect what each neighborhood wants for themselves. And also to be able to build needed affordable housing.
08_16_2022,homeless,Because there were a number of people who lost their housing after that and are now homeless. Certainly we do understand that. I might kick that question back to potentially [ORGANIZATION] who helps with that effort in finding locations for those residents to live or [PERSON] if one of y'all wanted to handle that piece.
08_16_2022,affordable housing,"One of the concerns with being able to provide affordable or sustainable or attainable housing is that the cost of land. And I would like to mention to the body that  perhaps because once you've purchased it and it becomes property of the city, if you decide to resell it, I believe that the rule applies that it has to be sold at fair market value and perhaps in consideration of the ability to maybe purchase  develop it for housing in the future, that a consideration could be made to resell it at a reasonable rate to nonprofit or other minded individuals who would have modestly affordable housing or modest income housing. So I'm just considering that once you take it into your inventory, then the rules of resale apply that would make it sometimes more expensive to redevelop in the future."
08_16_2022,affordable housing,"And anyone that cries foul at the demolition of these [ORGANIZATION] apartments in the name of affordable housing has completely lost the plot here. Because this is precisely what the resolution is intending to do, is to invest in affordable housing. This community needs someone to go to bat for them, which brings me to PERSON1."
08_16_2022,affordable housing,"yes this is a good and appropriate thing to do  The voters knew that acquiring properties that flood regularly was one of the purposes when they approved Question 4. This is a good and, from the sound of it, necessary thing for the surrounding neighborhood and the affordable housing in the greater area. So I hope that we will go through with this."
08_16_2022,housing crisis,But here's the thing. This is a good plan for a city with flood problems. It is only half a plan for a city in a housing crisis.
08_16_2022,affordable housing,We cannot continue to piecemeal these things. We have to look at the consequences. And I feel like this is forgetting the consequences of losing 50 affordable housing units.
08_16_2022,affordable housing,"And I hope we will look to other opportunities to find affordable housing for folks that is cheap, that is not full of mold, that doesn't flood and wipe out all their valuables and all their savings. So I hope we will look into that. And looking toward the future too, I hope that development services and the council and the planning commission will also think about not approving development in a floodplain or a floodway."
08_16_2022,homelessness,"Specifically DATE0, especially in FAC0, we had a lot of complaints in the [ORGANIZATION] area. And so we had to focus a lot of our efforts in the [ORGANIZATION] area and see what we could do to help those that are battling homelessness. help those that have mental health crisis, and connect those with the services that they need and try to do the best we could to connect them with our social worker and also our crisis intervention trained officer."
11_01_2022,homeless,"And I'm appalled that for the most successful parking lot in [ORGANIZATION], we're going to get a hotel with inadequate parking and a homeless park. That's all. Thank you."
11_01_2022,affordable housing,"And this is a good time to remind the [ORGANIZATION] that there were several proposals to include affordable housing components in [ORGANIZATION]. And the same people who are advocating against this hotel fought the proposal to include workforce housing on that site. And often, many of them chair organizations that do not pay their workers enough to afford to live in downtown."
11_01_2022,affordable housing,"The second thing is that parking is an issue only because... We have fears about impacts on other businesses, and no one is sharing the fear that I have. Once we throw out attainable, affordable housing in this community,  Essentially, the primary [STREET] that that's ever going to happen is to write down the value of city-owned land and rent it, lease it to someone below market, and to turn a surface parking lot that the city owns into an affordable housing project."
11_01_2022,affordable housing,"and we need to be looking long-term at that because that impacts the parking. If we dually out of our mouth say that we have both goals, we want a vibrant downtown and we want affordable housing, unless a church or someone donates that land, it's gonna be city land that we lease to someone who commits to produce that form of housing. The [ORGANIZATION] we have from our city attorney, we have it from,  two retired individuals, a development services director and the gentleman that managed facilities for [ORGANIZATION], who have told us that this is not a standard letter of intent, that in fact it's a binding agreement, a binding contract."
01_19_2021,homeless,She needs community support. She needs housing. She's homeless right now.
01_03_2017,homeless,"Covenant restricting development on certain portions of FAC0 required by [ORGANIZATION]. Section 404, Nationwide Permit Number 2014-[ZIP], [DATE], a resolution to approve a contract in [ORGANIZATION] to provide funding assistance in the amount of $103,000 for utilities, maintenance, and repairs at ORG2 FAC1 in DATE0."
01_03_2017,affordable housing,None of us wants to increase the traffic problems. But those are problems we have. And we have sat here meeting after meeting and listened about how we need affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION].
01_03_2017,affordable housing,"And this is affordable housing. And so I personally would like to see us vote [TIME], but I'll, of course, do what the council says. Thank you."
05_04_2021,affordable housing,"I'd like to note that large lots with large homes dates back to [ORGANIZATION] when affordable housing was intentionally discouraged. The property has great access to public resources. There's a park, [ORGANIZATION] less than a block away."
06_21_2022,homeless,"So...  sure okay our next item is an ordinance to amend section 159.01 fees of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permits  Whereas on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] passed Ordinance [DATE] to amend Section 159.01 of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees. And whereas on [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] passed Ordinance [DATE], which amended various chapters in [ORGANIZATION] related to stormwater regulations, but the exhibit containing revisions to Section 159.01 inadvertently excluded the exemption for homeless shelters that had been approved in [DATE]. Now, therefore, it be ordained by [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION], Section 1.  that [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] are hereby repeal Section 159-01B-10-FII and enact a new Section 159-01B-10-FII for the purpose of exempting homeless shelters from paying building permit fees as follows."
06_21_2022,homeless; affordable housing,"Quote, Double I, [ORGANIZATION].  construction of single-family, non-profit, multi-family supportive housing and homeless shelters funded wholly or primarily by [ORGANIZATION], non-profit service organizations such as [ORGANIZATION], housing and urban development housing loans, and similar programs designed to provide affordable, owner-occupied single-family residences to low-income individuals,  Nonprofit multifamily supportive housing and homeless shelters shall be exempted from the payment of building permit fees. And I brought this forward just because it's a housekeeping measure, as you know. Just inadvertently, it was the [INSTITUTION] part of this was repealed.  because I guess they didn't have the latest version of this particular code section when they decided to make changes in another part of the section."
06_21_2022,homeless,"And so this is just to put the homeless shelters exemption back in [STREET] as [ORGANIZATION] put in in [ORGANIZATION]. So this is just to correct that mistake. Okay, thank you."
06_21_2022,homeless,"In order to amend section 159.01, fees of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees. I move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading. Second."
06_21_2022,homeless,Yes. Yes. And your an ordinance to amend section 159 over one fees of [ORGANIZATION] to clarify that Homeless shelters are exempt from building permit fees Any questions or answers before we go into this last vote?
07_06_2017,affordable housing,"I live in the neighborhood, own property in the neighborhood. I'm supportive of the rezone as well. I think adding density increases affordable housing options."
03_07_2017,affordable housing,We're also putting affordable housing that is otherwise unavailable down in this area for artists. Artists that are coming in and making pay scale so that they can have a living  to spend their money here. So I did want to point that out too.
04_02_2019,homeless,"at the FAC0 swimming pool. Number six, a resolution to approve the renewal of four special needs assistance program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION] in the total amount of $283,976 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. Number seven, A resolution to authorize the purchase of a new ORG1 260 speed rower from ORG2 in the amount of $142,130 pursuant to a source well co-opted purchasing contract for use at the biosolids management site."
04_02_2019,affordable housing,"I don't have a cat in this fight, but this is what's going on around all of [ORGANIZATION]. They're picking off single or one or two lots, and they're sticking [DATE] or eight units in it, and they're calling it affordable housing. I don't even think the council knows what affordable housing is as far as their official definition of the three-bedroom with $300 or $500 or $800."
04_02_2019,affordable housing,"But the best math that I've been able to do through working – with [ORGANIZATION] and talking to them about the their efforts in housing folks who most desperately need affordable housing kind of my rule of thumb is 30% income somewhere around the median the median income so our area median income here is $65,400 for a family of four that puts your your [ORGANIZATION] payment on quite a bit higher than I would have expected, actually. Whether or not these will be affordable, I'm not sure if they will be available at that rate."
04_02_2019,affordable housing,"Mayor, I'd like to make one other comment. I don't mean this to sound the [STREET] that it may come across to some people, but... Affordable housing also starts with wages."
05_01_2018,homeless,"And number 11, a resolution to approve the renewal of two special needs assistance program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION] in a total amount of $228,826 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. I'll entertain a motion to accept the consent agenda as read. PERSON0?"
05_01_2018,affordable housing,And I think that we can come up with a [STREET] to build diverse communities and to create affordable housing. But I don't think we're going to do it by just rubber stamping every [ORGANIZATION] zoning app that comes before the city council. And it seems like that's what's been happening.
06_01_2021,homeless,"And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] further stated, quote, fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, unquote. And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] continued his recommendations for mask wearing and physical distancing for all not fully vaccinated persons, for all indoor places of public accommodation and most outdoor gatherings. And whereas [PERSON] passed the attached recommendations to the city council, including number two,  Those persons that are fully vaccinated should no longer be required to wear masks within the city of [ORGANIZATION], with the following exceptions in health care settings, on mass transit, in prisons and jails and in homeless shelters, unquote."
06_01_2021,homeless,"And whereas Governor [ORGANIZATION] confirmed on [ORGANIZATION], that he would not extend his pandemic emergency declaration, which requires reconsideration of your mask mandate ordinance pursuant to its fifth section.

03_02_2021,affordable housing,"Why don't you just commit to fixing the detention ponds at FAC0 and FAC1 developments before committing to this new development? And my second question is...  really comes down to something I haven't heard through this whole discussion over [ORGANIZATION], and that is what are the proposed price points for the houses that are going to be built in FAC2? You know, we have this discussion that this is going to be, you know, housing and affordable housing for people that, you know,  That's fine."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"What's in front of us [TIME] is, and we're getting more and more of these requests, and they will probably go through water sewer, but [TIME] will probably help us set a standard on how to proceed, is do we want to look at the long-term management of wastewater on the edges of the city,  or in the immediate stages, do we want to not accept these additional hookups? So it's a tough decision for the committee, and it will be for us here [TIME], because we know that there's a need for affordable housing, and this allows affordable housing. But we also know that we do have a city..."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"The developer, they talk about wanting to provide affordable housing, but in northwest [ORGANIZATION], the cost of transportation exceeds the cost of housing for most households. And so by putting these homes out there and essentially people are driving until they qualify. It's like if you [STREET] farther enough out, you can have a cheaper house."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,"You know, after going out and looking at this site, I put a lot of thought into this. And with affordable housing, since I'm a real estate agent, I work with this [ORGANIZATION]. And I can't tell you how many times I've told someone when we're looking at a certain price range, well, you're going to have to go outside of [ORGANIZATION]."
05_16_2017,affordable housing,You're going to have to go further out if you want to find that price range. So affordable housing is always a challenge. I have great concerns about the cost of this in terms of increasing sprawl and the connection streets that are around this are not really very wide and that sort of thing.
06_16_2015,homeless,28% have been harassed by doctors and medical personnel. 19% have been outright refused basic health care. 20% of us are homeless.
06_16_2015,homeless; homelessness,"If they choose to tell me that I have to leave my house of [ORGANIZATION] where I have been quiet, I have not been destructive, and I've paid my rent on time every month. It won't just be me that is homeless, but the other two people that live under my roof as well. Yes, homelessness is so prevalent in my community that we have to offer up couches just to keep people safe."
06_16_2015,homeless,"So against a special election. By the [STREET], a special election, another $40,000 could buy about 40,000 meals for the homeless. Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], also known as PERSON1."
06_16_2015,homelessness,None of us are immune. Even one of our most active community organizers has been unemployed for [ORGANIZATION]. One in five transgender people experience homelessness at some point in their lives.
06_16_2015,homelessness,"But one of the feedbacks that I've heard is,  was that a lot of people felt misled by the last petitioning process. The ordinance language was very confusing, and people called me in distress that their name was revealed to have been on the petition because they didn't realize what they were signing, and they thought it was, in fact, the opposite of what they were presented with. And so I think that one of the advantages of us sending it directly to the people is that we can be clear and transparent in the ballot language and prevent some of the...  misconceptions or deceptions that happened last time and the other reason that we can't wait until [ORGANIZATION] is that because equality can't wait for the people who are experiencing homelessness or unemployment or who are living in fear of losing their home or their job  Every moment counts and it's imperative that we do this now and that we do it immediately Because so many people are in urgent situations."
05_05_2020,housing crisis,"It's not going to change my mind. We have a housing crisis that we're dealing with. We need more housing, and we need it in close proximity to transit and services and existing infrastructure."
05_05_2020,housing crisis,"We need to be better about meeting our housing needs. And if that takes us [ORGANIZATION] rather than just doing this, then that's fine. But our housing crisis is only getting worse and we need to be building and we need to be building a diversity of housing types."
05_05_2020,homelessness,Thank you. I appreciate that [PERSON] is raising what I think is the most important issue that's relevant to the discussion [ORGANIZATION]. We've seen homelessness increase by 150% over [LOCATION].
05_05_2020,affordable housing,"This is what I'm looking at from my point of view. The point of when we're talking about buying a home and you say that we need more housing, we do need more housing, but we need affordable housing. And this is an area that currently does have single family homes that are somewhat affordable."
05_05_2020,affordable housing,And that's what's been going on all over town. So we are losing affordable housing. We're not gaining anything.
04_19_2022,housing crisis,"There were concerns about not supporting requests like this would further heighten concerns about our housing crisis we're experiencing or the assertion that there's a housing crisis, but the indisputable evidence that there are increased housing prices in the area. Also that this property was an appropriate location given its proximity to a transit location and amenities and the interchange. And also there was a comment that if council were not to support this, they shouldn't support other attached residential uses or non-residential uses that are in somewhat close proximity to the property."
04_19_2022,affordable housing,"And I believe it's possible to develop and create affordable housing in other ways. And also, RU, well, in general, I mean, this would be precedent. If this upzones to RU, other...  And our extended neighborhood is already burdened with failures in this area to make sure that not more than three unrelated people are in homes."
04_19_2022,housing crisis,"I'm here on behalf of my father and friends that reside on FAC0, FAC1, FAC2, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and parts of [ORGANIZATION]. The housing crisis was mentioned earlier, and we are experiencing a kind of housing crisis [ORGANIZATION].  down the [STREET] from this property and I can appreciate the city attorney's directive to not conflate rezoning concerns with the development process but I hope to highlight an example of when rezoning gets expedited or is hastily approved that it can compromise the development process towards the end of my comments. This project has a significant plot of permeable surface that will presumably transition into a big slab of concrete or impervious area."
04_19_2022,affordable housing,"It also aligns with the corridor urbanism ethos of the [ORGANIZATION] corridor plan by increasing affordable housing opportunities potentially and growing the opportunity to create an attractive front door to pay both downtown and the adjacent neighborhoods. This request lowers the intensity of zoning and supports the city's planning objectives. and more broadly to see its DATE0 goals of becoming a more walkable, livable community, a more vibrant and resilient community."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"So it's kind of in that zone where I think it's accessible to the infrastructure that we are investing in. And so I'm not willing to call this too far out just yet when we are always keeping an eye on affordable housing options. All right, anyone else?"
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"And the main reason is, uh, I believe that the multifamily housing is going to offer a lot more affordable housing. So that's really important. We're missing that right now."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,I'm DATE0. I am so in line with appropriate infill and affordable housing like you don't believe. But I don't feel especially like the developer hasn't reached out or talked to us or had any kind of dialogue with 34 houses in the neighborhood so that we could talk about it.
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"Someone spoke to affordable housing. The developer is proposing housing at $250,000. I'm old enough to think that's expensive."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"It doesn't give the vision [ORGANIZATION]  When you look at the definitions of some of those words, appropriate infill.  diversity and growth economy, pathways to prosperity. These houses are not going to be an affordable housing option. They're being built in this neighborhood because there's an opportunity to make some money at a square footage that's available."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"Those people have to [STREET] into somewhere. They're probably going to take FAC0. So, so that's not just you know There's other areas outside of [ORGANIZATION] that feed on to FAC0 and they're they're building affordable housing out there"
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"When we don't build housing for people that are coming anyway, the scarcity drives up costs.  which also means it's driving up your property values. So we've got that tension of affordable housing and the fear of lowering property values when I think the reality works the other [STREET]. But I was also...  on my assessment of [ORGANIZATION] as unsustainable."
03_05_2019,affordable housing,"and now there's neighborhoods i want to protect if i was in it and there's times i wanted to live in higher density and our community is having this debate continually and we are really going to have this debate in [ORGANIZATION] as we update this plan we have affordable housing and we've heard [TIME] about supply and demand determine price that's not something we say that's economics  The less supply we have, the more the price goes up."
03_05_2024,homeless,"This is [PERSON]. Number nine, a resolution to approve a contract for [ORGANIZATION] to provide funding assistance in the amount of $40,000 for maintenance and repairs at FAC0 in [LOCATION]. Number 10 resolution to approve a contract with benchmark construction company of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] incorporated any amount of seven hundred eighty nine thousand seven hundred forty seven dollars and fifty cents for construction of the FAC1 project phase one to approve project contingency any amount of eighty thousand dollars and to prove budget just this is DATE0 [STREET] improvement on project number 11 a  A resolution to approve a budget adjustment in the amount of $1,948,635, recognizing federal aid and state funding from ORG2 for right-of-[STREET] acquisition associated with the improvements to FAC2."
03_05_2024,affordable housing,"We looked at how many properties had existing housing, what vacancy we had there, kind of what the potential for additional infill was, at what scale could that be. And we talked a lot about affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], so we wanted to be sure to show this information. Single family, large lot detached housing does not provide us a lot of opportunities for low cost housing at this point in time."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"I hope that that changes in the future because I do believe that many of us graduated from [ORGANIZATION] We're alumni, and so we love the university, but we need to work hand-in-hand with them in order to solve the housing crisis, solve other issues that affect our city greatly. So I hope they will be more forthcoming."
04_16_2024,affordable housing,"If we want to preserve our farms and forests on the edge of town, if we want to protect our water quality in [ORGANIZATION], if we want to provide affordable dwellings, affordable housing and transportation, if we want to encourage our residents to walk and be more active and healthy, then in places we need density like this. It's a contrast to what we're proposing. Next slide, [ORGANIZATION]."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,yeah okay well let's just leave that one here it is let's go to number six a resolution to establish a new full-time employee for a housing coordinator to focus efforts towards the housing crisis declaration of [ORGANIZATION].
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"And if not [TIME], if we don't support it [TIME], then I hope that we keep this on our radar as we move forward in this housing crisis process. Thank you. okay anything else"
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"I think it would take the onus off of the task force to shoulder additional duties and responsibilities in conjunction with their own [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] lives. I think it would also give us someone who has access to resources and information that are available to a member of staff. I think in the face of an already very deeply complex issue like this housing crisis, that adding whatever assistance we could to the experts and peers that will be members of this group would be of a benefit to the project."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"One person and one person's salary to help support and ground the experts that are being gathered seems like a fair price to pay for this kind of support, which I believe will ultimately be worth far more to the city than the sum of money used to pay for this position. I think that having a static person who will, over time, not only be an expert on individual facets of our housing crisis, like the members of the task force, but on the nature of housing in the city as a whole, will be a huge benefit. Thank you so much."
04_16_2024,homeless; homelessness; housing crisis,"And as part of my training, I have had to volunteer at [ORGANIZATION] for [TIME] of service. And in addition to that, I worked at [ORGANIZATION] as a building services  a worker and I have had a lot of interaction with people under the unfortunate poverty and homelessness and  I absolutely encourage a housing coordinator, and I would hope that the council would potentially consider hiring a social worker or somebody who can understand the complexities surrounding the housing crisis and just take into consideration the intersectionality of having to –  specifically create locations and being able to facilitate the populations of [ORGANIZATION] and honoring those."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION] again, last time [TIME] I promise. They've made some great points. The one thing I want to add is that this is your opportunity to decide whether recognizing and declaring we have a housing housing crisis was a statement that we're going to say and then go through some some motions to make it look good or if it's something that we are committed to addressing It's not a ton of money it's a a  source that's not going to impact the general fund, which was a big source of concern at budget time."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"Or what's the intent with the –  No, I really appreciate the question. You know, I've had the privilege to get to travel to places like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION]. And, you know, [PERSON], I think we had that conversation together as a body that we're not incredibly unique in the fact that we're facing housing crisis, right?"
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"The nation is facing. With the housing crisis, however, oftentimes we've been quite ingenuitive. Those different cities are really focusing resources around housing and creating different unique positions, some like in [ORGANIZATION] that are looking at real estate type opportunities."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"Yes, sir. I appreciate the feedback and I want to acknowledge that yes, through this compromise set of resolutions, we did arrive at one agreed upon housing crisis resolution, but we also did say we were in crisis."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,"But naming it as a crisis, a housing crisis. It's so much of our population. It's our entire population that's impacted by that."
04_16_2024,housing crisis,I perfectly understand. I was a couple things up myself [TIME]. I thought that the housing crisis was something else entirely.
04_16_2024,homeless,Go ahead and give it to us in [TIME]. All right. uh best i can [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] i left a proposal for you regarding the homeless issue in [ORGANIZATION] this was presented to the mayor's office and to the council's office where it was graciously received along with a copy of my letter to the editor on the same subject which had been recently published on DATE2
04_16_2024,homeless,"So, the word is out among us. I am hoping that [ORGANIZATION] can lead the [STREET] in developing a system of collective housing for peer groups that might share a variety of their particular identities. These peer groups might include homeless [PERSON] veterans who identify together as such, or battered women who identify together as such, or recovering alcoholics, or unemployed diesel mechanics, or any other manner of folks who can identify in common based on secular, religious, social, gender, generation, based on any meaningful identity."
04_16_2024,homeless,"After all of that, one final question might occur to you. Why should we bother? Well, of course, we want to offer homes to the homeless."
04_16_2024,homeless,"And they hope that their networks will harvest wealth and power and influence, just as those old monastic orders did. Here in [ORGANIZATION], where the homeless problem has become a crisis of its own, we can lay the groundwork for the solution. And hopefully, those vast networks will be headquartered here."
04_21_2020,homeless,"The funding for unsheltered homeless needs services and supplies, and the health assistance also needs services and supplies.  that will be funding that will be available for entities in the community, non-profits that will be working with individuals that are low to moderate income, and then the unsheltered homeless, of course, specifically for unsheltered homeless. So if we want to comment about the rental assistance, is that the time we're supposed to comment now or right now we're just accepting the money and later we do? I'm so sorry if you already said that I got a little lost."
04_21_2020,homeless,"I hope I can reach it. So there will be additional funding because I think what's gonna happen is as we move through this event, we're going to come up with different needs that we have. Now, the categories that I also heard you mentioned that how these came up,  I have been in meetings with, there is a regional homeless work group."
04_16_2019,affordable housing,The covenants for FAC0 restrict construction to one story and no more than one unit per lot. This would allow... several stories and if you've been to the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood since that area went through some new construction it is jarring when you have the closeness to the [STREET] that they had as well as the heights and let me just point out that that construction didn't necessarily result in more affordable housing because one of those is an [ORGANIZATION] house our neighborhood's We're lucky to have streets with curbs. We don't have sidewalks.
07_03_2018,housing crisis,I'll try to keep it under four and a half. But I think this is really important that we're doing this now and dealing with this kind of issue before we have a housing crisis. The  The things I want to stress are that the demographics that the country is looking at is 70% of households are one or two members.
02_20_2024,affordable housing,"And, you know, that's That's their exercise and that's their safe path to exercise and then we're creating a very dangerous intersection for them Another point I'd like to make is that we are talking specifically in about an area in a very affordable housing Area"
02_20_2024,affordable housing,"And part of the conversations that we've been having over [ORGANIZATION] in transportation are around in the [STREET] fund, we have a certain allocation that goes towards transit cost. And as we have this conversation about affordable housing, you know, the all-in cost of transportation and housing is incredibly important for households. And we know that wages are not keeping up to increase wealth and help folks with affordability."
02_20_2024,housing crisis,"However, I was approached by the applicant some time back who had expressed a desire to put mini storage on this location. And in that conversation I expressed. a great desire that that not be the direction, that we are in a housing crisis and that housing people's belongings in a very prime location that had already had tremendous infrastructure developed by our taxpayers was not the highest best use of that property."
07_02_2019,homeless; homelessness,"I want to take you back to a time [ORGANIZATION] when I was a business owner in northwest [ORGANIZATION] and had very definite opinions about what it meant for people experiencing homelessness, except back then I just said homeless people, those people that, you know, beg for money on the side of the [STREET]. Right. And over [LOCATION], I have, as you all know, become a very staunch homeless advocate as I came out of the closet about personally having experienced homelessness as a child and a teenager."
07_02_2019,homelessness,"And what I'll tell you is that during that time, I have become very aware of the things, the causes of homelessness from childhood trauma. If you look at what childhood trauma does to the brain development and your ability to make good decisions,  and you look at the number of people that are experiencing homelessness that experience childhood trauma, I think it's unfair to just automatically take our own white middle-class values and project them on someone when we don't know the trauma that they have endured. As I have become aware of people experiencing homelessness and the causes and the reasons for that,  I would encourage other people that are maybe not aware of their own biases, perhaps maybe this ordinance can not only give the prosecutor the discretion that he needs and the encouragement to  do what he's probably already been doing, which is use his discretion, but also to raise his awareness."
07_02_2019,homeless,"but they're using the marijuana because they're not able to go and get prescription drugs to deal with the anxiety that they have and the depression that they have  If this ordinance helps to raise awareness for our law enforcement and our judicial community and our entire community, the [STREET] the advocacy has done for me over [ORGANIZATION], then our community will be better. And I do agree that we need to not just look at this ordinance, but what are the ways that we can help  our judicial system will look at the entire process and the entire effect that it has on poverty and the entire effect that it has on people of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. You know, a lot of times when you're a homeless advocate, people will say to you, well, why don't they just get a job?"
03_03_2020,affordable housing,"We are actively participating in regional initiatives on affordable housing. As population grows, so do jobs and housing needs. We must proactively manage the growth on our city's borders."
03_03_2020,housing crisis,"We have a housing crisis in this community, and if you've looked for a [STREET] to rent or even buy for something that you could afford on an average salary, there's an extreme shortage of that. And by refusing to allow reasonable density in close proximity to where people want to live, work, and shop, we're exacerbating that crisis. we need to be building as much as possible right now or or it's going to get worse"
03_03_2020,homelessness; affordable housing,"I mean we have a lot of people experiencing homelessness we have a lot of people spending far more than they should or percentage-wise of their household income for for rent and for transportation because they're forced to [STREET] until they can qualify or afford so it's absolutely unacceptable to me that we are  dragging our feet on allowing reasonable density in infill areas. So I think that if  If we support affordable housing, if we support appropriate infill, if we support community revitalization, if we actually want to discourage sprawl and build a livable transportation network, we absolutely must upzone these parcels in question. So I hope that we'll support this, and I hope that we will get really serious about creating attainable housing in this community because we're in a crisis."
06_20_2023,homeless,"PERSON0. Good [TIME], Mayor and [ORGANIZATION]. As the [ORGANIZATION] will remember, at our last ARPA work session, we talked about and came to the conclusion that the best use of the remaining ARPA funds would be to look at housing and an opportunity to resolve problems  some of the housing issues with homeless and those who were on the borderline or had the, or who could become homeless in a short period of time."
06_20_2023,homeless,"So we were, we discussed it at the time and the administration has drafted a request for innovative concepts for housing solutions and case management. I'm going to read you just the pertinent part which will be the guts of what we're looking for. [ORGANIZATION] is looking for creative solutions for concepts to execute and address homeless instability."
06_20_2023,homeless,Applicants are asked to submit projects with a holistic and scalable amount approach to the addressing of permanent housing solutions and case management for the homeless and those facing instability related to the effect of the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic. Proposals should maximize the number of individuals involved  to provide housing to use [ORGANIZATION] funds. Proposed projects must comply with the [ORGANIZATION] and its final rules.
06_20_2023,homeless,"Proposal should clearly indicate how the applicant will implement the project and how the project will provide a benefit to the homeless population in [ORGANIZATION]. Preference will be given to permanent  housing solutions, and projects that are sustainable beyond this particular funding opportunity. Proposal for each project should provide a budget, discuss how many people will be assisted in the project, and a detailed timeline for the applicant to administer the project."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"So that is something that is an educational process which I'm really happy to hear that you want to do that would assist the people who are getting subsidized housing. I want to thank all of you for having the wisdom to recognize the importance of affordable housing. I also want to thank [ORGANIZATION] Members [PERSON] and [PERSON] for their insight and intelligent care for the community, which put this before your [ORGANIZATION]."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"I truly believe everyone deserves to have a [STREET] to live, and that the whole of [ORGANIZATION] is benefited by circumstances that support affordable housing. As good-hearted people, I believe all of us support making affordable housing accessible to those who need it. I really see that here [TIME]."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"Affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] is disappearing. I don't know if you know how serious this is. [ORGANIZATION]  have recently altered their policies concerning vouchers, and both FAC0 and FAC1, two long-time properties providing affordable, subsidized housing, are facing issues that will reduce the amount of affordable housing."
06_20_2023,homelessness,"So if those people were not given the ability to find places, you would have here in this city a homelessness crisis. I know I personally have a voucher and it's overwhelming to find landlords that will accept even this voucher."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"There has been issues with tenants facing eviction due to rent or just the circumstances of living there as well. I just want to say that it's hard for me as the rent has skyrocketed and affordable housing  is a crisis and I'm facing that barrier as well to relocate, to find myself a safe [STREET] to live. So I just want to say that I hope that you guys will see this going forward and understand there is a crisis for affordable and low income families to relocate and to move."
06_20_2023,homeless,"It doesn't only affect homeless people or income people, but also the people that this city mostly or  at least sizably profits off of, which is college students, people from other states coming over here. It is also a danger to us whenever people don't have homes because that can lead to crime. So right outside of FAC0, or I guess FAC1, there is a criminal activity going on."
06_20_2023,homeless,"There's homeless people there. And one time whenever I, it was [TIME], I was in my bedroom, I had like a [ORGANIZATION] kid coming inside my apartment and knocking on my door, saying that a man outside my building was like chasing him and stabbed him in the toe. And he was just trying to find  any door to open to just go inside because he's just that desperate to get away from the violence so this can so this disparity causes violence and people can turn to crime so it just doesn't affect them"
06_20_2023,affordable housing,but it also affects you know college students so like that crime can also be very dangerous for us so high rent prices lead to those crimes and potentially like it but it hurts more people but also these uh the voucher transparency can also help renters  find affordable housing so this can be a solution for that and it can also help make upward socioeconomic mobility uh easier to achieve it'll be easier for them to you know do better we want them to do better so make it a little easier for them to do better so that [STREET] they can fill themselves back up and it can serve as a foundation for them to feel like a citizen and participate in the economy and whatnot so it's a it's a huge ripple effect that we also need to see it as too thank you thank you thank you who else would like to address this  Good [TIME]. My name is [ORGANIZATION] and I am a member of [ORGANIZATION].
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"What compels me to come speak [TIME] is the deteriorating state of affordable housing in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I support this amendment because the shrinking availability of properties that accept vouchers is alarming as someone who works with low to middle income tenants, but devastating for the individuals and families that often wait [ORGANIZATION] for assistance only to wind up empty-handed. With such a situation facing our community, any step taken to address it is a step in the right direction."
06_20_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"While the actions of local governments are often limited in their scope, their impacts are felt across the community. Lack of affordable housing is being felt across our city, but it is low and middle income people, many of them persons of color, who bear the brunt of this burden. I encourage this body to take yet another step to resolving our housing crisis, and I thank you for your time."
06_20_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"We all recognize the reality that affordable housing is crucial. And my work as a community organizer for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], across the state,  The number one issue that I'm hearing from voucher recipients is inability to access a [STREET] where they can actually use the voucher. I recognize that none of us want this housing crisis."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"I do want the public to know that we are really concerned about affordable housing. We spent a good [TIME] discussing affordable housing [ORGANIZATION], and  However, [TIME] I'm going to reluctantly support this. I think that the implementation piece is not well-defined because you're going to have to have all these landlords go in and actually identify whether they're going to take Section 8 or other kinds of vouchers."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,Let's talk about affordable housing. We've heard a lot about that [ORGANIZATION]. I think you guys probably talked about it quite a bit at your retreat.
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"This will help support commercial space and affordable housing in the area. Also, it will support the golf course, which is a great amenity to [ORGANIZATION]. When the area is connected to the bike path via FAC0, there will be tremendous opportunities for recreation for residents."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"And giving people the opportunity to live out there  be able to use one of the only public golf courses in [ORGANIZATION] and not have to pay membership fees and exclusivity and not be able to afford it. By giving these 100 homes, which we've done very successfully in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION], I'm old as a rock, but it's been a long time. We've provided affordable housing for [ORGANIZATION].  All along the [STREET], I think most of you are very familiar with what we do on the affordable housing."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"I don't know of another golf course community that you will find an affordable housing subdivision that's offering homes from 13, [DATE], 1500 square feet. So it embraces almost everything that we've heard [TIME]. We're bringing some attainable housing."
06_20_2023,affordable housing,"So what density does, by decreasing the density with that bill of assurance, you're making the houses more expensive. If you have asked about affordable housing in this plan, think about what that's going to do to the affordable housing aspect of it. you take the same amount of land, you divide it by fewer buyers, each one's going to pay a bigger chunk of the price."
02_04_2020,affordable housing,"We put more two to four hundred thousand dollar houses what happens is people don't buy houses that are 1[DATE],000 in that neighborhood put in [DATE] and then sell it for 300 the affordable housing [PERSON] because we're not gutting now houses in the neighborhood already there. So if we're talking about affordable housing, um  I think this helps even if these specifically aren't affordable go through some of these neighborhoods You see so many dumpsters and so many yards because that's what's happening as they're gutting what used to be affordable houses So hopefully this helps prevent that All right, this is no other final comments care would you please cover up  [ORGANIZATION]?"

06_04_2020,homeless,"I think I'm glad that we're  pulling the trails off because those are used by different folks for not only leisure needs but also for transportation needs and many of our homeless population use those so I appreciate not making ordinances as well that may be target someone or very small instances particularly or I agree with many of the commenters we do have laws on the books that exist [ORGANIZATION] for things that are stalking loitering criminal mischief  that our law enforcement can use to keep our citizens safe. I very much applaud the conversation in regard to etiquette, and And I think this can be not only trail etiquette, but any etiquette around the city."
03_01_2022,homelessness,"support groups who have  experiencing issues before [ORGANIZATION] and now these communities are really being impacted. African Americans, Hispanic, [ORGANIZATION], homelessness. And so that's what we're looking at."

[ORGANIZATION] AND [PERSON] PROVIDING EXPRESSIVE ART CLASSES, EXERCISE CLASSES FOR CHILDREN IN PERSON AND [LOCATION], CAREER READINESS TRAINING WORKSHOPS,  for kids that are homeless, teens that are on probation, within the juvenile detention centers, and feeding. We have hosted back to school events, [LOCATION] holiday giveaways for families that are in dire need in GPE2. Our impact report is very impressive and it shows that we are determined and dedicated to improve the quality of life for all individuals, especially children here in [ORGANIZATION]."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"One of the things that [ORGANIZATION], as well as all the towns in northwest [PERSON], one of the biggest requests there is right now is for affordable housing. With the [ORGANIZATION] plan with the two-acre lots, that's just not a possibility. It's just not a feasible thing."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"Thank you. I agree with staff and planning commission's assessment of this property that [ORGANIZATION], or the four units per acre, is not an appropriate land use. Based on our [ORGANIZATION] plan, you know, we're supposed to be discouraging suburban sprawl, and I would say that this  parcel probably has a walk score of zero and that you can't walk anywhere it's well outside our box around the city its adjacency to the floodplain means that developing this land could exacerbate flooding issues downstream and as far as affordable housing affordable housing there's a caveat of that the the cost of transportation um"
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"We need to have variety in the marketplace, and if that goes against the [ORGANIZATION] plan to let this happen, to allow people to have a [STREET] to live on the edge of town, then we  who prefer to live on the edge of town, why should we try to fit a square peg in a round hole? Why don't we let the market offer variety? I don't view it as a great immoral breach by letting this landowner develop his land with affordable housing in an area of town that is growing."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"But on the other hand, I also see the challenges that people face trying to find affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and I can tell you that affordable housing for most people is  for a lot of people is not in central [ORGANIZATION]. I mean, that's where I live, and I'm lucky to live there, but for a lot of the people that I work with as a real estate agent, it's just not an option. And so they are looking outside the city limits of [ORGANIZATION]."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"You know, I don't necessarily...  like this exactly but I'm not exactly against it either because I understand the Need for affordable housing and that just that just does not end up all the time in the middle of [PERSON], thank you. Okay, [ORGANIZATION] This is very tough for me to say too because I'm going to go right along with the arguments that we just heard from this bunch as a banker  Every day I'm faced with trying to find affordable housing with an affordable mortgage plan for families of modest means."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"This is in a rural development area, and so there are programs that would allow a family to get into this with a rural development loan. These loans are specifically for this type of development. I have compassion for these individuals that have looked and looked and looked and looked for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and they can't find it."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,and so i had to balance a lot of that affordability and opportunity for some people that i know personally on a [DATE] basis that are struggling to find a [STREET] to live this is not ideal there's a lot of things about this that is not ideal but i'm going to support the development of this property  because I do see it as an opportunity for affordable housing for people that otherwise won't have it. It's not so far away from services that I think it's going to make transportation a large issue.
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"okay i guess we've had the conversation about affordable housing enough now that i've got a question for mr PERSON0 um  Knowing how far out [ORGANIZATION] this is in transportation costs, can you put a number on what you consider affordable housing on this area? Affordable housing for any of this area I would think would probably be around the 200 grains, 175 to maybe two range, something in that area right there. That's one thing that's always driven the affordable housing market to the west side of [PERSON] because of the terrain out there allows you to get some pretty good yield on your lots."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,And I'm glad you do. And I look forward to being able to add something to the study of [ORGANIZATION] and give us some more affordable housing out there. Thank you.
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"council member [ORGANIZATION] just hit on some of the points that i was going to talk about that you know [ORGANIZATION] development does not pay for the cost of infrastructure to maintain it but also you know we talk about affordable housing and a key part of this discussion is  It's about right size housing and we have an abundance of the single family, three bedroom, two bath homes but the dynamics of the demographics of our households are changing. We're already over 75% child free households and that number is going to rise.  because of empty nesters, because of people delaying housings. We're having non-custodial households and families of divorce."
02_20_2018,affordable housing,"And we're also fortunate to bring in eight industry experts, people with expertise in public-private partnerships with health institutions to anchor development, expertise in jurisdictional transfers working with state departments of transportation, and expertise in public health  commercial development and affordable housing and they are tasked with interviewing more than 48 people on [ORGANIZATION] from the community across all sectors and Developing summary recommendations for presentation on [LOCATION] those presentations will be at the town center starting at [DATE] and go until 12 I think we start at [DATE]. I hope you can be there [TIME] for first miss mayor. I have a question for [ORGANIZATION] first time for me to ask a question on I  Can you explain to the people what items are available to be disposed of on DATE2?"
05_03_2016,affordable housing,"So we feel like we're still in line with where we're trying to go as a with our city and traditional development patterns. One of the advantages, one of the reasons we created the RSF 18  zoning district was to allow for some smaller single-family infill lots to be Built out and also allow for some potential for more affordable housing. However, as you guys see when sometimes you'll have To get those smaller single-family lots in the past We would have to rezone it to a multi-family zoning and that had a difficult time going through the political process"
05_03_2022,affordable housing,"If the [STREET]-in must go away, how can we ensure that its lands utilization will go towards affordable housing, affordable entertainment options, and the general betterment of the city? And how can the city government ensure the survival of our independent art and cultural spaces? The pandemic took a grave toll on these spaces locally and nationwide."
05_03_2022,affordable housing,"They didn't buy the land intending to only have affordable housing on it. They didn't buy it or they're not selling it, you know, just to have affordable entertainment or affordable housing. They're selling it because they no longer want to run the [STREET]-in or they're ready to retire or whatever."
03_06_2018,panhandler,"Our concern on this is safety. We're just as concerned about the safety of a panhandler in the middle of the [STREET] as we are a pedestrian. And when you have people... texting and the number of, we've written over 146 tickets of people texting and driving when you have the distracted individual and you have people standing longer periods of time, not in a pedestrian crossing aspect, it is a real safety issue."
03_06_2018,homeless,"Mayor, do you want to add a comment? Because I don't want misinformation getting out. The city contributes over $600,000 to homeless services, over $450,000 for housing with a veterans housing focus."
03_06_2018,homeless,"And we also have roughly $200,000 for various homeless services, including contributions to [ORGANIZATION]. So when you talk about we need to do something, I do want you to get credit for the money that you have allocated which is over a half a million dollars to this problem i'm not aware of any other city that can make that statement thank you for setting your own chart on that i did not intend to imply that we weren't we're doing anything to tackle the problem just there's a whole lot more problem we've left in front of us okay well let's open it up for some public comment i guess by now everybody knows the rules Good [TIME], Mayor, [ORGANIZATION]."
03_06_2018,homelessness,"We are a civil rights organization that helped pass the civil rights ordinance here in the city. We have since become a local political action committee supporting progressive candidates and policies, but at its heart, For [PERSON] is a civil rights organization. [PERSON] is the next big civil rights challenge here in this city."
03_06_2018,homeless,"We do not have very many homeless beds in [ORGANIZATION]. Until we can do this, we believe we're going to be continually chasing our tails and handing people citations they cannot pay. Our homeless neighbors need housing, not handcuffs."
03_06_2018,housing crisis; affordable housing,"For every 100 people eligible for low income housing in [ORGANIZATION], there are 41 available units and 31 units is the national average. We are in an affordable housing crisis and the future outlook isn't positive as wages stay stagnant and rent increases substantially. Housing is the best intervention coupled with a supportive community."
03_06_2018,homelessness,"As a student, I've logged [TIME] working with low-income individuals and our neighbors who are experiencing homelessness. There's always a concern. First, I'd like to thank the city of [ORGANIZATION] for the resources that they do provide for our vulnerable citizens and the police officers themselves."
03_06_2018,homeless,"And the last thing I might say is, yeah, I've been in a couple of communities that have have posted signs like text a certain number with a certain phrase to donate a certain amount to your local [INSTITUTION] signs. And I wonder if something like that might help out with this particular issue."
03_06_2018,panhandler,"It's not directed toward panhandlers. And even if being a panhandler, though, doesn't give you the right to break the law, it doesn't give you the right to jaywalk or to create danger for other people. You have a right to ask for money, and you can do that, and we don't say you can't."
02_21_2017,homeless,"We're going to be talking about a regional approach to this. Folks, it's like the homeless situation. That is a regional thing that we need to address."
04_04_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,This program is a federal block grant program that provides [ORGANIZATION] funding used exclusively for affordable housing activities to benefit low-income households. Funding for homelessness services is not an eligible activity for this funding. I think that was mentioned at the last meeting I wanted to make sure that you were all aware that that is not an eligible funding activity.
04_04_2023,affordable housing,"This will help us to get there. This is a first-time participation dollar amount. And then moving forward, we will have our allocation that will come to us [ORGANIZATION] to use to assist individuals to get into affordable housing."
04_04_2023,affordable housing,I assume we'll be completing the application [TIME]. The home funds do have different uses than some of the programs that we currently offer. i know that the planning process in [ORGANIZATION] before the plan is submitted in [LOCATION] will we'll have a lot of opportunity to discuss that i hope that we will lean more into uses that expand our inventory of affordable housing and not just the the easy [STREET] to do it is to to set up rental assistance programs that  just dump our public money into the hands of landlords that already exist and will have somebody no matter what.
06_07_2022,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], we have partnered with [ORGANIZATION] and our pillars are addressing hunger, homelessness, and poverty. In that collaboration with [ORGANIZATION], we address poverty through exposing them to the arts through the Lights Up program. This exposure would not be available to some of the citizens in [ORGANIZATION], as well as underrepresented and underserved citizens without [ORGANIZATION] offering these lights up tickets."
06_07_2022,affordable housing,"And that comment came from the president of [ORGANIZATION]. So I like to think he speaks for a larger group in a lot of ways. And that is consistent feedback we've had from a lot of our applicants is whatever,  Our fees are considered so nominal to many of our applicants that it does not pose any obstruction to their ability to deliver a product, their ability to provide affordable housing."
06_06_2023,housing crisis,"I'm not I understand, you know, I understand our housing crisis and everything. So, again, I don't have a dog in this fight. But again, just on that one point, I think is kind of important."
06_06_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"We could take [ORGANIZATION]'s map and that blue line and make it a  The black heritage district, and maybe we should look into that, but that's not going to stop people from being displaced. That's not going to solve the problem. We're in the midst of a huge affordable housing crisis here."
06_06_2023,affordable housing,"I don't know how much we did to be able to make that happen, but market forces have taken over. And in fact, there has been tremendous development there, loss of affordable housing and replacement with housing that is nicer but more expensive. What can we do?"
06_06_2023,affordable housing,"For example, legacy business program, adaptive reuse of historical buildings for affordable housing, et cetera. And I will mention that in surveying the community at the farmers market [ORGANIZATION], that was a very popular option that got a lot of votes. I'm happy to answer any additional questions the council might have."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"Yes, yes [PERSON] yes, okay, let's move on to number three. I  resolution to declare a housing crisis in the city of [ORGANIZATION] good [TIME] uh mayor and city council and I believe after the meeting after the meeting we had on [ORGANIZATION] I'm not a I'm not privy or aware of any changes um I'm not sure how to proceed uh because we did discuss um  some things [ORGANIZATION]."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"Okay, just wanted to make sure. Okay, I make the motion that we accept the amendments to this new housing crisis resolution. Second."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,I ran up the stairs. Give me a second. Okay.  and reveal the difficulties posed by our housing crisis through sharing my personal story as to many others.
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING FROM EXPENSES TO [LOCATION], THE AMOUNT OF [ORGANIZATION] COMPETITIVE  MAKE IT DEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR [LOCATION] TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE HO[LOCATION]ING OPTIONS. I HOPE TO NOT ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF, BUT TO ALSO STAND HERE AS A VOICE FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO CANNOT BE PRESENT DATE0. I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS HO[LOCATION]ING CRISIS RESOLUTION."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"In his presentation, he did a fantastic job of  Well, outlining how we got to where we are, but also of including a certain panache for corny humor that I always forget to bring to my numbers, so thanks for that also. It laid out a fantastic understanding of how we got to where we are in our housing crisis that pairs really well with the numbers that the staff report provided [ORGANIZATION] for quantifying the housing crisis. He pointed out a lot of the things that the city is not in control of and some of the things that the city is in control of."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said. I just want to say thank you for hearing us out and for looking for solutions to the housing crisis so tirelessly. Your servitude is inspiring and I'm grateful to call [ORGANIZATION] home.
04_02_2024,affordable housing,"And then plus the non-market forces, if we want below market rates, we have to have non-market actors involved in housing. So the public financing at every level of every jurisdiction level that is possible, public resources like land, those public tools we have to influence ultimately how affordable housing can happen. So thank you for your attention and to listening to this."
04_02_2024,affordable housing,the mobilized renter community and I hope we can build together a cohesive affordable housing strategy for [ORGANIZATION] thank you who else would like to address this who do you have on zoom [ORGANIZATION] mayor no one on zoom has their hand raised whoops here we go okay [PERSON] raised his hand come on up yeah
04_02_2024,housing crisis,Thank you and I look forward to seeing this housing crisis passed. Thank you. Thank you.
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"DATE0, I talked about the hope that I had when I first moved here and the growing fear that I had that I would not be able to stay here. And the growing fear that I had for my students as a [ORGANIZATION] high school teacher that they would not be able to stay here. And I truly believe that the amount of work that y'all put into listening to the people of [ORGANIZATION] and the amount of work you put into serving us by trying to come up with a solution or at least a start to some solutions for this housing crisis has given me a lot of that hope back."
04_02_2024,homelessness,"are now, and it's hard to even, even encompass this, that people are living in multiple families, just trying to survive. Some people are, are, you know, they're living in a very, very poor environment. are on the brink of homelessness."
04_02_2024,homeless,"I live in public housing. I serve all over the community in areas of need, and I see people living from paycheck to paycheck, many of them taking in extra people in their homes so that they're not homeless. We do have a crisis, and I know you've listened to [TIME] of this, so I'll keep it short, but  But thank you for considering everything and please vote yes on this resolution so that we can address all the needs and have a task force to focus on all of these needs."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"International students are deeply affected by our current housing crisis. Legally, they are very limited in their ability to work. and most are unable to afford a car."
04_02_2024,affordable housing,"This means that they have to find housing near enough to the university or along public transit routes in order to find housing, let alone affordable housing. Sorry, finding housing, let alone affordable housing is a challenge. I personally have a friend from [ORGANIZATION] who had to stay in a hotel for [ORGANIZATION] before he could find an apartment when he first arrived, which drained him of his savings."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"And this is not a unique experience. And so I'm not asking for any changes to this resolution [TIME], but as we address this housing crisis over [ORGANIZATION], there are some things I'd like to see happen. Overturning residential parking minimums is a no brainer."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"And I believe when we work together, this shows when we work together, we can do great things. My vote on the housing coordinator wasn't so much that I'm against having a housing coordinator, I'm for that, but after talking with city staff, after working with my fellow council members, I'm not one to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I ran on addressing the housing crisis and I hope while seated that I get to make measurable strides in that effort and I want to stay true to my words."
04_02_2024,housing crisis,and i want to express that [TIME] i'm pleased with this council i'm pleased with my staff i'm thankful that we have citizens that let your voice be heard everybody needs to always show up step up and speak out and that's what you've done and we've heard you so thank you all thank everybody so with that PERSON0 let's vote  There needs to be a motion to approve. I make the motion that we adopt the housing crisis resolution.
04_02_2024,housing crisis,Resolution. Second. We have a motion and second to adopt the housing crisis resolution.
04_02_2024,housing crisis,"[ORGANIZATION], [DATE] FAC0. It is fitting that moments after unanimously recognizing a housing crisis,  and acknowledging that we need more housing, that you have an opportunity to make a decision that will enable more housing supply in the city. I hope that you will remember your previous statements and stay consistent with that."
04_02_2024,affordable housing,"And the maintenance issue is a big one down there, right? But I want you to be aware of the consequences because Improving the maintenance remodeling will probably raise the rents Redevelopment which I would support would also cost Probably a dozen affordable housing units in the town. And so with this which is a totally appropriate action and  comes an increased need to look at other proposals that come forward with an eye to remembering the responsibility that you create with this decision to maintain affordable housing, encourage additional stock everywhere you can right now."
02_21_2023,housing crisis,"So I'll just move right into it and kind of frame the climate. We said it on [ORGANIZATION], we're in a housing crisis that was further pressured because of the pandemic in [LOCATION] when [ORGANIZATION] released data on the calls for the need of service  By far, the biggest need is in housing. And this continued lack of increased housing stock for needed populations has been expressed in our master plan and in regional publications around the area."
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"I've done direct pandemic relief work. And then in campaigning, you get the privilege for [ORGANIZATION] to really be immersed with your community and really find,  I think oftentimes communities are not quite understanding of the dire need for housing for certain parts of our population. And so having a communications plan to really identify where there's that loss of existing affordable housing and the struggling cost of just being able to make ends meet for parts of our community can really be addressed if we can get attainable housing in [STREET] for parts of our community."
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And then moving on to identify opportunities for the creation of affordable housing on publicly owned land. You know, we have a lot of moving parts of the city and with the [INSTITUTION] vacating their building, leaving lots around the city. There's an opportunity in those areas to discuss and focus on those areas."
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And then the long-term one that I really landed on in the master plan was creating a complete neighborhood or [STREET] corridor plan [ORGANIZATION]. And this is already underway, and many of these goals are in process or being discussed. But knowing that hand-in-hand, finding the neighborhood fits for affordable housing projects being so important and vital in the core parts of our community."
02_21_2023,homelessness,"And I think the pandemic has really highlighted housing. I know for me it has. I live at near FAC0 in Ward 1, and I have seen nothing but an incredible increase in people experiencing homelessness."
02_21_2023,housing crisis,it's a lot of work and as council member [PERSON] as she stated and i think we all know this housing is a problem and we are experiencing a housing crisis
02_21_2023,homelessness; housing crisis,"and i i believe that in order to address any crisis we have to be proactive and it's not just a favorable problem but we're here in [ORGANIZATION] and so that's why  that's why we're concerned. I am committing myself as well, because I'm hearing the concerns about the housing crisis and the homelessness and individuals have come to me and they told me that,  Their rent started out maybe at $800 a month, and now it's $1,500 a month."
02_21_2023,housing crisis,but we definitely have a housing crisis there's no doubt about that and and as everybody has said it's not just locally it's nationally
02_21_2023,homelessness,"We've had the conversation about homelessness, but then there are individuals in [ORGANIZATION] who are working the working poor. And that's right. I just believe that what I'm hoping is.  that we can start working towards something to address that, because I'm hearing it all the time."
02_21_2023,homelessness,"And so we talk a lot about homelessness, but we're talking,  I don't think we've had the conversation around helping those who are working. Yes, I'd like to really thank you for doing this, [ORGANIZATION]. And I like the idea of, you know, I don't know what, you know, [PERSON] suggested maybe we look at maybe at some point, maybe a consultant, but I like the idea of trying to figure out"
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"If nothing else, we can express ourselves in a meeting, as we all times do. I volunteer to provide liquid refreshments for this retreat. I think my two cents worth would be is that...  you know, no one's against affordable housing."
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"And as as we've talked. I want to first acknowledge that that staff, you know, I completely respect your opinions. My concern, though, is as we work with the challenges of affordable housing and housing in general and infill, we're going to get in situations where we have to get creative."
02_21_2023,affordable housing,"Who's there? When we talk about, when you talk about accessible housing, are you talking about affordable housing? Because there is no [STREET] that this area is affordable now for most people."
06_16_2020,affordable housing,"You know the intent is to have single family homes right there,  that are small enough to be affordable. This is in walking distance to the university, the bike trails, FAC0 grocery store. And so I think it fits in with the city's goal to reduce urban sprawl and create affordable housing."
06_16_2020,affordable housing,"There is an opportunity there, but we know that there was an error made on this [STREET] as council member [ORGANIZATION] said, that started a domino effect and is used as an anchor to make an excuse for rezoning. I'm sorry to say it and I've said it before, but when we do these zonings and infills and we talk about affordable housing, it just hasn't happened. And I know it's because it's a supply and demand thing, but what is in this neighborhood already is affordable housing."
03_19_2019,affordable housing,"That started in [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION], which was an affordable housing loan purchase mandate. that 30% or more of [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s loan purchases, that's [ORGANIZATION] Mae and [ORGANIZATION] Mac, had to be related to affordable housing. During the [ORGANIZATION] administration in [LOCATION], [LOCATION] Secretary [PERSON] raised the percentage from – it had raised to 42 percent, and Secretary [PERSON] raised it to 50 percent."
03_19_2019,affordable housing,"In a relative term, we are calling affordable housing in the area. If you go to [ORGANIZATION] right now and you pull up [ORGANIZATION] or any other realtor website, you're going to find that houses in that area on... FAC0 on FAC1 on mission farther down on crossover up in [PERSON]. I believe you're going to be paying 500, $600,000 for a house."
04_06_2021,housing crisis,"Good [TIME], [ORGANIZATION] Members. I, too, am here to speak in favor of this [TIME]. And I could talk about housing crisis or that, you know, this is such a great area to live."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"It is very difficult to build affordable housing. Typically most cities experience affordable housing through what's called a process of filtration where housing starts as new, has all the amenities you'd expect for housing at that time and as markets change and amenities change the older housing tends to become more and more affordable as it moves through. As a result, it is certainly a concern if this property were to be developed and this housing were to be demolished or removed."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"I currently live in [ORGANIZATION] and I know that finding housing is incredibly difficult. The affordable housing that the displaced people who are asking for help currently, the housing they currently live in, is incredibly difficult to replace and these people may very well be just chased out of the city."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We, the city has declared a housing crisis and it's important to build more housing. There's too many reasons that go against rezoning this specific property. We definitely need housing, full stop, but we have to balance housing sustainability with the humanity and quality of life of those that are currently living here."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"so yes i worry about what will happen to these students and my other neighbors when they're forced to move out because this is one of the few remaining areas with affordable housing where middle class residents can live and enjoy the amenities of our city i'm i worry that it would be detrimental to the character of our city and to the neighborhood surrounding downtown to remove all affordable housing in downtown that has character and  and diversity and replace it with a large modern luxury apartment complex that I'm sorry you guys, I apologize, no offense, it looks like [ORGANIZATION]. It doesn't look like [PERSON]."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. but if not letting this residential area be is a good thing the long-term residents of this area and similar spaces are still in need of safe affordable and consistent housing where will they go will they have to leave our city i know that this kind of question will be put to the housing crisis task force but the people who live in this housing now are being affected immediately i believe that this type of mixed-use zoning is a good thing
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"And that's not a gap you can just make up. We know and mostly accept that new construction is going to be more expensive than the old, and that is the reason why it's essential that we pair our efforts for new housing with efforts to preserve our existing affordable housing. This isn't doing that."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"DATE0, this council voted unanimously to declare a housing crisis, and we are all thankful for that. And since then, it has moved with great speed to approve new developments that will bring hundreds of new beds to our city. That should be applauded."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Okay, so If if the property sells just the [STREET] it is without any rezoning someone could come in and add more units to the property That's possible. Yes Okay, so  this is a hard one is one of the commoners pointed out this is a difficult one um you know we just declared a housing crisis but at the same time that doesn't mean that uh we can just rubber stamp everything that comes comes past us and and i think height and context are important uh the zoning for cardinal and atmosphere that's that's at rmf [DATE] is it not [ORGANIZATION]  It's a mixture."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Are we going to consider, and we do have a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION]. We've all identified that. Are we going to up zone this to allow for the most we could get out of that piece of property?"
05_21_2024,housing crisis,I believe the the property that the the public speaker was talking about is the not that but the great building on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1  first i want to say thank you to the residents and that came out and spoke [TIME] um you know i commiserate with my colleagues you know this is not an easy decision by any means um one of the things that was brought up um you know we are in a housing crisis and having us solve this you know holistically across the entire city but also one of the things that we put in our comprehensive plan is making sure to really honor the significance of each of our kind of neighborhood centers And so I would ask for you to really think about that context around that hill.
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We did say there's a housing crisis. Well, I was . I know you're going to remind us of that."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"okay thank you you always know until the mayor's so PERSON0 I thought you had your life actually what councilmember PERSON1 was asking on the process was why you know I have hesitation around the sprawl aspect but if we have an [STREET] you know I guess one of my questions was whether or not when we're working through those contracts sometimes you know these types of things have been like what think about our workshop around our housing crisis resolution you know we added a lot of input kind of had a workshop and wonder if that water sewer committee it would make sense for us to be able to give feedback about what we might want included so that those that sit on that committee potentially could help with that but  Just throwing that out there, not sure procedurally if that makes sense, but having that ability to look at the contract later is important."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"The biggest point that's been brought up that's the hardest hurdle for me to get over is the vagueness of what everyone is wanting to see built there. And respect to everybody's time, I kind of want to know, I mean are we talking enough density to make this affordable housing or are we talking a low density where I have to go to a higher end tenant?  With increasing the water, I think the sewer line is going to be fine. The water line, increasing that is where a huge amount of cost is going to be."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"We'll continue on then. The resolution to appropriate a million dollars in general fund revenue received as [ORGANIZATION] revenue loss to fund the housing crisis task force early recommendations in response to the declared housing crisis. PERSON0, this one is yours."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"And it's for the purposes to set it aside to implement the early recommendations from [ORGANIZATION]. And so, you know, one of the reasons why we do this, you know, before the task force is formed is because, you know, we want to ensure that there are enough resources that are available to really support their efforts. And really wanting to make sure that we avoid any delays in implementing actions that might get identified, especially if there's like a short near-term or any low-hanging fruit."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"But one of the things I think whenever this was maybe looked at in the past about parks was [ORGANIZATION], and we know so much more. I know it's come up in so many of our conversations [TIME] about the housing study that was done, about our inventory levels, about... And the fact that we did deem this housing crisis."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"That would make that available. We've heard different things about the possibility of affordable housing type projects. That money could be available because, again, it doesn't have some of the restrictions that we've heard from the city attorney's office in the past."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Just tone it down? Well I would strike the immediate and immediate, I'd say appropriate use of funds and then  [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] hereby request [PERSON] to make recommendations in a timely manner for the appropriate use of these funds to begin endowed in the housing crisis. Will work for me."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,could I make a recommendation I made a note sorry well just differently just if we just strike out the time timeline so it agreed that [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] GPE0 hereby request that the housing crisis task force returned recommendations for appropriate use of these funds to begin addressing the housing crisis just gets rid of the immediacy term so we just delete only we add nothing so we have [TIME] on this
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"And so, you know, one of the things that was identified [TIME] through [LOCATION] talking about  property that's looking at rezoning was that kind of fr[LOCATION]tration around you know knowing that this workforce affordable ho[LOCATION]ing potentially what you know would exit that space and so the possible identification of potential you know projects that there would be some level of outlay or design or diligence work it's been brought up so many times you know in conversation about development codes and so you know that's obvio[LOCATION]ly a relevant  [STREET] that it can be [LOCATION]ed. I've been surprised at some of the cities in all honesty about some of the smaller amounts that they've been able to give to different organizations to do what they're calling affordable ho[LOCATION]ing and haven't been able to dig in and understand what their financial stacks are for that."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"okay okay well you know one of the things about  We were hoping when we gave them that money that it was gonna be affordable housing, but it really didn't turn out that [STREET]."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,This is going to be a decision you make. And a lot has changed over [ORGANIZATION] since those words. You've recognized the housing crisis.
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Hello, my name is [ORGANIZATION] and I live at [ADDRESS] and  [ORGANIZATION], I spoke with a friend who was very excited about the city declaring a housing crisis, and they asked what the task force could possibly need this money for. Code reform and land acquisition are just two guesses of mine, as someone relatively inexperienced in the area."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"Would you suggest it go to ordinance review? This is really a fairly minor change. Now every time you put a different burden upon a developer, then your affordable housing gets less affordable."
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"This is a small thing, but every time you add new ones, delay the process, then you're making it harder and harder for affordable housing. But this is a minor one here, so I don't think it's very complicated. I think everybody can understand it, so it really is not one I think needs to go into this review."
05_21_2024,housing crisis,"Mayor, a couple of announcements. We're really pleased to announce the schedule that was published [ORGANIZATION] from long-range planning from [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]'s group about the FAC0 rezoning public meetings that are going to start.  to begin [PERSON] and there are seven meetings scheduled so we'll have a pretty intense schedule to be able to work very diligently on that housing crisis around FAC1 and then also uh city pool opens on [ORGANIZATION] that's right that's right"
03_20_2018,homelessness,"We're not questioning anyone's motives here. We acknowledge the compassion, generosity and leadership of our city and believe it's second to none in this state or region when it comes to taking care of those who are experiencing homelessness or poverty. We also trust police officers and department leadership."
03_20_2018,panhandler,"There's been discussion not [TIME], but during the agenda meeting [ORGANIZATION] about working towards some solutions with signage like we do with many other things like parking, like crosswalks, like. um other roadway oriented um ordinances to let people know what the law is and what is expected in each location um that signage will actually help people get help if they need to it could feature the uh kind of ways two one one number so if someone legitimately does have a need and they're in public or near those popular intersections um they can get help um also um give people some information in lieu of giving to a panhandler or giving to someone can go to a website or text a number to donate. I know that Mr. [PERSON] has looked into that."
03_20_2018,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] ORG1 is hosting this event as a [STREET] of highlighting the variety of programs funded by ORG2. We're celebrating [ORGANIZATION] with this event [PERSON] um light refreshments will be provided the event is free it will highlight for our citizens so they can learn about [ORGANIZATION] funded community programs so the council and [ORGANIZATION]'s comments about how do people find out about our housing rehabilitation and repair program this event [PERSON] we'll talk about that as well as transportation assistance the hearth program which is for our homeless and many other programs that are funded by CDBG funding. The city has been providing much-needed services through this funding to low- and moderate-income residents for DATE2, and so this is a good [STREET] to come learn more about that."
05_18_2021,affordable housing,Let's do it. Let's get affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. But we have to be smart about it.
05_18_2021,housing crisis,"Speaking of the citizens, I've had several people reach out to me and one of the comments they believe that this is about slowing down construction projects and politicizing technical decisions the planning commission is charged to do. It's an insult to past and current members of [ORGANIZATION]. We have a housing crisis."
06_07_2016,homeless,"Number six, a resolution authorized the purchase of [ORGANIZATION] ORG0 [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] in the amount of $55,000 presented to [ORGANIZATION] Purchasing Agreement produced by ORG2. Number seven, a resolution to approve the purchase of a DATE1 [PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] of Federal [PERSON] in the amount of $17,771 for use by [ORGANIZATION] and to approve a budget adjustment. Number eight, a resolution to approve a Special Needs Assistance Program grant agreement with ORG6 in the amount of $188,525  for the city to administer programs to provide rental assistance to supportive services and supportive services to the homeless federal residents."
06_05_2018,affordable housing,"You know, it's, so to me, I'm looking at the number of occupants that we're adding to neighborhoods. And so while I might be willing to make some allowances for children [ORGANIZATION], as a dependent child in one of the units, I might be able to be convinced on that, but ultimately I don't wanna see us adding more cars and more noise when this is really about adding affordable housing. And if you've got two ADUs and you've got a maximum of 1200 square feet, those are 600 foot units,  I think it's absolutely reasonable to limit that occupancy to one because by adding all these extra adults with their vehicles to neighborhoods, that's where we're going to start seeing a lot more opposition."
06_05_2018,affordable housing,"I REALLY THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROPOSAL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT [ORGANIZATION], WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE IN PLACES THAT MAY HAVE TROUBLE FINDING HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE. AND SO LOOKING AT OPTIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT WITH A [ORGANIZATION] MEMBER  probably some of you, there was a whole roomful, talking about how do we find affordable housing."
06_05_2018,affordable housing,"And so I think that...  THIS REALLY GIVES A SOFT [STREET] TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INCOME FOR THE HOMEOWNER. IT PROVIDES JUST A SOFT [STREET] AS OPPOSED TO NECESSARILY REZONING SOMETHING, BUILDING A LARGER APARTMENT COMPLEX OF STUDENT HOUSING."
06_05_2018,homelessness,"And I'll be meeting with the climate change mayors while I'm in that, and the...  immigration meeting. I'll be setting in on that and then of course we'll be looking at issues of homelessness among veterans over there. So that'll be some of the topics I'll be a part of and looking into."
02_18_2020,affordable housing,"I'll touch on this quickly. No doubt you all have seen the [ORGANIZATION] report that has come out and the call to action there as far as the need for affordable housing. And we also think it hits on a lot of the goals, especially looking up here as in terms of goal number six on the [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] plan of creating affordable housing."
02_18_2020,affordable housing,"well we can help them with first and [ORGANIZATION] rent, but if there's not affordable housing, you really haven't helped them in a complete [STREET]. So that's really what we've seen as far as what the need is, a bit of who the people are, etc. If you then turn to really who the community partners in this are, we really look at this as we're not just building housing, but we're building a community."
02_18_2020,homelessness,"I've talked also at this microphone about homelessness and all of the work that we've done, and one of the backbone ways that we've been able to do the work that we've done with homelessness is because of the work that they do at [ORGANIZATION]. They not only funded the strategic planning process that we've been a part of for [ORGANIZATION], they've also provided the software that we need to maintain our by name list. They've been very responsive by working with [ORGANIZATION] to put together ORG2."
02_18_2020,homelessness,"Thank you. Who else would like to address us? Hello [PERSON], I live at FAC0 in FAC1 and  and I am here, I'm a social worker working in the homelessness sector."
02_18_2020,homelessness; affordable housing,"I actually found about this project in the newspaper and my heart leapt with joy when I read the words 90 units of affordable housing. I spend the majority of my day looking for affordable housing for folks. Not just the folks experiencing homelessness, trying to get housed out of the shelter I work in, but also those who are looking for homelessness prevention, who are just barely hanging on to their rental units here in town."
02_18_2020,affordable housing,"And when we have more affordable housing, that opens up more public vouchers, public housing for those who are only making $7.70 a month in disability, and that might be the only option for them. So I wanted to come and speak for those who would benefit from it, those who would benefit from public housing, and unfortunately those we've lost in our community who died while they were waiting for a public housing spot to open. Our community is collaborating on housing better than any time before."
02_18_2020,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] mentioned by [ORGANIZATION]. I'm part of a group of probably a dozen agencies and [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] I'll be with those individuals and we'll be discussing all the individuals on that list who need affordable housing and trying to come up with a plan with that. And I just can't even begin to describe how important it is that the start of 90 additional affordable housing units would be.
06_06_2017,affordable housing,"I too would tend to agree with that. I think we put together a plan that everybody worked on together, and it's difficult. And I understand the new rezonings and the need for affordable housing, but I would tend to agree with those comments."
04_20_2021,affordable housing,"I'm [PERSON], [ADDRESS], [ORGANIZATION]. I just wanted to comment that it's very difficult to find affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. And often when an affordable property comes on the market, there are multiple, multiple offers."
04_20_2021,affordable housing,"And I just wanted to say that this project on [ORGANIZATION] would be a step in providing affordable housing for the city. And I think that's all my comments. As a realtor, I see the need for affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]."
04_20_2021,affordable housing,"If you have drainage issues and foundation issues, welcome to [ORGANIZATION]. We all do. uh [ORGANIZATION] and i uh support this you know the affordable housing issue um that area is getting developed we have a lot of good commercial going in down there the bus line is down there we need affordable housing we need to build um you know [ORGANIZATION]"
07_02_2024,homeless,"Number two, resolution to approve the renewal of continuing of care program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION]. and the total amount of $334,694 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. Number three, a resolution to approve an amendment to the professional services agreement with [ORGANIZATION] incorporated any amount of $34,988.75  for a multiple property documentation form and [ORGANIZATION] submission for the [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] neighborhoods."
07_02_2024,affordable housing,"Right now, everybody who applies with [ORGANIZATION] receives some sort of incentive. I think some of the examples I gave at Agenda Session include luxury housing, it includes gas stations, some of the land uses that I think have caused some angst to our community in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]. They are all receiving subsidies just as affordable housing is receiving subsidies, just as market rate housing, some land uses that we have said as a community we want to prioritize."
07_02_2024,homeless; affordable housing,"This will not be the last time you see it. You'll be seeing the nuts and bolts of it when it comes forward again, what it looks like incorporating exemptions or waivers, kind of like we have in code [ORGANIZATION] for certain projects, homeless shelters, capital A affordable housing projects, things like that that we think are important to continue keeping incorporated in there, which are ultimately policy decisions for you all to make. great thank you so much certainly"
07_02_2024,housing crisis,"yes okay thank you all number nine a resolution to require require the appointment of a renter and an individual who works with renters rights to the housing crisis task force [ORGANIZATION]  Excuse me, Mayor [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]. This is just, this was, I was bringing this board based on, I've heard from different citizens and from, thank you PERSON2, thank you so much. And this is just to correct an oversight."
07_02_2024,homeless,Because are they not getting a disproportionate amount of representation? Because like the mayor says if we say we're gonna add renters What's the parameters of the renters we're gonna add? You know are we gonna add when we're gonna add a homeless because they're struggling with [ORGANIZATION] too.
07_02_2024,housing crisis,"So to answer your question, we were looking at more of [ORGANIZATION], the folks from [ORGANIZATION], the folks who work with [ORGANIZATION], those who work directly with individuals who are impacted by the housing crisis. Thank you. I'm sorry who was next?"
07_02_2024,homeless,"Because I currently own when 60% of my life was spent as a renter. Regrettably, [ORGANIZATION] of my life was spent homeless. Does that disqualify me?"
07_02_2024,affordable housing,"And if we look at the actual resolution that we all passed,  It talks about the lack of affordable housing and options disproportionately affect low income. It mentions veterans, it mentions seniors, it mentions families and marginalized communities. And I look at each one of those or a combination of those could end up being a separate subgroup for this task force, and I think after listening to the mayor and thinking about, you know,  who do we pick for the renter?"
07_02_2024,housing crisis,"Now, I'm a renter, and I know a lot of other people who have told me when I went out to talk to individuals who were impacted by the housing crisis,  The people that are on the task force, a lot of them weren't there. But the individuals who came to all those meetings, they were renters. But that's neither here or there."
07_02_2024,housing crisis,"They're actually living through the housing crisis and they know what's what's going on with landlord tenant regulations and evictions and all that that someone who's on the task force who's not a renter might not know. And renters will be directly affected by any housing policies that the task force comes up with that they bring to you for consideration. And I haven't heard anyone say anything about any members who are already on that board, on the task force.  that they object to adding renters."
07_02_2024,housing crisis,They're not taking away any votes here. So that's what the amendment would do. Still would require a renter and an individual who works with renters' rights to serve on the housing crisis task force.
03_01_2016,affordable housing,"So it's harder and harder to buy or to find affordable housing. And our transportation costs are exceeding the cost of housing. And I just want us to be sensitive to taking care of our workforce and making sure that we're not part of the problem so that the people who work for us, that they can meet their basic needs and they're not, you know, we have,  Our health insurance has a $1,000 deductible, and for a person who's making $10 an hour, that just prices them out."
03_15_2022,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], one homelessness services...  term ending [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], one unexpired citizen at large, term ending [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], one unexpired term ending DATE2."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"And finally, a lot of people have talked about the possibility of [ORGANIZATION] zoning leading to the possibility of affordable housing. We know that is an issue in [PERSON]. It absolutely is."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"But the zoning alone is not going to create affordable housing, especially because we don't know what's going to be built there. whoever buys this is going to determine what is going to be built there. So I don't think that this is in keeping with the neighborhood that it is."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"And while we've been given some ideas of what might be nice there, there's no controls in [STREET] to make sure that that is what actually happens in this property. So in my opinion, This isn't going to lead to affordable housing. It's going to put a strain on our existing water and sewage systems."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"Correct. So I'm curious, if you have data, I'd love to see it because I'm on panels to discuss affordable housing and we're trying to come up with real solutions. So if you have data showing that are... I have a lot of data that I would certainly love to share with you."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"I would echo the comments that have been made that this rezoning in no [STREET] furthers the city goals of affordability. There was discussion, there was colloquy a moment ago about trying to find affordable housing. If you look around the city at houses that have been built in [ORGANIZATION] developments, these are not affordable houses."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"People can look into the FAC0 development in [ORGANIZATION] when we're looking at beautiful, dense housing. But while it's important that each neighborhood has their own identity and has their own ability to control what's happening, as a community, everyone in [PERSON] has to tackle the affordable housing problem. And it's not just... students or old people who all need housing."
04_17_2018,affordable housing,"That has to be built. So, I've done a little research. I feel like there are some ways that we can achieve affordable housing."
02_06_2018,homeless,"Number seven, a resolution to approve a budget adjustment in the amount of $400 representing donation revenue to [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] event. Number eight, a resolution to approve the agreement for assignment of ground lease for [INSTITUTION] facilities  Property located at [ADDRESS] from ORG1 to ORG2. Number nine, a resolution to approve contract with [ORGANIZATION] to provide funding assistance in the amount of $57,000 for maintenance and repairs at FAC0 in [LOCATION]."
05_19_2020,affordable housing,"The, but besides that, if you look at the neighborhood now and you look at the possibility of ruining the fabric of the neighborhood as a single family neighborhood that does have affordable housing. And again, I mentioned the argument for higher density has always been that it's going to develop more affordable housing. It hasn't happened."
05_19_2020,affordable housing,"And I know that it's somewhere along the linear progression where we reach a tipping point of something that will allow more affordable housing. But what we have in this neighborhood currently is affordable housing. So I don't see why we need to destroy affordable housing to think that somewhere in the future, based on some idea that certainly hasn't revealed itself in the higher density in the south side of town, that we are really getting a bargain and allowing people to have affordability or affordable homes."
05_19_2020,homelessness,But do we not already have a homelessness crisis in this city? Do we not already have thousands of people in the city without shelter? Do we not already have children at our own schools without a [STREET] to sleep?
05_19_2020,affordable housing,"And so I know that from what I've heard and from what I read, that affordable housing is important to the city of [ORGANIZATION]. And the last thing is how will it generate prosperity for the many instead of the few? Again, I think if this issue does not get resolved of some of the issues that [ORGANIZATION] said, then I think it's going to create a lot of mess and a lot of chaos."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,"Okay. number three a resolution to approve and authorize mayor [PERSON] to sign an [ORGANIZATION] funded sub-recipient agreement with ORG1 for supportive and affordable housing any amount of one one million two hundred ninety five thousand dollars and to approve the budget adjustment sir thank you mayor welcome  So the ORG2 monies were given to our cities and across the country to help  solve for disproportionate impacts within our communities. I've had the distinct privilege to talk over [ORGANIZATION] within the community to have cookouts, to be on people's porches and out in the parks, and to get a gauge on what individuals are really asking for us to invest this money into."
03_07_2023,affordable housing; unhoused,"But to kind of break down those numbers, I mean, this is a [ORGANIZATION] commitment to affordable housing based on [ORGANIZATION] standards of our most vulnerable and lowest income. When you look at studies, and you can [ORGANIZATION] anywhere and look at our highest utilizers of services to understand that vulnerable populations that are unhoused  end up in jail populations more often and detention centers. Here locally, [LOCATION], that costs us $30,000 a year."
03_07_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"They use more emergency services, about 50,000 a year versus about 10,[ADDRESS]. And so really, this ends up both being a response to a humanitarian of us saying that we know we're in a housing crisis and we need to do affordable housing, but it's also a more fiscally responsible approach as well. When you span that money across [ORGANIZATION], that's about a $32,000 a year investment."
03_07_2023,unhoused,"I donate all of my donations to go to the housing to support those who are unhoused. As [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, I've had numerous opportunities to see it firsthand, see it firsthand but not living it firsthand. I remember maybe [ORGANIZATION] I was driving down the [STREET] on FAC0 and I saw  a lady jumped out of the dumpster."
03_07_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"Because as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, this is a housing, this is a crisis. When I think about the [ORGANIZATION] funding,  the affordable housing and homelessness resonated. When I talked to people and when people talk to me, they were asking, why is this not a priority?"
03_07_2023,homelessness,"When I think about [ORGANIZATION] and when I walk through [ORGANIZATION], when I [STREET] through [ORGANIZATION], I see the challenges. And I know that there are challenges throughout [ORGANIZATION], but as a [ORGANIZATION] representative, I have a commitment. And I want to make sure that we do everything that we can to offer homelessness, to offer those individuals who need housing the opportunity."
03_07_2023,unhoused,"So when I thought about this, I thought about supportive housing. Actually, it saves money spent on housing. unhoused people, and when it comes to the emergency room, I work in hospital and jails and shelters."
03_07_2023,homeless,"It's chronically homeless people who are in the streets. We see that, and on the trails and in the parks. And if not [TIME], how will we address this situation?"
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"And we know that this will not solve this entire problem because it's very complex, but this is a great first step  in the right direction. And I would like to say that when we talk about homelessness, we have to acknowledge that members of our homeless community have disabilities and no one chooses to have a disability. Okay."
03_07_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,Thank you for giving your time and attention to the affordable housing and homelessness crisis we have in our community. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I help lead the [ORGANIZATION] community.
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"We're a low barrier, resident run, housing focused community where people begin to recover from chronic homelessness. I remember [ORGANIZATION] is when I started working in the homeless care system here. I feel old."
03_07_2023,homeless,"Our proposal is really straightforward. We asked for the city to invest $1.3 million in expanding supportive housing in [ORGANIZATION]. With these funds, we proposed a purchase  small quality housing units on the market, rent them to people who have disabilities and have long-term homeless backgrounds at affordable rates."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"Then we'll pair that housing with support services so that the person recovering from chronic homelessness can ultimately heal, thrive, and contribute. We plan to serve six to eight people [ORGANIZATION] and over the lifetime of the project, serve 30 or more people. I want to ground the project in the community's need for exactly this kind of intervention."
03_07_2023,homelessness; housing crisis; affordable housing,"We often have a misconception that homelessness is one group of people that share the same circumstance, but that's not really true. I want to give you my [TIME] primer on homelessness. There are three people impacted by the affordable housing crisis and homelessness crisis."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"They're living in their car. They're staying in an emergency shelter. For both this first and second person, there's a book called [ORGANIZATION] is a Housing Problem."
03_07_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"And what the book finds is that for person one and two, the best thing you can do is to increase housing production. It's mostly a housing, it's an economics issue. So reviews of zoning and of development and looking at social housing and community land trust, all these prescriptions are those city level answers for people hit by the affordable housing and homelessness crisis."
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"But there's a third person. The third person is chronically homeless, long-term reoccurring homelessness. Research shows that this person is disproportionately likely to sleep in unsheltered locations.  much more likely to have lifetime trauma, to have mental illness, to have substance abuse, to have justice system involvement, or to have physical disabilities."
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"So chronic homelessness causes a lot of pain and suffering and death. In fact, we lost a gentleman [ORGANIZATION] who has been chronically homeless. And I could spend [TIME] listing the names of people who have passed away  chronically homeless."
03_07_2023,homeless,"So this is the environment in which [ORGANIZATION] launches, [ORGANIZATION]. We stepped up to say, we wanna open a community where we can welcome chronically homeless people off the [STREET]. And let me tell you, there is a lot to be proud of."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,Where is the affordable housing for this person to move into? Our project we've applied for is the answer to that question. [ORGANIZATION].
03_07_2023,homelessness,"In that [STREET], homelessness is a policy choice more than a personal choice. And lastly, I have learned a great deal  from my friends and acquaintances without housing over [ORGANIZATION]. And that's why I've committed to working alongside them, not to take care of them, to work with them, not for them."
03_07_2023,homeless,"A lot of chronically homeless people really are on their last leg. And then we do have a couple of people who ended up going to jail. You mentioned, I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you mentioned somewhere in your presentation that you would envision working with the city's [ORGANIZATION] program to help with supportive services and stuff."
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"When we get to,  own the housing rather than rent from the private market, we can address both the deep affordability and the renter qualification issue. So many folks with chronic homeless backgrounds do end up going through the justice system, whether it's really minor stuff like littering or public urination or trespassing, these are really common. It also sometimes is a drug possession,  over [DATE] of their homelessness."
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"Can you tell us what being homeless, what it looked like before [ORGANIZATION] and the impact that it's made? And also, too, if you can educate us on the barriers, because we talk a lot about  hitting a brick wall. And I think that if you're not familiar with homelessness or if you're not marginalized, period, you may not be aware of those barriers."
03_07_2023,homeless,"Another may be criminal background or credit background. Sometimes you've been homeless [ORGANIZATION], you don't have a landlord that can vouch for you. That's a very common denial."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"As far as what homelessness looked like before [ORGANIZATION], I mean, well, I know for 20 people, it looks 100% different. And there are a couple of those people here [TIME], and I think one on [ORGANIZATION]. So we may hear more personally."
03_07_2023,homeless,There's a homeless encampment there that is so big. And I used to walk there all the time and I had stopped walking. And so I started going again in [ORGANIZATION].
03_07_2023,homeless,"Hi, I'm PERSON0. I live at [ADDRESS] in FAC0 in public housing. I landed there because I was homeless, because I got a divorce, and because my mom died, who I was buying a home with."
03_07_2023,homeless,I wasn't homeless long. I was one of the couch surfers. I can tell you it's still scary.
03_07_2023,affordable housing,"And when you're waiting on that list and wondering if you're going to get a home, if you can afford a home, it's pretty scary. There's not any affordable housing out there. I'm also disabled."
03_07_2023,homeless,"I serve the community in a lot of ways. I volunteer out there. I deal with a lot of homeless and people that are chronically hungry, chronically ill, and chronically in need of housing."
03_07_2023,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] AND COUNCIL MEMBERS. OUR [ORGANIZATION] CITY PLAN RECOMMITTED [PERSON] TO ACCOMPLISHING ITS ATTAINABLE HOUSING GOAL. OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ATTAINABLE HOUSING  will require us to address several areas of housing focus, including homeless housing, low-income housing, workforce housing, addressing housing barriers, and equity."
03_07_2023,homeless,"They are proposing a program that can present timely and targeted opportunities for the city to demonstrate its commitment by taking action on addressing one of those important areas of attainable housing,  that is homeless housing. Please give serious consideration to partnering with [ORGANIZATION]. So thank you."
03_07_2023,homeless,I'm homeless. I have been since [ORGANIZATION]. I've been a resident of [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION].
03_07_2023,homeless,"I managed to raise a family and  get them well taken care of before I became homeless. I believe I became homeless as a result of losing my job as a commercial construction superintendent and a divorce. And because I'm a veteran, I was able to get a [ORGANIZATION]-VASH voucher at one time, but I wasn't working when I got the voucher."
03_07_2023,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], my daughter and I have volunteered with [ORGANIZATION], which is an initiative of ORG1, and prior to that, ORG2. We've done countless loads of laundry free of charge to anyone with need. The overwhelming majority of our clients at [ORGANIZATION] are homeless."
03_07_2023,homeless,"Yeah. It's right here in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], a city of compassion. I've witnessed firsthand what kind of transformation occurs when someone who is chronically homeless is given the opportunity for stability and a fresh start that FAC0 provides."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"How are you gonna, we have a lot of people that walk, that rotate through these doors.  are you going to stay? Because that's what working with people who have experienced homelessness, the first thing that you do is you have to establish a relationship. They have to know that they trust me."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"So, allowing to have the opportunity to create those relationships and to find that sustainability within the educational system and the healthcare system in northwest [ORGANIZATION] is a huge piece to this puzzle. And I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, and I would love for, to say that on DATE0 DATE1, we started building our legacy of respite homes.  of sustainable housing and supportive housing for people who are experiencing homelessness so that they don't have to have that trauma anymore. So thank you for listening and for your service."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,I am not with [ORGANIZATION]. I'm here because affordable housing is a big issue on my heart. I have a friend on disability who is spending about three quarters of her disability check on rent for a two-bedroom apartment for her and her child.
03_07_2023,housing crisis,We give a lot of lip service to having a housing crisis. Sometimes we wonder what we can do about it. It is a huge problem and it feels too big to solve.
03_07_2023,homelessness,"We've heard about enough individual problems [TIME] to make your head spin and make you wonder how we could ever fix all of that. Our housing affordability problems and our homelessness problems predated the pandemic, but since [ORGANIZATION] them get dramatically worse. I wish that when we got [ORGANIZATION] money and ORG1 money that we had paid the essential bills here at the city and then really put all of that into a massive coordinated effort to jumpstart housing in the city."
03_07_2023,homelessness,"i've seen firsthand how [ORGANIZATION] has changed especially in [ORGANIZATION] and how more and more of my neighbors are succumbing to living on the streets [TIME] i'm asking you to vote for the new beginnings proposal that will allocate the 1.3 million to purchase duplicates duplexes that will be dedicated to providing homes for our neighbors that are  recovering from chronic homelessness. [DATE] at FAC0, my residents show up and do the work that we as a society say that they should do to be able to deserve our help. So how am I supposed to tell them that?"
03_07_2023,affordable housing,"And what does that say about how we feel about people living in poverty? I see a new housing complex being built [ORGANIZATION], but still low-income housing is scarce, resulting in more and more of our neighbors having to succumb to living on the streets, or sleeping on a friend's couch, or sleeping in their car. By supporting the [ORGANIZATION] proposal, we can not only help our residents find permanent and affordable housing, but we can also start to change the narrative about what it means to restore humanity and people."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,"I invite all of you to look at our residents that are here [TIME] and tell them why you think that they aren't worthy of safe and affordable housing. Why even though they've done all of the quote-unquote right things,  And most of them, or some of them, do have vouchers to pay their rent. They're still unable to find homes that are within their allowance."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,We now have four people at [ORGANIZATION] with vouchers that have no affordable apartments to move into. We need more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. We are changing the entire landscape of our community.  by not prioritizing affordable rent.
03_07_2023,homelessness,"I've lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] now, and I have worked in the housing services sector for [ORGANIZATION]. I started as an intern, and I never looked back, not because it's easy or extravagant, but because I had the opportunity to unlearn everything I thought I knew about homelessness.  and learn from the people experiencing it, who are some of the most compassionate people I have ever met. I watched them share the last of something, and I guarantee you that with all my privilege, if I needed something, they would give it to me."
03_07_2023,affordable housing,So I was really thrilled to hear about this proposal and that supportive services that would go along with that. Our population of people who need affordable housing is growing while the housing stock shrinks. I know off the top of my head at least four places that used to be relied on or considered affordable housing that no longer exist for varying reasons.
03_07_2023,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you. Yeah, I'm [PERSON] at 105 North Willow, and I just wanted to publicly thank [PERSON] for coming up with a plan to deal with the homelessness situation. That I hope that you all will support it and that this will be the beginning of what  a new direction for the city instead of the plan to make life more difficult for the homeless."
03_07_2023,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a prime example of what it is to help the homeless. I was out on the streets for [ORGANIZATION] living in the mountains, [ORGANIZATION]."
03_07_2023,homeless,They care about us. We are people. We're not just homeless.
03_07_2023,affordable housing,The lack of access to affordable housing has been an issue forever. It's always been an issue. It's been such an issue that the [ORGANIZATION] had to write it out as a human right to make it one of their goals to achieve.
03_07_2023,homelessness,"With a combination of support services and consistent housing, these community members would have a chance to access the opportunity a home provides. I'm also a member of the small group of LGBTQ youth in [ORGANIZATION] who, with just the reality of our state,  are always on the edge of homelessness. So due to either lack of family support or the resulting mental illness that the, you know, ostracizing experiences that we've had in school and in our communities and in church  have led us to kind of always be feeling like we're living on the edge."
03_07_2023,unhoused,So that's why I changed. My research emphasis was on how healthcare people treat those unhoused. It's horrible.
03_07_2023,affordable housing,"We were a nonprofit affordable housing developer  Earlier, a couple of council members had asked about sustainability for housing services programming. And I want to reinforce that there's no operational income from housing services. It's public funds, private philanthropy, great leaders like [ORGANIZATION]."
03_07_2023,homeless,"And if you approve this, then I'm going to have to work on a contract to try to protect the interests of our citizens, as well as the interests of the homeless people that are going to be helped in this. And it will, you know, we can't as a city regulate rental. I heard someone say we should be like [ORGANIZATION] and regulate rents."
05_16_2023,housing crisis,"Oh, my name is [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], 200 West Center, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. I am in no [STREET] affiliated with this project. I've never even met the developer from GPE2 nor any of his team members I'm just here because I'm very aware of this big problem We're having in our community of a housing crisis If you know anyone who's tried to find rental or for sale housing recently, then you understand how bad it is"
05_16_2023,housing crisis,"We're having a major housing crisis. I think it's worse here than any other city in northwest [ORGANIZATION], and why would we not let this project move forward? It's on the trail."
03_26_2024,housing crisis,"certain areas of expertise. Section four came from Jones Amendment number two. This was adding kind of a charge to [ORGANIZATION], what ORG1 wanted them to accomplish during and at the end of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_26_2024,housing crisis,"And I think that was, oh, I also didn't include the specific list of task force members, because I think from the original resolution, you were saying you wanted it set up by [ORGANIZATION]. And so I have left how the task force is being created open for discussion. And also the title, we left it at a resolution to declare a housing crisis in the city of [ORGANIZATION], summarize actions taken and anticipated to support housing production in the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
03_26_2024,housing crisis,"Yeah, I sure can. The title just reads, A Resolution to Declare a Housing Crisis in [ORGANIZATION] and to [ORGANIZATION] and Anticipated to Support Housing Production in [ORGANIZATION]. That's fine."
03_26_2024,housing crisis,"but I think it's always better to read and hear about what our focus and our goal is, is to really recognize that we're in a housing crisis. You have to identify the problem and then you have to start to say what solutions are we going to put forward? And then ultimately the resolution is trying to put some solutions forward."
03_26_2024,housing crisis,"DATE0, they just went, you know, everybody, they just went to flood the market with microwaves. Well, the next thing you know, the same microwave that I paid $300 for, you can buy for $50 DATE1. You know, it puts more, you know, we have a housing crisis, housing shortage, whatever you want to call it."
06_02_2015,affordable housing,the housing market in this city is insane we're one of the fastest growing cities in the [ORGANIZATION] less the mid-south progress is always painful change is painful losing trees losing what had been a beautiful wooded backyard is painful what's also painful is families trying to find affordable housing in good school districts in a pleasant atmosphere And I took a look on [ORGANIZATION].
08_21_2018,homeless,"number one approval of the DATE0 DATE1 special city council meeting [TIME] special it was number two a resolution to approve a budget adjustment in the total amount of sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six dollars  Representing donations to [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], income received from a housing [PERSON] payoff and to approve a budget adjustment in the amount of $7,553 to allocate use fund balance prior funds. Number three, a resolution to approve renewal of two ORG2 grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION]. and the total amount of $73,278 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents."
09_18_2018,housing crisis,It is obviously we're facing a housing crisis. Where do we put it? Out on the edge of town?
09_18_2018,beggar,"Thank you. All right, let's take some public comment. Mr. [PERSON], before we start the class, do we get two turns to speak or do we have time?"
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"Okay, thank you all. Number four, an ordinance to authorize [ORGANIZATION] to grant a variance in the single-family infill standards to support attainable, affordable housing. Kit."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"We're at [ORGANIZATION] placed within city plan [DATE] a new general guiding principle goal six we will create opportunities for attainable housing and to emphasize how important attainable and affordable housing is to our citizens and city. And whereas a provision concerning garage placement within the newly adopted single-family infill standards can in some circumstances significantly and unnecessarily raise the cost of home construction and impair the affordability and attainability of housing, And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] should be able to consider and grant a reasonable variance to such provision which would preserve the legitimate aesthetic concerns but allow home builders to offer attainable houses to our citizens. Now therefore it be ordained by the [ORGANIZATION] of the City of Fayetteville-Arkshaw, Section 1."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], educate me. Because we state in our goals that we want to build affordable housing, Does that adversely affect someone's ability to build half million dollar houses or million dollar houses or like real big nice houses? Well, absolutely not."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"And I think it's good for our government to encourage that sort of affordable, attainable housing to be available for citizens for starter houses or maybe even for a final house. Well, I agree that there should be a variety of housing to accommodate all economic levels of those people seeking housing in our city. We want affordable housing at the lower end."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"i believe it is And I just really want to thank you first, Mr. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION], for listening to our saga here. We know that [ORGANIZATION] is a very good town to build affordable housing."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"I'm making the motion to consider it as published, but I do want to be sure that we are discussing what we're what is in this motion specifically as we move forward because it's getting real clouded with the suburban development or infill or urban development or because that's not what we're looking at what we're looking at with this is a very nice addition to authorize [ORGANIZATION] to grant a variance for single family infill but it has nothing to do with a lot of what this broader discussion that we're bringing forward And we need to be sure that there's no implication in the long run or any maybe false promises or false understanding with a clouded discussion when we're talking specifically about an ordinance to authorize [ORGANIZATION] to grant a variance, which is a nice thing, and a single-family infield standards to support attainable and affordable housing. So that's my point, and I'm moving – that we do consider this motion and move forward."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"And they do degrade the quality and value of neighborhoods. There are a lot of studies that show this. You know, if we want to get serious about affordable housing, there are many alternatives, such as parking on the [STREET] or using a carport, you know, or maybe reducing our residential parking requirements."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"We are going to final plat hopefully [ORGANIZATION]. The streets are finishing paving DATE1 and DATE2. And I guess the biggest thing that I would challenge everybody to is, This is discretionary for the purpose of affordable housing only."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,We're looking at some affordable housing complexes out here right now that are going to be subsidized. That's great. These aren't subsidized.
08_02_2016,affordable housing,We're not striking the ordinance. We're just taking that one thing that is specifically aimed at affordable housing out and giving it time to vet and see if this is what everybody wants to do across the board instead of singling out one group. It's wrong.
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"So here we have [ORGANIZATION], a private developer investing and taking a bet in [ORGANIZATION], creating designs that he hopes that will sell, and hoping that he could help a few hundred families in [ORGANIZATION] to own affordable housing. So we want to thank him for that kind of commitment. The city too, you're having a great partner and really understand, very progressive to understand that attainable and affordable housing is actually a workforce problem."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"Because without affordable housing for our workforce, they may have to go elsewhere. And so that impacts our employers as well. So that is important for us."
08_02_2016,affordable housing,Why just impose that standard on just affordable housing some of our poorest residents i think we already have a motion a second on the floor so parliamentary wise i don't think a motion to amend is appropriate it wouldn't be appropriate now but that's where i'd head with this to give him relief and give everybody relief i don't think it's reasonable that we tell people where they have to put their garage they should put it where they want uh within certain broad parameters
08_02_2016,affordable housing,"Yes. Yes. And ordinance to authorize the city council to grant a variance in the single-family infill standards to support attainable, affordable housing."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"Again, I want to point out some key points for you all. This is an immediate housing solution for a housing crisis that the city currently faces. Again, as [ORGANIZATION] said, that this is recommended for approval by staff and [ORGANIZATION], and that this has satisfied the rezone requirements, including those requirements  the compatibility with the city's future use goals, and then what the current surrounding property is being used for."
09_19_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Yes. Okay, thank you all. Now let's go to number three, a resolution to address with urgency the affordable housing crisis and to request that Mayor [PERSON] apply for a [ORGANIZATION] grant."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Additionally, there's the investments that can be made in our community around development activities, things like financing the construction of affordable housing, acquisition or disposition of land for development of affordable housing. That's one of those housing land trusts that we've heard talked about and mentioned across the region. Additionally, infrastructure, we can install new utilities for development or preservation of affordable housing."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"We've done some of that here locally, so we obviously have expertise in that. An increased community resilience by nature-based solutions to mitigate impacts of weather to preserve affordable housing. We can go back in our memory banks pretty quickly thinking about the ORG0 monies that we spent about the [ORGANIZATION] apartments that were flooding.  while we've worked to mitigate in that space."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"And unfortunately, our area wasn't identified. And that's a score area out of the possible points that we do have a little bit of a downturn. We're competitive because  We've already shown demonstration with our [ORGANIZATION] city plan that we have a commitment that we have identified That we're seeing affordable housing go to under-resourced areas contributing to sprawl and we've identified growth areas and  that we can actually [STREET] denser housing in resource rich areas."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"and I feel like the only hurdle that the biggest barrier  that I'm hearing is that's involving perhaps manpower as it relates to putting the grant together. So I'm definitely going to support it because I don't,  There's no, and someone said it perfectly, that it's not perfection, but it's progress. And I do believe that since we are experiencing a housing crisis, that we should do everything that we can to alleviate that."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"and i want to express our deep deep support for this  And also to point out that one of the things that this grant could do is to help alleviate the problem of understaffing for this. So, you know, it's like we're at a log jam and this could be a potential to find that [PERSON] in the logs to break this log jam and hopefully  get us at least closer to solving the massive housing crisis that we're in right now. Thank you."
09_19_2023,homeless,"She had these things before. Despite saving up for the move, the rising costs of housing and lack of available units has left her mostly homeless. Women like her deserve better, and you have the power to do that."
09_19_2023,homelessness,I could not afford my house that I live in now. And I know a lot of people who are going through a...  homelessness right now and we all know that homelessness leads to incarceration incarceration leads to homelessness and that's one reason we have so many people sitting in our jail right now that's a whole other issue
09_19_2023,homelessness,"And I want to start by saying I moved here in [ORGANIZATION], joined the [ORGANIZATION], which is  continuum of care in [LOCATION] and their goal then was to resolve homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] by DATE2. We're in [LOCATION] and we're not even close. But I sat and watched."
09_19_2023,homelessness,"I, as a community member, joined  the ranks of supporting the work around solving housing and homelessness. I also joined [ORGANIZATION] for a couple of terms because I wanted to be part of the work to really work towards this.  and watching what was going on with homelessness, housing, and the funding for [ORGANIZATION], I see this as an opportunity for this community. So as I stand before you I express my strong support for the city's application for a [ORGANIZATION] grant to fund housing and supportive changes."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,As you know our city is facing a serious housing crisis. Many of our residents are struggling to afford a safe and decent [STREET] to live. This is especially true for low-income residents and people with disabilities.
09_19_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] grants can provide much needed funding to support a variety of housing initiatives such as building or renovating affordable housing units, providing rental assistance to low-income families, supporting services for people with disabilities and other special needs, addressing homelessness,  I believe that a [ORGANIZATION] grant would be a valuable investment to our city's future. By supporting this housing change, we can help to ensure that all of our residents have a safe and affordable home to live in. I urge you to vote in favor of applying for the [ORGANIZATION] grant."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"All of this to say, we desperately need immediate relief for the housing crisis and this grant would be a great start in working toward a solution. Please vote yes on this resolution. Thank you."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Who else would like to address this? Hello, my name is [ORGANIZATION], I came up earlier. I'm a student here at [ORGANIZATION], and everyone I've talked to about housing, about getting a house, somewhere to live, has a lot of concerns about affordable housing."
09_19_2023,homeless; affordable housing,"There are a lot of poor, disabled, at-risk residents who will be impacted negatively, who will be probably even made homeless if housing prices continue to rise. [ORGANIZATION] is a very fast-growing city obviously and Thanks to the planning decisions has made many steps already towards affordable housing so both of those things taken into account, I think that we have a good chance of Being competitive for this grant. I would definitely advise optimism with this I think it's  As the other speakers have said, it's definitely worth trying."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Hello. My name is [ORGANIZATION], currently living at [ADDRESS], and I've come here [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] in favor of this resolution. i'm here to speak in favor of councilmember PERSON1's resolution [TIME] for the same reason i was here [LOCATION] to speak in favor of further limiting short-term rentals in the city [ORGANIZATION] renters need help the public outpouring for support [TIME] is evidence of that federal approval for this grant would alleviate some of the stress from the renters struggling the most here in our community  Federal government has already made this money available using taxpayer money, and our city should at the very least apply for a portion to help fund the initiatives of affordable housing and rezoning that the city has already committed to."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"As [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] stated, the city has until [ORGANIZATION] to apply for this grant. With shrinking affordable housing options, the lack of zoning capacity for housing, and a functionally full housing market, this funding is urgently needed. Thank you."
09_19_2023,homeless,"A recent study was released that showed that about 254 students, high school level students, middle school students, children are homeless in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Whenever they get off the bus, they don't have a home to go to. Additionally, a study was actually released [ORGANIZATION] and the study is actually titled [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"And in spite of housing conditions, most of the residents that were slated for relocation stated that they liked their home and did not want to move. So next slide you'll see too what they call out as the conditions of housing prior to this passing is that there's a surplus of affordable housing units, they have too many affordable housing units. There's a balanced amount of medium modest income housing, there's a shortage of housing units at middle income and there's a very severe shortage of luxury housing."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"We can't subsidize our [STREET] out of that problem. Also, the number of, you know, the amount of money it would take to provide some affordable housing units, a fraction of that cost could replace the code and have this massive change citywide. If we can come to the next slide, please."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"That is a very big amount of money to say, we don't have time for that. Like, when is this coming across your desk again?  back to what i was intending to say prior to hearing everyone's statements reclaiming our tax dollars our federal tax dollars especially for one of the most important issues in our city is only common sense with the comments from the federal government it seems like our city would make a prime candidate according to a press release from [ORGANIZATION] quote funding can be used for planning and policy activities to allow for higher density zoning and rezoning for multi-family and mixed-use housing  Streamlining affordable housing development and reducing requirements related to parking and other land use restrictions, which have specifically been mentioned here [TIME]."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"They're literally giving us a chance. In [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] reaffirmed its commitment to the City Plan [PERSON], a comprehensive land use plan for the City of [ORGANIZATION], encouraging development patterns to prioritize the creation of affordable housing and walkable neighborhoods. The City is pursuing this grant, hopefully, fingers crossed on a yes [TIME], right, with the opportunity that will give us...  a clear path on how to keep us in line with the goals of the [PERSON] plan and move us another step forward and making it a reality, which like we need."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"This is [ORGANIZATION], Ward 1, [ADDRESS]. Thank you, [PERSON], for bringing this forward and thanks to PERSON2 for his vocal support. We are in a housing crisis."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"We are in a housing crisis. If you don't know this, you're not paying attention. I had recently lost two members of [ORGANIZATION] because we are in a housing crisis."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"One of those members is why you have a vacant seat in the horseshoe [TIME] because [ORGANIZATION] had to move.  out of the ward because she couldn't find affordable housing in the ward. The [ORGANIZATION] city plan is a great plan, but unfortunately with our existing zoning, it's an impossible plan. And I think this grant could help us at the very least identify changes that we need to make to our [ORGANIZATION], to our Unified Development Code, to find a [STREET] to realize the  Now, this is just a non-binding resolution, and there's nothing that says the city staff must do this even if you pass it."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"I support... For the high pro housing grant, I have lived in other rapidly growing cities where new and affordable housing product projects have not kept up with demand and the results are always the same. Teachers, nurses, physical therapists, artists, and other vital members of the community are pushed out and unable to afford to live there."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"This really starts to feel like bureaucratic doublespeak, and that's a major disappointment. Mayor, you have said numerous times that we have a housing crisis, and now it's up to you to lead us through it. You don't just have a staff."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"They're just going to say no. So, you know, I implore that you please do something to fix this housing crisis. Because if, you know, look at how many people have stood up [ORGANIZATION] who are young people and can't afford housing."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Back in [ORGANIZATION], in [DATE] of [ORGANIZATION], I used to be on [PERSON] before I was Justice of the [LOCATION]. And when the city was deciding where to put the parking deck,  I know [PERSON] was pushing to include some sort of affordable housing component in the arts quorum. And in [DATE] [ORGANIZATION], we gathered together in one meeting, representatives from [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"And at that meeting, I went around to each organization and I asked,  Will you please make a serious commitment on partnering to create affordable housing? And every organization said yes, the city, the university, everyone around that table. I looked up the [ORGANIZATION] article about it to jog my memory."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"While we're on that tour, I asked our county [STREET] crews  Is there some part of the county where you're doing more work than others? And they said, oh, yeah, out on the west side, just beyond the [ORGANIZATION] city limits out there, they can't get the roads paved fast enough because there's so much sprawl happening out there. Because the folks, developers can't build affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] because of [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"Everybody that spoke [TIME] spoke in favor of this resolution, and it's because we are experiencing a crisis. As you all probably know, [ORGANIZATION], I held a town hall meeting to discuss this very same topic, affordable housing. And I heard horror stories, stories very similar to the ones [TIME] and different."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"As representative of FAC0, I have to do everything that I can to promote affordable housing. Every opportunity. We talked earlier about, and I do, again, I appreciate you so much bringing this forth, and the fact that citizens of [ORGANIZATION] are willing to volunteer or to help in some capacity to make sure that this grant is reality."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"This is not the first time and it won't be the last time. And this hard thing is, if we're going to do something hard, it has to be in the best interest of [ORGANIZATION]. We know that we are experiencing a housing crisis."
09_19_2023,affordable housing,"It's not going to be affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION] land costs are a third of single-family homes [ORGANIZATION], not 20%. So we're talking about the need to build multifamily housing."
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"so I guess I fall on the side of Absolutely believe we have a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION] Absolutely 100% believe that Will this fix that problem? No, I don't think so  If I'm brought something that I realistically think can utilize staff time"
09_19_2023,housing crisis,"It's not available. I certainly would want to take a really hard look at whatever was drafted and review it and ensure that it does meet the goals and the needs of our population here. And I know, I do think we have a housing crisis, and I do believe that everybody that spoke [TIME] and on [PERSON] is well-intentioned, absolutely."
10_04_2016,affordable housing,"The city [TIME] will begin consideration of formalizing a commitment to providing funds to offset infrastructure costs for FAC0, an affordable single-family housing project conceptualized [ORGANIZATION] in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood. Other tools we have at our disposal include waiving impact fees for non-profit single- and multifamily affordable housing, providing zoning districts that allow for a variety and mixture of housing types and sizes dispersed throughout the city,  We are able to waive fees and provide grant funds for rehabilitation of existing historic homes or those who qualify for economic assistance. And we also ensure that when homes are built, they're the most energy efficient possible, reducing the [ORGANIZATION] utility bills and thereby reducing the overall cost of living for our residents."
10_04_2016,affordable housing,"During the interview process, the selection committee found a very high energy, committed, and professional local team that will lead [ORGANIZATION] entrepreneurial target sector. Specific tasks outlined in the contract, which is attached to your packet, include supporting collaborative, entrepreneurial, and innovative environment, increasing high-tech job growth through university and [ORGANIZATION] research and technology partnerships,  creating and maintaining innovative spaces and programs to support entrepreneurs providing an online directory of the startup community to support and encourage mentoring opportunities technology support networks entrepreneurial initiatives and events and education exploring affordable housing options for entrepreneurs inventory and expand educational opportunities support the growing artisan food and craft beverage industry and support supporting talent attraction retention and development  So to support the growth of small businesses here in [PERSON]."
10_04_2016,affordable housing,"but they're also supposed to be, quote, exploring affordable housing options for entrepreneurs, unquote. So what is this? Is it low income or high income that they're dealing with?"
10_04_2016,affordable housing,"I was on the original... Group of partners for better housing when we were looking at options for affordable housing because it was one of the goals Set forth by the city and a city plan we were fortunate to get property  that was not utilized in the south part of town, property that needed attention for infrastructure, property that was otherwise not being utilized. This program is going to allow us to expand economic opportunities for individuals that can live and work in our city and become productive in the long run."
10_04_2016,affordable housing,"i you know um  Our kids best advice is that it probably is You know if the city is going to get sued for something, you know, I think that Trying to find innovative ways to serve our citizens with affordable housing It's not such a bad thing to have to defend and and I'm willing to stand by that So with that I'm gonna make a motion to suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading more. I'll second that"
10_01_2024,housing crisis,"And so, you know, I think that our community has waited a long time. We've had [ORGANIZATION] between talking about the crunch of what the housing crisis looks like and what that housing stock looks like. And I don't think we should delay any further."
09_05_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"and i think she's ready to discuss it okay do i need to make a motion to suspend the rules or would you like to first actually mayor i think it's there in front of you why don't you read the title of the resolution if you're okay hang on  A resolution to address the urgency, with urgency, the affordable housing crisis to request that Mayor [PERSON] apply for a housing and urban development pro-housing grant of up to $4 million to fund housing, supportive changes to [ORGANIZATION]'s land use and zoning ordinances."
09_05_2023,housing crisis,OUR $70 MILLION PROJECT IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE CITY'S TAX SPACE. I ALSO HEARD A COMMENT EARLIER THAT REFERRED TO THE CITY'S HOUSING CRISIS. THIS PROJECT RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL QUALITY HOUSING IN THE CITY OF [ORGANIZATION] AND IT WILL MEET THAT NEED.
09_05_2023,housing crisis,"And I guess we had a retreat in [ORGANIZATION] where I felt like we all held hands to and said quality of life,  and we said we need to solve this housing crisis that we're in. You know, I tried to bring forward, I mean I'm very concerned about our budget for [ORGANIZATION] and looking for creative solutions and I think that grant could have been part of that solution because I think we're gonna have some hard discussions But every reason where we have this conversation, where we're not able to potentially put housing on the market for people that need it [LOCATION]."
09_05_2023,affordable housing,so this is cumulative and so any impervious pavement and lack of low impact development will have a significant effect on on that preserve and  and also downstream on [ORGANIZATION]. So we need to keep that in mind. The other thing I want to mention is that at no time did I hear affordable housing mentioned in the development proposal.
09_05_2023,affordable housing,"And while of course new housing is hard to make affordable just because of construction costs, that's affordable in the technical 30% of your income term. you only build ten houses out there like [ORGANIZATION] outlined those ten houses will have to be massive large luxury properties to command the price that would would make the cash flow for the infrastructure investments and  While we might not get affordable housing with a capital A, we can certainly get more affordable than that and we can provide housing to people who need it. This is about half, almost exactly a half mile from a designated tier two growth center as outlined in the [ORGANIZATION] plan that y'all have approved unanimously and reaffirmed unanimously."
12_06_2022,affordable housing,IT DOESN'T BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT BRINGS HOUSING THAT COULD BE AFFORDABLE IF EVERYONE WAS RICH THAT BOUGHT THE [ORGANIZATION].
12_06_2022,affordable housing,"The ones that are already there will be old construction. New things tend to be more expensive, especially with inflation. But we will not get more affordable housing by building fewer houses."
12_06_2022,affordable housing,"And you can definitely see it, you know, [ORGANIZATION], [STREET] through these neighborhoods and it was just dumpster, dumpster, dumpster, dumpster. And those were all affordable housings that are going away. And so by providing the houses that people that can buy a $400,000, $500,000 house, if they buy a new one, then they're not basically...  encouraging a flipper to tear apart what is affordable housing."
12_06_2022,homeless,"I have been working for code compliance for [ORGANIZATION], and it has been vacant for at least that amount of time. Thanks. Have we had anyone from the homeless community living in the house?"
12_19_2017,homeless,"That house around that area is full with homeless people, just ethically. That house was totally livable. We've got hundreds, if not thousands, of homeless people around here."
12_19_2017,homeless,"And my dad has helped many of these people. And even some of the houses they're living in now, some of these people would be homeless if it wasn't for him helping them out. So ethically, it was unright for you guys to come in and tear that house down."
12_19_2017,homeless,"No. To a homeless person living under a bridge, that house was a step up, maybe two or three steps up. Okay?"
12_19_2017,homeless,"So I think it's... a little bit arrogant of us to say that this house is deplorable and we you know it's below the standard we think is acceptable but to some people who are living under bridges and are homeless this house was two or three steps up there was a roof over their head and you and I wouldn't live there but some people would and I think that's what he's getting at so I would in the future I would hope that we would see that perspective also before we raise a house Sure, it doesn't meet our standards."
12_19_2017,homeless,"yes yes okay number two there aren't suede requirements or formal competitive bidding and approved contract [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of a hundred and three thousand dollars services to homeless and needy residents in federal in DATE0 kit Whereas ORG1 of ORG2 has operated a daytime facility to serve numerous homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents for over [LOCATION], relying upon the support of several local churches, charities, and charitable persons, as well as some governmental support for veterans, et cetera."
12_19_2017,homeless,"And whereas FAC0 is currently suffering an operating income emergency and is in dire need of temporary assistance from the city of [ORGANIZATION] to be able to weather the and continue to offer vital services to [ORGANIZATION] homeless residents during [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas if [PERSON] could no longer operate as [ORGANIZATION] family residential community transitional housing, currently housed citizens might become homeless again and have to live on the streets or in woods during these harsh [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]. and whereas if seven hills could no longer operate as [TIME] facility large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing hot food a warm [STREET] to stay during [DATE] as well as access to a telephone and other job assistance services could not find such comparable services elsewhere and whereas the facility and services provided by seven hills needed need to be continued and should be temporarily supported by city taxpayers prevent our homeless and needy residents from suffering undue hardship and deprivation now therefore be it ordained by [ORGANIZATION] the city of favela [LOCATION] section one that [ORGANIZATION] city of [PERSON] determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical and therefore weighs requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a contract between the city of [PERSON] and ORG2 in the amount of one hundred and three thousand dollars for services to homeless and GPE2 residents and authorizes mayor [PERSON] to sign this contract PERSON2, Good [TIME], Mayor and [ORGANIZATION]."
12_19_2017,homeless,"And ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $103,000 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON0. I move we suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading."
12_19_2017,homeless,probably every year I'm in total support of us helping [ORGANIZATION] but I think I always like to say on the record this is not just a [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] and when we talk to people there or we talk to people on the staff there are people there from all over the region that need help and I'm glad it's there
12_19_2017,homeless; homelessness,and i know it's hard to prove or for another city to take any responsibility that that they should help but you know i do think other cities should consider helping the [INSTITUTION] here not just [ORGANIZATION] although i'm in favor of us doing it but i do think that we have a situation there where a lot of communities have folks that are that are using that shelter not just [ORGANIZATION] person who guards the the taxpayers of GPE1's dollars and cents I always like to say that [DATE] just I'd love to see a more regional approach to homelessness and in this city and all cities.
12_19_2017,homeless,"I would like to say we ran the numbers [ORGANIZATION] on we took over a grant from [ORGANIZATION] one time if you remember that And the amounts of money is around $350,000 or so. I think that's a pretty close estimate of what we are spending on the homeless situation in this city, either directly or indirectly."
12_19_2017,homeless; homelessness,helping people because I know in the studies that I've done on homelessness many most Americans in this country is about one paycheck away from being homeless and so that could be anybody at any time and I think for us to step up and help people is vitally important to this city and what this city stands for and I think that's all I have to say.
07_16_2019,homelessness,"Going slow, getting a lot of input from different different different communities is is is really good and well thought out. Sorry if you mentioned this, but I definitely want in this study a look at the relationship between I guess the type two and homelessness in communities. I do know that some people find it financially beneficial to kick out their long term tenants so that they can rent it out at football games and bikes, booze and barbecue."
07_16_2019,homelessness,"As a city, we're having issues with homelessness. So if we don't look at this and also look at that issue at the same time, I feel like we're missing something. So thank you."
07_16_2019,homelessness,"Hello, my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the executive director for [ORGANIZATION], also a resident just outside the city limits of [ORGANIZATION]. Thanks so much for considering this ordinance and beginning this research project, because anecdotally, we may not have done the studies, but anecdotally, I can tell you this has a huge impact on people experiencing homelessness."
07_16_2019,homelessness,"But on this situation, we might consider it as a fee versus a tax. I don't know how that works, but perhaps maybe there's more latitude for the council to make a decision about  I also would like to talk about, I don't think it's too early to say let's talk about how that money will be used. The city spends a large amount of money on homelessness, and we greatly appreciate that."
07_16_2019,homelessness,"And we couldn't be making the progress that we are toward ending homelessness without that. And there are some situations where we have the opportunity to apply for grants and there's not match money for that. So, for instance, right now, the continuum of care, there's a two hundred forty three thousand dollar grant that we can apply for and we'll need a twenty five percent match.  which means that one of our organizations is going to have to fundraise private donors or somewhere to be able to find the match money."
07_16_2019,homeless,"My also perspective is that if a private citizen is going to earn money, I think that's beautiful and amazing, and I'm an entrepreneur at heart. And if them earning money is going to result in the government having to solve some problems, then I think they need to contribute a portion of that revenue that they're generating and the profit that they're generating to be able to assist the government in solving the problem that they're helping to create. So I am very happy and would love to be part of the stakeholder group and would be happy to help in any [STREET] that we can and offer our resources to be able to help convene people, get the word out, and of course connect you with homeless service providers and other housing authorities, whatever we can do."
07_16_2019,homelessness,"So whether it is just policy goals or an ordinance, there's a couple of things I want to make sure that we consider during the study that just don't get overlooked. [ORGANIZATION] mentioned how short-term rentals can be part of the homelessness problem. But I want to make sure we also talk about how they can be part of the solution."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"And that's going to go into our pond. And there are only limited options available to truly, that truly  slow the runoff a little bit, it's going to be there. I've heard people mention that, hey, we need more affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], and we do."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"There's plenty of, there are plenty of places to build in the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Affordable housing is a concern, but we're not, we're not living in a heavy metropolitan city. There's a lot of land around here to build."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"A lot of people, that's where they're building lots of houses. There's a lot of development out there for more affordable housing. And if you want to live close to [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON] and you need to get into that side of town, that's the [STREET] you're going to go."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"But I would be concerned about it. So this is really, really a real challenge. And I don't really believe, unlike some of my colleagues have said, I don't believe this contributes to affordable housing at all."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,Those are going to be expensive places to live. The price per square foot is going to be quite high. So we're not developing affordable housing.
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"maybe we're creating additional housing stock, but this is not really affordable housing. So I still haven't made up my mind yet. It's a really, really tough situation right now."
11_05_2020,housing crisis,"So I don't think that this is going to do any damage to property values adjacent, but I do think that it gives an opportunity for more people to find housing and  Right now we have a housing crisis and we need all hands on deck and we need to be building as much housing as we can and putting it on our major corridors where we can eventually serve it with transit, where it's within walking distance of jobs and services when we get around to fixing that corridor. This is a good [STREET] for housing. This is a great development proposal and I believe that [ORGANIZATION] made the right decision and I will vote to uphold it."
11_05_2020,homeless,"There was also extensive discussion about,  the issue of the park not having eyes on it and whether it created security problems. And that was reviewed by a [INSTITUTION], which a summary I think of their finding is, is that homeless people tend not to locate where there aren't services. So at this point, there isn't that much of a problem at this location."
11_05_2020,homelessness,"And we do not, based on what we heard from the police, based on if the topography of this hill, we do not believe that there would ever be a problem with homelessness. But on a lighter note, since the meeting started [TIME], we've been hearing coyotes in our backyard. this is the second time [ORGANIZATION] that that's happened so i feel like that anybody that wanted to put a tent on the hill would think secondly if they heard all those coyotes so we just want to support and that we appreciate all the hard work that [ORGANIZATION] did and that the parks and recreations did and we would we're in support of moving this forward thank you thank you who else would like to address us  PERSON1."
11_05_2020,homeless,"So, you know, we trust them. They're the professionals that know what to do. I don't agree that [ORGANIZATION] is a [STREET] for the homeless to run as a highway."
11_05_2020,homeless,"hi can you hear me  Yes. PERSON0 [ORGANIZATION] in Ward 2. I haven't been a part of this full conversation and I've just been listening [TIME], but there were some comments that were made and I'm not sure as part of the process when we talk about public spaces around [ORGANIZATION], but we have a fairly large homeless population and many of these folks are struggling with addiction and mental illness."
11_05_2020,affordable housing,"We don't have enough housing. We talk about affordable housing and we don't have enough housing and situations for permanent supportive housing for these individuals. So,  I guess whenever we're having conversations about public spaces,  I really want to hear more about inclusivity."
11_05_2020,homeless,Our homeless are part of our community. They deserve dignity and respect. They can be in our parks as well.
09_03_2019,affordable housing,"We have a lack of bicycling infrastructure. We have a woeful lack of effective public transit there. a lack of mixed-use housing, and a lack of affordable housing for students close to the university."
09_03_2019,homeless; homelessness,"Lots of variety of veterans need housing, especially sometimes people need it when they just want to be close to the [ORGANIZATION] to be able to receive their services. We're working with [PERSON]  homeless services department to be able to provide case management services for those folks that do have a voucher as part of our [ORGANIZATION]SH program. So we feel like that this is going to really add to the beauty of FAC0, as well as serve an important  function that we have come many times and said, hey, council, we need to really work on homelessness, and we really need to work on low-income housing."
12_20_2016,homeless,yes yes yes okay do we have any public comment on this and mr. [PERSON] you ought to probably read the title of the resolution resolution absolutely okay resolution to express the [ORGANIZATION] support for seven hills mission to assist the federal homeless population and to request our citizens honor [ORGANIZATION] of giving with a Generous contribution to seven hills now is there any public comment on this?
12_20_2016,homeless; homelessness,"Any public comment on the amendment? Hi, my name is [ORGANIZATION], and I've spent DATE0 becoming very just uncomfortable Educated on issues concerning homelessness here in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] And one of the issues that I never really thought about as someone who has been homed as an adult but was homeless as a child or a teenager [LOCATION] is the issue with creating a record in the system and so my question to you would be if I violate this ordinance and if I'm arrested for panhandling then what is the um What is the charge and what is the punishment for that crime? Is that a misdemeanor?"
12_20_2016,homeless,"Is that a felony? Because one of the issues that faces when you become homeless and you get into the judicial system, then you have a lot harder time to get back into housing, you have a lot harder time to get back into employment, you have a lot harder time to get a lot of places. So I get that we're trying to keep people safe, But I didn't really realize, I didn't really think about until [ORGANIZATION] how this sort of thing seems like a safety issue and then could create barriers for someone to become homed again or employed again."
11_03_2015,homelessness,"Mr. [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] will meet at [TIME] at [ORGANIZATION]. We will hear from ORG2 sociology graduate students who are working with [PERSON] and have been interviewing people experiencing homelessness on the [ORGANIZATION] to help us get some insight into the causes and...  experiences that they are experiencing so everyone is welcome that's 530 at the new design school on DATE1"
08_06_2024,affordable housing,"And so I have concerns about that. The affordable housing, I have concerns about that very steep hillside. I have concerns about that."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,I objected to the process then continued to receive feedback that there's not been adequate involvement from affected residents and surrounding community members. I watched the housing authorities DATE0 meeting and witnessed the many people who came to participate who contacted me later saying that they had felt that they had been somewhat disrespected. I continue to hear from many area residents and citizens that they do not believe the FAC0 project is in the best interest.  of those citizens in need of affordable housing.
07_24_2018,housing crisis,"If you would like to make some comments. Thank you. With our growing housing crisis in the region, we need to ensure that we are making the best decisions possible and fully utilizing all resources available to address the housing needs of our most vulnerable citizens and that those citizens are included in the decision-making process."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"But ultimately, as we move forward, I think that we need to set really high standards for our housing authority. You know, when I read their goals, their big goal was increasing the availability of decent, safe, and affordable housing. And I think about the goals that we set for the rest of our community, about being a healthy and safe and inclusive and welcoming community."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"Affordable housing is a crisis and when I look at the numbers in the [ORGANIZATION] report about barriers to housing whether that's overcrowding, housing affordability,  inadequate facilities whether that's not a full kitchen or bathroom or poor maintenance you know and I see that we have all these cost burdened households and all of this need and then I read such an underwhelming plan to address this overwhelming need and that indicates that to me that we need more public oversight we need greater citizen engagement and we need to do better for our citizens so I hope that's what we can do [TIME] I've  made an attempt to fill in the blanks of the original template resolution that [ORGANIZATION] had proposed."
07_24_2018,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. My address is homeless. And my questions are very direct.
07_24_2018,homeless,"At this present time, at [TIME] [DATE], there are 600 people, mostly children, on a waiting list to get homes. A lot of them are living in tents, in cars, in sheds, garages. Is there a [STREET] we can lower the standards so that a lot of people cannot, they're homeless, they can't get into a house?"
07_24_2018,homeless,"If you've been homeless for [ORGANIZATION], what's your credit score? What's your background? What's your background?"
07_24_2018,homeless,It's there completely hammering the tops of the homeless. They can't get out. We need to help them.
07_24_2018,homeless,"So I continue to do that because just like the gentleman who mentioned he was homeless, there are other people. If I move on or when I do move on, I want to leave in a better opportunity for others. So that's just what I want to share."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"Okay. But I do want to see a solution. What that looks like, I don't know what it is, but I do want affordable housing that, you know, I can live in and that my neighbors, the kids, and other people can live in as well."
07_24_2018,homeless,"Over [TIME] periods. I've had leaks in my home where they've had to come in huge holes in my ceilings. But again, I have to say that it's better than being homeless."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"But obviously I'm not here to talk about city and university relations. However, I will say that I see many parallel issues in [ORGANIZATION] that I have served on that committee, particularly when it comes to fair and affordable housing, overzealous private development, neighborhood relations, and community complaints not being taken seriously until they devolve into public relations crises. I've always considered myself an outsider in [ORGANIZATION] because I am not from here, nor did I attend college here."
07_24_2018,homelessness; affordable housing,"These people need to ask themselves, why are they serving on this board? If it's not to help the people in need to gain and keep a safe and affordable housing, if it's not to be part of the solution to housing and homelessness, if it's not solving these problems, then they are part of the problem. In the case of the proposed and ill-conceived plan to sell [ORGANIZATION] and slowly work to centralize all the housing and residents in one area down at FAC0, which is a horrible idea, and look at [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and that's what they all did."
07_24_2018,homelessness,I live in LOC0 Ward 4 and As an ambassador of homelessness I have recently discovered that the reason why it's hard to remember what it's like to have grown up in poverty And experienced homelessness is because there are some feelings that you feel when you are in extreme poverty and when you are dealing with homelessness and those feelings are a feeling of hopelessness and  being out of control and quite frankly in my case my parents were making decisions that made my life suck more and so what I'm going to ask the council to do I love that you guys have brought this together because I would like for the leadership of our city to first of all like  Can you believe this many people care about public housing? That's fantastic. I'm happy to talk to you all about homelessness as well.
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Housing choice vouchers we could have applied for in [ORGANIZATION] up to a million dollars in vouchers to be able to address homelessness. There's nothing in our housing authority that allows them because of their current funding restraints to be able to prioritize people experiencing homelessness. As a result, our organization, the continuum of care, which is also graded by [ORGANIZATION], also reduces points."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"And I didn't have time to pull that up, but I think it's about 18 of the 200 points that we have an opportunity to lose because none of our housing authorities are able to prioritize homelessness. Now I understand that vouchers are not the end-all be-all. However, we've hired a strategic consultant who is beginning to help us research very creative ways to increase our housing stock."
07_24_2018,homeless; homelessness,"Other people are doing this. It turns out you actually can solve homelessness for veterans, for chronically homeless, and housing vouchers are a major critical piece. We can increase our grant funding through the efforts of like what City of [ORGANIZATION] takes care of a lot of our homeless  grant services, we could increase that for permanent supportive housing [ORGANIZATION] by about $66,000."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"That's what we'll be applying for at the cost of homelessness. That's about $11,000 a year, so we can help about six more people. With a million dollars in housing choice vouchers, that number gets a lot bigger."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"So 120 people, 125 vouchers. This is real money. So if you could please...  [PERSON] add to your List of recommendations to have some type of priority for people experiencing homelessness Because that will have a direct impact on exactly how much more federal funding that we can get for our community at large"
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Thank you I was just going to reaffirm that what you're asking us to do is to add to our resolution the request  to have the housing choice vouchers and homelessness as a priority. That's correct, yeah."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"We've got to work all the pieces of the puzzle. So if you can specifically prioritize people experiencing homelessness as a portion of the vouchers we receive, then yes, we do have some methodology for taking care of that. Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"Thank you I  in your experience with other programs like that and  Are there additional ways to fund extended capacity so that if they had those vouchers, they could add a staff person to manage them? What's the story behind that part? So I can't speak specifically to that, but I know that on our priority, the continuum of care priority, very moved higher to the top of our list [ORGANIZATION] is what does it take to increase that capacity, and whether that's private foundation or  [ORGANIZATION], as many of you know, had a community meeting [ORGANIZATION] where we explained this is what's going on with homelessness, here's our strategic plan, we've hired a consultant, they've helped eight other cities be able to end homelessness in those eight other cities."
07_24_2018,homeless,"Perhaps, yes. Based on the GoFundMe that funded $15,000 in [ORGANIZATION], I would say yes, sir. Ms. [PERSON], good evening, and thank you for being such an effective advocate for the homeless, the least of these in our city."
07_24_2018,homelessness,And I know that the only [STREET] we've been able to make a change in homelessness is we went out in  the national sphere and we found a consultant that actually had helped someone else and we changed our perspective so based on their perspective I do believe they have the best meaning at heart. Thanks.
07_24_2018,homeless,"My reputation has been maligned. Just like you thought it was funny to say I was the [ORGANIZATION] attorney. We do have a program, [ORGANIZATION]."
07_24_2018,homelessness,And we have 130 vouchers. And those are leased out. So we do realize homelessness is a problem.
07_24_2018,homeless,"I also want to let you know that [ORGANIZATION] when we have a board meeting, I announce that we have open vouchers. In fact, we just returned $40,000 to [ORGANIZATION] because those vouchers were not filled. So unless those homeless persons, and they were veterans, were brought to our office, we could not house them or we couldn't help them to find housing assistance."
07_24_2018,homeless,"So we do recognize there is a need. Also, I would ask that you talk to [ORGANIZATION], and she can tell you about the problems you have with  finding homes for homeless people. There's more than vouchers, not having vouchers is a problem."
07_24_2018,homelessness,We have the executive director from [ORGANIZATION] here as well. So maybe we can get that on their list to make homelessness a priority as well. Know that we have 600 and something people on our waiting list.
07_24_2018,homelessness,"So although we think homelessness is a priority, what about the priority of those people who've been on the waiting list for [ORGANIZATION]? So are you going to turn these people away and say, look, I'm sorry, you're not important now. Because we don't look at somebody else."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"We also like to address Good [TIME] [ORGANIZATION] finance bill [PERSON]. I live at [ADDRESS] Ward 1 and  It says in the [ORGANIZATION] website that we promote adequate and affordable housing, economic opportunity, and suitable living environment free from discrimination in an environment that fosters self-sufficiency and community pride. When your public housing assets are all in one zip code, there is discrimination like there is now."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"to ensure so your comprehensive plan, your comprehensive plan, not theirs, talks about having available, attainable, affordable housing in all quadrants of the city. The direction in your [ORGANIZATION] master plan update is about multiple growth concept areas so that people can have affordable housing closer to employment, closer to multiple schools. So even in this particular scenario as it relates to our master plan,  We would want to see future properties in the northern part of town where we have none, in our [LOCATION] on the west side of the highway."
07_24_2018,homeless,"And the thing is, it's hard. It's just unacceptable, you know, and I wanted to bring up what again what [ORGANIZATION] was saying about innovation I think that the first thing that we need to do is take some form of action Some have some form of sense of urgency towards this issue instead of just you know talking and you know Trying to go around these loopholes to try and you know [PERSON] as if we're trying to help these people when in reality it sounds as if someone's trying to make you know a lot of money, right So I think that, you know, innovation, innovative solutions is something that we need to, uh, you know, really harp on as she was saying, um, that being said, uh,  We're talking about the homeless issues."
07_24_2018,homeless,"I'll also air my appreciation that this discussion is being had right now. I think I'm here specifically to talk about the [ORGANIZATION] plan and I  that the standard of our public housing should be better than, as it was noted by a resident earlier, better than being homeless. We should have higher standards for housing."
07_24_2018,homelessness,"and so what I guess what I'm concerned about when I when I I  want to talk about no rad there is that we make sure that that [ORGANIZATION] maintains the autonomy to prioritize homelessness as was stated earlier in the plan and that that's not seated to a buyer or a ninety nine point nine nine percent interest in the company that that might choose different policies  I know that the waiting list is long and that's inconvenient, but if you've got somebody on a waiting list that's being sheltered and you've got the option to put somebody who's sleeping under the stars under a roof, then yes, I think that it would be appropriate to prioritize that first. And I want to make sure that they maintain the option to do that. So I will, I guess...  moderate some of my my rad statements with i agree if we can keep it prevent demolition so that that clears the cloud of of improvement monies"
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"And so when I think about what we can do as policymakers, well, we can legalize affordable housing. And that means apartments, duplexes, and nontraditional housing types in all of our neighborhoods. You know, when I hear about developers not accepting rental assistance vouchers, well, as a city, we can offer developers incentives to accept a certain percentage of rental assistance vouchers."
07_24_2018,housing crisis,"So regardless of what we do here [TIME], the problem is bigger than this. And I want us to all stay engaged because we have a growing housing crisis in our community. Step one is fixing our housing authority and making it serve our community better and giving it the resources it needs to succeed."
07_24_2018,homeless,"Well, I have listened to everyone, and I do think your comments, [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON], about how to operate is very good, and that should be listened to, but that's not really part of the [ORGANIZATION] plan, right? So what I have boiled it down to is four items, conveniently numbered A, B, C, D. And the first one was prioritize homeless to obtain housing vouchers and including staff capacity if needed."
07_24_2018,affordable housing,"I'm sure some of you have experienced some of the same thing. But first and foremost, I think I agree with a lot of the comments here [TIME]. Right now we're working on an affordable regional housing plan that's being done regionally, and hopefully we can address affordable housing in the future."
11_14_2019,homelessness,"Um, but other than that, I mean, the, the job of the city clerk is to record key and, and communicate, um, there's, there's still room for me to have my own opinions as we all do, there's still room for me to advocate, um, for the things that are close to my heart, which for the most part is, um, people experiencing poverty and homelessness and, uh, equality. And, um, you know, while I won't be speaking in front of the podium, I'll still advocate for those things. Um, but also trust."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"When we looked at that, as Mr. [PERSON] noted, we won't create any additional drainage problems or flooding problems to the neighborhood. We might even possibly be able to add some retainage ponds a little larger that might stop some of the flow that's going downstream, or at least retain it. We were challenged DATE0 about trying to find land that could be in the mayor's box for affordable housing."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"It'll be either on the hillside or floodplain areas. So this is one of the last areas we've been able to find to look at affordable housing and doing a full mixed use again of the affordable, the [ORGANIZATION] and older, and the middle and larger homes. If we can't do that, then what we're doing is forcing our hometown hero group to move to the rural areas or the smaller cities."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I don't need it. Okay, I had someone tell me that this decision for you guys all boiled down between a choice between 134 estate homes that were entitled to build or affordable housing. I dare say it's a good bit different than that."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"Yes, on one side of the equation is 134 unaffordable, expensive estate homes with sprinkler systems and the whole nine yards. On the other hand, is more than just affordable housing. You'd be getting things such as 100 of those would be the [ORGANIZATION] plus cottage homes where it's less than half the DATE1 car trips than normal and less usage of water and sewer than normal."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think what you're getting is not just affordable housing, but affordable housing that's good for the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I stand by ready to ask any questions. And further, we have our engineer if you have any questions for him."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I have a question. Sure. I hear the term affordable housing a lot, and I'm just curious to know affordable for who?"
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"That's what I'm, you know, I'm just curious. And this is a question that many of the residents have addressed, and it's a very fair question, especially considering the lack of affordable housing. So that's one of the things that is, well,  When I'm having conversations with the residents, that's been driving the conversation."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,The one thing that irritates me about all this is I've heard mentioned several times from three or four different people that a part of this  affordable housing is going to be for the elderly or someone called them the local heroes or I'm DATE0 and I [STREET] from my neighborhood into town sometimes three or four times a day so I'm just I'm not sitting just parked in front of my television I travel quite a bit I'm active And I hate to be thought of as a geriatric old geezer who just is not going to be a hardship on the system.
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"You're going to see these neighborhoods going up and they're just packed, crammed with affordable housing. So let's put in some nicer homes too for people. I mean, we're telling people, no, we're not going to build those homes because we want nothing but affordable housing."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,We need housing in [ORGANIZATION] desperately. We don't need more mansions. We need a vast opportunity to provide affordable housing that is available in the city.
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"And maybe we could meet with him and see exactly and understand exactly. When you talk about affordable housing, what are you talking about?  when you talk about exactly where are these homes going to be. So I thank you for your time, and I certainly appreciate your willing to serve our community."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I think the chief concern that I have as a council member is that I don't have a price tag for those infrastructure improvements that would be linked to this development. I do not like the use of the term affordable housing for a development such as this primarily because  By the time DATE0 goes by, the cost of labor, materials, and infrastructure is such that you can't make a promise of a price tag. The only thing you know currently is the price of the dirt upon which you're going to build."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"And I do support affordable housing, and I certainly understand the housing issues that we are facing. But [TIME] is not about that. [TIME] is about infrastructure problems."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"It's clearly outside of the mayor's box and it has a very low infill score. And I want to remind my fellow council members that the only item that is enforceable is the bill of assurances. So I know this developer is reputable, has got great integrity, but we have also heard about affordable housing many, many times before."
07_18_2023,affordable housing,"I'm just really reflective, and I think I shared this with you, of wanting to make sure going forward, anytime that we can tie to what our strategic goals and like the spending specifically to really make sure that those decisions we're making going forward, the council too has visibility with saying yes to those budgetary items. And one of the areas where, you know, as I was looking through here that I was being really mindful was thinking about our recent retreat and thinking about, you know, we talked about really wanting to make sure there was attainable, affordable housing and making sure that we have, you know, a good quality of life. And so that's kind of how I went into the mindset as I was kind of, you know, looking through here."
11_02_2021,affordable housing,"Parking would need to be on the property only. We're also talking about affordable housing to have a more diverse community that reflects the changing times, and I don't see that happening with the rezoning. We all know the developers are trying to turn a profit and they couldn't directly answer our questions regarding the price of the structures they're trying to build."
11_02_2021,housing crisis,"You know, given the fact that we could do 280 use now, I don't think we would build four houses and four 80 use that be almost impossible to fit there. But I think this is reasonable. We have just a massive housing crisis."
11_02_2021,housing crisis,"So I see us going from basically two units to four units or in this case, four to four, depending on how you splice it. This seems like a reasonable increase. Yeah.  especially given the housing crisis."
11_02_2021,homeless,"If you've got theoretically 11 families that want to move in houses and you've got 10 houses, well, the price goes up until that 11th person can't be here or they're homeless. Right. So we need houses."
11_02_2021,housing crisis,"And as I mentioned earlier, I was there [ORGANIZATION] as well, and the speeding, stormwater issues  connectivity, they're all challenges. And I'm just hoping that we're able to address these issues, the safety issues, sooner rather than later. This is really complex for me because the residents have really spoke out, but we do certainly, there is a housing crisis here and that can't be denied."
08_01_2023,homeless,"a resolution to award bid number 23-27 authorized purchase of bulk crushed rock salt from [ORGANIZATION]  for 40 dollars per ton for materials picked up and 89.49 per ton for materials delivered as needed and to authorize use of other bidders based on price availability as needed  number 12 a resolution authorized acceptance of the ORG1 grant in the amount of 189 450 to fund 90 of the cost of an environmental assessment for the taxiway extension project at FAC0 to approve tax order number seven in the amount of two hundred and eight thousand dollars with ORG2 to complete the assessment and to approve budget  [DATE], a resolution to approve the renewal of four continuing of care grant agreements with ORG3  the total amount of three hundred thirty eight thousand two hundred and sixty dollars for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents number 14 a resolution to designate an authorized marriage ordinaries designate to execute certain documents in connection with funding administered by [LOCATION] to obtain loan funding for the  [LOCATION] water transmission main project and to prove budget just my little entertain of motions except consent agendas read so moved second the motion the second to accept the consent agenda PERSON0 yes more yes, we dicker. Yes, [PERSON]. Yes lunch yes"
08_01_2023,affordable housing,"and also [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. So I hope that when the budget comes around, that we can really take another look at those budget items and see if we can adjust them, because I do think they're really important. And during our retreat, along with affordable housing, we also talked about quality of life."
08_06_2022,affordable housing,"And as far as affordable housing, besides [ORGANIZATION], did we have any applicants from those organizations, I guess, [PERSON] or ORG2? We did have proposals from ORG2 and ORG3. Okay."
10_06_2015,affordable housing,"This does give us the opportunity to be more diverse, and it also is going to give us a step closer to that goal that we have for infill development that's responsible, and then it's going to give the opportunity for more affordable housing ownership, rather than living in a multi-family  complex where you don't have ownership and therefore you don't have personal liability on the property that you're building on. Step one and [ORGANIZATION] I listen I agree with you totally as we're seeing this high density development, and we're seeing the impact of runoff the management of stormwater the Management of the watershed the high velocity that we get with the high density development as it's running off into the watershed It all has to be managed responsibly"
10_06_2015,affordable housing,"I mean, I would support sending the entire ordinance to ordinance review again or to planning commission to start over or reevaluate some of these elements, but I can't support this ordinance without the amendment. Ms. [PERSON]. I think we need to pass the original ordinance and we need to pass it now, and we need to do that because we have a serious lack of  affordable business space, small retail space in our downtown area, and affordable housing space."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"You know, a lot of younger people, millennials especially, I mean they want more options to live, to work near walkable destinations. They want missing middle. They want more affordable housing."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"This does address both tree preservation and storm runoff, because when you're removing trees, in order to fully develop the lot you paid $500,000 for,  you're covering the lot all the water is running off and there are no tree roots to absorb anything so the two aren't tied together and as far as the comment that and i know i'm not supposed to do so i'm going to keep this general infill particularly in downtown [ORGANIZATION] does not provide affordable housing especially when the lots are going for half a million dollars  Nothing that's going to be built on there is going to be affordable."
07_16_2024,housing crisis,"And so a lot of people I know, a lot of my friends are successful professionals, but  We're in a situation with our housing crisis that people I know can't afford to move sideways. And so if you have a young family who can't afford, you know, and you just had another kid and they can't afford to buy that bigger house, their only option is to add that bedroom."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"The dissenting votes mostly emphasized the loss of affordable housing that this rezoning may catalyze, and also the potential that there is an outsized amount of building height allowed under the seven stories of [ORGANIZATION]. Conversely, those in favor of the request felt that this property's very high infill score indicated that it needs to be used for a higher amount of housing, a higher use, if you will, and also acknowledging that there is currently a very high existing redevelopment potential and that the bill of assurance gives a certain degree of comfort to the commissioners moving the request forward. um and i wanted to refer to the bill of assurance one last time because you may have seen a message from our legal department uh in reviewing the bill of assurance following agenda session mr [ORGANIZATION] identified that there was some language in that bill of assurance that we  that we feel is important to protect the city that was either removed or not included."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"So I just want to say you guys have already received an email from me [ORGANIZATION], but I still have a lot to say about this. Infill in this area comes with expensive student housing and that is contradictory to the stated goals of affordable housing for residents, discouraging suburban sprawl and the climate action plan that you guys just discussed earlier. So with that being said, I hope that you're ready to hear more about trees."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"Who else would like to address this?  Thanks for listening to me again on this topic. [ORGANIZATION], [ADDRESS] [ORGANIZATION]. I am reluctantly in support of this because I see the need for the development, but there have been many good points mentioned about how it will  affect affordable housing because most of the housing that's up there right now in the apartments is affordable because it's older housing and I do question where those people are going to go because There aren't really they're not building new buildings that are going to absorb the people who are displaced from those units"
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"I would like to start by saying that as of [ORGANIZATION], I received a letter from my property manager stating that the property has been  The decision has been made to sell the property. I can only assume that it is to [ORGANIZATION], the anticipated developer. This property is a unique property in that it is affordable housing for not only just students, but small families that can not afford the upscale living of apartment complexes like those nearby us, like the FAC0 and the FAC1, as those layouts aren't subject to  the ins and outs of a family's dynamic, and that they are four separate bedrooms that share a living room, and they are intended specifically to be quote-unquote dorm style."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"I am a graduate student at [ORGANIZATION], and I can understand the benefit that it would have to demolish all of the properties in the suggested rezoning, but that benefit is only for the university. It doesn't accommodate to the existing residents of [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION],  As a [ORGANIZATION], almost [LOCATION] resident of [ORGANIZATION], I have seen a number of affordable housing be lost to development just because [ORGANIZATION] feels the need to have luxurious grand apartments while the current residents suffer because the university is ever-growing. I am all for the development of the university and I think it is an amazing concept to have a city that's so intertwined with its university but at the same time we are losing the affordable housing that so many of these graduate students or small families depend on because we want to satiate the university's need to expand."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,I know that the atmosphere and the cardinal have essentially become  dorms that are operated by third parties rather than the university. I'm afraid that [ORGANIZATION] will be demolished so that another dorm-style situation can be opened up and we will lose the affordable housing that we have. I pay less than $500 a month to live here with my roommate.
09_03_2024,housing crisis,"They actually create environments  where crime and substance abuse actually proliferate. And really also in relation as we've been talking a lot around our housing crisis that we face and we're a majority renter population, is that oftentimes individuals due to just lack of necessary income, they have to rent with many individuals who, you know, they may not be highly understanding what the interactions are of those, say, roommates. I'm very aware that unfortunately There are instances where you know one roommate might be participating in a certain area of something You know and all people that live within that that unit end up with criminalization You know based on those those items being present in that area Additionally, you know we've heard from  Folks that have experienced domestic violence who oftentimes again because of our housing crisis are having to stay in situations That are non desirable with people that can be their abuser And so in those instances again where those individuals are present in those households We hear"
09_03_2024,housing crisis,I don't dislike apartments. I don't dislike dense houses  We need this housing. We have a housing crisis.
09_03_2024,affordable housing,"And in that area, if you think about kind of looking at the general area of kind of affordable housing or accessible housing for families that might want to access that schooling,  There's not a lot of it. It's pretty finite in that area and you've seen students encroach in that area. And so when I look at this, I'm also just taking that into consideration looking at [ORGANIZATION]."
09_03_2024,affordable housing,"This is an area, if you're familiar with it, that has a lower socioeconomic population that lives there. I mean, this is some of our more affordable housing. And there have been individuals, when they've come into that area of our community, that they haven't been  is aware of the type of population that lives there."
08_15_2023,affordable housing,"The preserve is always intended to capture, sequester, and filter stormwater for the surrounding area, but we believe it may be reaching its capacity to do so. [ORGANIZATION] in general is not opposed to responsible high density infill within our urban core. We have been in discussions with regional partners about the need for more housing, especially workforce housing and affordable housing."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"The golf, the pools, the restaurants. Typically those type of golf amenities  the homes are much higher priced. Not only are we going to try to bring affordable housing in there, but I think you guys have seen something that [ORGANIZATION] sent out that we're calling [ORGANIZATION]."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"Additionally, while welcoming to me and my family, this growth has come at the expense of the less privileged residents of [ORGANIZATION] who have been here much longer than me by increasing the minimum threshold to secure safe and affordable housing. I'm here [TIME] to express my support of the rezoning, my gratitude to all who have taken the time to educate me over [ORGANIZATION]. and to express my hope that regardless of the decision that it rendered, that the city of [ORGANIZATION] will tackle the challenge of supporting infrastructure and affordable housing with the same zeal with which it promoted itself to be a top ten best [STREET] to live."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"I think it would be nice to have...  you know, some commercial restaurants and stuff to be in that area. I also think it'd be great to have some improvements to the golf course as well. And I'm also in support of the affordable housing."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"And when my wife and I moved here [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], we experienced quite a different atmosphere than what is happening right now. With all due respect to affordable housing concerns, all it takes is a cursory look coming up [ORGANIZATION] and FAC0 to see where massive amounts of homes are being built. Now, while I'm softening my outlook on this, I also believe that."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"So I'd like to know if this is going to be done, why there has to be so much affordable housing, as they call it, and why can't we have around the country club much more states that bring up the property value? I think it's wonderful that we're going to have that. you know, active living facility and housing."
07_06_2023,housing crisis,"And my concern with city staff not supporting it, that's also...  that's a big concern as well however leaving the meeting I do feel that the perspective has changed and as they said [TIME] I think a lot of their hearts have been softened however there are still some concerns so it's it's difficult because we are experiencing as we all know a housing crisis and but at this point I  I believe that I can support this. I'm leaning toward supporting this and especially  with the city continuing to work with the neighborhood as it relates to fixing what we can as quickly as possible because those concerns are legitimate. And when we think about infrastructure, when there are things that we can address, there are things that we can fix as a city, I want to make that our top priority."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"And then the infrastructure cost issue. I believe that there are other areas in town where affordable housing could be built with less infrastructure requirements, but I don't have all of that information in front of me. So, for example, how many more lift stations would need to be built to handle that kind of capacity that has been identified in the bill of assurance?"
07_06_2023,housing crisis,"In a perfect world, they would be just fine. If we have a functioning housing market and  Short-term rentals would fit into that and play a role. But when we're in a housing crisis with a housing shortage, demand outpacing our construction for [ORGANIZATION], we don't have a healthy housing market, and so we have to address the situation that we're in."
07_06_2023,affordable housing,"People are not safe or healthy when they don't have access to affordable housing. And so I hope that you will reduce the cap now, consider reducing it later. If we find that the cap doesn't grow with the population,  you're amending it now you can amend the cap again anytime you need to um you have that authority um so i hope that you'll take this action [TIME] thanks thank you who else would like to address us"

Number 4, a resolution to approve the renewal of four special needs assistance  Program grant agreements with ORG2 in a total amount of $305,348 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents and to approve a budget adjustment."
12_07_2021,affordable housing,I represent the southern sellers of the 51.2 acres. The only thing I would like to say is thank you guys for your time [TIME]. And I just want to reemphasize the need for affordable housing in your town.
12_07_2021,affordable housing,"And I'm not going to repeat everything I said on [ORGANIZATION], but I would like to reiterate and reassert that [ORGANIZATION] does need affordable housing. There is no denying that fact. And approving the annexation and rezoning this 110 acres will allow such housing to be built in [ORGANIZATION], someplace other than on the west side of the city."
12_07_2021,affordable housing,"That motion failed by a vote of four to five with a mirror motion to forward it being made immediately thereafter forwarding it five to four to the [ORGANIZATION] recommending approval. The main comments in favor of the request were that it was preferred that if the property were to develop, that it be under RSF8 to afford the opportunity for smaller lots and potentially more affordable housing in the city. Those opposed emphasized concerns with congestion and that the city's resources would be better spent rezoning properties nearer to the city center and investing in infrastructure there."
07_20_2021,affordable housing,"We talk about affordable housing all the time. Our moratorium is going to end, the [ORGANIZATION] moratorium at [ORGANIZATION], and we have many people I think will be in crisis that will be in house because rental dollar assistance is not getting into those hands quickly enough. struggling and not making ends meet, unfortunately have to result to other means sometimes to get their needs met and those don't make our community safe."
07_20_2021,homeless,"We understand that there are national issues concerning policing. However, we must turn our attention to [ORGANIZATION]. Regardless of the neighborhood, whether you are a college student, visiting, homeless, or whatever the case may be, everyone in [ORGANIZATION] deserves to be safe, period."
08_02_2022,homeless,This is a [ORGANIZATION] firefighting facilities improvements bond project. Number five will be pulled from the agenda. It is resolution to  Approve the renewal of three special needs assistance program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION] in the total amount of two hundred seventy thousand One hundred ninety three dollars for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents.
08_02_2022,homeless,"Now let's go to number five that we have pulled a resolution to approve the renewal of three special needs assistance program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION] in the total amount of two hundred seventy thousand one hundred ninety three dollars  for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. Is PERSON0 available? Yes, sir."
08_02_2022,homeless,"Okay. These are our renewal grants. And what they're utilized for is for the continued service to provide rental assistance down our deposit, our rental deposit and utility deposit for individuals that were formerly homeless."
08_02_2022,homelessness,"It's possible, and I'm sure [ORGANIZATION] will fill this in, that there are carryover participants from [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] since this is a permanent housing grant. And so I'd like to know how many people did we actually help this [ORGANIZATION]? I'd like to know what factors in a time where we know housing prices are rising, rents are rising, and homelessness is rising."
08_02_2022,homeless,"So so there was not I mean, you know, basically what had to do is they came to us. They said, either you all take this money so that you can help the homeless or [ORGANIZATION] is losing it. And I know that I hear you all saying, we hear that a lot, but that's what they came to us with."
08_02_2022,homeless,"The city stepped up, mayor, everyone that discussed it. Absolutely, we are not losing this funding. We will take it because we want to keep housing the homeless."
08_02_2022,homelessness,"Sure. I'm just wondering, and I don't know, and it may just be so specific that what we can do it when I'm hearing you say that we could use it for homelessness. But to have, I think what I'm understanding is the board is wanting to have feedback to how those funds are used or how many people are affected."
08_02_2022,homeless,So is there an opportunity for next...  [ORGANIZATION] if this is no there is no feedback i mean [PERSON] is dictating these funds can only be used to house the homeless housing and each specific one they dictate how many units they expect us to house with the funding and what services need to be provided to go along with that so so they're they're running this show we are not [PERSON] is telling us what to do  I think that a key here would be to offer education regarding these to the committee so that they have a better understanding of the source of the legislation and the history of this specific funding that came from another organization to the city
08_02_2022,homeless,"whenever we we um i'll just say when a client no longer is with us then we turn to there is a binding list  What this binding list is, is a listing of every individual that we can document that is homeless and they are prioritized. We use a document that is called the Viespa VET."
08_02_2022,affordable housing,"That program is designed to keep properties from ever falling into this level of disrepair. It would be amazing if that program had the resources to be proactive, to use all of the funding that y'all have made available to it so that we are not tearing down affordable housing. I'm sure that this property is far too gone for that."
08_02_2022,housing crisis,"I'm thinking like seven to nine. There's not even the acreage to go up to 12 if they wanted to, but by the time you add a [STREET], cause it's, you would have to, it almost be impossible. And we are pretty much a housing crisis."
09_19_2017,affordable housing,"You said it – did you say it violated some federal states? Well, there is a letter saying that they did not – Violate [ORGANIZATION] guidelines, but there's also nothing saying that they were in compliance with those guidelines Because they failed to notify [ORGANIZATION] or create the appropriate paper trail in order to liquidate FAC0 which is basically there they want to move all of these residents of the low-income housing. [PERSON] and [PERSON] this other housing, so we're not creating really any new affordable housing units."
09_19_2017,homelessness,"I also believe in the very best intentions of people. I want you to know that you can't spell community without the word unity. [ORGANIZATION], our mission is coordinating a community-wide response to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_19_2017,homelessness,I really do. But I wanted to make sure. I'm traveling actually to attend some further training to learn how to create the strategic plan for homelessness.
09_01_2020,affordable housing,"Other commissioners felt that the existing ordinances are not set up to adequately ensure the compact, complete and connected development our comprehensive plans want to see, particularly this far west in town. And stemming from that and the applicant's assertions that they would want to build affordable housing, there were questions of how affordable the housing can really be when factored in with transportation costs, if the majority of services and workplaces were fairly distanced from this property. And that said, I'm happy to take any questions the council has and I appreciate it, thanks."
09_01_2020,affordable housing,"And in addition, it would provide more tax dollars. So we would like to implore [ORGANIZATION] to appeal the decision to deny the rezoning and allow us to rezone it and market it to someone who can bring in the affordable housing um  to this area like i said that already has a lot of small lots and some duplexes across the [STREET] and that's all i have for now thank you so much okay does the council have any questions for the applicant before we go on the public comment"
07_07_2015,homelessness,"It's kind of a stop gap for people that are having a major crisis. Usually it's for domestic abuse, temporary homelessness, some other kind of emergency situation. It's not just free boarding when you go on vacation, but in this particular instance, you know, if you simply had no other options, then yes, that would be a good example of that."
07_07_2015,affordable housing,"And it helps a lot of people. And honestly, I will tell you that this program enables the affordable housing stock in the city of [ORGANIZATION] to be maintained. Because a lot of the individuals that we assist, if there wasn't somebody there to help them maintain their home,  they wouldn't have a [STREET] to live and guess what they wouldn't be shopping they wouldn't be buying gas they wouldn't be providing that income to the city"
12_04_2024,housing crisis,"And I'd rather have us  you know, [ORGANIZATION], look at our, at our, at what we've done and say, whoa, we've, we've had some loss because we're going to have some loss. We know we need to develop more. We have a housing crisis in [ORGANIZATION], so we're going to lose some trees."
12_04_2024,housing crisis,"And I'm very glad that they were able to meet because they were able to reach common to meet common ground and The neighborhood continued to echo that it's not about development and so  I really appreciate being able to compromise and reach some type of common ground because initially that wasn't the case. But [TIME] it seems as though that there has been, it's not a perfect solution, but I believe it's a viable solution in that it's working together and to the developers, again,  time is money and of course, you know, as a council member, this is not intentional, but it's about balancing and striking a balance and making sure that we're listening to our neighbors loud and clear, making sure that we're listening to the neighborhood. We recognize that we are in a housing crisis."
12_04_2024,housing crisis,"I do have incredible concern But because you know we did look at the budget only in [ORGANIZATION] with holidays, etc And much going on within our city getting to [ORGANIZATION] There hasn't been a lot of time given all the money you should to be able in my opinion to do the public and  vetting and discussion in public while I've had those private conversations. And so I have a desire that we can change that in 25 so that we can start the budget process sooner, sometime in [DATE] to start to get some visibility and to get some community feedback as we shape that plan. But I definitely want to point out, as we have declared a housing crisis,  And we have so many incredible comprehensive plans that might touch on things."
12_04_2024,affordable housing; unhoused,"We do not have a strategy and a focus on affordable housing. And I think that's something that really we are going to have to look at and address, having a comprehensive plan around affordable housing. And we have $300,000 that we're spending to move individuals who are in camp that are unhoused."
12_04_2024,affordable housing; unhoused,"We really are going to have to, and the affordable housing plan has an ability to  have us address our unhoused population in a dignified manner so that we aren't spending $300,000 to relocate them and to remove trash around our city long term. I also have concerns about continuing to add spending in our [INSTITUTION]. whenever there are additional needs within our city that we do need to look at in regard to healthcare capacity and how we respond to crisis for individuals that are struggling in our community, as well as I have incredible pause about the continued growth of the poverty within our community and not having specific programs and focuses that are within a comprehensive strategy and plan and hope that we'll look at those in [ORGANIZATION] to come."
10_19_2021,homeless,"Number eight, a resolution to approve [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] in the total amount of $76,763 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. Number nine. resolution to approve an amendment to the current right-of-[STREET] maintenance permit with ORG2 in order for the city to be able to assist the creation of the city's third medical cannabis [ORGANIZATION] by having the right to determine which trees may be removed and which must be retained from parcel  765-[ZIP]-001 near FAC0, number 10, a resolution to approve a remission deed to reconvey about 5.82 acres to ORG3 of the [ORGANIZATION] estate so that Miss [PERSON] may personally donate this 5.82 acres back to the city of federal and number 11 a resolution to prove a sub recipient agreement with [LOCATION] to provide funding from the American rescue plan."
10_19_2021,affordable housing,"But a few things that really stood out in my mind was his work on [ORGANIZATION], his work on funding for the mobility and 71B master plans, his work on the [PERSON] health and safety measures, his work on...  helping with [ORGANIZATION], his work on expansion of our recycling trash program, his work on climate change and green space protection, his leadership on [ORGANIZATION], and his advocacy for affordable housing and public transit. He also was instrumental in his support of the city's DATE0 bond initiative. There are too many contributions for me to list here [TIME]."
11_20_2018,affordable housing,"I live in Ward 2, and good evening to Mayor and [ORGANIZATION]. I note that affordable housing is still one of the city's goals. It was something that I lobbied for, along with some others of you, when I was a member of this esteemed body once."
11_20_2018,affordable housing,"Anyhow, it's disappointing to me that a lot of what we're talking about for affordable housing is the same as what we're talking about [TIME]. A large contingent of the folks, people that are opposed,  Excuse me, a large contingent of the folks in the area proposed for rezoning are here [TIME] and have written to you asking you not to rezone. It was my understanding when I was an elected official that it was my mission to listen to them and to represent their points of view."
11_20_2018,affordable housing,"And also mixed income neighborhoods are more resilient neighborhoods. You know, we talk about we don't want to flood [ORGANIZATION] with too many affordable housing units or we don't want to concentrate poverty because we want a diversity of incomes in our neighborhoods because those are stronger neighborhoods. But then I'd also like to point out something that's been happening in my neighborhood where we see the construction of, quote unquote, single family homes, but they're rented by the bedrooms."
11_20_2018,housing crisis,"and i think we should do this but when we switch from [ORGANIZATION] to ORG1 to ORG1a or ORG3 we need to  make an adjustment somewhere else in the city, because as we've seen already [TIME], like there's a housing crisis, because we don't have the right zones in our city. So if we're taking away some of our denser zones, then and making it a lighter zone, then we're gonna have to make a denser zone somewhere else."
10_17_2017,affordable housing,"So I know that you're concerned about that, I am too, but I also know that we need affordable housing. The housing that we currently have, it's old. It's not terrible, but it is an older building."
10_17_2017,affordable housing,"But I also hear you speak fondly about the neighborhood that you're in and the [STREET] that it occupies. You know, they could... The studies that they did showed that they could completely renovate the facility where you're at and make all of the upgrades that you talked about desiring for one-fourth of the cost of building the new units down at FAC0 and that they're not actually adding additional affordable housing units."
10_17_2017,affordable housing,"Zero. Okay, but we do have available land, or we do have other [ORGANIZATION] accessible units in our affordable housing inventory. I believe at the one over FAC0 and FAC1 as well."
10_17_2017,affordable housing,"We've got a need nationally of about 120,000 low-income units across the country. We're building about 45,000 a year, and about 40,000 or so of the ones we already have lose their provisions and get converted into market rates. So we're more or less not really creating any new affordable housing as a nation."
10_17_2017,affordable housing,"and I think that was the balance move to make just as I think you know [ORGANIZATION] decision here is it's the balance move to make Again, even even though I think some of the criticism is fair and the project could probably be better Thank you i just wanted to summarize again that voting to support this appeal it's not voting against affordable housing and what it is about is going back to the drawing board and saying that this this plan isn't good enough it uh and we have a higher standard um for public housing in [ORGANIZATION] and that we value the people who live there and want to make sure that they have appropriate access to jobs in transportation and grocery stores and all of the and things places like FAC0 and all the things that they need to participate in society and be successful and that they should be able to access those without endangering their lives by walking on dark streets without adequate sidewalks and and putting themselves at risk for being hit by cars."
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], would you please call the roll? I hear that. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Thank you all under unfinished business number one an ordinance to authorize the [ORGANIZATION] grant of variance in the single Family infill standard to support attainable affordable housing PERSON1."
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"okay uh [ORGANIZATION] i'm just curious as to uh what happened to the uh whereas about affordable housing because it was my understanding that that was the primary motivation behind uh passing looking at this ordinance Well, the affordable housing was in relation to if we were going to have a variance procedure in front of [ORGANIZATION]."
08_16_2016,affordable housing,So this is no longer about creating affordable housing. It's about making it easier for developers. Is that correct?
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"I think it does help affordable housing, because I think that we heard from the developers about how that without, you know, if we had continued with the ordinance where it's less than 70 feet,  and you have to have the garages recessed and not just flush then in fact that could be expensive for home buyers so i think even though this this is not the major purpose of this particular ordinance but i think that is one effect that it will in fact help affordability and attainability of houses anybody else okay what public comment do we have on these amendments bear with me just a second i've had a lot of allergies [ORGANIZATION]"
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"Thank you to the staff. Thank you to [ORGANIZATION], and especially thank you, Mayor [PERSON], because we know that you've always been a champion for the affordable housing. You look up here and you read that last item, and it says we'll create opportunities for the attainable housing."
08_16_2016,affordable housing,To your question a while ago Had we not had this this change? there's two things that could happen if we had to go from a 70 foot lot to a 60 foot lot and still and [ORGANIZATION] everything up it would be expensive But if we stayed with the 70 foot lot It could possibly cost that homeowner another five to ten thousand just because of the size of the law so this allowed us the flexibility to drop a  this size lot down to create this affordable housing in the manner that we have done for [DATE] and and been embraced with [ORGANIZATION]  involved with them for over [DATE] now.
08_16_2016,affordable housing,"I can tell you this, they're not what I would call affordable housing. I mean, they are lower priced, but they're very high per foot, but I'm not necessarily going after the first-time homebuyer. So it certainly limits what we can do on the lots, and as a developer, it just adds a lot of complication in an already complicated process."
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"There's actually already a lot of density nearby and it's already proven difficult for some of our property owners nearby that do own animals. I 100% support having affordable housing, but I think the idea of shoving all of the lower income people into the outskirts of the city is a regressive policy. Because as [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, if you are a lower income family, it's harder to buy and maintain a car."
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"all of us to understand better about the long-term growth and the plans and we just don't see that this high density in such a small area at this time it goes in line with that. Also along with the lack of city services as both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] mentioned and in time I'm sure that those will be provided in this area. There are  In part of the case for the rezone, the [ORGANIZATION] stated that we need more affordable housing in this area."
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"I'm assuming that they mean this immediate area. So...  Because I'm experienced in canvassing and counting as an employee of [ORGANIZATION], I explored a half-mile radius around the case property for rezoning, and I found that we have about 140 current what would be considered affordable housing duplexes  in our immediate area plus the 90 that will be going in in the cobblestone edition which has been approved we think that is a wonderful project we support that that is a half a mile away so that puts about 230 duplex units [TIME] in the immediate area  There are also 30 duplex units directly across FAC0 from this ORG1 property. And we are concerned about a traffic clog right there since there is no traffic light."
09_15_2020,affordable housing,"For this one in particular, I appreciate the concern that  this is not the ideal [STREET] for affordable housing because of the distance and the increased transportation costs. Unfortunately, every time we try and look at affordable options or affordability concerns, closer to town where it would be more appropriate, we run into substantial resistance there as well. And I find myself wondering where is an acceptable [STREET] for affordable housing and will we ever build it?"
09_15_2020,homelessness,"Secondly, most of the reason that I think [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] had wanted to have something like this, if possible,  was prevent homelessness and the problems that people would also have. They had to go to a shelter with too many people there during this [PERSON] virus pandemic that we're in now. But the federal government has at least attempted to prohibit evictions during this pandemic."
09_15_2020,homeless,"Yes, ma'am. And I am speaking on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], coming to show support, not necessarily just for this particular concept, but in general for the idea of continuing to find ways to support not only our residents who are at risk for becoming homeless, but also for our community partners who provide housing, and those are our landlords. I believe both [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] pointed out that the landlords are not getting assistance in order to continue to provide housing, even though our residents may not be losing housing.  still have to be paid."
11_17_2015,homeless,"Number three, resolution to award bid number 15-58 and to authorize the purchase of a prefabricated steel trail bridge from ORG0engineered solutions [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $87,126 plus split taxes for installation on the town branch trail over town branch creek and to approve a project contingency in the amount of $19,124.16.

10_03_2017,homeless,A resolution to authorize the addition of one full-time equivalent position to [ORGANIZATION] to hire a third case manager to provide housing services for homeless federal residents. PERSON0? I move we accept the consent agenda as read.
10_03_2017,affordable housing,"We'll have some other people up to address specifically these concerns that have been brought up. I'd like to speak as a member of the board. As you know, the primary goal of the [ORGANIZATION] is to provide safe, affordable housing to low income families."
10_03_2017,affordable housing,"We have all the construction costs and whatever, but this is about our residents having safe, decent, and affordable housing. And what they have right now is not very safe. I can't say that these lines are going to collapse [ORGANIZATION], but I know since we're having the problems, it's going to happen really soon."
10_03_2017,affordable housing,"I can't do my job to provide fair, safe, decent, affordable housing with the conditions and the financial straits that we're in. Thank you. Okay."
10_03_2017,housing crisis,"And a valid point that was brought up by another person, it's like we're looking at a housing crisis, but yet we're spending – this can help handle that because we're going to have – increased income over time. So that's just what I have to say up front. Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]."
12_18_2018,affordable housing,My name's [ORGANIZATION]. I live at 527 South Sherman. I'm also the vice chair of [ORGANIZATION] and I know that it came to there was some discussion at the work session [ORGANIZATION] that this particular bond can't money can't be used directly for affordable housing
12_18_2018,affordable housing,"One of the ideas perhaps would be to do some sort of long-term lease between the [ORGANIZATION] and the city. I don't speak for the whole commission, obviously. It would have to be approved on our side, but this could be a [STREET] to support the  the mission of public housing indirectly and provide funds indirectly for public housing and affordable housing in the city through this bond even though it can't be done directly."
12_18_2018,homeless,"Yes. Okay, thank you all. Number 14, an ordinance to waive the requirements for competitive bidding and approve contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $108,000 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION]."
12_18_2018,homeless,"PERSON0? Whereas [ORGANIZATION] has operated a daytime facility to serve numerous homeless and needy [ORGANIZATION] residents for over [ORGANIZATION], relying upon the support of several local churches, charities, and charitable persons, as well as some governmental support for veterans, etc.,  And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] City Council approved a funding request for [ORGANIZATION] to maintain the operations of [ORGANIZATION], and although funding for the center by donors has improved, a shortfall still exists that jeopardizes its ability to continue to offer vital services to [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless residents. and whereas if FAC1 could no longer operate as ORG2, currently housed citizens might become homeless again and have to live on the streets or in the woods."
12_18_2018,homeless,"And whereas if [ORGANIZATION] could no longer operate its [DATE] facility, the large number of homeless residents who depend upon this facility for showers and washing, hot food, a warm [STREET] to stay during [DATE], as well as an access to a telephone and other job assistance services could not find such comparable services elsewhere. And whereas the facilities and services provided by [ORGANIZATION] are required to be continued and should continue to be supported by the city in order to prevent our homeless and needy residents from suffering undue hardship and deprivation. Now, therefore, it be ordained by [ORGANIZATION], Section 1, that [ORGANIZATION], hereby determines an exceptional situation exists in which competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical, and therefore waives the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approves a contract between [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Homeless Center in the amount of one hundred and eight thousand dollars for services to homeless and needy GPE2 Residents and authorizes mayor [PERSON] to sign this contract [PERSON] if you remember DATE0 [ORGANIZATION] came forward discussed with the mayor  The issue that they did not have proper funding to keep [DATE]care center open at that point in time, the mayor brought forward to the council and you unanimously agreed to fund the center."
12_18_2018,homeless,Yes.  in order to weigh the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of one hundred and eight thousand dollars for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. we will suspend the rules and go to the third and final reading second that motion we have a motion and second to go to the third and final reading something would you please call the roll  Dutch? Yes.
12_18_2018,homeless,"And the ordinance to waive the requirements of formal competitive bidding and approve a contract with [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $108,000 for services to homeless and needy residents in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, final comments from the council. Other than that, I want to thank the council for doing this."
11_21_2023,housing crisis,"Everybody I've talked to is tired of this. not just the neighbors that have to live next to it, but again, the people that are trying to seek housing. And we have a literal housing crisis."
11_21_2023,affordable housing,"And meanwhile, you know, people can't, their kids can't find a [STREET] to live when they move out of the house and they have to move out of the city. The whole reason I'm here is because [ORGANIZATION] couldn't find affordable housing in Ward 1. At the same time, the chair of [ORGANIZATION] had to move, had to resign and move out of [ORGANIZATION] because she couldn't find affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]."
11_21_2023,housing crisis,"And so that's why we have a sunset clause to give [ORGANIZATION] the discretion and authority To make changes to the short-term rentals that the current operators might not like I echo some of the concerns that were expressed by council member [PERSON] know, I've had a little bit of time on council and absolutely understand. This has been a conversation that's been evolving over [ORGANIZATION], but also to the information and  in regard to our housing crisis and the shortage of available rentals has become much more sharpened and focused for us too when we've gotten concrete numbers from our planning department who's done such a great job in long-range planning of identifying the tremendous gap that we have. And so I think we have to look at all available levers and think about, you know, this is 500 available units, you know, more really with the illegal operating  They're not available housing stocks."
11_21_2023,unhoused,"So when I start to think about where thousands of units behind in available housing and effective 0% available rental, I start to think about, I need to solve that as fast as possible because that's my brother and that's my cousin. It's students that come here that unfortunately end up in an unhoused situation. And I know that all of us don't stand for that, right?"
11_21_2023,affordable housing,"And the university is growing by leaps and bounds and eating up all the affordable housing here. But I think there's an opportunity throughout [ORGANIZATION] to make these amendments, to make these adjustments to the current code. And so I don't feel that...  putting a [LOCATION] limit on there will actually get things moving any faster or put any more pressure on us."
11_21_2023,affordable housing,"So I'm going to support whatever ordinance comes out of this to regulate this more to protect the residents versus the investor class who don't even live here. They aren't the ones who have to deal with not being able to find affordable housing to deal with these bad neighbors, you know, tearing up the streets and running over people's pets and keeping people up at [TIME]. The other thing I would just like to close with before I go is I know"
11_21_2023,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And I would just say short term, like in residential areas, short term rentals are I think like it's an experiment that has not had the greatest results. And there is a reason why cities that are further along in their housing crisis, such as like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], have worked to have tried to pass ordinances banning them outright in residential areas. short-term rentals they take away from the or affordable housing in GPE2 like as someone in my [ORGANIZATION] that is Like whenever like trying to look for an apartment it's usually a [ORGANIZATION] slog to find anything that is affordable for me because of how scarce housing is in this city and and"
11_21_2023,housing crisis,"And here recently, I've heard from a lot of the constituents in FAC0 echoing what [ORGANIZATION] has said and others have said. My question is, what would be the harm in reviewing this in [ORGANIZATION]? I mean, I just want to know is because what I don't want to happen is we are in a housing crisis."
11_21_2023,housing crisis,And I just believe that we have to do we have to utilize absolutely every tool in the toolbox. And I believe that I just would like to know what would be the harm in revisiting this in [ORGANIZATION]? Yeah.  to show the citizens that we are hearing them and that we are concerned and that we're doing and that we understand the challenges that come with the housing crisis.
11_21_2023,housing crisis,"And so I do want them to have an opportunity to be involved and to be engaged and especially those individuals who are impacted by the housing crisis. I really want them to understand this process and be able to weigh in. And hopefully that's everyone else's concern, but I do know that Ward 1 is really being impacted, and that is my responsibility [TIME]."
11_21_2023,housing crisis,And we are in a housing crisis. Can I ask how many times did the ordinance committee meet [ORGANIZATION]? I lost track.
11_21_2023,housing crisis,"BUT, YEAH, I J[LOCATION]T WANT [LOCATION] TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS. AGAIN, WE ARE, YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU SAY IT LONG ENOUGH AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE HO[LOCATION]ING CRISIS, HO[LOCATION]ING CRISIS. NO, WE SERIO[LOCATION]LY ARE."
11_21_2023,affordable housing,"So I feel like if we're talking about affordable housing, the ordinance as is is more protective  of that because we do have an enforcement mechanism to shut down illegal type twos. Okay, this is an ordinance. It's on the first reading."
11_21_2023,unhoused,"I'd like to stop doing that. We'd have that money back. And what if we're able to shave down having to spend $300,000 on trash because individuals are unhoused in our community and shave it down even by $50,000 to contribute to some of these things?  I want to just put that out there as just a conversation starter about all the incredible opportunities I think are out there."
11_12_2024,housing crisis,"Y'all are going to hear the same thing from me over and over, and I don't know everything about rezoning, but I would like to encourage you to vote for this. Anytime we have higher density living areas, we really need to go with it. I would like to remind everybody of the plan that says that we need 1,500 units a year, and we know from research that to get ahead of this housing crisis, we need to produce more than that."
12_19_2023,homeless,"[DATE], a resolution to authorize Mayor [PERSON] to sign  Subrecipient agreements with [ORGANIZATION] and its partner agencies pursuant to a resolution number 233-23 and RFP 23-12 any amount of 1 million six hundred thousand dollars for a project to address housing instability and federal number 12 a resolution authorized acceptance of a 20  23, [ORGANIZATION], any amount of $9,000 for a pilot curbside food waste collection program and to approve budget adjustment. 13. A resolution to approve a budget adjustment in the amount of $40,957 representing donation revenue to [ORGANIZATION]."
09_20_2016,affordable housing,"He's really given us, he's basically limited it to a lot of what it was previously designed to handle but then basically made some accommodations to deliver some accessory dwelling units on non-owner occupied areas. lot so i think this is going to help give us some appropriate infill in that area as well as provide some affordable housing options in terms of flexibility and size and scale so i support this a hundred percent"
09_15_2015,homeless,"yes okay all right let's go on the new business  Number one, a resolution to approve special needs assistance program grant agreements with [ORGANIZATION] in the total amount of $414,161 for the city to administer programs to assist homeless federal residents. PERSON0, I believe you have this."
09_15_2015,homeless,And so they would be assisting homeless residents of [ORGANIZATION] to actually have housing. And so this would cycle through different individuals to help them get back on their feet. Do you have any questions?
09_15_2015,homeless,"One of the grants actually will help individuals with tenant-based rental assistance, so that will be assisting them with their rental payments, and that would be for homeless individuals. Then our second grant, which makes up the total, is for leasing and payment of leasing for individuals that are homeless and disabled. And then we have a third grant which basically would help, of course, with the whole leasing component, and this would be units throughout the city working with landlords to provide homes for the homeless, and this would be for the chronically homeless and disabled."
09_15_2015,homeless,"How do, if I were a homeless person, or if I had a friend that was a homeless person who wanted to avail himself or herself of this money, how would they go about doing that? Well, we would work with them. We'd have to have a case worker to determine what their status is, what their needs are, and then of course to qualify them as homeless individuals and meet the criteria."
09_15_2015,homeless,"And at that point we would have to go out. And I think there are already some individuals, this was a program that had already started,  so there are individuals that are already working with the non-profit and so we would continue those relationships and then we would try and get the homeless folks that need help and they would cycle through the program"
09_15_2015,homeless,"Okay. Mayor, I would just like to say that I'm very happy that we as a city can take over this particular grant and administer it so that we can help the homeless people of our city. The nonprofit that started it cannot complete it, but I'm delighted that we can step in and take over."
09_06_2022,homeless,"There's zero available. I asked for him to look at rapid rehousing, which is people that are actually homeless. zero available in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_06_2022,housing crisis; unhoused,"But that based on social science and public policy that we understand that housing is  first is the most impactful priority for budget funding and That keeping people housed as this more was saying is [STREET] less expensive than trying to get people back in housing  Additionally, I would like to just reflect on the fact that [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] had a joint meeting [ORGANIZATION] on housing security and our housing crisis after we lost two of our community members who perished due to inclement weather and being unhoused in [LOCATION]. So we have policy frameworks in which we work in. And then we have this opportunity through the CDBG-CV, the COVID CARES Act dollars, which is not funding that we will get back."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"You know, what are the measurements of that success, right? Clean water is important, affordable housing. We have a lot of incredible goals that go behind us on the board."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"I've talked to over 3,000 households in affordable housing, water encroachment, folks being able to unafford basic life necessities. There are a lot of struggles within our community that our budget process and how we spend their taxpayer dollars are so important to address. And so I really want to say, you know, who defines what really goes into our budget?"
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"I mean, affordable housing, we say, is incredibly important. But so far, you know, that's not something that I think has a line item in our budget. Improving overall well-being, inequalities, and plans to close those gaps, I know those are important as well."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"There's also a concern expressed about the potential for destabilization of the neighborhood, having more transitory home occupants rather than permanent residents. uh they these planning commission concerns a lot concerns aligned quite a bit with the public comment heard at that meeting [ORGANIZATION] also had a little bit of a sneak peek at those comments during your recent short-term rental ordinance conversation several members of that neighborhood came before [ORGANIZATION] and spoke in broad terms about the ordinance but also more specifically about their concerns for their neighborhood  of which one is that this area was deliberately rezoned by [PERSON] as part of a neighbor-initiated rezoning effort that downzoned the neighborhood to hopefully protect what they see as its character and a lot of the naturally occurring affordable housing in that area. All that said, I'm available to take any questions."
11_15_2022,homeless,"We have a homeless problem there. Now it's like we're moving the transiency right into our neighborhood, right into these houses. My wife was here."
11_15_2022,homeless,"We know the names of the dogs and most of the cats. Guests and visitors comment on how calming and peaceful it is to visit here. We pick up trash, we aid the homeless in times of their need, in bad weather or flooding."
11_15_2022,homeless,"But our full intention is to use it and to respect what the community has. I mean, who doesn't want a neighborhood like that that cares, right? They're talking about the homeless population."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"And so my great concern here is that once we start one in that little wonderful modest affordable housing neighborhood,  I could see the whole thing just becoming Airbnb'd out. Now we know because we're talking about the caps and everything that that's probably not gonna be possible, but I'm just concerned for that situation from the perspective of stock of modest housing in [ORGANIZATION] and then how easy it is to get to the games and all of the things that we know that people come to [ORGANIZATION] to enjoy."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"And so I just want to thank you for going through the process and being, you know, visible and having the conversation with the neighbors. But I have grave concern because we are running out of affordable housing stock and this is such a wonderfully modern neighborhood. So we just approved a hotel."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"You know, whatever reasons, they had health issues that had to be dealt with, someone had to take a job somewhere else, they'd love to hang onto this house and they probably sat down at their dining room table and talked it out.  and figured how they could all, well, we could come up here and visit, and we could do this, and we could keep the house, but we could maybe Airbnb it and help pay the mortgage a little bit. So I fully appreciate that as well. I'm not really decided on how I'm going to vote on this yet because I think there's, you know, just because if this family doesn't own this house, it doesn't immediately become affordable housing."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"And they could rent it to someone for, one woman said, we want families, we want people to come here and live and own houses, well, they might rent it to someone who would live  The gentleman that said they had people that lived in their rent house for [ORGANIZATION], but they might not own the house. So there's a lot of things being said that I'm not really in agreement with. And one is that if we automatically do away with the [ORGANIZATION], we're going to have affordable housing."
11_15_2022,affordable housing,"And by allowing a lot of rentals and a lot of higher density, that was a tight-knit neighborhood. And it no longer is the neighborhood that it was. And there's not much affordable housing left over there."
11_15_2022,homelessness,"But one area that we have the most demand for that we cannot meet is our emergency shelter capacity. Currently, we have 14 rooms with 14 bathrooms.  that can be utilized by survivors for emergency short-term safe housing when they flee abuse and are looking to find safety before they can move on to new housing in the community or with friends or family members. Safe housing is important for survivors of domestic violence because homelessness and domestic violence are highly linked."
11_15_2022,homelessness,The leading cause of homelessness for women in [ORGANIZATION] is domestic violence and because of the unique dangers that domestic violence poses for survivors. Homicide rates increase dramatically after a relationship has ended and we know that  These relationships can turn deadly. They can be very physically violent.
09_01_2015,affordable housing,"But then there's also the economic impact of this, and as we try to encourage infill development in our downtown area, if you think about the cost of building a structured parking deck in a parking garage, it runs between 20 to $40,000 a space. And when you're talking about affordable retail space, affordable housing space, you know, affordable business space, that is a huge barrier to creating that type of affordability that we need to see our city thrive. So I think that it's in the best economic interest, it's in the best urban planning interest to go ahead and remove these parking minimums."
11_21_2017,affordable housing,"okay who else has questions [ORGANIZATION] thank you um mr [PERSON] can you tell us i know you serve on [ORGANIZATION] what is your proudest accomplishment on that board that comes day to day just helping people get into housing affordable housing it's no secret that some of the facilities we have are not up to par and we are constantly working to improve those even with dwindling budgets coming down from the federal level  I have many people who I consider friends who are actually residents of ours. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than them just saying thank you, which I do get quite often for even just little things. So I understand where they come from, and it makes me very happy to help them out in any [STREET] that I can."
11_19_2019,homeless,"This is a good one for at animal services from [ORGANIZATION] When adopters bring in a new unwrapped toy for a child They will have the adoption fee waived for any available dog or cat To encourage people to embrace the holiday spirit and help people be engaged in adopting the homeless pets and then finally a  We have put up on the main website page, there's a red button that says please help us evaluate our website. That'll be online for quite some time, but it takes you to a very small survey that allows you to provide input to us as we look at a redesign of that website. We do a redesign DATE1, so this will help us with the redesign coming up."
07_19_2022,homeless,"So this is not just about protecting animals. It's about protecting consumers. Yet this ordinance would not prevent pet stores from doing business if they utilize a humane, business-friendly model that generates profit through sales of supplies and services, as thousands of successful pet stores across the country are currently doing, and ideally partnering with shelters and rescue groups to offer homeless pets for adoption."
11_16_2021,homeless,"There are a lot of organizations that deal with the cost. the challenged community. You know, we just finished kind of a new [INSTITUTION] and you know, where is $50,[ADDRESS]?"
11_16_2021,affordable housing,"You know, when it was last updated, you know, you're looking at industrial or nature use for this particular property. And when that decision was made, no one really anticipated that we were having a global pandemic and resulting serious shortages of building materials.  nor that we're going to have the kind of severe lack of affordable housing in your city. So you know the proposed development that the applicant is putting forward does address a lot of the nature and that's something he can certainly address better than I."
11_16_2021,affordable housing,"I've got about [ADDRESS] I defined that was three bedroom two bath a house a townhouse or a condominium the square footage [DATE] square feet and the price point was $275,000 or less and in the entire city of [PERSON] you have eight active listings and  You have 4,000 realtors in northwest [ORGANIZATION] and they have eight houses that they can possibly sell right now."
11_16_2021,affordable housing,"The highest was 295. So they build affordable housing. And I really think that from a fiduciary perspective, your city has a distinct lack of affordable housing."
11_16_2021,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION] has long prided itself in being a diverse community, but without affordable housing, diversity will suffer. This project can be part of the solution to housing workforce households. A planned development like the one in front of the council [TIME], in addition to annexation, is a good beginning and fits well into [ORGANIZATION]'s DATE0 vision of affordable housing."
08_03_2021,housing crisis,"I remember that downtown master plan and thinking, boy, this is great, [ORGANIZATION]. And I tend to agree that it would need to be updated. There's a housing crisis."
12_15_2020,affordable housing,"And when I think of [ORGANIZATION]'s many contributions to this city, a few things really stand out in my mind. her work on [ORGANIZATION], the FAC0 project, FAC1, our LGBTQ civil rights ordinance, the [ORGANIZATION] bond projects, food security and urban agriculture, and her advocacy for affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION]'s work on these projects  and many more over [LOCATION] have strengthened [ORGANIZATION] and helped to make the entire city a great [STREET] to live and work."
12_15_2020,affordable housing,"In [ORGANIZATION], he's made a big impact in several areas. improving public participation and engagement in city government, bringing a focus on land planning, supporting the DATE1 bond projects, advocating for affordable housing and thoughtful growth on the west side of town, and helping secure and preserve public green space through FAC0 and FAC1. [ORGANIZATION]'s work on these issues and many more have helped shape the future of [ORGANIZATION] and the entire city."
12_15_2020,homeless,"We also have folks that are homeless because they're struggling with addiction. So we have neighboring areas like [ORGANIZATION] that have homeless liaisons. It would be great to see these funds potentially, again, pouring back into our community to try to uplift individuals."
10_20_2020,affordable housing,"You know, I think the bulk of this [STREET] has recently been rezoned to RSF [DATE], which is what I'm asking for. Originally, when I attempted to rezone this property, [ORGANIZATION], I know that there was some public opposition towards that, but I don't believe there's been any opposition to RSF [DATE]. I think that this is in line with the city's objective to  create affordable housing and urban infill."
10_20_2020,affordable housing,"[ORGANIZATION], I wanted to ask you if you would explain  Briefly, I know you covered a lot of ground before, but what are the top reasons the planning staff is recommending we uphold the [ORGANIZATION]? We, just from a policy standpoint, it brings a lot to the table in terms of the comprehensive plan housing, affordable housing, mixed use  But we also looked at the specific reasons for appeal and we feel that this application addresses all those reasons that are already addressed. I might add another fact which is that the application  This, the cluster housing is subject to all our storm drainage requirements, which means total retentions of increased flow as well as water quality."
10_20_2020,housing crisis,We already have a housing crisis in this community and a critical shortage of smaller homes. I'm not sure where the assertion is that these are not family homes. I see all of them have three bedrooms.
12_17_2024,housing crisis,"And maybe even better solutions, maybe implementing some of the recommendations from our [ORGANIZATION]. okay [ORGANIZATION] did you have something yes uh thank you council member [PERSON] because that is what i was thinking i think that um don't want to rush this especially with the potential of legal issues"
12_17_2024,housing crisis,"But this is not the only policy that our city can look at. Our city's [ORGANIZATION] has already brought forward a number of measures before you. And these are measures that can help people with security and utility deposits, help with educating landlords about the existing programs and services that they can participate for themselves and for their tenants."
12_17_2024,housing crisis,"So don't let these proposals collect dust in the meantime, where we're waiting on more answers about this application fee ordinance and pass the recommendations of the task force that residents of [ORGANIZATION] worked so hard to create to assist you in making housing more attainable for people. And I would just like to conclude with a message to renters watching that we will continue to explore options to help you and work to address our city's housing crisis. Thank you for not killing this [TIME]."
12_17_2024,homeless,I'm a business owner and a renter I love living downtown But maybe you guys have heard where I'm gonna where I live just got sold for 13 million dollars for student condo development So I'm effectively going to be homeless within [ORGANIZATION].
12_17_2024,homeless; housing crisis,"um but people are suffering people are homeless and people are living paycheck to paycheck people don't have fifty dollars to put down because they barely have enough for rent and for the deposit which is another rent payment So this city has to start doing something and to take housing seriously because rents are skyrocketing. And as you know, I know some people on the board have been anti-housing crisis, and we know who you are."
12_17_2024,housing crisis,"But again, we are now in a housing crisis. So we have to start taking this seriously because what we're doing now is not enough. It's not enough."
12_17_2024,homeless,"Number one, approval of the [ORGANIZATION] ORG0 meeting minutes. Number two, a resolution to commit ORG1 funds in the amount of $23,719.80 to ORG2. and to approve a budget adjustment."
12_17_2024,housing crisis; affordable housing,"And that escrow account is creating a lot of unhappiness in that home. The housing crisis really focuses on what we're going to do, what we're going to build, where we're going to put it. But I want to argue that the focus of affordable housing should be on preserving it."
