Met a couple from Oklahoma that chose the ""lifestyle "". They walked and hitch hiked here, because they heard it is ""a good place to be homeless "". I am an advocate for helping those in need and the homeless, but I don't think this issue will be successfully addressed without acknowledging that a subset of these folks will not change even when given the opportunity. The life that seems unlivable to the average person is normal to them and for some a willful choice. Some of the kids and the newly displaced seem the most accepting of assistance and want to escape homelessness. Addressing homelessness needs to start with understanding there are two homeless populations. The truly displaced and those that chose to be where they are.",32,2023-01-30 12:47:17 UTC

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in October I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from Dickson Street to Kessler. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

36.07994° N, 94.16916° W

I have been there before and it looked like an entire city of homeless, yet that was years ago and may be cleared up. I am glad this is getting attention. If I think of more examples I will add to this post",12,2023-01-30 06:12:33 UTC

Alternatively, peg minimum wage to rent rates in the region.

I've helped with it several times in the past. 

There's always a ton of anecdotes about how many people somebody knows that are ""choosing"" to be homeless and how common it is, but the numbers don't lie... The *vast* majority of homeless people are not willingly homeless. And most of the unwilling share a similar story: mental health issues, medical debt, or a lost job. Couple any one of those with a lack of decent safety net programs in this country, and bam, homeless.

If you really want to help individuals but are worried how they would spend cash, buy $10 gift cards to restaurants or Walmart and keep them in your glove box for when you see someone. Otherwise, donate to folks like 7Hills or Peace at Home.. the money will go a lot farther.",6,2023-01-30 15:42:15 UTC

I have also seen that according to some homeless forums online, NWA is a “good place to be homeless”, and even going so far as to advise putting “God bless” on their signs for better success.

I’ve lived here for 30 years and while we’ve always had homeless, it’s really kicked up in the past decade or so. People in general are still relatively sympathetic but nowadays I can’t even go 15 minutes across town to Walmart without seeing at least two cardboard signs out. Even Arkansan generosity has its limits, and if word got out that any of them were choosing to be beggars, what sympathy is left will quickly dissipate.

And it puts us in a rough position because either we enact sensible homeless laws and programs designed to actually help them get back on their feet, or we become like bigger cities and start putting spikes under bridges and shit.

When the subject of our larger than normal homeless come up in normal conversation I’d say most people do not understand the population as a whole. Who they are, their make up, the multiple reasons, where they camp and live, or maybe they’re just invisible to their eyes. 

I find myself getting irritated by those who I suspect of doing as a choice. I think if the “nomad” life is the life you want to live you need to do it within the legal boundaries of society and don’t take from the resources meant for those truly in need, and I mean all the way down to even collecting resources at a street corner. Washington Co has more homeless children than any other county in Arkansas. There are a lot of people truly in need that are not getting what they need to get out of said situation because the resources get snatched up by those who really aren’t in a desperate situation. 

The city of Fayetteville does a good job providing some assistance but they can only do so much with the funds they have. We need so much more and it’s going to take quality studies to get the data on the record to secure funding, because it’s not just a Fayetteville problem, it’s a NWA problem. Municipal infrastructure to help those who need a hand up is much like all infrastructure in that the government doesn’t get the funds until first it gets the population.

They pick them up off the street and bring them in, want to pay the first 3 months of their apartment rent AND put the deposit down, great right.  Wrong.  


Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a place of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

Not to say that taxation isn’t an appropriate method in many cases, but the issue isn’t that the county doesn’t have enough to operate. 

The problem is that the correct remedy for bringing down housing costs hasn’t been implemented.

Many people in Fayetteville are fighting tooth and nail to be able to pay rent, and have basic necessities and have next to no leftover income to deal with financial emergencies. People are quite literally one or two unforeseen circumstances away from food insecurity or being forced to incur late fees or running out of gas, etc. They do not have the luxury of holding rental properties and could not even dream of putting two kids through college as you say. While you may not feel particularly greedy, from the perspective of those much less fortunate than you, it is difficult to see it any other way.

Addendum: From what little I do know about the national housing crisis, this whole “the few own the properties of the many” aka rental/ leasing housing economy we’ve built is a BIG part of the problem. The writing on the walls is that fewer and fewer people will ever be able to own the spaces that they live in. I don’t mean to call you out specifically. I can only take you at your word that you’re trying to be a good landlord, but the truth is that the only real long term solution to the housing crises, as I see it, is to move to give residencies back to the people.

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. Highway 71 improvement project that's underway or our Tier Growth Centers in our City Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in New York? Triple-deckers in Boston? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from Euclidean zoning to form-based zoning. Bentonville and Rogers are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If Fayetteville chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. The Walton Family Foundation is offering cities in NWA a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the City has not taken them up on it. 
* City councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that Fayetteville **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it. 

Really curious what's going to come out of this. Also, it's interesting that Mike will be up for re-election this November.",15,2024-03-21 15:28:16 UTC
High Rent and FOIA'd Fayetteville Government Emails from Mike Wiederkehr,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/fayetteville/comments/1bjn7mb/high_rent_and_foiad_fayetteville_government/,2024-03-20 20:17:11 UTC,"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most. Mike Wiederkehr's motivation for his own resolution seem to be focused on his own insecurities and pride more than that of the people's voices (that personal letter, wow), and I find that unacceptable as a representative of us citizens.

Mike's thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”  
  
– Council Member Mike Wiederkehr, on Page 1 of the Note, speaking about the Housing Crisis Resolution written by voters

So his response was to propose his own, one key difference being that his does not declare a housing crisis, but it does give himself pats on the back.

>Council Member Wiederkehr’s counter-resolution does not declare a Housing Crisis and does not call on the city to try new things. The FOIA documents show Wiederkher purposely leaving some council members out of the process of seeking co-sponsors. They also show him purposely asking the City Attorney’s office to **hold off sending out his resolution to non-sponsors until the last possible moment** before the agenda session, **leaving them in the dark** until hours before the meeting on purpose. That’s his right, but neither of these things seems very inclusive or consensus-building. -Evelyn Rios Stafford",5,2024-03-21 16:39:02 UTC

I'm not a person who believes the Waltons are 100% good, but they do work at addressing problems like affordable housing in tangible ways that many other organizations don't have the ability or finances to do.

The smart way to view the Waltons is a resource that can be directed towards what the city needs.  Engage with them about potential development that will help address housing affordability, for example.  Springdale is kicking our butt in that regard right now.  

The prevailing sentiment in Fayetteville seems to be to not want the Waltons involved in anything at all, because they are ""evil"" in some way.

It comes off as hillbilly suspicion and clannish-ness more than any righteous cause.  ""We dont need no rich folk here messin up the order of thangs here in our poor little holler!""",-4,2023-11-11 17:31:40 UTC

The reality is, City of Fayetteville and residents DO NOT WANT massive chain retail or restaurants. We thrive  in spite of Rogers being the hot spot for those. 

Affordable housing, yes. This is much needed and I know several city council members have been advocating for this for a while, and because of that there are plans of more affordable condos around the Archibald Yell area.

Fayetteville will be hesitant on 15-20 story buildings. You have to remember we are a big town, not a city, and people want it to remain that way.
