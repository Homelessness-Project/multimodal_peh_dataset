Met a couple from [ORGANIZATION] that chose the ""lifestyle "". They walked and hitch hiked here, because they heard it is ""a good [STREET] to be homeless "". I am an advocate for helping those in need and the homeless, but I don't think this issue will be successfully addressed without acknowledging that a subset of these folks will not change even when given the opportunity. The life that seems unlivable to the average person is normal to them and for some a willful choice. Some of the kids and the newly displaced seem the most accepting of assistance and want to escape homelessness. Addressing homelessness needs to start with understanding there are two homeless populations. The truly displaced and those that chose to be where they are.","homeless, homelessness"

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in [DATE] I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from FAC0 to FAC1. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

36.[ZIP]° N, 94.[ZIP]° W

I have been there before and it looked like an entire city of homeless, yet that was [ORGANIZATION] and may be cleared up. I am glad this is getting attention. If I think of more examples I will add to this post",homeless

There's always a ton of anecdotes about how many people somebody knows that are ""choosing"" to be homeless and how common it is, but the numbers don't lie... The *vast* majority of homeless people are not willingly homeless. And most of the unwilling share a similar story: mental health issues, medical debt, or a lost job. Couple any one of those with a lack of decent safety net programs in this country, and bam, homeless.

If you really want to help individuals but are worried how they would spend cash, buy $10 gift cards to restaurants or [ORGANIZATION] and keep them in your glove box for when you see someone. Otherwise, donate to folks like ORG1 or ORG2.. the money will go a lot farther.",homeless
49,2023-01-30 02:30:55 UTC,7,2023-01-30 14:35:13 UTC,Efforts underway to examine number of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION],"This.

I have also seen that according to some homeless forums online, [ORGANIZATION] is a “good [STREET] to be homeless”, and even going so far as to advise putting “God bless” on their signs for better success.

I’ve lived here for [ORGANIZATION] and while we’ve always had homeless, it’s really kicked up in [LOCATION] or so. People in general are still relatively sympathetic but nowadays I can’t even go [TIME] across town to ORG1 without seeing at least two cardboard signs out. Even [PERSON] generosity has its limits, and if word got out that any of them were choosing to be beggars, what sympathy is left will quickly dissipate.

And it puts us in a rough position because either we enact sensible homeless laws and programs designed to actually help them get back on their feet, or we become like bigger cities and start putting spikes under bridges and shit. I’ll let you guess which outcome is more likely in a deep red state.","homeless, beggar"
49,2023-01-30 02:30:55 UTC,2,2023-02-01 12:02:12 UTC,Efforts underway to examine number of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION],"You’re right. When the subject of our larger than normal homeless come up in normal conversation I’d say most people do not understand the population as a whole. Who they are, their make up, the multiple reasons, where they camp and live, or maybe they’re just invisible to their eyes. 

I find myself getting irritated by those who I suspect of doing as a choice. I think if the “nomad” life is the life you want to live you need to do it within the legal boundaries of society and don’t take from the resources meant for those truly in need, and I mean all the [STREET] down to even collecting resources at a [STREET] corner. [ORGANIZATION] has more homeless children than any other county in [ORGANIZATION]. There are a lot of people truly in need that are not getting what they need to get out of said situation because the resources get snatched up by those who really aren’t in a desperate situation. 

The city of [ORGANIZATION] does a good job providing some assistance but they can only do so much with the funds they have. We need so much more and it’s going to take quality studies to get the data on the record to secure funding, because it’s not just a [ORGANIZATION] problem, it’s a ORG1 problem. Municipal infrastructure to help those who need a hand up is much like all infrastructure in that the government doesn’t get the funds until first it gets the population.

I don’t have answers, but I wish people had a better understanding of the situation.",homeless

Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a [STREET] of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

[ORGANIZATION] will be hesitant on 15-20 story buildings. You have to remember we are a big town, not a city, and people want it to remain that [STREET]. I would love a more affordable, walkable town, but I also love my yard, dogs, and patio with a tv and smoker I get to use [ORGANIZATION].",affordable housing

[ORGANIZATION] already has a mall and chain restaurants.  We need to keep foot traffic at good levels in our current establishments.  I am focused upon affordable housing in the [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and [PERSON] corridor so those citizens are more likely to shop and eat in [ORGANIZATION].

What I said was the [ORGANIZATION] campus needs to build 15-20 story [ORGANIZATION] with parking decks in the base to create dorm rooms with appropriate parking.  THe campus doesn't have enough land for surface parking lots.   We need dense student dorms on campus which could create great pedestrian traffic close to GPE2.",affordable housing

Affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] is just going to look for the cheapest land which is not a desirable area but it will provide marginal housing.

Maybe west of downtown towards FAC0, but in my neighborhood houses are priced at around $220 a foot which are [PERSON] prices. Not to mention my RE taxes went up 11% DATE0.

Not trying to being a jerk or anything by my response or anything. I just probably probably wouldn’t look at [ORGANIZATION] for “affordable” depending on where [ORGANIZATION] is coming from.",affordable housing
