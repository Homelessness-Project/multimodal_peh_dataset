Met a couple from Oklahoma that chose the ""lifestyle "". They walked and hitch hiked here, because they heard it is ""a good place to be homeless "". I am an advocate for helping those in need and the homeless, but I don't think this issue will be successfully addressed without acknowledging that a subset of these folks will not change even when given the opportunity. The life that seems unlivable to the average person is normal to them and for some a willful choice. Some of the kids and the newly displaced seem the most accepting of assistance and want to escape homelessness.

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in October I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from Dickson Street to Kessler. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

36.07994° N, 94.16916° W

I have been there before and it looked like an entire city of homeless, yet that was years ago and may be cleared up. I am glad this is getting attention. If I think of more examples I will add to this post",12,2023-01-30 06:12:33 UTC

Alternatively, peg minimum wage to rent rates in the region.

There's always a ton of anecdotes about how many people somebody knows that are ""choosing"" to be homeless and how common it is, but the numbers don't lie... The *vast* majority of homeless people are not willingly homeless. And most of the unwilling share a similar story: mental health issues, medical debt, or a lost job. Couple any one of those with a lack of decent safety net programs in this country, and bam, homeless.

If you really want to help individuals but are worried how they would spend cash, buy $10 gift cards to restaurants or Walmart and keep them in your glove box for when you see someone.

I have also seen that according to some homeless forums online, NWA is a “good place to be homeless”, and even going so far as to advise putting “God bless” on their signs for better success.

I’ve lived here for 30 years and while we’ve always had homeless, it’s really kicked up in the past decade or so. People in general are still relatively sympathetic but nowadays I can’t even go 15 minutes across town to Walmart without seeing at least two cardboard signs out. Even Arkansan generosity has its limits, and if word got out that any of them were choosing to be beggars, what sympathy is left will quickly dissipate.

And it puts us in a rough position because either we enact sensible homeless laws and programs designed to actually help them get back on their feet, or we become like bigger cities and start putting spikes under bridges and shit.

When the subject of our larger than normal homeless come up in normal conversation I’d say most people do not understand the population as a whole. Who they are, their make up, the multiple reasons, where they camp and live, or maybe they’re just invisible to their eyes. 

I find myself getting irritated by those who I suspect of doing as a choice. I think if the “nomad” life is the life you want to live you need to do it within the legal boundaries of society and don’t take from the resources meant for those truly in need, and I mean all the way down to even collecting resources at a street corner. Washington Co has more homeless children than any other county in Arkansas. There are a lot of people truly in need that are not getting what they need to get out of said situation because the resources get snatched up by those who really aren’t in a desperate situation. 

The city of Fayetteville does a good job providing some assistance but they can only do so much with the funds they have. We need so much more and it’s going to take quality studies to get the data on the record to secure funding, because it’s not just a Fayetteville problem, it’s a NWA problem. Municipal infrastructure to help those who need a hand up is much like all infrastructure in that the government doesn’t get the funds until first it gets the population.

The city attorney explained that Fayetteville removed most regulations on panhandling in 2016 after the supreme court decision. Not long after, other cities were sued for regulations they kept in place for panhandling.

Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a place of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

A little silly in his responses, but he had bits of legitimately profound policy ideas. I think he broadcasts a message he wants the other candidates to hear.

Lioneld - I see him as a vessel for the people. He leans on his staff (which I think is good) instead of ruling. He understands he's not an expert in everything, but he has a strong moral compass. I love the direction he's steered the city so far. The green corridor, the trail system, the response to covid, the 71b plan, the pre-approved building plans, the climate action plan, etc. Those were all from his tenure.

Molly - I see her as the neoliberal candidate. I like her social opinions and her know-how on funding sources. I don't like her willingness to cave to developers making mistakes or support for an overhauled UDC. I'm trepidatious on supporting her. I don't want Fayetteville to be a tourist center, and I don't want us loosening restrictions on development (there's nuance to that last part. Ie. I agree that we should change building height restrictions in certain cases.)

Tom - I've never listened to him until now. His regional ideas hold some merit. We need to be thinking about regional stormwater issues, aging infrastructure, etc. However, opening the doors to development isn't the way. The more we build out, the more infrastructure gets ""donated"" to the city. If you look at the cost per lane-mile of roadway and public utilities, it vastly exceeds what single-family residences pay. Further, development is ""expensive"" in Fayetteville because we require more of developers. We require water quality measures, stormwater detention, sidewalk and roadway improvements, grading and building permits, etc. Those items take time and money to engineer and construct, but I percieve doing away with them as subsidizing developers by removing necessities and shifting the burden onto the residents. (Think, if we allow pollution to run to the creeks, who gets hurt? If we don't require runoff detention, who's house gets flooded due to the added impervious area?)",6,2024-09-06 17:54:49 UTC

The trail system.   Planning for this started in the 1990s and the first segments were completed in the early 2000s.

2.  The 71B Corridor plan. The first segment of this was from Rock to North Street.  This was approved prior to lioneld becoming mayor.   

3.  The pre-approved building plans:   this was the brain child of Matthew Petty, an open supporter of Mayor Dan Coody, both times he ran against Lioneld. 
Most of the above initiatives actually slowed down under Lioneld.  

The fact about Lioneld is the he doesn't spur ANY new ideas or initiatives.   He's there for the ribbon cuttings and Farmers Markets.  Most everything progressive about Fayetteville development the past 15 years had nothing to do with him.   I've watched him decline to support form based zoning.   I've watched him refuse to pursue meaningful grants that could have had a real impact on housing affordability.   I know for a FACT that he has (or at least had)  a standing bi- monthly meeting with Rausch Coleman Homes, one of the big developers cashing in on Fayetteville's growth while taking every shortcut known to man. 

I'm happy to listen if you have an example of something meaningful Lioneld has brought forward that has helped this city.   He once brought a proposal to sell the West Ave parking lot to a developer for the value of ONE YEAR of parking space revenue,  and actually presented it to the city council!   It was jaw droppingly foolish to anyone with any understanding of real estate and development.

The issues local government deals with are nuts-and-bolts things that shape communities we all live in regardless of party. Pot holes don't care about your party.

But, since you're curious and get to make decisions on whatever basis you like, and since no one else wants to spill the beans, I'll offer this from the public voter records I have from 2020:

Molly is a registered Democrat, and she cast ballots in the Democratic primaries in 2012, 2014, and 2016.

Lioneld Jordan is registered Optional, and he cast ballots in the Democratic primaries in 2012, 2014, and 2016.

Tom Terminella is registered Optional, and he cast ballots in the Republican Primaries in 2014 and 2016. He did not vote in the 2012 primary.

Adam Fire Cat is registered Optional, and his voter record looks like he has never voted in a primary election for either party. He consistently votes in special elections, general elections, and run-offs, however.

""Optional"" simply means that the person did not choose a party when they registered. It is not required in Arkansas and 87% of registered voters in Fayetteville were ""Optional"" at the time of my latest set of voter records (before the 2020 general election).",10,2024-09-06 22:51:56 UTC

Her comment on sidewalks is kind of like how our city currently does park land dedication. Developers can opt to pay fee in lieu of building the thing and the City can go in and build it themselves, often how they want it. It's supposed to reach the same end product but speed things up for the developer. I wouldn't be opposed to having a fee-in-lieu for sidewalks because our City has an experienced in-house sidewalk crew and there lots of good contractors that can be utilized. As long as the work gets done.~~

~~I do think the fee-in-lieu model has been bad for parks, though, because those funds have to be used to buy land instead of build parks. That's where I'm a big fan of her referencing Rogers comprehensive growth plan, because it requires developers to build a park when the build residential developments of a certain size - no fee-in-lieu allowed.~~

Molly wasn't suggesting fees in lieu of building sidewalks. She was suggesting collecting a fee for constructed sidewalks that don't pass inspection.

The current practice is to require the builder to pour the sidewalk, then send out an inspector. If a section doesn't meet some pretty exacting standards (being 1 degree off the target cross-slope, for example), they are required to tear it out and repour it. Some local developers (not greedy corporate types, but folks who build quality homes on tight margins and keep the small profits here in our city) have had to redo particular sidewalks 2, 3 or 4 times.

That means literal tons of concrete in the landfill, wasted emissions on equipment and replacement cement, weeks of project delay, and thousands of dollars that get added back into the price of the home. All while we have existing sidewalks everywhere in the city that are all sorts of wonky from tree roots or soil settling. The annual sidewalk budget does a couple thousand feet of improvements a year - that's it. They can't currently afford to repair the ones that are really bad, but a builder can't pour a perfectly usable one if it's off by just a hair. 

Molly's suggestion was to collect a penalty fee for sidewalks that fall out of spec but within a usable range, and to use that money to fund additional higher priority improvements that have serious mobility impacts.

With ADA restrictions, I'm not sure whether it's legally an option - it may well be; I just haven't looked - but it is certainly a creative idea for prioritizing our limited resources and doing the most good. Not a hand-out to developers.",7,2024-09-06 23:08:30 UTC

I understand the 71b proposal is limited in height. I'm talking specifically about the mayoral forum and this answer. It seems like at least some chamber members and at least the Mayor are in favor of very very tall buildings.

Separately, I am not necessarily opposed to very tall buildings. In fact, I'd like to see a few. However, it seems to me there are limits to your claim about taller buildings being allowed being cheaper. I'm not here to make some kind of truther argument about height limits.

I suspect there is some optimum height limit for pressure relief that should be monitored and adjusted over time to balance speculative dynamics and achieve maximum viable infill outcomes.

It's a pretty safe, family-friendly neighborhood. Her husband is a police officer (so is she, technically, though it's not her full time job anymore) and works for the fire department as well.

It's far away from downtown to be quiet (baby friendly), but also close enough to everything that it's a short drive to EVERYWHERE.

The residential areas don’t have sidewalks but the roads and slow and quiet so my husband and I feel comfortable walking along the curb and will do the same when we have a baby this summer. We live across the street from the library park which has a nice playground and a soft walking track which is nice too. 

We’re only about a 5 min drive from downtown Rogers which is easy and free to park around so we can walk around to enjoy the growing food and shopping scene. We also have a farmers market in downtown which isn’t as big as Fayetteville and bentonville (which I prefer because it’s not as crowded) but definitely growing each year. We don’t have many bike trails that go into the downtown area but the city does have lots of plans in place to expand the trails to have more access to downtown so we’re looking forward to that option in the coming years.

I definitely recommend Rogers since it’s cheaper than Bentonville or Fayetteville, but growing very quickly so it won’t be long until our downtown area is just as popular.",4,2023-04-04 18:41:37 UTC

That being said, I do personally enjoy living in Rogers more than the rest of the cities. I’m central to NWA and can get to bentonville in 12ish minutes and Fayetteville in a little over 15.
Amenity wise the city of Rogers has everything that I personally need, and I think it would meet most people’s needs as far as shipping, restaurants, entertainment goes as well.

If you're on the southwest side, Lake Fayetteville is a nice 5.5 mile, paved and pleasant walk.

As others have noted, Devil's Den isn't all that.  It tends to be super-crowded with not a lot of solace. Some great views and some great trail, but you'll spend as much time parking as hiking.

If you are on the east side of Beaver anyway, I'd strongly recommend doing the combo Goat Trail and Hemmed in Hollow hike, starting at the Centerpoint Trailhead.  The trail to Big Bluff (a great view overlooking the Buffalo River, google image searches give you an idea) is about six miles round trip.  But keep going at the obvious trail fork and add another five miles and you can add Hemmed In Hollow, the tallest waterfall between the Rockies and the Appalachians. This does involve some route finding, but it gives you two iconic views in one moderate day (12 or 13 miles, maybe 2000' elevation gain). Watch for wild boar.",4,2022-02-13 19:52:57 UTC

I was bit 4 years ago and I have yet to recover from the decease, I can no longer eat red meat or any mammals for that matter. Also make sure that if you have a partner, you want to constantly be checking for ticks on each other. All it takes is one bite and that will change your life for the worst.

Great way to scare off wealthy families that have the ability to easily move. 

I have seen many Walmart executives spend their final years in the Dallas area because they benefit from Texas not having any state income tax. I'm no expert in how it works but they claim retiring in Texas saves them money in the long run and what I've seen them do is just rent a humble apartment in Dallas area. They use that apartment as their permanent address but then still own property up here which is subject to property related taxes but their income is left alone in due to them having established residency in Texas. 

A county specific income tax would result in wealth moving over the county lines to Benton, Madison, or Crawford counties. ",25,2019-03-21 06:44:55 UTC

Not to say that taxation isn’t an appropriate method in many cases, but the issue isn’t that the county doesn’t have enough to operate. 

The problem is that the correct remedy for bringing down housing costs hasn’t been implemented.

I was trying to get a conversation going about rising gentrification as I've seen Fayetteville grow significantly since I moved there in 2011. I didn't realize that a, e.g., Tyson exec living in Fayetteville can have their permanent residence in Texas and claim no income in Fayetteville as a result.

I honestly wouldn't mind wealthy people moving to the surrounding counties (concentrating further in  Benton, let's be honest) since Fayetteville will stay attractive as a place to live for many people. 

I have the feeling that the wealthy people in Fayetteville will change the laws in their favor as they grow in numbers.

The guy with middle length sandy blond hair and a limp is also fake. He claims to be homeless and disabled, but I've repeatedly seen him be dropped off near the strip mall on Joyce by someone in a nice car with a backpack full of supplies. They show up before the early morning traffic, blond dude pulls the dirty clothes he wears from a basket in the back of the car, changes into then, puts his clean clothes in the car, and them crosses the bushes to go panhandle while his friend leaves. If you catch him away from his post, you can hear him bragging about making $80+ in four or so hours.

The heavyset couple with two dogs that also begs around Joyce claim to be disabled as well, but aren't. They're just super overweight and don't want to work.

Many people in Fayetteville are fighting tooth and nail to be able to pay rent, and have basic necessities and have next to no leftover income to deal with financial emergencies. People are quite literally one or two unforeseen circumstances away from food insecurity or being forced to incur late fees or running out of gas, etc. They do not have the luxury of holding rental properties and could not even dream of putting two kids through college as you say. While you may not feel particularly greedy, from the perspective of those much less fortunate than you, it is difficult to see it any other way.

Addendum: From what little I do know about the national housing crisis, this whole “the few own the properties of the many” aka rental/ leasing housing economy we’ve built is a BIG part of the problem. The writing on the walls is that fewer and fewer people will ever be able to own the spaces that they live in. I don’t mean to call you out specifically. I can only take you at your word that you’re trying to be a good landlord, but the truth is that the only real long term solution to the housing crises, as I see it, is to move to give residencies back to the people. As long as housing remains such a large scale profit engine, it only serves to drive the wedge further and further between the rich and the poor.",0,2024-04-07 06:11:54 UTC

* this is a national problem and local solutions will have somewhat limited efficacy- more success may make Fayetteville even more popular so none of the proposals should be considered to be a permanent solution. 

* The USA has pursued a development pattern that emphasizes heavily on **low-density suburban sprawl** which **uses a lot of land** per household. 

* Can you guess **what highly desired resource is very limited? Land.** 

* Fayetteville is a lot better about this than other cities in NWA, but **forcing developers to build single family houses instead of allowing multifamily** wherever it's palatable **forces supply constraints** on single-family houses, prices go up, walkability goes down, traffic gets worse, and municipal services are more costly.

* **The most desired parts of Fayetteville have a mix of housing types**: see the area between Dickson and Wilson Park, the vicinity of the square and south of Dickson, and other areas built before zoning constraints and redlining came into play. This is actually a traditional development style for Fayetteville, but then you had ~segregation era politics screw everything up. 

* People are happier, healthier, and have less financial volatility when they *don't* have to drive to get everywhere they need to go. Allowing *smart* density makes for cheaper housing and provides knock-on effects. (Side note: having a walkable/bikeable daily commute, even with a diesel bus, is better for the environment than switching to an EV)

---

With that said, I want to urge caution here: the large home builders can and have spent loads of money to influence policies against the interests of our friends, family, and neighbors here in Fayetteville: Rausch Coleman handed Sen Bart Hester a sack of cash to kill Fayetteville's ability to implement tougher quality standards on new builds AND they donated almost as much money to Councilperson Berna as his opponent raised in total. 

The answer isn't to build more cookie cutter single-family houses so we can line DR Horton's pockets, it won't work and we'll end up having [bulldozed the natural landscape](https://youtube.com/watch?v=0LoenypUcmI&pp=ygUpcGF2ZSBwYXJhZGlzZSBwdXQgdXAgYSBwYXJraW5nIGxvdCBseXJpY3M%3D) for a badly built bandaid on the problem.",42,2024-03-21 00:00:57 UTC

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like Arkansas Renters United, Canopy NWA, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five City Council members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. Mike Wiederkehr led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

What I think was strange about Mike's version was that it over-emphasized the City's efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, Highway 71 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. Highway 71 improvement project that's underway or our Tier Growth Centers in our City Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in New York? Triple-deckers in Boston? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from Euclidean zoning to form-based zoning. Bentonville and Rogers are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If Fayetteville chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. The Walton Family Foundation is offering cities in NWA a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the City has not taken them up on it. 
* City councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that Fayetteville **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

Mike Wiederkehr's motivation for his own resolution seem to be focused on his own insecurities and pride more than that of the people's voices (that personal letter, wow), and I find that unacceptable as a representative of us citizens.

Mike's thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”  
  
– Council Member Mike Wiederkehr, on Page 1 of the Note, speaking about the Housing Crisis Resolution written by voters

So his response was to propose his own, one key difference being that his does not declare a housing crisis, but it does give himself pats on the back.

>Council Member Wiederkehr’s counter-resolution does not declare a Housing Crisis and does not call on the city to try new things. The FOIA documents show Wiederkher purposely leaving some council members out of the process of seeking co-sponsors. They also show him purposely asking the City Attorney’s office to **hold off sending out his resolution to non-sponsors until the last possible moment** before the agenda session, **leaving them in the dark** until hours before the meeting on purpose. That’s his right, but neither of these things seems very inclusive or consensus-building. -Evelyn Rios Stafford",5,2024-03-21 16:39:02 UTC

Families live in multifamily housing all the time (here, right now), I'm not sure I understand your point. I can, however, say that a lot of the apartment designs utilized in Fayetteville make for bad outcomes and don't serve the community or walkability well at all, not compared to the older designs you find on/near Dickson and the square. Having access to parks and services nearby might sway your impression- take the small apartment complex across the street from Washington elementary for instance, there's an elementary school nearby, Wilson Park is a walk or bike away, and there's access to jobs, a bus stop, churches, shopping, etc... a family can live well there. 3+ br units would be needed for longevity, but that's hardly a new concept.

-

Building tons of low-density single family housing induces sprawl- sprawl is why west Fayetteville feels like an entirely different city than the rest of Fayetteville. It's why you have to spend ages in traffic, nothing is nearby, and services are more expensive for the city. Maintaining those far-flung streets is crazy-expensive, fyi, and is a huge looming expense that weighs the city down a lot.

So I grew up in Fayetteville and currently have been in Asheville NC for 5.5 years now. They are very similar honestly. Same sorta vibe and great nature. I'd say the Mountains here in Asheville are way bigger and prettier. You also get way more waterfalls and more hikes imo.

The beer scene here is also on another level. Several huge breweries such as Sierra Nevada and New Belgium but there are like 40 in the city. A bit over saturated. Also there are definitely more restaurants and bars as well because of the massive tourism based economy here.

That being said it is a huge tourist town. So when it's in season the whole town is packed and it's hard to get around and dinner reservations and stuff. But in the off season it's a ghost town and the locals can thrive and actually do things in the city.

Asheville doesn't have other towns like Roger's and Springdale and Bentonville here. So the little mountain towns outside it don't have much going on. But definitely more to do in it than Fayetteville does.

There is a huge local art district here to view local artists and then you have the biltmore as well (but that's super touristy). Really tho Asheville is a hippy mountain town at its core.

The main east-west road to and from Asheville is I-40 and I believe it's one of the most dangerous stretches of interstate in the country.  Some locals call it Die-40.

Asheville much much bigger downtown area and just in general. Fayetteville has a massive university that is a part of the city unlike UNC Asheville. Fayetteville doesn’t have shows every weekend like Asheville does. Not even close. Less options there. Less options for nature stuff, less cool stuff in driving distance. Think of Fayetteville like Boone but bigger, it’s growing a lot but (all the growth is kinda suburbia ish-not really a fan). Asheville has more everything and is bigger, maybe you could say Fayetteville is Asheville on a smaller scale.

The Ozarks are cool but the best nature spots are all hour + away. It’s not anywhere near as cool as the Blue Ridge mountains.

I think the biggest difference is just stumbling around drunk downtown Asheville, you can find stuff, a show, whatever. Fayetteville has a strip of bars, but it’s different as far as like. 5 bands in town any given weekend

Don’t trust random Redditors on all this though. Come stay for 3/4 days. You’ll like it and youll find neat shit. It’s different though",12,2024-04-08 01:22:26 UTC

I would say the best part of Fayetteville is the surrounding towns of Northwest Arkansas(NWA). I currently live in Fayetteville and work in Rogers. The Northwest Arkansas Metro Area is the 18th fastest growing metro area in the US. Fayetteville has its spots but the infrastructure is a bit dated and the city is hard to work with as far as new development(I am a heavy civil estimator for a local construction company.. don't get me started). But Bentonville and Rogers is booming. Walmart is currently building a 300+ acre home office/campus in Bentonville that is driving improvements all across the city. 

For bars you have Dickson st in Fayetteville which is still the best place to bar hop but there are a lot of great local bars spread out through NWA if you want to avoid the college crowd. There are also about 20 local breweries in the area. For entertainment you have the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville(Broadway style plays), JJ's Live(Live Music) in Fayetteville and the Walmart AMP(Live Music), next to Top Golf, in Rogers which draws a ton of top talent. My favorite show there is still Tenacious D. Alice Walton has a world renowned art museum, Crystal Bridges, nestled into a wooded pocket of Bentonville. You also have the Razorback sporting events.

The Promenade area of Bentonville has blown up in the last 5-10 years. Ton's of fantastic restaurants shopping ranging from flea markets to high-end designer boutiques. The company I work for currently has 3 projects in that area right now that we are building and I am bidding more every week. 

Plenty of outdoor activities as well. Tons of golfing all across NWA. Devil's Den hiking/camping is only a 30 min drive on the interstate. Bentonville was named the ""Mountain Bike Capital Of The World"" due to its 70+miles of in city trails connecting to 400+ mile of nature trails. The ""Razorback Greenway"" is a continuous \~40 mile trail that starts south of Fayetteville and ends in Bella Vista north of Bentonville. We also have Beaver Lake which offers great fishing, boating and camping. As well as numerous rivers and creeks in the area. Kayaking the King's River about 30 minutes east of NWA is one of my favorite things to do.

I thoroughly enjoy living here in Northwest Arkansas. I have been all across the US and I am proud to call this place home. I think that this area has hit the sweet spot of progressive infrastructure while maintaining the natural beauty.",3,2024-04-12 13:04:23 UTC

There are so many solid neighborhoods that I wouldn't be able to answer this question. We live off Wedington in a pretty nice area.
2. Fayetteville is definitely the hippie side of NWA, and that's why my wife and I picked here over the other cities (which are also great, just for different preferences). The food scene is extremely solid. I have 3-4 favorite coffeeshops, 3-4 favorite bars. Restaurants are pretty solid, some of the newer/fancier ones are up towards Bentonville.
3. Very cheap cost of living comparatively to most places in the US.
4. OzarksGo all the way, if you can get it. We pay $80/mo for 1 gig fiber.
5. We don't have kids yet, can't answer.
6. My favorite brewery? Hard to say, but it'd have to be either Fossil Cove or Bike Rack.
7. In the past month we've hiked Devil's Den, rafted Kings River, and been to probably 2-3 other parks. We like the Kessler Mountain trails.
8. Try Meetup, there's a few young professional groups. Other than that, your typical coffeeshop/bar scene I guess. I don't know...I don't even know how I have friends!
9. Honestly, the music scene could be better. I grew up in Little Rock which (while a much crappier place to live in most respects) has a great blues/rock scene. There are definitely house shows and smaller joints around town, but it's been difficult to get plugged into the music scene for me.
10. Springdale will give you some of the most authentic Mexican food imaginable. Quite a few excellent taquerias and taco trucks just a few minutes away from Fayetteville. Otherwise, your typical normal Tex-Mex is everywhere.

> Results show that the average risk of severe injury for a pedestrian struck by a vehicle reaches 10% at an impact speed of 16 mph, 25% at 23 mph, 50% at 31 mph, 75% at 39 mph, and 90% at 46 mph. 

> The average risk of death for a pedestrian reaches 10% at an impact speed of 23 mph, 25% at 32 mph, 50% at 42 mph, 75% at 50 mph, and 90% at 58 mph.

Not exactly the difference between 20 and 25, but I think the difference between 16, 23 and 32 sufficiently makes the point that a slight reduction in speed can greatly improve chances of pedestrians not being severely injured or dying from vehicle impact.

section 42 is tax credit, income restricted based on area median income - typically people need to make 30-50% of the AMI (which means based on the neighborhood, rent and restrictions can be vastly different - ie if they're building a development by harber vs by SHS the income restrictions and rent amount could be wildly different) 


Vouchers generally cap rent at 30% of a person's income 


Rent controlled apartments are more or less a thing of the past, but ideally they would cap rent at 15 - 30% of people's income starting and then have restrictions around the amount rent can increase yearly. 


A lot of places regardless require applicants make 3x the rent each month 


Their ""good"" here (which is really just a tax break for them regardless, so beneficial to their finances and not really for the greater good) is contingent upon how affordable and accessible the housing actually is.

I'm not a person who believes the Waltons are 100% good, but they do work at addressing problems like affordable housing in tangible ways that many other organizations don't have the ability or finances to do.

The smart way to view the Waltons is a resource that can be directed towards what the city needs.  Engage with them about potential development that will help address housing affordability, for example.  Springdale is kicking our butt in that regard right now.

It’s replaced with apartments and houses to house home office employees, larger roads to accommodate the cars they drive. That’s destroying the area.

My wife and I bought our house (little over 1K sq ft, three bedroom 1.5 bath) up the hill from Root School back in good ol' 2000, paid 89,5 for it. Had/chose to refinance back in 2011, 12 whenever (had to juggle around a ton of debt, mostly medical from a decade+ at the time of cancer treatments and everything that goes with that, plus being on a single income, living off cc's etc) and Simmons sold our mortgage to the highly qualified criminals at Wells Fargo to whom I still pay a little over $650 mo, 30 year note.

Now, the fun part. Dial it back even further. No, further! Dad bought his house, the house I was raised in, the house he still lives in, a couple blocks up from Root in the other direction (Kings dr. West of Root, our house is East of) back in 1958, maybe 59. Paid $12,850 for it, 2 bedroom (he later converted the garage to a third bedroom, did it himself) one bath, just shy of an acre of land. When he paid the house off (in barely a decade from purchase, Dad was a public school employee btw, not a rich dude, monetarily speaking fyi... Mom worked too, nursing, but I think Dad did all the mortgage stuff his own) he was making house payments of $71. No shit, mortgage payment of $71, just barely over 50 years ago.

Right, I know. Kinda blew my mind too.

Bentonville is a suburban/urban outdoor playground, basically because the Waltons want it to be a fun place to live and are willing to throw any amount of money at it. Think Johnny Morris if he was into mountain biking and fine dining instead of hunting and fishing. Rogers is kind of “Bentonville lite”. Eureka springs is a cool little resort town as many people have mentioned and really close to Bentonville.

My summary in addition to what everyone else has listed: NWA is quite a bit bigger than Springfield in both urban area (spread over two counties) and population (about 110k more people), Springfield is a lot more “area important” than NWA (Springfield is the center of a larger media market than NWA and is kind of the cultural center for all of the southern half of Missouri while NWA is basically us and Fort Smith if you go west much at all Tulsa kind of takes over, north is you guys and Joplin and both south and east is Little Rock), while Springfield is smaller it does feel more “like a city” than NWA since it’s built around one singular city than a string of smaller one but this is rapidly changing.  NWA is also growing quite a bit faster than Springfield (the Springfield MSA grew by 16k people-from 475k to 491k-from 2020 to 2023 while NWA grew by 44k people-546k to 590k in the same time frame).

Demographically both regions feel similar (mostly white) with the only notable difference being that NWA has decidedly more Hispanic and Marshallese people. Also due to the growth in NWA and where the growth has come from (a ton of out of state growth) the cultural character of NWA is starting to change from “Ozark Highlands” like Springfield to something else…can’t name it because it’s an amalgam of people from California, Texas, Colorado, and the Northeast.  This has led to an even further “difference” between the towns where some cities and parts of the cities feel very much like Joplin or Springfield while others feel more like Dallas suburbs.",15,2024-06-12 14:18:56 UTC

We have world class mountain bike trails as well as hundreds of miles of paved pedestrian/bike only trails that intersect called The Razorback Greenway.  

We have world class canoeing and kayaking on the Mulberry, and Buffalo Rivers with some of the most spectacular views of the Boston Mountains portion of the Ozarks you’ll ever see.

If you enjoy hiking, we have hundreds of trails that take you to scenic lookouts (Hawksbill Crag) or waterfalls (Triple Falls).  For an easy but spectacular hiking experience try Devil’s Dem State Park near West Fork. 

If art is your thing we have the Chrystal Bridges Museum of American Art which started as a personal collection of art owned by Alice Walton and has evolved into one of the best museums in the US.  There are sprawling grounds with sculpture installations and the museum itself is enormous with works from Rothko, O’Keefe, Rockwell etc. If you are traveling with kids, the Scott Amazeum is right next to Chrystal Bridges and is a great time and way to introduce your kids to a museum experience.

Beaver Lake is not as large as Lake of the Ozarks or Tanneycomo but it winds it’s way across NWA and there are lots of recreational areas where you can camp or just spend a day enjoying some swimming, jet skit rentals, or fishing.

Rogers and Bentonville are in the northern area of NWA and they are where most people go to shop and dine.  Pinnacle Hills in Rogers has Top Golf and The Walmart Amp which is an outdoor concert venue where touring artists like Dave Matthew’s Band, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Stone Temple Pilots etc have or will appear this year.  

Even our small towns have cool things to see.  If you have time head over to Bella Vista and see Cooper Chapel.  It’s a glass and timber church that was designed by famed Architect Fay Jones Jr.  speaking of Fay Jones, you can find several homes he designed scattered across NWA.  They are works of art in their own right.  

Fayetteville has Dickson Street which is the culture and arts center of Town and is only a few blocks north of our Town Square which has shops and dining as well as the best farmers market in the area in my opinion.  

Lastly, if you just love driving, and scenery you can’t go wrong with a drive down the historic Pigtrail byway down Hwy 23.  You’ll pass Mulberry mountain and there’s a fantastic lookout at the peak of the drive.  If you have time take a quick detour down Hay 215 to Oark Store.  The oldest functioning General Store in the state.  They serve an awesome burger and homemade pies and the drive down 215 is littered with lookouts and views of the Mulberry River.

So that’s what we have going on down here.  It’s not so far from you all and I’d recommend taking a long weekend or a whole week to come enjoy it.",14,2024-06-12 13:51:21 UTC

Activities wise there is significantly more to do in NWA, and most popular/big attractions are cheap/free (Crystal Bridges/Amazeum). You have a lot of brands/concepts you would see in bigger markets, but are in the NWA medium market. Overall, the quality and quantity of entertainment are significantly higher in NWA. 

When it comes to food scene I would say Springfield is very similar on options (other than Chinese food), with NWA constantly adding more and more options and types that continue to push it towards a better food scene then Springfield. 

Lastly, the people in NWA are a lot of transplants from around the country and makes for a unique make up. A lot of what is said above is accurate around the people aspects, but would say it is a more unique makeup then that of Springfield who are primarily SWMO people or from KC or STL.

Lastly, as a mid thirty father of 2 I would choose NWA 100/100 times for raising a family and finding friendships. It’s designed more for families and has a lot of people who are in the young professional stage of life.

Fayetteville is much hillier and more ""natural"" feeling, like Branson without the... Branson-ness. 

>What are the cool and exciting stuff on your side of the Ozarks? If someone wanted to take a vacation to Northwest Arkansas what would you recommend they see?

Eureka Springs is awesome, the Buffalo River (more north-central AR) is absolutely stunning, the Pig Trail is a beautiful drive. Ozark Highlands Trail is great to hike. I feel like all of the outdoor activities (hiking, paddling, rock climbing, etc) down here tend to be just a bit better overall than the ones on that side of the border since it's not on a plateau. Fayetteville is a very pretty town with quite good infrastructure (especially non-car infrastructure) for the area. Bentonville has Crystal Bridges and the Momentary. Springdale has the best food.

>What do you feel like similarities and differences are between our two halves?

It's really two sides of the same coin at the end of the day. We don't fit with the rest of Arkansas, y'all don't fit with the rest of Missouri.

The [Boston Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Mountains) run through here, which are honestly the heart of the Ozarks. You’ll find elevation variances 3x larger than what you’d find between Springfield and Branson, as an example.

Because of that, they are home to the tallest sheer cliff (dubbed “big bluff” - roughly 550’ tall) between the Rockies and Appalachian range, as well as the 2nd tallest single drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains, called Hemmed-in-Hollow falls. Hemmed-in-Hollow is 209’ in height, bested by only Taughannock Falls in upstate New York at 215’.

It is also home to America’s first national river, the Buffalo National River. Much of the Boston Mountains are protected from development by the National Park Service via the Ozark National Forest.

Eureka Springs is a really quirky, authentic, touristy mountain town. NWA (from Bentonville to Fayetteville) is exploding, as is Springfield.

NWA is the 6th fastest growing metro of over 500k (100 total), just behind Austin (TX), Boise (ID), Lakeland (FL), Provo (UT), and Huntsville (AL) from 2018-2023.

The tax rates for Arkansas mean a hell of a lot more for someone living in a small town without many jobs. NW Arkansas has a strong job market which, in turn, makes the cost of living as a percentage of income more ""affordable"".

On the other hand, if you are part of the population that does not have one of the higher paying jobs, you'll find yourself pushed away from here.

Even though the article posted was from a local news source, it's been repeated everywhere, many times. I'm not sure who their target audience is or if it's Fayetteville's self-promoting marketing designed to bring in a more affluent demographic.

It's not a zero-sum game. Growth up there doesn't mean loss in Fayetteville. After decades of Fayetteville outgrowing sleepy Bentonville and Rogers, those cities are just waking up and starting to catch up. They're growing faster than Fayetteville, but that's all catch-up from past decades and doesn't mean Fayetteville is slowing down. We're just slow and steady down here.

Plus, as someone said up thread, if you look at the type of growth they're getting, it's not what Fayetteville wants or needs. Chain restaurants make a big splash, but they also make you indistinguishable from any other mass-market city in the country.  It's ok to specialize in local small businesses that give a city a unique character.

In fact, a lot of small bets will always be more resilient than a handful of big projects.  Fayetteville can afford for a restaurant to fail or a boutique owner to retire after 40 years without it crippling our sales tax. And there will be 3 more to replace it next month. If Rogers loses a restaurant at the Promenade, it's substantial. And a big-box footprint like that can sit vacant for a long time waiting for the right tenant to come along.  And don't even get me started on Bentonville's billionaire-subsidized growth.  It isn't organic and won't persistent if the investors find a different shiny plaything to attract their attention.

Now, as for housing... Yes. Fayetteville needs to pull our heads out of our collective environmentalist back-sides and realize that sprawling out to Elkins is far more damaging to our resources and our community than a few apartment buildings ever could be.",16,2023-03-07 14:15:56 UTC

Average rentals I see near campus is somewhere between $1000-$1500 a month. You can find cheaper ($650/mo.) farther away and give up washer and dryer. 

The current bus system is hobbled by the lack of routes and diminishing number of active busses. The easy fix is to add more busses and bus routes. You should also start adding covered waiting areas and benches at the bus stops; for which currently there are very little. 

There's no such thing as a good suburban development. It adds to urban sprawl, creates more stroads with accompanying traffic, and further pollutes the area and destroy the environment.

You can walk to Walgreens, Walmart Market, get on the bike trail, walk to a cool restaurant in 2-5 minutes or walk-bike to the Square or Dickson.

Never had a good experience with any moving company so, since the 2 first (and only) failures, I just rent and do it myself, even when across the country.

But I've helped more than one person, including here in Fayetteville, use a container moving service. They'll drop a container (different size choices) and you can fill it up at your leisure and timetable.

If you do go with a moving company, the biggest issue we had was an argument (settled off-court) over how their measurements and mine differed. To the tune of $3k or more. My advice:

* Make sure you have it down on paper how they measure and how they charge - in any different way (i.e. After X cubic feet/x lbs/x number of boxes/etc. the charges go from $ to $$$$)
* Take pictures of your measurements and have them measure everything BEFORE loading.
* Do not agree to pay in full (or just accept whatever fee they might have) until AFTER you have the final pricing in writing.
* Optional (the 3rd company I once tried to use worked with me on all previous points, except this): Write down a document and have them sign it, before the truck is loaded, attesting that all boxes received show no sign of damage and that [all of these are still OK](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-23017/Damage-Indicators/Shockwatch-2-Indicators-50G?pricode=WB8197&gadtype=pla&id=S-23017&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4uaUBhC8ARIsANUuDjX-42v9iJWap-Vp9Xd22yzpZ2sORoF2S_hZ5x_xQOKuSZGFsY9Tzk0aAodqEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

I had everything worked out, then they called my \[elderly\] mother, got her all confused and made her sign documents with different agreements from what I had made.

She got screwed, as there was nothing we could do because she was paying and had signed documents ""after revision and not being able to reach me"".

Similar things happened before, to my sister, moving from Florida to NY.

If you want to rent a truck on your own (the cheapest but most labor intensive), go with Penske better equipment and pricing than U-Haul.

But I liked the container service. I helped a friend load up a ""Pod"" in NY, when they were moving back to France and another company (cannot recall) for friends here in Fayetteville going to Washington State. They just plop the container in front of your house. If I understand and still the same, the price is pre-agreed by what fits in that size container and the delivery time - it seems that trucks are only involved at the customer home level. The big in-between is by rail, which is usually slower but they can negotiate several cars at a time.",1,2022-06-03 20:45:10 UTC

Fayetteville in general is vey safe. There’s few places I’d feel unsafe walking around in, as a young new grad myself. I would say the part of Leverett St on the north side of North St is a little seedy, because it’s just older and a little run down. There’s nice apartments everywhere though, so you’ll just have to look. 

If the trail isn’t a huge selling point, there’s plenty of nice housing out off Wedington to the west. Also, check apartment complexes around Garland on the north side of North, some of those are nice. 

I lived in a small 6 unit apartment complex on Leverett just south of North, across from the Eureka Pizza. It was 2 bed 2 bath. Just a stones throw from the trail, and on the bus route if you ever wanted to get on campus. Check out Wilson Properties for that, it was hella cheap 

DM me if you’d like any more help! I’ve lived here for 20+ years now so I know the city well. ",4,2017-10-30 13:51:07 UTC

I used to live in Campus Edge Apartments on Whitham Ave, and even though the apartment itself was nice and spacious (and super cheap), the students/college age people living around me made lots of noise and would play baseball in the parking lot, not caring if they hit people's doors with the ball. Also walking home from work via Arkansas Ave/Maple Street in mid-afternoon was hellish, especially trying to cross Maple which was always congested with shiny new SUVs with Texas plates. I would recommend trying to live somewhere south of Lafayette and north of MLK.",1,2017-11-01 18:42:49 UTC

Leverett really isn't that bad as long as you aren't a clerk at the EZ Mart. The only places in the area I might actively avoid are the trailer park behind the EZ Mart and Bottom's Up further down the street.",2,2017-10-30 19:01:55 UTC

I'm not sure if they do that kind of thing or not but it doesn't hurt to ask. Good luck! ,2,2016-04-15 00:27:21 UTC
