From Monica Brich's article, quoting Chris Joannides, executive director of the Hope Campus, which serves homeless people: <br/>'I am of the belief that the folks that stay outside will continue to stay outside, regardless of a 'tent ban'.

It lays out strategies for making downtown more walkable, building more parks and trails, increasing access to the Arkansas River, and boosting tourism.</url></p><p nitf:lede=""true"">But invigorating downtown will require major investment, and the master plan would have some of that money come from taxpayers. One possible source of public funds is a one-cent sales tax proposed by Mayor Frank Scott Jr., which the <url normalizedValue=""https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2024/07/30/little-rock-will-again-vote-on-a-one-cent-sales-tax-in-november"">Little Rock Board of Directors voted on July 30 to put on the November ballot.

(The downtown master plan would absorb only a small part of </url> <url normalizedValue=""https://www.littlerock.gov/media/21577/results-in-the-rock-draft-1.pdf"">the proposed sales tax hike, which would also increase funding citywide for parks, infrastructure, the police and fire departments, and the Port of Little Rock.)</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://i0.wp.com/arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Riverfront-Axon_DTLR-scaled.jpg?quality=89&amp;ssl=1"">This rendering from the master plan shows potential areas for improvements or projects Credit: SASAKI</url></p><p>The plan says its single most important piece, though, is the creation of one or more 'tax increment financing' districts downtown. Tax increment financing, or TIF, is a complex financial policy tool that essentially allows local governments to divert revenue from future increases in property taxes in a specific geographic area and put that money toward development or public improvement projects in that same area. This is often done by issuing bonds to fund capital projects, then paying investors back over time.</p><p>'Most critical for the success of the entire plan is establishing tax increment financing (TIF) as a tool,' the plan says. The document advocates changing state laws and regulations to increase the amount of revenue a TIF district can capture. It even says city leaders should push for an amendment to the state constitution — which, if successful, could impact funding for public schools across Arkansas.</p><p>The city board approved the master plan on July 16, but that doesn't mean everything in it is a go. The plan is merely a list of suggestions, not a binding document. The city board would have to vote on creating a TIF district, and directors say they're still in the early stages of discussing next steps.</p><p>Ward 1 Director Virgil Miller told the Arkansas Times that Mayor Scott is planning to form a Downtown Master Plan implementation committee before the end of September. A spokesperson for the mayor did not respond to questions about Scott's plan to form an implementation committee, and neither the mayor nor city directors mentioned the master plan at the board's Sept. 17 meeting. </p><p>Ward 4 Director Capi Peck and Ward 5 Director Lance Hines both said they hadn't heard anything about master plan implementation since the board approved the plan in July. Peck also said first steps will likely depend on whether the sales tax passes in November. Another city director, who spoke to the Arkansas Times under the condition of anonymity, said the board is holding off on doing anything TIF-related until after the November election. </p><p>In the meantime, it's worth taking a closer look at what's in the master plan and how a TIF district would operate, if the board should eventually create one. </p><p>What is the master plan?</p><p>The new master plan could be seen as an attempt to undo the negative consequences of planning efforts in decades past. In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, the <url normalizedValue=""https://honors.uca.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Central_Little_Rock_Urban_Renewal_Project"">Central Little Rock Urban Renewal Project promised an end to slums and blight but instead </url> <url normalizedValue=""https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/urban-renewal-7856/"">further segregated Little Rock's neighborhoods and made the city's infrastructure car-dependent, culminating with the opening of Interstate 630 in 1985 after two decades of construction. </url></p><p>'The subsequent results of that practice 50 years ago has created the built urban form that we know in downtown Little Rock,' said Daniel Church, associate planner at Sasaki. 'There's a lot of surface parking lots. It's a neighborhood that is largely geared toward driving in and out of with one-way streets. It's geared toward the automobile.'</p><p>While these conditions aren't the ideal starting place, the downtown area presents opportunities, Church said.</p><p>'You've got underutilized parking lots, which are a great opportunity for infill development. You've got the ability to reimagine streets for bikes and for people, more than just the automobile, and the opportunity to make one-way streets [into] two-way streets,' Church said. </p><p>Planners have been talking about making downtown more people-friendly for decades. The 1982 <url normalizedValue=""https://honors.uca.edu/wiki/index.php/Downtown_Little_Rock_Development_Plan"">Downtown Little Rock Development Plan contained similar ideas to the new master plan, including improved public transportation, dedicated pedestrian paths to increase walkability and mixed-use development. The most tangible part of the 1982 plan to come to fruition was the creation of the River Market District.</url></p><p>The new master plan lists 44 strategies for transforming downtown. Some are focused on economic development: The master plan suggests building more housing and doubling the downtown population, currently about 4,400; establishing a 'Downtown Development Corporation' to manage new building and improvement projects; renovating underutilized buildings, like the Donaghey and Tower buildings, into mixed-use developments with affordable housing; and incentivizing the construction of a grocery store downtown. It proposes establishing a Black entrepreneurship and incubator hub on West Ninth Street to provide affordable space for start-ups.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://i0.wp.com/arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/30-Crossing-Park-Axon_DTLR-2.jpg?quality=89&amp;ssl=1"">This rendering from the master plan shows potential improvements and projects in the area surrounding Interstate 30. Credit: SASAKI</url></p><p>The master plan also includes ambitious proposals for improving transportation with a more efficient, high-frequency bus route; more bike lanes and wider sidewalks in certain areas; and an expansion of the trolley system to reach SoMa, the airport and Union Station. It suggests creating a connected trail network throughout downtown, developing new parks and public spaces, and closing the 'Dillard's Gap' in the Arkansas River Trail, a dangerous and confusing part of the multi-use trail near the Dillard's building that <url normalizedValue=""https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2014/01/25/little-rocks-river-trail-inches-toward-the-dillards-gap"">the city has tried to fix for more than 10 years.</url></p><p>Church and Gabe Holmstrom, executive director of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership, presented the plan to the Little Rock Board of Directors on July 2. The city board approved the plan July 16. But the real work is still ahead.</p><p>What is tax increment financing?</p><p>According to the plan's timeline, the first goal is to establish one or more TIF districts downtown, which would require further action from the city board.</p><p>TIF is a tool used by local governments to stimulate development in a specific geographic area by capturing a portion of property taxes in that area to pay for new public infrastructure or other projects. A local government can borrow against the captured tax revenue to finance development projects, with the expectation that it will eventually be able to pay off any loans in the coming years as projects are completed and the area improves. If all goes well, property values rise along with tax revenue, in a virtuous cycle of economic development. </p><p>Critics of TIF argue that it diverts money away from essential services like schools, while proponents argue that it is beneficial in the long run for school districts and other public services that depend on property taxes.</p><p>A TIF district will not take existing funding away from schools and other services; whatever baseline amount of property tax revenue the area generates at the time the district is created will continue to go toward those services. But as improvements are made in the TIF district and property values increase, the TIF district captures a portion of any increase in property tax revenue, diverting it away from the school district and other services. During the TIF district's lifespan, the diverted tax revenue goes toward financing bonds to pay for infrastructure in the TIF district.</p><p>After a TIF district expires — they last until the bonds issued for the district are paid off — schools and other local services will once again get the full amount of tax revenue from the area. </p><p>TIF districts in Arkansas are limited in what types of property tax revenue they can capture, making them a less powerful incentive here than they are in many states. State law keeps TIF districts from dipping too deeply into property taxes dedicated to public schools, for example. </p><p>TIF critics question whether it's necessary to divert funds at all to spur redevelopment.</p><p>Baker Kurrus, a former Little Rock School District superintendent and former school board member, said he's skeptical of TIF as a development tool. (Kurrus is a regular contributor to the Arkansas Times.)</p><p>'The way to get people to live [downtown] is to give the schools more money and say, 'You want to go to this area school? You have to live in the area,'' he said.</p><p>'There's no tax increment financing in the [Arkansas] cities that are growing at paces five, six times Little Rock's pace,' Kurrus said, pointing to fast-growing communities such as Benton and Bryant.</p><p>Church, the Sasaki planner, said LRSD will benefit from economic growth and will eventually see more money flowing into it than it ever would have without TIF.</p><p>'It [TIF] ultimately helps the school districts because it means that they're able to get development that is driving tax generation that's going into their coffers over time,' Church said. 'That wouldn't have happened otherwise.' </p><p>When Church and Holmstrom presented the master plan to the city board on July 2, Church recommended the board establish a TIF district, but also said there are lots of federal grants that could fund parts of the plan. </p><p>Holmstrom, the Downtown Little Rock Partnership director, told the Arkansas Times that the group is still 'researching some of the other economic development tools being used successfully in other states,' not just TIF. Regardless of the mechanism, Holmstrom said, some type of incentive is needed to stimulate new development downtown.</p><p>'All of these discussions are centered on concepts that will decrease the overall cost of development, which would help make projects [viable],' Holmstrom said. 'At the end of the day, [with] the increased cost of construction combined with current interest rates, the math does not work with our market rents. We need to figure out the best way to close that gap.'</p><p>What is TIF's track record in Arkansas?</p><p>TIF has been tried before in Arkansas, with mixed success.</p><p>Rockwater Village, a fast-growing residential development near the River Trail in North Little Rock, benefits from a TIF district, officially called the 'Lower Baring Cross Redevelopment District,' established in 2006. The developers behind Rockwater <url normalizedValue=""https://talkbusiness.net/2023/11/with-tifs-help-nlrs-upscale-rockwater-village-replaces-blight/"">told Talk Business &amp; Politics in 2023 that the area 'previously generated $58,874 in property taxes, if those could be collected. Now it generates more than $850,900.'</url></p><p>The North Little Rock School District has seen increases in its property tax collections from the area as Rockwater has grown, but it won't collect the full revenue until the TIF district expires. Bonds associated with the TIF district have final payments due on Dec. 1, 2031, according to the NLR city attorney's office. Records from the Pulaski County treasurer's office show the district captured about $209,000 in property tax revenue in 2023 to service the debt. </p><p>(Though the high property values in the area are generating more tax revenue for the school district, the newly constructed homes are far from affordable for most families in North Little Rock: A look at current Zillow.com prices for available Rockwater houses shows prices ranging from $500,000 to $785,000.)</p><p>Fayetteville's experience with tax increment financing has been less encouraging than North Little Rock's. In 2005, the city of Fayetteville created a 350-acre TIF district downtown, issued $3.7 million in bonds to fund the demolition of a blighted building, and approved the construction of a hotel in its place. Planners expected the assessed value of properties in the district would reach $95 million by 2011 and predicted the bonds would be paid off by 2029 with the tax revenue generated by the hotel.</p><p>By 2011, the construction plans had fallen apart, in part due to the 2008 financial crisis. Property values within the district were assessed at only $47.2 million, <url normalizedValue=""https://web.archive.org/web/20240726005430/https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2011/sep/04/tax-district-underperforming/"">the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that year.

The ordeal left Fayetteville taxpayers with millions of dollars in bonds to pay off on a much longer timeline than predicted</url></p><p>In 2013, Little Rock established a TIF district near Otter Creek Road and the I-430 and I-30 interchange to incentivize development of the Bass Pro Shop and an outlet mall.</p><p>The city has one other active TIF district in the Port of Little Rock, the industrial area southeast of the airport. Established in 2004, the '<url normalizedValue=""http://web.littlerock.state.ar.us/WebLink/DocView.aspx?id=913&amp;page=1&amp;searchid=ef013961-fb40-4b0f-ac24-30e481c0602a"">Port of Little Rock Redevelopment District No. 2' funded infrastructure to prepare the area for private industrial development.</url></p><p>Though Rockwater and Otter Creek have experienced rapid growth, skeptics of TIF districts question whether they're a necessary perk to prod redevelopment or simply a giveaway for developers. In Little Rock, areas such as Pettaway and SoMa have seen much development in recent years without TIF districts.</p><p>The midtown area of Little Rock near Park Plaza Mall is another example of redevelopment without TIF. In 2003, the city board created the Midtown Redevelopment District and approved the creation of a TIF district. It was never established, though, and the board <url normalizedValue=""https://www.littlerock.gov/city-administration/board-of-directors/meeting-agenda/AGENDA%20-%20WEB%20-%203-17-2020/R%20-%20Disbanding%20Midtown%20Advisory%20Board.pdf"">disbanded the redevelopment district in 2020. As Max Brantley noted in a </url> <url normalizedValue=""https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/03/07/little-rock-set-to-kill-midtown-redevelopment-district"">2020 Arkansas Times article, private developers have invested millions of dollars in the area since 2003 without the incentive of a TIF district.</url></p><p>The master plan calls for changing state law. Why?</p><p>TIF districts aren't as widely used in Arkansas as elsewhere, partly due to Arkansas's tax structure. The state's property tax rates are among the <url normalizedValue=""https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/property-taxes-by-state"">lowest in the country and its sales tax rates are among the highest. And because Arkansas has declared some shares of property tax off limits, TIF captures less revenue here than it would in most states. </url></p><p>Arkansas property taxes are measured in mills, or one-tenth of a cent. A mill generates one dollar in tax revenue for every $1,000 of assessed property value. The millage rate in Little Rock is now 70.5, of which 46.4 mills go to the Little Rock School District and the rest goes to the city and county.</p><p>The LRSD's share includes a special 25-mill minimum tax that is levied in every school district in Arkansas. The state pools the funds from those 25 mills and redistributes it among Arkansas's school districts. In 2007, the state Supreme Court ruled that TIF districts aren't allowed to touch those 25 mills. The decision 'effectively gutted TIF,' according to a <url normalizedValue=""https://lawrepository.ualr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2065&amp;context=lawreview"">2020 article in the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Law Review.</url></p><p>Arkansas law also restricts TIF districts from taking any mills dedicated to libraries, fire and police pension funds, county hospitals or servicing bonds that existed before the TIF district was established. </p><p>Not only are TIF districts in Arkansas limited in how much revenue they can tap into, they're also restricted in how they can spend it. Current Arkansas law requires TIF to be used only for public improvements, like roads and parks, rather than directly incentivizing private development. </p><p>Church said Arkansas is 'way behind' almost every other state in terms of 'what millage can be captured and be used for TIF.'</p><p>But changing the most important piece of the law as it stands now — the fact that the 25 mills are off limits to TIF districts — would require a constitutional amendment or a new ruling by the Supreme Court.</p><p>The Downtown Little Rock Master Plan suggests city officials lobby the state Legislature both for changes to statutory law and a constitutional amendment, which would ultimately require voter approval. </p><p>'The most critical amendments to state TIF law are: 1) expanding the total millage that can be collected by the TIF, and 2) expanding the range of eligible uses for TIF funding beyond those related to public infrastructure, including land acquisition, property assembly, site preparation, and other private development costs,' the plan reads.</p><p>Kurrus, the public school advocate, criticized the idea of changing state law to allow TIF to capture property tax revenue allotted for schools. 'If you want to throttle back the amount of money a school district has to work with by taking some of that [revenue] away, you're not going to have an urban area that's attractive to middle-class families and children,' he said. </p><p>No matter what the master plan says, it isn't yet clear if the Downtown Little Rock Partnership and city officials will pursue that route. Kyle Leyenberger, communications director of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership, said everything is up in the air at this point.</p><p>In July, as the city board was preparing to vote on the master plan, Mayor Scott said it would take at least a year or two for a constitutional amendment changing TIF law to go before voters.</p><p>'I don't think we want to wait on something that we can't determine for another year-and-a-half, two years,' Scott said at the July 9 city board meeting.</p><p>A spokesperson for Scott did not respond when asked about the mayor's position on the TIF portion of the master plan.</p><p>At the moment, the mayor is more focused on passing the one-cent sales tax this November, which would also fund parts of the master plan. The tax would spend millions on parks, public safety, public infrastructure and the Port of Little Rock. Made up of a five-eighths-cent general capital purposes tax, which would last 10 years, and a permanent three-eighths-cent tax for general operational purposes, the city estimates the tax would bring in $650 million over the next decade.</p><p>Since the city board voted to send the tax to voters, Scott has been encouraging residents to vote in favor of the tax at nearly all of his public appearances.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">NEWSTX-ARK10026852769434791225220500209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:6D0Y-XYF1-JCMN-Y1S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2024-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""3114""/><timeReceived>1:26 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Smith, authors of 'Stateswomen: A Centennial History of Arkansas Women Legislators, 1922-2022' will talk about their book at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Clinton Presidential Center<br/>The book marks a century of service by women in the Arkansas General Assembly -146 of them. Jay Barth, director of the Clinton Library, will moderate the conversation and a book signing will follow. </p><p><br/>Advertisement <br/>The program is free. It also will be streamed live by the Clinton Center. <br/>Click here to register.[1] <br/>Advertisement <br/>The Smiths, who married in 1994, are both former legislators and University of Arkansas faculty members. <br/>A UA Press promotional release[2] for the book says: <br/>Advertisement <br/>Stateswomenshines a light on the women who have served as some of the state's central decision makers. Drawing on documentary research and oral histories, Lindsley Armstrong Smith and Stephen A. Smith present lively, concise biographies for the nearly 150 women legislators who have served in the general assembly to date, chronicling their personal histories, volunteer work and social activism, and legislative victories. In a probing introduction, the authors examine the neglected role of women in Arkansas political history alongside the 'long history of resistance to full citizenship rights for women in Arkansas'—demonstrating that political representation is essential for improving opportunities in the wider society. <br/>The first comprehensive study dedicated to these trailblazing Arkansas legislators,Stateswomenwill surely inspire history buffs, community-minded citizens, and political hopefuls alike. <br/>I can testify that the Smiths are not stuffy academics. <br/>The Encyclopedia of Arkansas's account[3] of Lindsley Smith's legislative efforts is, I'm sorry to say, something of a benchmark of the reversal of political tides at the General Assembly. <br/>Smith's first bill expanded coverage of the Workers Compensation Act to include work-related neck injuries that had been previously excluded (Act 1250 of 2005). Her major legislative accomplishments included two measures intended to enhance citizen participation in government and public affairs by protecting citizens exercising First Amendment rights from frivolous strategic lawsuits against public participation (Act 1843 of 2005) and awarding expenses to citizens who prevail inFreedom of Information Act[4]enforcement litigation (Act 440 of 2009). Onenvironmental[5]issues, she sponsored legislation expanding the Arkansas Wetlands Mitigation Bank (Act 476 of 2007), requiring utility net metering provisions for renewable energy sources (Act 1026 of 2007), and establishing the Heritage Trails System (Act 728 of 2009). Smith sponsored several bills to protect victims of domestic violence (Act 1875 of 2005, Act 682 of 2007, and Act 619 of 2009), as well as protecting women's health by requiring health insurance policies to cover prescriptions forcontraceptives[6](Act 2217 of 2005) and requiring employers to provide unpaid break time and reasonable locations for expressing breast milk (Act 621 of 2009). <br/>Appropriation measures to benefit citizens of Fayetteville sponsored by Smith included bills providing General Improvement Funds forKUAF Public Radio[7], the UA Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics &amp; Society, the Special Collections Department of UA Mullins Library, the UA Pryor Center for Arkansas Oral and Visual History, Seven Hills Homeless Shelter, Fayetteville Scull Creek Trail, Fayetteville Fine Arts Festival, Peace at Home Family Shelter, Ozark Guidance Center, Single Parent Scholarship Fund, and the Fayetteville Public Library. <br/>Among other legislative efforts that Smith considered significant were her unsuccessful attempt to addsexual orientation[8]to the classes protected by theArkansas Civil Rights Act[9](HB 2751, 2005) and her sponsorship of the unsuccessful effort to secure ratification of theEqual Rights Amendment[10]to the U.S. Constitution in 2005, 2007, and 2009. <br/>Stephen Smith has quite a record, too, legislatively and elsewhere.[11] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=""https://forms.clinton-foundation.org/view.php?id=812775"">https://forms.clinton-foundation.org/view.php?id=812775</url> [ 2]: <url

Even the most entrenched misanthropes among us can admit there are some fine people doing delightful things around here (shout out to Arkansas's 2021 best budtender, Buffy Montgomery!), and that perhaps that's cause enough to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Arkansas's pathetic vaccination rates could suck anyone into the doldrums, but the annual Best of Arkansas edition is a well-timed shot in the arm. </p><p><br/>The readers have voted, and you have pretty good taste. Sen. Joyce Elliott is indeed the best Arkansan. The Van, which supported the dignity of our homeless population even through the pandemic by helping them secure essentials like clothes, food and toothpaste, deserves accolades and support. Discovery's reign as the best gay bar should not and has not been challenged. <br/>Advertisement <br/> We peppered some of the winners with lightning round Q&amp;#38;As, and were happy we did. Actress Jamee McAdoo shared what it's like to dip a toe into the pageant scene and wind up winning the tiara. Designer Kelley Kolletis tipped us off to the color of the year and even told us how to not mess it up. TV meteorologist Todd Yakoubian offered up a dad joke tragic and endearing enough to make the whole state groan. <br/> The editors here have favorites, too, and we took the liberty of fleshing out readers' nominations with a few of our own. Food editor (and best author nominee) Rhett Brinkley picked Arkansas's best peck of pickles on a road trip to visit Blytheville's own Mr. Davis Pickles. A former preschool teacher who bounded into the pickle-making arena after sampling his own mother's recipe and finding it wanting (savage!), Dedric Davis pickles whatever he pleases, rules be damned. Turkey bologna? Hot dogs? Sure, pickle them, why not? And his cucumber-based concoctions are equally innovative. Can't decide between dill or bread and butter? Let Mr. Davis Pickles blow your mind with a combination of the two flavors, all in one jar. <br/>Advertisement <br/> Our most elusive editor, Lindsey Millar, gives up the secret location of his clubhouse with a story about Natural State Treehouses, a Fayetteville-based business that can make your childhood dreams come true. <br/> And culture editor Stephanie Smittle combines encyclopedic knowledge of the Little Rock music scene and her signature balletic prose to remind us why the White Water Tavern, our favorite phoenix, will always rise to the top of any best live music venue list. <br/>Advertisement <br/> The mosquitoes are biting and a dark virus cloud seems to have settled over the state like we're the Addams Family or something. But if it's the end times, might as well enjoy them. So binge watch 'The Mysterious Benedict Society' courtesy of Little Rock's best newly famous writer, Trenton Lee Stewart. Affix some faux lashes from Beauty &amp;#38; Beyond to look your most fly on the voyage to the hereafter. Drop in at Colonial Wines and Spirits ('best booze to go') and provision yourself to offer up a proper farewell toast. It's summer vacation's (and maybe even Western civilization's) last gasp. Let's break out the good stuff. <br/> Make your next pickle your best pickle with Mr. Davis Pickles[1] Meet the cucumber king of Blytheville. by Rhett Brinkley <br/> Wigging out[2] Beauty &amp;#38; Beyond is a cosmetological wonderland. by Austin Bailey <br/> Change of the guard: White Water Tavern reopens under new ownership[3] Same White Water Tavern, but slightly cleaner. by Stephanie Smittle <br/>Advertisement <br/> Natural State Treehouses makes dreams come true[4] Fayetteville contractor Josh Hart is riding high during a treehouse boom. by Lindsey Millar <br/> Trenton Lee Stewart's 'The Mysterious Benedict Society' is an enterprise in emotional memory[5] The Little Rock author, whose beloved middle-grade novels spawned a new 'Disney Plus' adaptation, specializes in riddles, puzzles, mazes and daydreams.

Claiming that Chinese companies benefit from 'unfair' subsidies, the Commission will introduce a new regime of tariffs, overruling German-led objections. However, manufacturer Tesla appears to have secured preferential treatment to protect itself from elements of the incoming protectionist policies.</p><p>Starting on July 4th, Chinese EVs will face tariffs on a sliding scale, topping out at 38.1% -on top of a pre-existing import duty of 10%. Commission spokesmen have warned of a 'threat of economic injury' to the European economy caused by the lack of a level playing field for Chinese imports. The sliding scale tariff structure means manufacturers can land a lower tariff through revealing the extent of their state subsidies to the Commission.</p><p>Commission hostility towards Chinese EVs is paradoxical, since it would restrict the use of a potential mechanism for achieving Brussels' (increasingly outlandish) Green Deal ambitions.

These residents are known as Harijans of Hindu faith.</p><p>This Hindu Harijan community, brought from the Telugu region of India during British rule, has been living in this colony for several centuries. They were brought here to serve the sanitation of the city's population. They did not voluntarily settle in Dhaka.</p><p>The DSCC has failed to fulfil any of the promises it made to the city's residents. The City Corporation is partly responsible for the traffic congestion but has done nothing to solve it. Even an hour of rain floods a large part of the southern area, but the DSCC has not recovered the occupied canals to address this. It also failed to protect citizens from mosquitoes and dengue fever. But, in the name of planning and beautification, the DSCC is ruthlessly evacuating the poor Harijan people from their homes without any rehabilitation package.</p><p>Under the pretext of building a market to be owned by Muslims, the City Corporation is demolishing part of the Harijan colony. The DSCC mercilessly treat the poor people as 'unwanted', who keep the city clean! These poor Harijans are residents of this city, voters of the City Corporation, and citizens of Bangladesh.

The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, ""had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof."" The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p><h>Alaska</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Anchorage: </emphasis>Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state's oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 - the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways - buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. ""We're experiencing record high inflation that we haven't seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,"" Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn't have come at a better time for those living on the state's vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.</p><h>Arizona</h><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/09/16/PPHX/42462e82-e996-4e80-bbd9-f9ad51f84826-Crested_Caracara_nest_Scott_Olmstead.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Phoenix: </emphasis>Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert's iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society<url normalizedValue=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2022/09/20/arizona-nonprofit-plans-plant-14-k-saguaros-wildfire-burned-areas/10361682002/"">is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona</url>. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro's fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.</p><h>Arkansas</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Fayetteville: </emphasis>The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor <url normalizedValue=""https://www.swtimes.com/story/money/2022/09/20/beyond-meat-coo-arrested-biting-nose-arkansas/10432656002/"">is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game</url>. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man's Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey's car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, ""ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose."" The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found ""two males with bloody faces"" at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat's COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.</p><h>California</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">San Francisco: </emphasis>Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city's quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco's lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.</p><h>Colorado</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Colorado Springs: </emphasis>An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney's Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. ""We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,"" said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee's next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November's election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.</p><h>Connecticut</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Waterbury: </emphasis>Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school's slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones' promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they've endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. ""There are days when grief is just so awful,"" said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. ""Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn't exist. That compounds everything."" One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.</p><h>Delaware</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Wilmington: </emphasis>A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington's financially ailing operator <url normalizedValue=""https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2022/09/20/port-of-wilmington-delaware-court-ruling-gt-usa/69504529007/"">must pay a ship loading company more than $28 </url> <url normalizedValue=""https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2022/09/20/port-of-wilmington-delaware-court-ruling-gt-usa/69504529007/"">million</url>- an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services - a local ship loading company already doing business at the port - to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer's local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer's officials had carried out ""bulldogged"" efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.</p><h>District of Columbia</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Washington: </emphasis>A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/washington-monument-vandalized-red-paint-man-arrested-police-say/65-2a4fe052-0893-489a-89cd-1f52c178780e"">WUSA-TV reports</url>. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. ""No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,"" one woman said. ""I don't know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,"" a man said. ""Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,"" one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.</p><h>Florida</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Fort Lauderdale: </emphasis>The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury's presence, accusing them of being ""unprofessional"" when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were ""the zenith of the cumulative disdain"" they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer's comments didn't rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge's ""expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger"" against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.</p><h>Georgia</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Macon: </emphasis>If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's ""Tribal Homelands Initiative,"" which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. ""This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country's tribal nations,"" Haaland said at last weekend's 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem.

Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university's plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state's dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school's proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry - Idaho's is the third largest in the nation - faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn't been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.</p><h>Illinois</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Chicago: </emphasis>A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant's releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation's highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant's most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant's original owner, $5million.</p><h>Indiana</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Indianapolis: </emphasis>The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared,<url normalizedValue=""https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/indianapolis/2022/09/19/indianapolis-overdoses-marion-county-coroners-office-leading-cause-death/65466292007/""> eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner's office</url>, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner's Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner's office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some ""natural"" deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. ""It's unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,"" said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.</p><h>Iowa</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Des Moines: </emphasis>Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility <url normalizedValue=""https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2022/09/16/des-moines-correctional-facility-unsafe-workers-union-alleges-osha-complaint-mold-asbestos/10370037002/"">have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing</url>. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.</p><h>Kansas</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Topeka: </emphasis>A state law enforcement oversight board <url normalizedValue=""https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/2022/09/20/kansas-deputy-disciplined-tasing-handcuffed-hogtied-autistic-boy-jackson-county/10411384002/"">reprimanded a sheriff's deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied</url> in the deputy's vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff's Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers' Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas ""struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, 'hog-tied' and ultimately tased L.H.,"" the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.</p><h>Kentucky</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Frankfort:</emphasis> A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky's history, officials said.

The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one - brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg - excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital's director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, ""Now I know what these things on my sides are for."" The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><h>Maine</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Portland: </emphasis>The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge's decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen's Association said this week that they're appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is ""escalating its fight to save Maine's lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,"" said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen's association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years.

Built in 1744, before America's independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn &amp; Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.</p><h>Massachusetts</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Salem: </emphasis>A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the ""Bewitched"" statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery - as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom - sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was ""going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested"" and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days.

Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau's refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city's reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. ""The Bureau's failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City's historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,"" the lawsuit said.</p><h>Minnesota</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Minneapolis:</emphasis> A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator.

Officials from the nation's capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn't have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation's population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be ""the balance point"" if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size - each representing the location of one person - placed on it.</p><h>Montana</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Bozeman: </emphasis>The state's fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue.

Multiple studies indicate it's not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night - it's a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be ""dazed and confused"" in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill.

Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan.6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.</p><h>New York</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">New York: </emphasis>An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. ""Mr. Acevedo's tragic passing is an immense loss,"" Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb.27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. ""Once again, their system failed,"" Acevedo's attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. ""I mean, he shouldn't have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual."" The state attorney general's office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner's office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city's main jail complex.</p><h>North Carolina</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Raleigh: </emphasis>The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina's bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina's proposal would cover the ""University Hub"" region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.</p><h>North Dakota</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">McHenry: </emphasis>A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.</p><h>Ohio</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Columbus: </emphasis>A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump's discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state's high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore ""Tore"" Maras, who calls President Joe Biden ""resident not president"" and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her ""Tore Says"" podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, a Republican, joining the court's three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras' roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose's office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official - acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter - filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official's favor, and LaRose's office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.</p><h>Oklahoma</h><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/09/20/NOKL/96a95cf3-7e12-4b4b-967a-6fcaed9c7928-joe_exotic.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Wynnewood: </emphasis>Joe Exotic <url normalizedValue=""https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/09/21/joe-exotic-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-over-tiger-king-songs/69507340007/"">is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune ""I Saw a Tiger""</url> in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness."" He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further ""unauthorized use"" of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. ""I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,"" he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.</p><h>Oregon</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Portland: </emphasis>Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. ""It's super hard on families,"" said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.</p><h>Pennsylvania</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Middletown: </emphasis>A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team's season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. ""This investigation did not involve just hazing or 'boys will be boys' conduct,"" Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. ""Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing."" Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed ""a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment"" to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts ""completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.""</p><h>Rhode Island</h><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/09/21/NPRJ/83c0ed56-3553-4a44-86c8-6b4693979859-susanmenard.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Woonsocket: </emphasis>Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2022/09/21/mayor-susan-menard-bodies-found-woonsocket-identity-confirmed/8071393001/"">was ""a strong leader"" who was especially good to the city's senior citizens</url>, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. ""She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,"" Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard's residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn't seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for ""a couple of weeks,"" police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. ""She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city's history,"" Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city's first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.</p><h>South Carolina</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Columbia:</emphasis> Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel's Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn't guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel's Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel's Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.</p><h>South Dakota</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Sioux Falls: </emphasis>Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP's 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor's office did not follow the state's open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor's safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota's Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem's labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren's retirement in the weeks after Noem's daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure - a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.</p><h>Tennessee</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Nashville: </emphasis>Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday.

The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year's gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving ""humanity's most pressing problems,"" ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. ""Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,"" Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states.

The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. ""Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,"" said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. ""We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened."" Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.</p><h>Utah</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Salt Lake City: </emphasis>A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother's 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still ""haunt him and his family,"" said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron's family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family's lawsuit even longer, he said. ""There are mixed emotions by the family,"" Morris said. ""It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues."" After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">USATOY-50763453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">USATOY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:66FG-VFH1-F03F-K07H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">480731</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2022-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""9391""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Gannett Media Corp  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=""22"" month=""09"" year=""2022""><dateText>September 22, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""organization""><classificationItem score=""55""><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.country""><classificationItem><className>United States, United Arab Emirates, Mexico &amp;

The misdemeanant helped himself to an ice cream bar, some milk and half a tomato, but was otherwise ""unarmed""; however, by the time the police standoff ended, the ""crime scene"" included more than 50 cop cars, a SWAT team (and backups), two helicopters, standby ambulances, a police robot, and a crisis negotiation team. Windows, walls and wrought-iron doors were destroyed; tear gas and a ""flash bomb"" were employed. (Jessen suspects that the farmhouse's isolation enticed police to decide that it presented an excellent training opportunity.)</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Compelling explanations</p><p>""Pro-choice"" activist Jessica Farrar, a Texas state legislator, introduced a bill in March to create consistency between the state's rigorous regulation of women's reproductive functions and those of men (regulation which, by the way, in either case she calls ""invasive"" and ""unnecessary""). Because Texas's anti-abortion laws highlight ""procreation"" as a crucial government interest, she believes male use of erectile-dysfunction drugs should be regulated as abortion is. Under her bill, individual use of Viagra or similar drugs must be preceded by ""counseling"" similar to that required by abortion laws.</p><p>Jason Sexton told KFSM-TV in Fort Smith, Ark., in April that he alone had been digging the massive hole neighbors noticed, now 34 feet deep and with separate tunnels extending off of the main hole. Police had come to check it out, since it was on another person's private property (and not the city's, which Sexton had assumed). He said he had been digging off and on for three years to get an answer to whether ""the Spanish"" had been in Fort Smith centuries ago, mining iron, and, if so, the site should therefore be a lucrative tourist destination. Sexton said he felt he had to give his explanation: ""Nobody in their right mind,"" he said, ""would dig a hole (this big) for no reason.""</p><p>Crime report</p><p>At a time of growing awareness that some people seem almost addicted to their cellphones and instant 24/7 communication, police in Brookfield, Wis., released surveillance photos of a woman in the act of robbing banks on March 25 and 27 - while standing at teller counters and talking on the phone during the entire episodes. Acting on a tip from the photos, police arrested Sarah Kraus, 33, on March 28.</p><p>College activist Pablo Gomez Jr., 22, was arrested in Berkeley in March and charged with the brutal stabbing death of an elementary school teacher. Gomez, a senior at University of California Berkeley, is well-known on campus for insisting on a gender identity for which (as an example) the pronoun ""he"" is an inappropriate reference. (Hence, ""they"" was charged with what is so far the only homicide in Berkeley this year.)</p><p>Paul Perry Jr., 39, sound asleep behind the wheel of his car, with motor running, at 6 a.m. April 2, was in no position to talk his way out of a DUI ticket, but did offer a gentle challenge to the Youngstown, Ohio, police officer. Several times, according to the police report, Perry offered to ""thumb wrestle"" the officer to get out of the ticket. From the report: ""Perry was advised officers would not thumb-wrestle him.""</p><p>Wait, what? A father, 43, and his son, 22, argued on April 9 about who would walk the dog at their home on Chicago's South Side. They apparently thought to settle the issue with a gunfight, and police, who recovered the two weapons, said both men received multiple wounds. The son was killed, and the father was in critical condition.</p><p>Leading economic indicators</p><p>The eight elite Ivy League universities are better thought of as ""hedge fund(s) with classes,"" according to a March report by the activist Open The Books, and thus there is little reason for taxpayers to have given them the more than $41 billion in grants and entitlements they received over a recent six-year period. The schools are already legendary for their $119 billion ""endowments"" (based on donations from alumni and aggressive investment). Those endowments are enough, according to Open The Books, that (assuming donations continue to arrive at the same pace) schools could provide free tuition to every student in the eight schools - in perpetuity. (Even if no new donations are made, the eight schools could provide such free tuition for 51 years.)</p><p>Ironies</p><p>Federico Musto was suspected recently by Wired.com of audaciously inventing academic credentials to help land his job as CEO of the company Arduino (a circuit-board manufacturer popular in the computer industry among coders creating, among other things, robots and motion detectors). Arduino's work is ""open source"" - creating hardware that others, by design, can exploit and modify for their own loftier projects. It might thus be said that Musto's claimed academic ""accomplishments"" (his so-called MBA from New York University and claimed Ph.D from MIT) are themselves the product of his having ""open-sourced"" his own, previously modest curriculum vitae.</p><p>Foreign press</p><p>Village police in Bangladesh arrested Yasin Byapari, 45, in January on the complaint of his wife - after she had learned that she was not, as he had told her, his second spouse, but rather the 25th of his 28. (Police found him at the home of No. 27.) The accuser said she had, through sleuthing, tracked down 17 of her ""competitors."" </p><p>Passing parade</p><p>(1) In same-day competition in March, perennial Guinness Book records jockeys Zoe L'Amore and Ashrita Furman squared off over the record for stopping blades on an electric table fan the most times in one minute using only their tongues. On Italian TV, L'Amore stopped blades 32 times, but Furman, at a different venue, later stopped 35. (2) Norway unseated Denmark as the world's ""happiest"" country, according to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Solutions Network. (There was no word on whether Denmark was unhappy about losing the top spot.)</p><p>News of the Weird classic (August 2013)</p><p>The upscale restaurant at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art announced in August (2013) that it would soon add a 20-item selection of waters from around the world, priced from $8 to $16 a bottle (and a $12 ""tasting menu""). The restaurant's manager, Martin Riese, who is a renowned water gourmet, will sell his own California-made 9OH2O (from ""limited editions of 10,000 individually numbered glass bottles"" at $14 each). Riese has been certified as a ""Water Sommelier"" by the German Mineral Water Association.</p><p>Read more weird news at WeirdUniverse.net; send items</p><p>to <email normalizedValue=""mailto:WeirdNews@earthlink.net"">WeirdNews@earthlink.net</email> or </p><p>P.O.

to refugees who crossed the border into safe countries.</p><p>She said: ""Back in February when the war broke out we could all see what was happening through the news.</p><p>""It really just broke my heart to think that people were being told to leave their homes.</p><p>""Myself, knowing how much stuff you need just for one baby to get out for the day, I couldn't imagine being told you had to leave your home with simply what you could carry.</p><p>""It was about three days after war broke out that my friend who is Polish, lives in England, sent me pictures of her city back home saying there were hundreds of families walking into their city with nothing.""</p><p>                     Mother who spearheaded Helen's Law                   </p><p>A murder victim's mother whose legal

after her daughter vanished near their home in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1988 aged 22. </p><p>Local pub landlord Ian Simms was jailed for her murder despite her body never being found and was released in 2020 before his death earlier this year.</p><p>Mrs McCourt's campaigning following her daughter's death led to the Prisoners Disclosure of Information About Victims Act, dubbed Helen's Law, being enacted in 2021.</p><p>The legislation makes it harder for killers and paedophiles who hold back information on their victims to receive parole.</p><p>Mrs McCourt, 79, said: ""I couldn't believe it.</p><p>""All these years I've done -it's nice to see people be given these awards... who have had to do things which have hurt them so much because of the reasons why they want to make sure our laws are right and correct.""</p><p>                     New Year Honours List 2023 in full                   </p><p>                     Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour

'It's already almost impossible for voters who may be asked to decide whether Trump is fit for a return to the Oval Office - or at least to carry the GOP banner into the election - to keep pace with all the competing legal twists and the scale of his plight. A confusing fog in which all the cases blend together could work to the former president's advantage as he seeks a White House comeback while proclaiming he's a victim of political persecution by the Biden administration. But the deeper his legal mire gets, Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination are getting braver in suggesting that his fight against becoming a convicted felon could be a general election liability. Trump's dominance in the GOP primary has been boosted from his criminal indictments to date. But the sheer volume of cases unfolding alongside his campaign is increasingly daunting.' And: 'All of this frenzied activity unfolding on one day represents just a snapshot of the complex legal morass now surrounding Trump. It's just a taste of the enormous strain the ex-president is about to feel as he campaigns for a return to the Oval Office. The crush of cases will also impose increasing financial demands. Already, Trump's leadership PAC has been diverting cash raised from small-dollar donors to pay legal fees for the former president and associates that might instead have gone toward the 2024 campaign.' That being the point.</p><p>* * *</p><p>'DeSantis Has Discovered No One Likes a Copycat' [ <url normalizedValue=""https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/08/02/desantis-trump-copycat-00109210"">Politico</url> ]. 'Like their cousins in commerce, [DeSantis campaign strategists] studied the leading brand in their market — Donald Trump — and then devoted themselves to 1) imitating him, and 2) expanding on what he does. Like something conjured in a mirror, DeSantis copies every political stance and gesture Trump has made in the past eight years. But instead of supplanting Trump in the minds of the Republican base, the Florida governor appears to be fading. Why doesn't DeSantis' me-too act generate greater appeal to Republican voters?. There is only one god in the party, and as long as Trump is on the ballot and demanding fealty, Republican voters will have no god before him. Why praise an imitator when you can have the real thing? That's the state of Republican fundamentalism today. It's Trump on top. Trump underneath. And Trump all the way down.' </p><p>'DeSantis Says Trump Rigged the 2020 Election for Biden' [Ed Kilgore, <url normalizedValue=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/desantis-says-trump-rigged-the-2020-election-for-biden.html"">New York Magazine</url> ]. 'The Florida governor's new departure is to blame Trump rather than the evil Democrats for the alleged voting irregularities that made the election suspect: '[H]ere's the issue that I think is important for Republican voters to think about: Why did we have all those mail votes? Because Trump turned the government over to Fauci,' DeSantis said, referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 'They embraced lockdowns. They did the CARES Act, which funded mail-in ballots across the country.' So there you have it: DeSantis is suggesting that Trump is as much a perpetrator as a victim of the rigged election of 2020. Not only does this provide an elegant solution to the problem of validating stolen-election schemes without exonerating Trump, but it also nicely meshes with DeSantis's strategy of running to Trump's right. Trump's alleged empowerment of devil figure Anthony Fauci has been one of DeSantis's most consistent targets.' Wowsers. </p><p>'DeSantis replaces campaign manager in latest shake-up' [ <url normalizedValue=""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/08/ron-desantis-replaces-campaign-manager-00110253"">Politico</url> ]. 'Ron DeSantis has replaced his campaign manager Generra Peck, in what is the third major reshuffling of his operations, a campaign spokesperson and a person familiar with the move confirmed to POLITICO. Peck will be shifted to a role of chief strategist as part of the new order. Taking her place atop the campaign will be James Uthmeier, who has served as chief of staff in DeSantis' governor's office. In a text message, Uthmeier said the change was happening 'ASAP.' The move comes just weeks after the DeSantis campaign and close advisers insisted that Peck's job was secure, even after the team <url normalizedValue=""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/25/desantis-lets-go-of-more-than-1-3-of-campaign-staff-as-reset-continues-00108046"">shed a third</url>  of its staffers amid a budget crunch and concern about the direction of the operation.

'Biden's role as 'the good father' is embedded in the national psyche, reinforced by his public devotion to and defense of Hunter. Josh Barro, a Democrat who left the GOP in 2016, sees that devotion in a dark, depressing light. 'To love Hunter Biden is to expose yourself to being used and abused,' <url normalizedValue=""https://www.joshbarro.com/p/on-the-tragedy-of-hunter-biden"">he writes</url> . He says Hunter has wreaked 'emotional terrorism' on his family 'as they have struggled to keep him alive and sober.' The Biden family has made its choices out of love. But strictly from a political standpoint, the pattern is dangerous. Veteran Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik says in his latest <url normalizedValue=""https://markhalperin.substack.com/p/wwon-bonus-edition-the-sosnik-wisdom"">campaign memo</url> , the White House staff must have 'the authority to manage' the president's son. Otherwise, 'Hunter could become a serious campaign liability. It is inexplicable how Hunter has been allowed to parade around White House State dinners and fly so conspicuously on Air Force One.' The Hunter problem is going to take an 'emotional toll' on the Bidens no matter what, Sosnik writes. I think he's right. It will hurt them when his troubles make news. It will hurt them to exclude him in order to avoid even more public notice. These are tough family decisions, yet Joe Biden has a higher duty right now, a duty to his country. One hopes an adult child, even a troubled one, will understand that and be secure enough in his father's love to do what he must: fade from the spotlight as much as is possible, and let his father do what he must: win a do-or-die referendum on America's future.' How on earth can this person have insight into the Bidens' family dynamics?</p><p>Clinton Legacy</p><p>Democrats en Dshabill</p><p>Patient readers, it seems that people are actually reading the back-dated post! But I have not updated it, and there are many updates. So I will have to do that. -lambert</p><p>I have moved my standing remarks on the Democrat Party ('the Democrat Party is a rotting corpse that can't bury itself') to <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/11/notes-toward-an-definition-of-the-democrat-party.html"">a separate, back-dated post</url> , to which I will periodically add material, summarizing the addition here in a 'live' Water Cooler. (Hopefully, some Bourdieu.) It turns out that defining the Democrat Party is, in fact, a hard problem. I do think the paragraph that follows is on point all the way back to 2016, if not before:</p><p>The Democrat Party is the political expression of the class power of PMC, their base (lucidly explained by Thomas Frank in Listen, Liberal!). It follows that the Democrat Party is as 'unreformable' as the PMC is unreformable; if the Democrat Party did not exist, the PMC would have to invent it. If the Democrat Party fails to govern, that's because the PMC lacks the capability to govern. ('PMC' modulo 'class expatriates,' of course.) Second, all the working parts of the Party reinforce each other. Leave aside characterizing the relationships between elements of the Party (ka-ching, but not entirely) those elements comprise a network — a Flex Net? An iron octagon? — of funders, vendors, apparatchiks, electeds, NGOs, and miscellaneous mercenaries, with assets in the press and the intelligence community.</p><p>Note, of course, that the class power of the PMC both expresses and is limited by other classes; oligarchs and American gentry (see 'industrial model' of Ferguson, Jorgensen, and Jie) and the working class spring to mind. Suck up, kick down.</p><p>* * *</p><p>'The New York City mayor is having his Aaron Judge year after all. And it's not good.' [ <url normalizedValue=""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/07/eric-adams-reelection-problems-00110164"">Politico</url> ]. 'Adams — not unlike the Yankees captain, who was sidelined by a toe injury in June and July — has struggled all summer. There is a law enforcement investigation into a former member of his administration. There's a looming federal takeover of city jails. The City Council overrode his veto of affordable housing bills. And now migrants are sleeping on sidewalks in Manhattan as a crisis over their arrivals grows worse. The nonstop hits call into question Adams' depiction of himself as a strong executive who is running the nation's largest city competently after years of mismanagement. And if the problems continue to spiral, Adams could have what every New York City leader fears most — a one-term mayoralty. 'It has been a difficult couple of months,' Basil Smikle, the former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said in a phone interview. 'He needs some victories. He really needs some ways to change the conversation.' A high-ranking Adams administration official put it more bluntly. 'Horrible,' said the official about the mayor's recent troubles. The official was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the boss.' What a waste. The cop with the million-watt smile implodes. </p><p>#COVID19</p><p>'I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.' -William Lloyd Garrison</p><p>Resources, United States (National): Transmission ( <url normalizedValue=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk&amp;null=Risk"">CDC</url> ); Wastewater ( <url normalizedValue=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance"">CDC</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://biobot.io/data/"">Biobot</url> ; includes many counties; <url normalizedValue=""https://data.wastewaterscan.org/"">Wastewater Scan</url> , includes drilldown by zip); Variants ( <url normalizedValue=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"">CDC</url> ; <url normalizedValue=""https://www.walgreens.com/businesssolutions/covid-19-index.jsp"">Walgreens</url> ); ' <url normalizedValue=""https://iowacovid19tracker.org/hospitals/"">Iowa COVID-19 Tracker</url> ' (in IA, but national data).

N = 11. From the Abstract: 'University instructors experience uncertainty regarding how to teach in person in effective, safe, and health-inclusive ways during periods of high COVID-19 transmission. This article provides a blueprint for implementing proven COVID-19 safety precautions based on a small graduate-level health psychology research methods course in 2023.' And the Results: 'COVID-19 safety knowledge increased from 55.5% at baseline to 93.6% and 87.3% at post-test and follow-up, ps .001. Students masked better (72.7%), promoted improved indoor air quality (90.9%), changed testing strategies (45.5%), helped others manage risk (27.3%), helped others to understand Long COVID (54.5%), and rated the course as more health-inclusive than their other courses (100%). Course evaluations were highly favorable, with 89.3% of all ratings and 96.4% of target ratings as at least a 4 out of 5.' I do think layered protection shouldn't need a graduate-level course, but perhaps that's where we as a society are. I also think that leveraging the entire 'preprint' apparatus for a course description is novel and interesting.

The deck: 'New mutual aid network distributing thousands of masks, want health care settings to keep or return masking safety measures.' And: 'They held signs that read, 'FREE MASKS,' 'Life-saving masks here,' and 'Keep masks in health care.' In about one hour, they handed out 675 free high-filtration masks to patients, health care workers and visitors going to and from the hospital. Some people declined the free mask. One nurse who works at the hospital gratefully took some, and said she would distribute them to her coworkers inside Presbyterian. Everything was going smoothly for the mutual aid group until about 2:20 p.m., when two hospital security guards pulled up in a truck, got out and asked the group to leave. One of the guards told Source NM that Presbyterian Hospital doesn't have a policy prohibiting mask distribution, but does prohibit gathering on the property if someone has no business inside the hospital. 'They don't want solicitors,' the guard told the group. 'And I know you guys aren't selling anything, you're just giving out masks which, I don't see a problem with that — I don't see why anyone else would — but it's just how our policy works.' In response to questions from Source NM about the group giving away free masks, Dionne Cruz Miller, chief hospital executive at Presbyterian Hospital, said on Monday the hospital system doesn't allow 'vendors' to hand out anything on any of their campuses without approval. Cruz Miller did not respond to a question asking why the surgical masks in the lobby at the hospital in Albuquerque are placed behind a desk and not in plain sight.' lol.</p><p>Celebrity Watch</p><p>'KISS took Vancouver firm's treatment to avoid COVID and cancelling world tour: manager' [ <url normalizedValue=""https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/kiss-took-vancouver-firms-treatment-to-avoid-covid-and-cancelling-world-tour-manager"">Vancouver Sun</url> ].

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered.To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">NWTXNC-NAKE102057169151798538325876100230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">102057</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:68WR-PRV1-F03R-N162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">484268</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2023-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""5607""/><timeReceived>6:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Naked Capitalism</publicationName><publicationDate day=""08"" month=""08"" year=""2023""><dateText>August 8, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Water Cooler</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem score=""50""><className>Computer &amp;

Volunteers at shelters in Bentonville and Fayetteville have to serve more meals because of the increase in the number of people.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Close to 80 homeless people were evicted from a UA property south of 19th Street where they were camping and were forced to find a new place to live, according to a previous article published in The Arkansas Traveler Sept. 6. Salvation Army officials opened two emergency cold weather shelters early to help house the people who were living on that property.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Bobby Maynard, 60, who has spent nearly 30 years of his life homeless, wants a place to live above all else, he said.</p><p>""I mean, you know, I stay at the Salvation Army at night, but it gets crazy in there,"" Maynard said. ""Every time they open that darn door, you're freezing your butt off. It's getting right now to where there's 40, 45, 50 men in there. It's not big enough.""</p><p>During the holiday season, Maynard can only look forward to meals provided by different religious organizations and homeless shelters in Fayetteville because he has no one with whom to celebrate the holiday season, he said.</p><p>People tend to donate and volunteer more during the cold, winter months, said Daniel Robertson, site coordinator at 7hills Homeless Center. The shelter needs people to donate supplies for the winter, including coats, blankets and sleeping bags.</p><p>""I think some of that is because the weather is changing, you know, so people realize how cold it is,"" Robertson said. ""We do get a lot more calls for volunteers that want to come serve Thanksgiving lunch or Christmas dinner and things like that, which is great. I wish we had that same enthusiasm throughout the entire year.""</p><p>UA sororities and fraternities, Muslims 4 Community and several churches like Genesis Church are some of the groups that help at 7hills, Robertson said.  </p><p>""It's just kind of a mixed bag,"" Robertson said. ""It's the whole community working together.""</p><p>Muslims 4 Community is a charitable group from the Islamic Center for Northwest Arkansas. Center officials offer a place for spiritual practices, said Abdellah Essalki, the imam, or leader, of the center.</p><p>Robertson thinks people at 7hills are excited when Muslims 4 Community members come to the center, he said. The group hands out sack lunches on Fridays to help carry people through the weekend.</p><p>""Everybody's been super respectful, and they're a welcome sight,"" Robertson said. ""They pull in, you know, and people start lining up.""</p><p>Maynard likes when Muslims 4 Community members come to the center, he said.</p><p>""I like them. They're nice people,"" Maynard said. ""I like their sandwiches too, just if they would put it on regular bread (rather than buns) because I've got no lower teeth and it's hard for me to eat that.""</p><p>The group also serves sack lunches at the Salvation Army center in Fayetteville, even though their help is not related to the holiday season. Christmas is the busiest time of the year for the Salvation Army, said Joshua Robinett, one of the Northwest Arkansas Area Commanders of the Salvation Army.</p><p>""This time of year is a time that we are reminded about all the things we're thankful for, and we're reminded to give and we're reminded to serve,"" Robinett said. ""So as those reminders come up, really within the American culture, the opportunity is there (to serve). There's an increase of folks that are volunteering.""</p><p>Ringing the Salvation Army bells, a volunteer activity that starts in November to raise money, is the biggest source of money for the organization, Robinett said.</p><p>""Without that, let me tell you, there's no way we'd be able to</p><p>step up to the plate the way we did this year when some of the homeless encampments cleared out,"" Robinett said. ""We just wouldn't have the resources to do it.""</p><p>Christmas is a major holiday for Christians, but Maynard does not celebrate the occasion. He sometimes attends services, but mainly goes to different charities for holiday meals, he said.</p><p>Maynard, a Christian, wishes he could celebrate Christmas, but none of his family members are alive to be with him. Maynard is the only one left after multiple family members, like his father, died of cancer. Other family members died in accidents, including a drunk driving incident that killed his cousin and a shooting that killed his nephew, he said.</p><p>""All you can do is during that time of year is reminisce the good times you had, you know, because you can't bring them back,"" Maynard said.</p><p>The Muslims 4 Community group rotates between multiple locations across Northwest Arkansas and partners with other organizations to provide clothing and food, Essalki said. Charitable giving is one of the pillars of Islam.</p><p>There are five pillars of Islam: faith, prayer, fasting, obligatory charity and pilgrimage.</p><p>""Our members in the community here love to volunteer,"" Essalki said. ""The charity goes to help people, that's including poor and unfortunate people in hard times. All sort of good that we can give, we have to.""</p><p>Temple Shalom of Northwest Arkansas has no activities to help the homeless at the moment, but officials are discussing working with Muslims 4 Community to help shelters, said Stanley Rest, president of the temple, in an email.</p><p>During Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and refers to the annual observance of fasting and prayer, the temple collects food, personal items and clothing to donate to the Peace at Home Family Shelter, Rest said.</p><p>Helping the needy is a command in the Torah, both materially and spiritually. This includes donating money and food and giving in a way that preserves a homeless person's dignity, according to Rabbi Sid Schwarz's speech, ""Judaism's Moral Imperative to End Poverty.""</p><p>Charitable giving is also a tenant of the Christian faith, which Jesus exemplified when he gave his own life, Robinett said.</p><p>""We were created as social beings dependent on so many things, including our fellow man. I think we were designed to give and to receive,"" Robinett said. ""The mission statement of the Salvation Army is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in his name without discrimination.""</p><p>Maynard does not think religious groups or charitable organizations have donated as much for winter this year, he said.<br/>""Usually they give long-johns, or toboggans, or some of them give coveralls and things like that, but a lot of them haven't done it this year yet,"" Maynard said.</p><p>Despite his situation and his past, Maynard continues to practice Christianity. He does not think it makes sense when a person stops believing after a tragedy happens, he said.</p><p>""It's part of life. You can't change it,"" Maynard said. ""They say, 'Oh well, I don't like Christianity. I don't believe in Jesus or God.' That ain't going to change s---. That's not going to bring them back.""</p><p> </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">UWIRE-3933686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5TWN-T2M1-DY7P-T3XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2019-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""1176""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Arkansas Traveler: University of Arkansas</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=""05"" month=""12"" year=""2018""><dateText>December 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""organization""><classificationItem score=""93""><className>THE SALVATION ARMY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.city""><classificationItem><className>Fayetteville</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.state""><classificationItem><className>AR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""subject""><classificationItem score=""93""><classCode>STX000863</classCode><className>HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""91""><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""91""><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>N624221MG</classCode><className>HOMELESS SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""89""><classCode>N813400CC</classCode><className>CIVIC &amp; SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""89""><classCode>ST00099LR</classCode><className>MUSLIMS &amp; ISLAM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>N624221MC</classCode><className>TEMPORARY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""78""><classCode>ST0009XS5</classCode><className>THANKSGIVING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""73""><classCode>N721310GM</classCode><className>STUDENT FRATERNITIES &amp; SORORITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""state""><classificationItem score=""96""><classCode>GS119</classCode><className>ARKANSAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>"

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert Anthony Molloy, of the Virgin Islands, to be Judge for the District Court of the Virgin Islands for a period of ten years. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Black History Month Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to celebrate Black History Month and to pay tribute to Pennsylvanians whose work has made a real difference in our Commonwealth. This year we will honor three individuals who have dedicated themselves to uplifting the lives of others. We know that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``Life's most persistent and urgent question is: `What are you doing for others?' '' For purposes of today's remarks, I will substitute one word. I will substitute the word ``children'' for the word ``others'' and ask: What are you doing for our children? It is an important question, not only for those of us who gather for Black History Month today and to celebrate this month, but it is also an important question for every Member of Congress to ask themselves. This year we are going to honor these three Pennsylvanians: Kathy Elliott, Rosemary Browne, and Ellyn Jo Waller. All three have dedicated their lives to answering this urgent question and to building pathways toward hope for children in their communities. I can think of no calling more important and no mission more essential than this one: to help our children. It is an honor for me to have the privilege to recognize these remarkable Pennsylvanians. They are beacons in their communities, and they are each, in their own way, an inspiration to me in my work in the Senate and, I know, to the work of our staff as well. American children face a crisis created by policy choices made by adults over now several decades. Despite low unemployment and overall economic growth, children are being left out and left behind. Almost half of young children in the United States of America live in poverty or near poverty, with infants and toddlers at greatest risk. [[Page S1097]] Nearly half of children live in those circumstances. According to the Census Bureau's ``Supplemental Poverty Measure,'' which takes into account many of the government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals, childhood poverty worsened--worsened--in 2017 for the first time since the Great Recession. Poverty harms children both immediately and for a lifetime, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded in their 2019 seminal report, ``A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty.'' They found that poverty itself, especially when it occurs in early childhood or is persistent over time, is damaging to children in ways that last a lifetime. Specifically, the report finds the following--and I am quoting the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine: ``We find overwhelming evidence . . . that . . . a child growing up in a family whose income is below the poverty line experiences worse outcomes than a child from a wealthier family in virtually every dimension, from physical and mental health, to educational attainment and labor market success, to risky behaviors and delinquency.'' This is a crisis of untapped potential opportunities. It is a crisis, as well, of contributions not made. When a child faces needless obstacles to becoming the person he or she might become, it is a profound tragedy that affects all of us because we are denying not just that child but also that family, that child's family, their community, and our country the contributions that child could make if we were investing in that child. Over time, corrupt forces have perverted the basic notions of freedom while creating a society that works for corporate interests rather than our children's best interests. Freedom, as we know, is not simply the right to be left alone. Real freedom must include the opportunity--the affirmative ability--to achieve one's dreams. A country that claims to support the freedom of its people must provide opportunities to its citizens. For example, in his second inaugural address, President Obama said the following: We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other . . . these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They don't make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great. President Obama was right, and he knew then that there were and are today extraordinary people across the country who are working to give our children the opportunity to achieve and grow and contribute so much to our Nation. Today I will speak about three women who are doing this work in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: first, Rosemary Browne of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. For over 35 years, Rosemary Browne has been a leader in South Central Pennsylvania. During that time, she has held a number of critical roles in both the government sector and the nonprofit sector. She is currently the President and CEO of Alder Health Services, the mission of which is to improve the health and well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS and members of the LGBTQ community in a culturally competent, affirming, and empowering environment. The agency provides behavioral health, primary care, case management, wellness services, HIV/STD testing and treatment, family planning, and a host of other programs. Critically, Alder Health provides a safe haven for LGBTQ youth, and we know that significant progress has been made in advancing the rights of LGBTQ individuals. However, the progress has been uneven, and we are still falling far short, for example, in serving transgender young people, especially transgender young people of color who face disproportionally higher rates of suicide and violence. Alder Health, under Rosemary Browne's leadership, has played an indispensable role in helping us better understand the challenges of LGBTQ adolescents and providing them with the services they need. In 2018 Rosemary was appointed to Governor Tom Wolf's Pennsylvania Commission on LGBTQ Affairs, the first-of-its-kind statewide commission in the Nation. Rosemary's work at Alder builds on her primary work at the Highmark Foundation, where she led efforts to address emerging community health challenges and to make sure that uninsured and underserved populations in South Central Pennsylvania had the attention and the services that they needed. In this capacity, she spearheaded efforts to address bullying in our schools and our communities as a public health problem and also provided leadership on a strategy to reduce childhood obesity through school and community-based partnerships. Prior to her work at Highmark Foundation, Rosemary spent a decade at the Foundation for Enhancing Communities as a program officer and then director of programs and community investment, where she oversaw tens of millions of investment in community services and tuition assistance, giving hundreds of area college-bound students the opportunity to pursue higher education. Over her career, Rosemary Browne has heeded the call of service and lent her considerable passion and expertise in many different capacities. Whatever the role, the work has been the same: putting a spotlight on the needs of the underserved populations--LGBTQ youth, girls of color, and other underserved populations who lack access to healthcare, higher education--and always--always--helping them to obtain the services they need and to remove the obstacles that stand between them and their full potential. Service has always been a part of Rosemary's work, believing, as she does, that we are given resources and influence not for ourselves but for others. Also, like Rosemary Browne, Dr. Kathi Elliott's career has been defined by her service to others and to the children and young people of Pennsylvania. In this case, in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Kathi came to this work naturally, having had those values instilled in her by her late mother, the former police commander of Pittsburgh, Gwen Elliott. We have had South Central Pennsylvania with Rosemary Browne. Now we are in Southwestern Pennsylvania with Dr. Kathi Elliott. Kathi's mom, Gwen, the late police commander, was herself a trailblazer and someone whose story also should be told. We don't have time for two stories in one family today, but I will tell part of Gwen's story as well. Gwen was one of the first African-American women officers in the Pittsburgh Police Department, joining the department in 1976 and eventually rising to the rank of commander. In 2002, Gwen founded Gwen's Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering girls and young women through holistic, gender-specific programs, education, and experiences through after school--school and community-based programming throughout the communities in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Gwen's Girls has grown to provide service throughout the region with sites in Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg, and Clarendon, PA. Given her mother's leadership, it is no surprise that Dr. Kathi Elliott has demonstrated the same commitment to and passion for leadership, development, and empowerment of girls. Prior to accepting the position of CEO of Gwen's Girls in 2015, Kathi spent years providing leadership in social service, community, and individual mental health treatment. Kathi began her career as a victim advocate at the Center for Victims, working mostly in the juvenile justice space. She also remains a practicing psychiatric nurse practitioner. In that capacity, she provides psychiatric evaluations, medication management, and clinical consultation services and treatment at the VA of Pittsburgh--their outpatient mental health clinic. Dr. Elliott completed dual master's degrees in nursing and social work from the University of Pittsburgh and earned a doctor of nursing practice degree from Chatham University in 2014. Through Dr. Elliott's leadership, Gwen's Girls has become recognized as a frontrunner in the integration of evidence-based, clinical prevention and intervention policies and practices that enhance the child and social welfare system. [[Page S1098]] Gwen's Girls convenes an annual equity summit for Black girls to address the racial and gender biases that exist within the juvenile justice, health and wellness, child welfare, and education systems. Dr. Elliott has also remained a constant leading force and convener of the Black Girls Equity Alliance--a collaboration of over 75 stakeholders committed to addressing systemic inequities in the juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and healthcare systems. Dr. Elliott currently serves on the board of trustees at Chatham University. In December 2017, she was appointed by Mayor Bill Peduto to serve as a commissioner on the newly formed Gender Equity Commission for the City of Pittsburgh. Our third honoree today, Dr. Ellyn Jo Waller, though she was born in Queens, NY, we are proud to call her a daughter of Pennsylvania. Many in Philadelphia know her as a member and a leader at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, as well as the partner, in both life and ministry, of Dr. Alyn Waller, senior pastor of Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. Ellyn Jo Waller earned a bachelor of special education from Ohio University, a master of education in curriculum, instruction, and technology in education, and a doctor of education and curriculum, instruction, and technology in education, with an emphasis on literary education, from Temple University. Dr. Waller has devoted her passion and her time to promoting women's education and empowerment. She has especially devoted much of her time to combating human trafficking, both here in the United States and internationally. She is an active member of the Philadelphia Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition and serves as cochair of the religion subcommittee. In 2011, Dr. Waller founded She's My Sister, an anti-human trafficking ministry at Enon Tabernacle. She's My Sister works to ensure that the faith community in Greater Philadelphia is aware of the issue of human trafficking and also partners with the Greater Philadelphia Salvation Army on the issue of participating in street outreach, supporting and strengthening the drop-in centers, and advocating on behalf of victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. In October of 2015, under Dr. Waller's leadership, the ministry hosted its Inaugural Human Trafficking Awareness 5K Walk/Run to raise funds for a transitional residential program for young women exiting the life and aging out of the child welfare system. Internationally, Dr. Waller regularly participates in rescue and restoration efforts in Italy and South Africa. Dr. Waller also serves on a number of boards and provides community leadership in other ways. She is a member of the board of the City School in Philadelphia, on the advisory committee of the United Negro College Funds, Delaware Valley Women of Faith for Education annual luncheon, and is president of the Charitas Foundation, which is the philanthropic Waller family foundation established to positively impact the lives of individuals by sowing financial seeds into organizations that change lives through their missions. Dr. Waller has served on the Foundation Board of the Community College of Philadelphia since 2014 and currently serves as the president of the Foundation Board. Each of our honorees today--these three remarkable women--have worked tirelessly to ensure that our children can flourish and can fulfill their potential. When others may look the other way or even wash their hands of the solemn duty to help our children, our honorees have instead volunteered for service over and over again. To refer back to the first question I started with, ``What are you doing for our children,'' each of us has an obligation to answer that question. Each of our three honorees today have answered that question by devoting their lives to the urgent work of helping our children. These three remarkable women--all Pennsylvanians--have provided pathways to hope. For that, we owe them our deepest gratitude. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Abortion Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this week, the Senate will vote on two bills that will protect our most vulnerable citizens--literally, our babies. The first bill we will vote on is the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which was introduced by our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Sasse. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It requires physicians and healthcare providers to treat babies who survive an abortion with the same lifesaving care that other infants born at the same stage receive. While you might be forgiven for wondering, why would we need such a bill; surely, that standard must already exist in our law--unfortunately, no. There are no Federal laws requiring healthcare providers to care for abortion survivors, just as they would for any other infant in their care. One of the most notorious reasons why we need this law sits in the Governor's mansion in Virginia. About this time last year, our country was shocked and outraged by comments made by Gov. Ralph Northam--a pediatrician, believe it or not--about what should happen when a baby is delivered and survives an abortion. He said: The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. Rather than immediately doing everything possible to save the baby, to provide the same sort of care he would to any infant, he wants to sit around and decide whether the baby will live or die. That is not healthcare; that is infanticide. Voting for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is how each Member of this Chamber can go on record to say they are against killing innocent babies. While some are desperately trying to paint this as an anti-abortion bill, which would infringe on women's reproductive rights, those claims could not be further from the truth. There is nothing in this bill about limiting access to abortion, no mention of first, second, or third trimester abortions, nothing about overturning Roe v. Wade. There is one goal with this legislation and one goal only: to give every baby a fighting chance. In a rational world, we wouldn't be having this discussion but would, rather, unanimously be condemning this practice for the evil that it is. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill and, once again, vote to stop the practice of infanticide and protect babies who survive abortions alive. We will be voting on a second bill, which will provide protections for unborn children that are practiced in almost all of the civilized world. This is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that would make it a crime for doctors to perform abortions on unborn babies at or beyond 20 weeks. There is significant medical research that shows that unborn children at this stage experience pain. At 5 months into a pregnancy, these babies are beyond halfway to delivery. One of President's Trump's guests at the State of the Union a few weeks ago was 2-year-old Ellie Schneider--one of the youngest babies to survive in the United States. Ellie was born at 21 weeks and 6 days-- just 13 days beyond the point in time we are discussing. She weighed less than a pound at birth and is living proof of the medical achievements and advancements that have improved the chance of survival for extremely premature babies. Ellie and her mother Robin are an example of the impact this legislation would have on the lives of many Americans families. Unfortunately, just as our Democratic colleagues have tried to deceive the American people about the purpose of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, they are trying to mislead everyone about what this bill would do as well. First, this bill would apply only to elective abortions, not those involving rape or incest or where the life of the mother could be in danger. It in no way places the mother in legal jeopardy for seeking an abortion. It clearly and solely places responsibility on healthcare providers. [[Page S1099]] Passing this legislation wouldn't make the United States an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion practices. In fact, it would put us in line with international norms. Currently, only seven countries in the world allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. One, of course, is the United States. The other countries on the list should make all of us second-guess allowing abortions beyond 20 weeks--China, Vietnam, North Korea. Countries with a history of human rights violations are hardly the model we should aspire to. It is time to give every baby a chance to live and stop doctors from performing abortions on infants who feel pain. I am proud to be a cosponsor of both of these bills and stand with my colleagues in the fight for human life. Our friend from Montana, Senator Daines, established the first-ever Senate Pro-Life Caucus to fight for the lives of our most vulnerable citizens. A couple of weeks ago, he said: ``These back-to-back votes will present an opportunity for Senate Democrats and all of us to show the American people whether there are any limits at all to radical abortion extremism.'' We will soon learn the answer. I appreciate our colleagues--Senator Sasse, Senator Graham, and Senator Daines--for their leadership on this legislation and for consistently fighting for the most vulnerable among us. I will be a proud ``yes'' vote on both of these bills--yes to protecting newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and yes to a fighting chance for all babies. Coronavirus Madam President, we are returning to Washington, DC, from time spent in our States. I was happy, for one, to get time to spend in Texas with constituents. I traveled the State, as I am sure many of us did, traveling from Midland, to Ft. Worth, to Corpus Christi, and a number of spots in between. Texas is a pretty big place, so it takes a little time to move around, but it is really great to be able to hear from the folks I represent--the folks we all represent--about what they care about the most. One of the most interesting things to me is how little they talk about what is talked about inside the bubble here known as Washington, DC. In San Antonio, for example, I met with State and local officials to discuss their growing concerns over coronavirus. Lackland Air Force Base is one of the designated locations where Americans evacuated from overseas with suspected exposure to coronavirus are being held under the first Federal quarantine in more than 50 years. Folks were naturally concerned about the fact that these evacuees were scheduled to be transported to local civilian hospitals for testing rather than remaining on the base where they are quarantined. In our meeting, we were able to speak with not only the mayor and two council persons, but we were able to speak with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department about these concerns, and I am glad we were able to come up with a better solution. The Department of Health and Human Services has now updated their protocol to ensure that testing for coronavirus will be conducted at Joint Base Lackland's quarantine housing, so evacuees will not be sent to hospitals in the area for their tests. I appreciate my colleagues at the city who have been working overtime to keep their residents there safe. I am grateful to the administration for addressing our concerns and being responsive to those questions. On the very day we met, 90 evacuees were released from quarantine, and I am happy they are finally headed home. I am sure I am not as happy as they are after being quarantined. We owe a huge thank-you to the medical professionals who have and will continue to care for those in quarantine and to the Bexar County and San Antonio officials who are working to safeguard public health. Prescription Drug Costs Madam President, I traveled up I-35 and was in Ft. Worth at the Northside Community Health Center to hear about an entirely different healthcare challenge, which is high prescription drug costs. I met with local healthcare professionals, advocates, and patients to hear about their experiences with these rising costs, and I have introduced legislation to address them. For example, we heard from Randall Barker and his daughter Emma, who both have diabetes. They need insulin. They told me that one bottle of insulin costs upwards of $281. Randall continues to make sacrifices to afford the lifesaving drugs he and Emma need to lead healthy lives. As I mentioned, to address the high costs of prescription drugs, I introduced a bipartisan bill with our colleague, Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, called the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. The purpose of the bill is straight forward: to stop drug companies from gaming the patent system to keep their profits high. Patents, of course, are granted for scientific innovations in order to encourage more of them. What happens under the period of a patent is that whatever the item is--in this case, a drug--that company reserves the right to sell it exclusively, without any competition, in order to recoup its costs and incentivize innovation when it comes to these drugs. But when companies game the system by establishing patent thickets--multiple patents used to unfairly block competition--this prevents new drugs, as well as competing drugs at a lower price, from entering the market. For example, the most widely prescribed drug in America is called HUMIRA. It has more than 120 different patents, for no real purpose other than extending that period of exclusivity as long as possible to continue to make money. In Europe, there are five competing products, but in America, there is only HUMIRA. That is a patent thicket. That is gaming the system, and it is hurting American consumers. I appreciate the support from healthcare providers and advocates and patients I heard from in Ft. Worth. They encourage us to get our work done sooner rather than later. I have come to the floor twice and asked unanimous consent to pass the bill. It was voted unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. The Democratic leader blocked it both times. I hope he will reconsider his position. I am sure his constituents in New York would like a little bit of a break when it comes to prescription drug costs. I happen to think it has to do more with the upcoming election than it does the merits of the legislation. E-Cigarettes Madam President, I traveled to a couple of other Texas cities, where I was able to talk to people about the rise of e-cigarette use, particularly among teens. In Corpus Christi along the gulf coast and in Odessa in deep West Texas, I met with a range of local officials, health professionals, and community advocates about the impact of teen vaping. One study found that in the Permian Basin, in the middle of the Odessa area, about half of high school students used e-cigarettes and 25 percent of them had vaped in the past month. This study found that in schools, the average age of first-time e-cigarette users is just 13 years old. E-cigarettes--even the closed systems, where you can't add other ingredients, like the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, THC-- even in the closed systems that are designed to deliver only nicotine, nicotine is an addictive drug. When children get access to these addictive drugs, it may well end up being a gateway to other use-- whether it is tobacco or other drug use--later in life. It certainly encourages them to remain a user of this nicotine delivery device. I have introduced legislation called the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act, which would make it difficult for children to get their hands on these devices, particularly when they buy them over the internet. All it does is apply the same safeguards already in place for online purchases of tobacco--it applies that to e- cigarettes. Customers would have to verify their age at the time of delivery--a practice which, shockingly, does not currently exist. A recent survey published in the American Journal of Health Promotion found that 32 percent of underage e-cigarette users reported purchasing products online, making online sales the single largest source of purchases for underage users. We recently raised the age from 18 to 21 to get access to these e-cigarettes, but still, as these studies [[Page S1100]] indicate, use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices is epidemic in our middle schools and our high schools. It is dangerous to the physical and mental health of our children. That is something you would think we would be able to address. If we are going to turn the tide on e- cigarettes and prevent more young people from facing their deadly health consequences, passage of this legislation is a necessary first step. State Work Period Madam President, when I was home in San Antonio, I was able to help celebrate the investiture of one of our newest Federal judges, Jason Pulliam, who filled the vacancy in the Western District of Texas. Then I got to spend a little time in Midland with folks and talk about the importance of our oil and gas industry and why innovation in that space and concern about conservation and the environment were not mutually exclusive. At each step along the way, I was able to hear from countless other Texans about changes they would like to see coming out of Washington. They encouraged us to try to work together and avoid some of the partisan gridlock we have seen that characterized so much of the recent impeachment proceedings. It was a great week recharging at home. I came back ready to get back to work. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Veterans Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, the Disabled American Veterans is celebrating 100 years of helping military veterans, and I rise to recognize this remarkable occasion. Throughout its history, the DAV has been influential in identifying ways to best support our veterans--from pushing for the consolidation of veterans programs, in its early years, to direct outreach to veterans in communities with the launch of the Field Service Unit Program, to pressing for more funding for VA healthcare and benefits. There has been so much progress in advancing veterans services thanks to the DAV's efforts. The organization's members and partners have a lot to be proud of. DAV members have been leading advocates for injured and ill veterans and their families, which has made a difference for countless wounded warriors. The DAV's advocacy has helped and continues to build better lives for disabled veterans. We are thankful for the more than 1 million DAV members and auxiliary members who are doing great work to ensure our country keeps the promise we made to the men and women who have served in uniform. This week, members of the DAV Department of Arkansas are visiting the Nation's Capital to share the organization's legislative priorities for 2020. They are part of an extensive network that has been influential in identifying how the Department of Veterans Affairs can strengthen its services. They are among the DAV members from across the country who are in Washington, DC, to advocate on behalf of veterans. There is simply no substitute for coming to our Nation's Capital and visiting with Members of Congress to let them know of DAV's priorities. These include strengthening veterans mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs, improving benefits and services for women veterans and ensuring veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances receive full and timely benefits. The good news is we are working on these priorities because we all agree that our veterans deserve nothing less than quality care and the benefits they have earned. Last month, the Senate's Committee on Veterans' Affairs advanced the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act. This comprehensive legislation will strengthen our ability to provide veterans with the mental healthcare they need. It includes language Senator Warner and I authored to leverage the services of veteran-serving nonprofits and other community networks in our overall strategy to reduce veteran suicides. VA Ranking Member Tester and I are also working to improve services to our women veterans. Our Deborah Sampson Act legislation would eliminate barriers to care and services that many women veterans face and would help to ensure the VA could address the needs for women, which is so critical because they are more likely to face homelessness, unemployment, and to go without needed healthcare. We are pleased to have the support of the DAV for this important legislation. I am proud to cosponsor the Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Recognition Act, which would allow veterans who suffer from the effects of burn pits to get the benefits and services they have earned. I encourage my colleagues to support these bills so we can provide the resources that have been promised to our veterans. For years, the DAV members have supported the passage of the Blue Water Navy bill. Thanks, in part, to their advocacy, Congress approved this critical legislation last year that extends benefits to more veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals during the Vietnam war. The DAV's attention extends beyond the Halls of Congress. Its National Service Program helps to direct services to veterans across the country. I applaud the efforts of the more than 11,000 DAV members in Arkansas whose outreach is helping veterans to understand and access their benefits. They have spent countless hours in advising fellow veterans about the assistance they qualify for and in helping them fill out the paperwork to secure those benefits through the VA. One of the well-known services provided by the DAV is the transportation of veterans to VA medical centers and hospitals. In rural States like Arkansas, the services these volunteers offer is critical to meeting veterans' healthcare needs. The Arkansas fleet is made up of 16 vans. Last year, more than 6,600 veterans were driven to medical appointments with the help of volunteers who logged more than 18,000 hours behind the wheel. I look forward to continuing to work with DAV members as Congress crafts and reforms policies to improve services for veterans and their families. This country made a promise to our veterans that we must live up to, and I am proud to join with the DAV to ensure we follow through on that commitment. In working together, we can find solutions and take action to deliver the results veterans have earned and expect. We will continue looking to the DAV to understand how we can improve the lives of the men and women who have served in uniform. As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and as chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees VA funding, I have seen the dedication of the DAV to support disabled veterans in Arkansas and across the country. I am proud to recognize the DAV on its 100 years of engaging veterans, in its advocating to advance benefits, services, and care, and in its making a positive difference in the lives of veterans and their families. Remembering Charles Portis Madam President, on a separate subject, I also pay tribute to an Arkansas veteran who is one of the State's most famous sons--literary icon Charles Portis. Mr. Portis, the author best known for his 1968 Western novel ``True Grit,'' passed away on February 17, 2020. Born in December 1933, in El Dorado, AR, Portis spent his childhood in southern Arkansas. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served as an infantryman and, during the Korean war, reached the rank of sergeant before his discharge in 1955. Following his military service, he attended the University of Arkansas and wrote for the student newspaper, the Arkansas Traveler. He graduated from the university in 1958 with a degree in journalism. After graduating, Portis began his career as a reporter. He first worked at the Arkansas Gazette and then at the New York Herald Tribune. Though he voluntarily ended his journalism career in 1964, he used the skills and tools he had acquired as a reporter when he returned home to Arkansas to begin writing fiction. His most celebrated work is the Western classic ``True Grit.'' This book chronicles the efforts of a Yell County [[Page S1101]] teenager, Mattie Ross, along with U.S Marshal Rooster Cogburn, to avenge the death of Mattie's father at the hands of a drifter. The novel incorporates distinct references that are familiar to many Arkansans, and it depicts life on the frontier in what was then the wild, wild West. It was later adapted into film in 1969 and 2010. While it is his most well-known work, Mr. Portis also wrote four other novels and several shorter works of fiction and nonfiction. During his career, Portis was honored with the Oxford American's first Lifetime Achievement in Southern Literature award and was presented with the Porter Prize's 30th Anniversary Lifetime Achievement Award. ``True Grit'' has been praised as ``one of the great American novels.'' I take this opportunity to say how proud we are of Charles Portis and his legacy as an acclaimed writer and storyteller. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family as they remember and reflect on his life. I hope they find comfort in the fact that Mr. Portis has left a profound, lasting mark on Arkansas, as well as within our Nation's culture and literary traditions. Charles Portis had a remarkable career that will be remembered for a long time to come. I wish to honor him and his loved ones today and help to celebrate his life. On behalf of all Arkansans, we celebrate Charles Portis and his notable contributions to our State. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am pleased to have arrived on the Senate floor just a bit early to have heard the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, pay tribute to the DAV, Disabled American Veterans, and I very much want to join in his comments. I will also take a moment to thank him for his continual service for veterans, not only for those of Arkansas but of our Nation, and to recognize that he and I, since our days in the House of Representatives, have worked together on veterans' issues and both now find ourselves in positions in the hopes that we can do even more. To Senator Boozman, I say thank you for his continued efforts in making sure that all who serve our Nation have a better future and that the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the American people, do everything they can to make sure that what they are entitled to they will receive. So I thank the Senator from Arkansas. Tribute to Kent Cornish Madam President, I come to the floor to congratulate and pay tribute to a Kansan, Kent Cornish. He is retiring as the President of the Kansas Association of Broadcasters. He has spent the last 40 years in the broadcast business and the past 12 at the KAB in his advocating on behalf of broadcasters across our State. His dedication to making certain that rural communities in Kansas have access to quality broadcasting programming is a testament to his commitment to rural America at large. I, in particular, find that very pleasing as we know how important broadcasting is--local broadcasting in particular--to the future and well-being of the citizens of Kansas and, particularly, to those who live in our smallest communities. Kent is widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable and effective advocates for broadcasting in our State and around the country. He has been a leading voice in Topeka and Washington, DC, and is someone whom I hold in high regard. Kent is a native of Topeka who dedicated his life to broadcasting at an early age. With dreams of becoming a sportscaster, Kent attended the University of Kansas, where he earned a degree in journalism. He later attended Washburn University School of Law. After joining his hometown station, WIBW, as an intern, Kent worked his way up through the ranks to become a news reporter, anchor, and, eventually, an assistant news director. He also spent time at WDAF in Kansas City and later returned to WIBW. He left the station in 1980 and turned his attention to sales. He served as executive director of the Kansas Manufactured Housing Institute, but he could not keep his passions in the background. He left that job to return to broadcasting. Four years after leaving WIBW, he rejoined the station at which he would ultimately be named program director and operations manager. He later took over as general manager of KTKA, in Topeka, and eventually moved to Wichita to manage two television stations. After having spent decades running broadcast stations that Kansans from all over our State have relied on for both local and national news, he became the president and executive director of the Kansas Association of Broadcasters in 2008. Kent has had a long and successful career. He has earned esteemed awards, including the Grover Cobb Award from the University of Kansas. He has also served in numerous leadership capacities, including as the former president of the National Alliance of State Broadcasters Associations and as the former chairman of the Greater Topeka Chamber of Commerce and of the Topeka Community Foundation. Kent has been a powerful voice in the Nation's Capital for critical Federal policy, all framed in the larger lens of improving communities' access--people's access--to quality broadcasting. Like the rest of us from rural States like Kansas, Kent knows how quickly these communities can be forgotten and has always been determined to ensure access to local information, news, and weather. I am proud to call Kent a friend, and I look forward to seeing where his life now takes him. We meet many people in the business that we are in here in the U.S Senate and in politics in general. Kent is one of those whom you appreciate from the first day you become acquainted with him. He is straightforward and honest and tells it like it is. He is there to be supportive but is there to provide the necessary information for me and others to make the best decisions, not just on behalf of broadcasters but for those they serve in their communities. I add my voice to the well-deserved praise that he has received and will continue to receive. Congratulations and thank you to Kent for all his work. On behalf of Kansas broadcasters, you are highly regarded by them and their listeners. Your efforts have benefited Kansans and have improved our Nation. You will be missed at the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, but I have no doubt you will continue to make your community a better place. I look forward to many more years of friendship and working together on behalf of Kansans, and I thank you for your friendship and for all you have done to make our State a better place. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The Senator from Arkansas. Abortion Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week the Senate has another chance to vote on basic pro-life protections for babies, both born and unborn. This week we have another choice to live up to our Nation's highest principle--that every person has the right to life--or to stoop down to a narrow vision of humanity peddled by the abortion industry and its cronies. The first bill we are considering--the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when there is clear, scientific evidence that these young babies can feel pain in their mother's womb. The abortion lobby and all of its defenders will dispute this science, claiming that babies or fetuses--which is the euphemism they like to use for babies--can't feel pain at all or at least until the very latest stages of pregnancy. Anyone pedaling that myth must have never visited a neonatal intensive care unit, or the NICU, as they are usually called. Ask any one of those NICU nurses who cares for little preemies, even micro-preemies, and they will tell you how they can hold that small infant sometimes even in the palm of their hands, and they can see it grimace at a poke or a prod, maybe even slap away a tube or a needle as they approach--just as older kids do, just as some grownups do. The undeniable fact of fetal pain in these young babies influences every aspect of how we care for the young in our hospitals. We swaddle them with only the softest fabrics because their little bodies are so easily stimulated. We give them pain medicine during surgery, whether they are in the womb [[Page S1102]] or outside it. But we offer no such comfort during abortions, even in the latest stages of pregnancy, when abortionists crush a baby's skull and dismember it. Indeed, a scientific paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Medical Ethics noted a curious fact: Abortion is the only--the only--invasive procedure performed on unborn infants without pain medication. Then again, abortion is unusual in so many ways, as so few hospital procedures are designed to end a life, not to save a life. Are we comfortable with this state of affairs? Are we comfortable with the fact that more than 11,000 abortions were performed after 21 weeks when, again, we have clear, scientific evidence that these babies feel pain and that many of them could survive outside their mother's womb? I would suggest the American people are not comfortable with this situation, and we can do something about it in the U.S Senate this week. The second bill we are voting on, called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, is even more modest but perhaps even more urgent. This bill would simply protect babies when they are born alive during an abortion. I know it is amazing to even hear this, but there are rare and horrible cases in which babies are intended to be aborted, yet they are born alive, and the doctors are under no obligation to provide medical care for that young baby with a spark of God living in its soul. So this bill would simply obligate abortionists to render lifesaving medical care to a baby struggling for life on the operating table. It would require abortionists to act as those babies' friends and their doctors, consistent with their oath--not act like the baby's mortal enemy. Of course, the abortion lobby will tell you: Oh, this never occurs. All of their defenders in the media will say that it never occurs. But if you are being honest, the facts are, they do occur. The implication here is clear. They simply want us to look away from this horror. That doesn't mean we should, though, because, in fact, we do know--we do know--that babies can survive abortions. We have the numbers to prove it from a handful of States that require abortionists to confess when they fail to kill a baby in the mother's womb and, instead, murder it on the operating table. In Florida, 11 babies were born alive during abortions in 2017; another 6 were reportedly born alive in 2018; and another 2, last year. There were 19 precious little babies born alive during abortions in just 1 State in just 3 years. Other States have reported dozens more cases. Still, the abortion industry will dismiss these lives as a mere rounding error: Let's not even focus on it. It is not a serious matter. But forgive us if most Americans see the matter differently. These are precious little children, made in the image of God and endowed by him with the same worth and dignity as you and me and all of us. We have a duty to these little children. We have a duty not to look away from them. These pro-life bills are modest and humane. They have the strong support of the American people--clear majorities. But the real reason we must protect these babies is not because it is popular but because it is right. Every human being is created equal and deserves recognition and protection under our laws. It says so right in the preamble to our Declaration of Independence. Our country doesn't always live up to that noble principle. But right now we have an opportunity to live up to it just a little bit more, if only in just a few more cases--but those cases in which life is most vulnerable and most innocent. So I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity and protect life by acknowledging the humanity of these precious little children. We must not look away any longer. I yield the floor. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Coronavirus Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, the World Health Organization has now reported that there are 79,000 cases of coronavirus across at least 30 countries, with at least 53 confirmed cases here in United States. As the virus continues to spread, the global economy is already beginning to suffer. All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic, and the administration has no plan. We have a crisis of coronavirus, and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response. We must get a handle on the coronavirus and make sure the United States is fully prepared to deal with its potentially far-reaching consequences, but the Trump administration has been asleep at the wheel. President Trump, good morning. There is a pandemic of coronavirus. Where are you? Where is your plan? It is just amazing. As the crisis grows and grows, we hear nothing. Coronavirus testing kits have not been widely distributed to our hospitals and public health labs. President Trump's State Department overruled the recommendations of the scientists in the CDC and allowed infected passengers from a cruise ship to be flown back into the United States. Amazingly, at a time when we know that these pandemics can spread, this administration cut the CDC--the agency in charge of fighting these global viruses--with a 16-percent senseless cut to its budget. My fellow Americans, that is what they do on all these things. They just cut, and then the President tries to claim credit after we restore the money. He did it in his State of the Union. He was claiming, because of his great work with NIH, we are curing cancer. He has cut the NIH every budget, including this one. It is a disgrace how this man can say one thing and do another and confounding that it doesn't catch up with him with too many Americans and none of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and it is probably, right now, most dangerous and most egregious when it comes to coronavirus. It wasn't just that the President cut CDC last year. It follows years of drastic cuts to the global health division at CDC by the Trump administration. In 2018, CDC was forced to reduce the numbers of countries it operated in from 49 to 10. That is how bad it is. We have crises, and we have a world that is different, and this administration, instead of stepping up to the plate, runs away, listening to the clarion call of the far right: Just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, no matter how it affects people. In 2018, even worse, President Trump ordered the National Security Council to scupper its entire global health security unit and asked the Department of Homeland Security to do the same. We don't have epidemic teams in the National Security Council or DHS. I hope and pray to God that corona doesn't spread here, but if it does, we have been inadequately prepared because of President Trump's lack of leadership, lack of understanding science, lack of ability to listen to experts and do something about them instead of being concerned--it seems all the time--with his own ego. The President has not even taken the simple, sensible step of designating a single official to lead response efforts. In 2014, President Obama made the smart decision to appoint Ron Klain to lead an interagency response to the Ebola outbreak. But President Trump, in contrast, has hollowed out so many agencies that one of the key figures responding to coronavirus is Ken Cuccinelli, an immigrant hard-liner with no experience in public health. Unbelievable. A man totally unprepared for coronavirus, an ideologue--a rightwing, nasty ideologue who has spent his career kicking around immigrants--is now in charge of our fight against coronavirus. This is after the President cut CDC, eliminated the global health security units in Homeland Security and at the NSC, and we are in trouble. President Trump has not only failed to marshal a capable domestic response to the coronavirus; he has been slow to take action to confront the virus abroad. We all know that the best thing to do is to stop it from spreading abroad before it spreads to these United States. Of course, the President--ego above anything else--has been afraid to criticize President Xi or the Communist [[Page S1103]] Party of China for silencing dissent and obscuring the truth about the coronavirus--where it originated. When China obscures the truth, it puts Americans in danger. Where is President Trump's voice? The videos emerging from behind the Chinese Communist Party's internet wall show Chinese people pleading--pleading--with the international community to expose the scope and scale of this epidemic. The response so far by the Trump administration is exactly what happens when science skeptics with alternate facts try to run emergency response that requires expertise, planning, knowledge, money, cooperation, and science-based actions. But being anti-science is not just rhetoric. It hurts us. It hurts every American in many ways, and that is what President Trump and his administration do, and our Republican colleagues just blithely go along. After months of tiptoeing around the Chinese Communist Party, after 3 years of cutting funding for our epidemic response programs, President Trump simply has left the United States unprepared to confront a possible epidemic like corona. I will have more to say this week about what the administration must do to right the ship. National Defense Mr. President, on another front, again, the frustration of how this administration has conducted itself is unprecedented. I know some of my colleagues like to say that it is just like Obama. It isn't even close. Here are some more examples, unfortunately, on the trampling of the rule of law in this country. Emboldened by the refusal of Senate Republicans to hold him accountable in his impeachment trial, President Trump has been interfering with the Justice Department and retaliating against officials in his administration who dare testify truthfully before Congress. In the short week that we have spent in recess, the President has managed to plunge our country even deeper into chaos and certainly has shown the need for having a trial during impeachment with witnesses and documents, getting the truth and not rubberstamping President Trump's behavior. The President continued to purge his administration, firing officials who refused to pledge allegiance to the President over their allegiance to the Constitution. The President classified Bolton's book in another blatant attempt to cover up the facts. This is what dictatorships do-- dictatorships. They say something is classified; they hide the truth. It is a disgrace. The President continued to abuse the pardon power, in one instance commuting the sentence of a notoriously corrupt former official without rhyme or reason. Maybe most egregious of all, the President, angered that the Director of National Intelligence had the gall to conduct a bipartisan briefing for the House Intelligence Committee on foreign interference in our elections, replaced him with a political lackey--a yes-man as the head of DNI, where truth needs to be spoken probably more than any other place in the government. He has no experience in the intelligence community and is simply known as an acolyte to President Trump. With each of these actions--I hate to say it, but it is true; any objective person will know--President Trump brings our Nation closer and closer and closer to a banana republic, a government not of laws but of one man, a government where officials are asked to swear loyalty not to our country or the Constitution but to the President himself, a country where truth is obscured or covered up or deemed fake simply because it is not flattering to the President and is not what he wants to hear. President Trump's decision to dismiss the DNI Director, the Director of National Intelligence, is particularly pernicious. Our intelligence community is an institution that is supposed to report on threats to our country with accuracy, without regard to politics, to speak truth to power, to protect us. For the President to install a yes-man at the top of the intelligence community, to politicize a part of our government designed to be apolitical, to so debase the morale of the brave men and women in the CIA and the NSA, many of whom risk their lives for our safety, is a disgrace. There are media reports that our intelligence community has found that Putin continues to engage in activities to influence the outcome of our election. That is reportedly what former DNI McGuire's team was briefing Congress about. So today, along with my Democratic colleagues on the Banking and Foreign Relations Committees, I am sending a letter to Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mnuchin urging them to impose new sanctions on Putin and his cronies using existing sanctions authority. They have it; they can do it. Let me repeat that. The Trump administration has broad authority to impose sanctions for meddling in our elections. It does not need new legislative tools or approval. Our message is clear: Secretary Mnuchin, impose sanctions now. No one on the Intelligence Committee, Democrat or Republican, has disputed that Russia is attempting to interfere in our elections. Most say Russia has already started to do so. So this should be an easy, bipartisan effort. We are being attacked today in real time by foreign adversaries. This is not about party politics. It is not about what Trump doesn't want to hear. The Russians wanted him to win in 2016 and in all likelihood will want him to win in 2020. It is about the oath we swear to defend our Republic. Americans--I don't care what their party, what their ideology--if they start believing our elections are not on the level, this democracy will be in big trouble. I hope my Republican colleagues will join us. The administration could impose sanctions tomorrow, and it should. A repeat performance of 2016--another campaign of foreign influence in our elections--is perhaps the greatest threat to our democracy. The Founding Fathers thought so. Read what James Madison said. We demand that Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mnuchin identify and target all those determined to be responsible for ongoing election interference. Anything less would be an abdication of their responsibility, their sacred, solemn responsibility to protect and defend the United States from the serious threat to our national security and the integrity of our electoral process. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">IMNWSE-INS3012567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5Y97-YFT1-F0YC-N0RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""9733""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""56562""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""201""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""LOGOS""/><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=""25"" month=""02"" year=""2020""><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
