12_05_2023,affordable housing,This is a key  Goal of our downtown uptown and surrounding neighborhoods plan. It's been in the housing study So we would look at we would certainly be looking at proposals that would include affordable housing New housing units in any configuration and then activating ground floor spaces neighborhood serving retail Looking at ways that perhaps we could do small business incubation there adding cultural uses attracting new sectors diversify downtown and looking at kind of alternative so education our research technology and  you know not just a co-working space or you know a restaurant or retail
12_05_2023,affordable housing,"I also think, you know, for some of the other properties, again, there's a mix, right? Some of them are significantly older, but some of them date from [ORGANIZATION], and they don't have quite the same historic character as others. I would hate to get in the [STREET] of something like development of affordable housing on some of those properties where maybe the same restrictions don't apply on those properties anymore."
12_05_2023,affordable housing,we have mr [ORGANIZATION] that signed up to speak on this item yes ma'am and then after this we'll go to a call to the public thank you sir thank you [TIME] mr [PERSON] you have [TIME] sir good [TIME] mayor [PERSON] and uh city manager [PERSON] um i speak uh in support of the sale of properties with ORG1 footprint  Taken into account the comments by [ORGANIZATION] and mr. [PERSON] And in that vein we support the call for project ORG2 that before the city sells the these particular properties that they adopt guidelines and standards and over in the overall vision of [ORGANIZATION] which includes a heritage corridor with musings FAC0 performance arts and  affordable housing mr. [PERSON] would you pointed out a new FAC1 affordable housing community gardens and other services one thing that I think so pointed out what else do we need in here I think that [ORGANIZATION] ought to be married with streetcars streetcars are [PERSON] provides a mode of transportation it will bring the tourists that will bring the visitors if you develop a small spur to [ORGANIZATION] that takes these folks to all these things that we just mentioned  [LOCATION] that we revive the streetcars from [PERSON] to FAC2 again and go to GPE2.
04_13_2021,homelessness,Another good opportunity is [ORGANIZATION]. This is actually a project put forward by [ORGANIZATION] to address youth homelessness. So homelessness in youths aged [ORGANIZATION].
04_13_2021,homelessness,"I will say with this one there was not a local match identified. And so that that would perhaps put us at a disadvantage, but there's a lot of community support for this project. And so we thought it worth pushing forward, especially because it does address one of our priority areas which is homelessness, housing and homelessness."
04_13_2021,homeless,"My next question is, I know you said everything has a match except for the homeless housing. Where did that match come from? Or where are those matches coming from?"
05_11_2021,homeless,"And the motion passes unanimously. That brings us to page 7 to the regular agenda to item number 18. This is discussion in action to direct the city manager to provide an update on the transition plan from the temporary facilities, providing services for the homeless at the FAC0 site, as well as funding allocation details regarding the 10th Amendment to the City's DATE0 45th Year Annual Action Plan for the Community Development Block Grant Coronavirus Phase 3."
05_11_2021,homeless; homelessness,"Good morning, everybody. I wanted the [ORGANIZATION] Manager to provide an update on the transition plan from the temporary facilities providing services for the homeless at the [ORGANIZATION] site, as well as funding allocations details regarding the 10th amendment to the [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] annual action plan for [ORGANIZATION]. During the pandemic, the [ORGANIZATION] Council has made large allocations of funds in area of homelessness, including via multiple amendments to the CDBG-CV allocation."
05_11_2021,homeless; homelessness,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the Executive Director for [ORGANIZATION]. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank [PERSON] and the staff of ORG1 for recommending funding for the coalition as well as all of the homeless programs in this [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] action plan. And to also ask that the city continue supporting projects focused on preventing and ending homelessness."
05_11_2021,homeless; homelessness,"In [ORGANIZATION], the coalition has served as the lead entity for [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care for the homeless, providing services, training, and technical assistance on the complex issues that all of our homeless assistance providers encounter [PERSON]. We also serve as the administrator for the operation of the region's homeless management information system and provide training, technical assistance, and help desk support to the numerous programs that enter their client data into that system. We have a long-standing relationship with [ORGANIZATION] in addressing homelessness and appreciate the continued support of these activities through the funding recommended before you DATE2."
05_11_2021,homeless; homelessness,"I'm very excited about a new project called [ORGANIZATION] that we are being funded for, or recommended for funding for. It's a brand new intervention for our city with the primary objective to divert households from entering the homeless system altogether. This project, it combines intensive case management,  active listening, creative thinking, along with financial assistance to provide solutions for households who are literally at the front door of our shelters."
05_11_2021,homeless; homelessness,"This is going to be a real carefully coordinated effort with many of our partners, as well as [ORGANIZATION], as the operator of the community's coordinated entry system. So the launch of this program will prevent households on the edge of homelessness from entering our system, helping them safely avoid a traumatic and stressful homeless episode. It will take pressure off the shelter system and reduce overall homelessness in our community."
05_11_2021,homeless,"We build a savings nest, a system in completing forms for services such as [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] applications, and other government benefits to improve their quality of life.  and prevent them from being exploited and becoming homeless. So this program provides an opportunity for these individuals to maintain limited independency and increase their economic stability. So therefore we want to express our full support of the DATE0 DATE1 action plan to continue nurturing and promoting a healthy and sustainable community and"
04_26_2022,homelessness,"First taking [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION], the occasion provides a fitting opportunity to recognize the outstanding contributions of transgender people in [ORGANIZATION] and everywhere. And whereas President [PERSON] said [PERSON] when he became the first American president to designate the Transgender Day of [LOCATION] with the ORG0 proclamation, this designation recognizes the generations of struggle, activism, and courage that have brought our country closer to full equality for transgender and gender non-binary people.  that has given countless transgender individuals the bravery to live openly and authentically, shaping an increasingly accepting world in which peers at school, teammates and coaches on the playing field, colleagues at work, and allies in every corner of society are standing in support and solidarity with the transgender community. And whereas discriminatory and  discriminatory attitudes towards the transgender community, especially against black, indigenous, and other women of color foster high rates of violence, homelessness, and economic instability."
08_23_2022,homeless,"And again, just doing it for our services and really making sure that there's no one  That's that's being left out of the mix for whatever reason because we also have homeless people in that in that boat as well And transient folks as well and we want to make sure we account for that So we're looking at it a little bit differently this go-around than we did [ORGANIZATION] And we'll continue also the city manager The mayor have meetings with the county on I think a DATE1 basis"
04_27_2021,homeless; homelessness,The next item is number 43. This is Discussion and Action on a Resolution to approve a 10th Amendment to the City's DATE0 DATE1 Annual Action Plan for the Community Development Block Grant Coronavirus Phase 3 to create a COVID-19 Emergency Shelter Capacity Expansion Project to supplement [ORGANIZATION] and to create [ORGANIZATION]. Motion to approve?
04_12_2022,homelessness,"And so we're very, very excited to be able to have them as part of our civic empowerment team, which is focused on equity and access. You all are very familiar with our human services division, which is very much about the public services that we offer, addressing homelessness, mental health, substance use, food security, et cetera. And then obviously a lot of our neighborhood development programs like [ORGANIZATION] and the ORG1 public facilities  work that we do."
04_12_2022,homeless,"One volunteer that comes to mind is at [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], she's been there for over [ORGANIZATION] and she started as a recipient of the food pantry when she went to go and ask for a food box. She loved the fact that she wanted to give back to her community so she signed up as a volunteer has been there for [ORGANIZATION] now. Even through the pandemic she she still volunteered and now she's responsible for handing out snacks and nonperishable food for our homeless."
04_12_2022,homeless,"This would be to establish a food resilience hub on [ORGANIZATION] to include a solar demonstration and a community garden. The next project that we're considering is the homeless welcome center for a cost of $950,000 with a federal cap of $1 million and a 20% match. The next one is the FAC0 expansion, which the total project cost is 1.5 million and the federal cap is 1 million with a 20 percent match."
06_22_2021,homelessness,"So we have a city of [ORGANIZATION], city of [ORGANIZATION], city of [ORGANIZATION], reaching out to you asking, what are you guys doing on fair housing? What are you folks doing on homelessness? How are you guys doing this whole thing with temporary emergency shelters?  We're very excited."
06_22_2021,homelessness,"We exist and are funded largely because of CDBG. Public services, which includes all of the funding for social service programs that I've mentioned already, including homelessness, is capped by the federal government at 15% of that total grant. So we are limited in the number of dollars that we're able to deploy to those services."
06_22_2021,homelessness,"The remainder of the funds are allocated to bricks and mortar projects that are awarded through a competitive process that you all are familiar with that measure alignment with community needs. I mention that because it's very important when we start to talk about spending CDBG dollars facility projects, we need to make sure that we are staying in alignment with the goals of this community  and the intent of the federal entitlement, which is to address vulnerabilities in our community, as I've described. [ORGANIZATION] is dedicated entirely to addressing homelessness in our community."
06_22_2021,homeless,"And you can see on the slide here, at just over a half a million dollars, you can see that it just scratches the surface in terms of the need in [ORGANIZATION]. Again, for context.  not including rental assistance, which is in essence homeless prevention. DATE0, we deployed over $10 million to address the needs of the homeless in our community."
06_22_2021,affordable housing,"And we've had a longstanding and very fruitful partnership with [ORGANIZATION] in deploying those funds. Home funds at [DATE] are dedicated to promoting affordable housing development, and it's driven largely by the goals of our regional housing plan. Next slide, please."
06_22_2021,homelessness; affordable housing,"So with those funding sources that I've mentioned, our team is charged with supplementing efforts to address homelessness,  support affordable housing solutions, stimulate economic growth in low-income communities, improve community health conditions through access to medical and mental health, promote programs that improve physical health and well-being, as well as improve access to child care and developmental education, ultimately improving quality of life specifically for the most vulnerable of all. All of that with $10.2 million.  100% of the programs that we fund, and this is what makes this funding a little different, must serve low to moderate income communities or populations of presumed benefit. And that's everyone ranging from folks that are suffering from instances of domestic violence, elderly persons, severely disabled adults, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, migrant farm workers, and especially and including individuals experiencing homelessness."
06_22_2021,homeless,"Thanks, [ORGANIZATION]. So next slide, please. And so first we're going to take a deeper look into our homeless and housing programs."
06_22_2021,homeless,"So as [ORGANIZATION] had mentioned, right, through these programs, we were investing about $1.[ADDRESS] to call home. And so as we kind of touched base on already, right, $1.6 million seems like a very large investment. But if we kind of compare this, right, to what we've received under the COVID CARES Act, this is only a fraction of what we put under or through homeless and housing programs through our COVID relief funds."
06_22_2021,homeless; homelessness,"And so it is for this exact reason, right? That for all areas of impact, including this one, that our department is very strategic in how we utilize those entitlement dollars to ensure that we are addressing local goals of our city. So here you'll see that there are seven components to homelessness and housing, all of which carry out functions that complement one another and in total create this continuum of impact, right, which provides stability and safety through housing options and also case management for those who are either at risk or who are literally homeless."
06_22_2021,homeless,"And so in general, right, our homeless and housing programs provide suitable housing options and a full range of supportive services for an array of vulnerable populations, right? We touched base on the seniors, persons with disabilities. We also have those who have escaped family violence."
06_22_2021,affordable housing,"So under that regional housing plan, the largest focus was on the development of additional affordable rental housing units, specifically for families around a household income of about $30,000. That's where we're seeing a growing gap in affordable housing units. And so a majority of the home funds are going to go towards housing."
06_22_2021,affordable housing,"multifamily construction, you'll see that through all of these funds, we're looking to add 282 affordable housing units. That's through rehab or development of new units. And this is a lot more than we've been able to do in the past, because in the past, we've been funding essentially 100% of every unit.  that we developed."
06_22_2021,homeless,"This will be [ORGANIZATION] that we're proposing to fund two separate programs. One of them is for homeless veterans that do not qualify for [ORGANIZATION] benefits, and the other is actually leveraging the ORG1 program where they already provide tenant-based rental assistance. And this essentially is allowing us to double the amount of ORG2 units that they're able to put out, which then frees up public housing units for those that are on the waiting list for public housing."
06_22_2021,homeless,"Could you tell me [ORGANIZATION] what were the figures for that same homeless and housing assistance? Or do you know?  I didn't have that number off the top of my head, but I can [STREET] back with you. I will tell you that it's likely very, very similar, only slightly less."
06_22_2021,homeless,"My name is [ORGANIZATION], and I'm the Director for [ORGANIZATION]. So I really just wanted to take this opportunity to thank [PERSON] and the staff of ORG1 for recommending funding for the coalition, as well as all the other homeless assistance programs that are receiving support in this [ORGANIZATION]'s actual action plan. And really to also acknowledge the...  work in this [ORGANIZATION]-long planning process that [ORGANIZATION] described [DATE]."
06_22_2021,homeless; homelessness,"I know it's been particularly difficult given the unprecedented challenges brought on by the pandemic. The coalition has served as the [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] lead since [ORGANIZATION], a longstanding partnership with [ORGANIZATION] in addressing homelessness in our community, administering over $3 million DATE1 homeless assistance programs. We really appreciate the support for our [PERSON] grant."
06_22_2021,homeless; homelessness,"This allows us to provide coordination activities, networking opportunities, training, and technical support for our community's homeless assistance program providers, as well as our HMIS grant, which enables us to continue providing training, technical assistance, and help and support for the numerous programs that enter client information into the database. Also, in alignment with the [ORGANIZATION]'s strategic plan, the [ORGANIZATION]'s resilience strategy, and federal strategic initiatives to make homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring, we are very excited to launch a pilot program [ORGANIZATION] with the support of the [ORGANIZATION] to divert households from entering the homeless system altogether. This collaborative project is designed to provide solutions to households that are on the edge of homelessness and divert them from entering the system altogether."
06_22_2021,homeless; homelessness,"This exciting project, along with all of the other homeless assistance projects recommended for funding for [ORGANIZATION], will continue to reduce overall homelessness in our community. So once again, thank you to [ORGANIZATION], and thank you so much for your continued support. Thank you."
06_22_2021,homeless,"And the motion passes unanimously. The next item is number 29 and this is discussion in action on a resolution authorizing the city manager to sign all contracts, contract amendments, and related documents between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to receive  [ORGANIZATION] ORG0 funds and authorizing the Director of [ORGANIZATION] to sign all contracts, amendments, and related documents. Motion approved."
04_25_2023,homelessness,"families, workers, that they can open a bank account and therefore they cannot be part of our booming economy and help them to integrate, right? People in homelessness status or transgender has been mentioned, veterans. So I think this is for everybody in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_25_2023,unhoused,"There are many vulnerable groups in [ORGANIZATION] that are in need of municipal IDs such as unhoused people, youth in foster care systems, low income individuals, people with mental health illnesses and disabilities, and formerly incarcerated individuals reentering society in order to get back on their feet. Studies have shown that not only having an ID affects primarily black and brown individuals as they are asked to provide IDs at a higher risk than people such as myself in situations that are not really necessary such as paying a check or encountering the police. I thank you for giving the time for this discussion to happen and I hope that item 21 passes so that we can have a city that truly puts equality and inclusion first."
04_25_2023,homeless,"Municipal IDs have the potential to benefit a wide range of individuals including undocumented immigrants, homeless individuals, and transgender individuals who may face significant barriers to obtaining identification through traditional means. By providing a municipal ID, these communities can access vital services such as opening a bank account, accessing healthcare, or even simply providing their identity to law enforcement. Item 21 promotes inclusivity, supports marginalized communities, and facilitates access to important services."
04_25_2023,homeless,"You have already heard from my colleagues and the residents of [ORGANIZATION] why this community service identification is vital to be able to carry out [ORGANIZATION]-to-[ORGANIZATION] activities and how we can be a better community. It's important to mention that the creation of this community service identification would be for everyone in [ORGANIZATION], to use it as a secondary ID to which could be linked to our city services. But most importantly, it would allow [ORGANIZATION] residents who are unable to obtain a state identification due to being homeless, going through a transgender process, or a survivor of domestic violence to feel integrated and be able to access those same services."
04_25_2023,unhoused,"I read in a statement that this will also help individuals who are unhoused  It will help individuals have access to libraries, which we know currently we charge individuals in the county. We want to be able to increase the education in this community. But I think that the banking element is a really important part of this."
04_25_2023,unhoused,"I won't even be able to take them to the doctor's appointment without my ID. And so it's incredibly important that we talk about what can we do to help bring all persons, whether you're a veteran, unhoused, whether you're an immigrant, how to bring you out of the shadows so that we can make you part of our community. Sorry, I'm super loud, so I don't know if the mic is on still."
04_25_2023,homeless,"So if someone on the call can...  Kindly answer that question is how exactly that's gonna help veterans I believe we have command sergeant major [PERSON] if you could help us out with that, please Thank You representative [PERSON] are for the record [PERSON] chief military officer for the city Yeah, we've definitely experienced problems with our veterans that don't have ID cards Case in point is our homeless veterans a lot of our homeless veterans Unfortunately lose all their documentation during the time that they're homeless Well, that's through being  you know subject of a criminal event like being robbed or mugged or just through the course of their time traveling they lose all their documentation when they lose their documentation it slows the entire process down really bogs it down a lot we have to try to find them an identification just to get them their basic support services started and we don't have identification that causes problems another case in point a repatriated veteran  a deported veteran that becomes repatriated that comes back to our community wants to start a life here doesn't have an identification card it slows the process down it really hinders the issue a municipal id could definitely help we can't even seem to get them processed through ORG0 very well without an identification card so we've brought this up we've been talking with  with Miss [PERSON] and the team, the city manager, and we're looking for solutions to this."
04_25_2023,homeless; affordable housing,"Mayor [PERSON], that's a very, very good comment. Just so you know, from our position, it's always about the value added. And so when we are looking at applications not just for affordable housing, but for homeless services, for other different services that we might offer under these funds, and they're very limited, and inflation is certainly hurting,  a lot of these dollars, we look for that value added to your point."
04_25_2023,affordable housing,"We've been to that community in [ORGANIZATION], I think you're referring to, I'm not the one in [PERSON], and it's been a very, very useful experience because they have on-site job training, they have all kinds of education for their individual healthcare, but one of the things that I can add in regards to the  housing authority application is that these folks are really leaning in in regards to transportation for the clients, you know, [ORGANIZATION] income tax preparation. There's food pantry and I'm sure that their CEO can probably speak to that better than I can, but we would never just take an application where someone's just building affordable housing units or someone's just doing something, a single thing. It's all about that ballot added"
10_12_2021,homeless,"Representative PERSON0 not present. item number 30 is a public hearing on an ordinance amending title 10 alcohol prohibited in public places [DATE] you and i are backwards here yes item [DATE] is a public hearing on an ordinance amending title 10 alcohol prohibited in public places to define [INSTITUTION] possesses and possession and to add [INSTITUTION] to the area where the offense can occur chief [PERSON], Mayor and also Assistant Chief PERSON2."
10_12_2021,homeless,"If we could go to the next slide, please. So the purpose is to improve the quality of life for residents and persons experiencing homeless in and around homeless shelters by reducing nuisances related to drinking and... The next few slides are going to be by City Attorney [PERSON]."
10_12_2021,homeless,"This section functions similarly. Under [ORGANIZATION], the legislature gave us the authority to prohibit open containers and the consumption of alcohol within 1,000 feet of a [INSTITUTION] or substance abuse treatment center. This pertains to public streets, alleys, and sidewalks  and it doesn't attempt to control other spaces."
10_12_2021,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. This slide points out that the [ORGANIZATION] code specifically limits us from further regulating open containers beyond the CBD, the central business district, and areas around homeless shelters, substance abuse treatment centers, and around the streets, sidewalks, and alleys. [ORGANIZATION] slide, please."
10_12_2021,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. Now we're looking at a definition for [INSTITUTION] and possession or possesses to the ordinance. [INSTITUTION] would be defined to mirror the language found in the TAVC and will read  a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter or other facility that is designed to provide temporary living accommodations to individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate residence."
10_12_2021,homeless,"Possesses or possession is going to be a definition familiar to law enforcement and to city prosecutors alike from our state's penal code. The definition will read, actual care, custody, control, or management. And our last addition to the ordinance is the functional language making it unlawful to possess an open container or consume alcohol within 1,000 feet of a [INSTITUTION] outside of [ORGANIZATION] on public streets, alleys, sidewalks, or pedestrian ways."
10_12_2021,homeless,"The addresses of the shelters listed were received through [ORGANIZATION] and may not encompass all shelters throughout the city due to some confidential locations for vulnerable populations. An example of this would be [ORGANIZATION]. If the IT can click on the hyperlink, we can show you a list of the, from the homeless coalition."
10_12_2021,homeless,The maps that were showing afterwards that would be the inclusion into the current ordinance that would add the definition of homeless shelters and enforcement under the homeless shelters within a thousand feet. So this would this would add additional areas outside of the central business zone? That is correct sir.
10_12_2021,homeless,"This comes to us through the TAVC code, sections 109.35 and 109.36. Those two statutes give cities the ability to regulate open container consumption of alcohol in those specific places pointed out, the central business districts of the cities  within 1,000 feet of homeless shelters or substance abuse treatment centers. And as you also saw it foreclosed, there's a possibility of implementing other regulation on open container."
10_12_2021,homeless,"And this is probably another obvious question, but this would not discriminate between somebody carrying an open container that would either be a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,  somebody that would be at a [INSTITUTION] or a resident that would live a block or across the [STREET] from a [INSTITUTION] that had an open container it would not discriminate anybody that had an open container could would commit an offense with this. That's correct. There would be no difference between a local resident and  who would be in violation of this ordinance and a person who's utilizing a [INSTITUTION]."
10_12_2021,homeless,"They were getting a lot of traffic from homeless in those surrounding areas and so this came as a result of trying to do something responsive to their concerns. Okay. And then the Chiefs are, are y'all seeing something similar in terms of some of some of these disruptions in the neighborhoods arriving these areas from your officers?"
10_12_2021,homeless,"Yes, sir. We're data driven. So one of the difficult things for us to present a council was the fact that  Historically, we don't capture that information on open containers near homeless shelters because it is not currently in the fence at the time."
10_12_2021,homeless,"But the data and some of the calls for service pointed towards that and we feel that this would definitely help in protecting everyone. And to be clear, the open container amendment is not targeting the homeless. It actually protects everyone, citizens, neighborhoods, homes."
10_12_2021,homeless,"homeless shelters, the employees, and the homeless themselves who are vulnerable at times. Okay. Well, I think that kind of rounds out the question."
10_12_2021,homeless,"I mean, when this discussion first was had, remember when it was brought up before, the biggest thing that struck me was the fact that  in essence outside of the central business area and if these proposed areas around these homeless centers, so pretty much it's legal within the city of [ORGANIZATION] to have an open container on any sidewalk or public [STREET]. And I was not aware of that at all and I know that there is issues or concerns about behavior related towards alcohol consumption but the fact that state law legalizes and allows for  that state law allows open container on city streets, whether that's on FAC0 or FAC1 or FAC2 is very surprising and a little bit troubling, but that's what state law is, is that correct, Chief?"
10_12_2021,homeless,"I think that if we could really just blanket the whole city with this policy, I would have no issue with it. But I don't know why we are asking [ORGANIZATION] to essentially patrol  homeless shelters. Substance abuse, addiction are very real things that our homeless community deals with."
10_12_2021,homeless,"But when someone calls my office and says, there's a homeless individual living in our alley, we don't call [ORGANIZATION], we call ORG1 or another organization that can help. And I really wish that that had been the solution here. And I have a lot of heartburn about doing this."
10_12_2021,homeless,"I think that the comment was it's up to a $500 fine for drinking outside of a [INSTITUTION]. So we're just going to be constantly finding individuals in these shelters that can't afford these fines until they're placed in jail. I mean, I don't understand how that's helping the community, but I know that we do have public comment, correct, Ms. [PERSON]?"
10_12_2021,homelessness,"And then also the shelters that we spoke to were also in favor of this. So we have, you know, spent a tremendous amount of time, especially since the start of the pandemic, addressing homelessness and expanding both the services we offer and the partnerships we have with the other providers. And like you were saying, Representative PERSON0, we do call those providers if there is a problem."
10_12_2021,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Deputy Director for [ORGANIZATION]. And I do want to point out a couple things.
10_12_2021,homeless,"It comes with a $500 fine. As you work with the homeless, you're working with individuals that don't have the ability to pay the fine, and if there is a slim chance that they do, I'm just going to be quite blunt, they have no desire to pay the fine. Okay."
10_12_2021,homelessness,And so we don't want to create a cycle of homelessness as it relates to in and out of the county jail as an example. And I would like to suggest that we have some significant discussions with regard to the approach that we take. It could be modeled for example after the [ORGANIZATION] program and the reason I bring the [ORGANIZATION] program up to the forefront is it's focused on those that have a significant mental health diagnosis.
10_12_2021,homeless,"I mean, to me, you're targeting the homeless population. I mean, it's one, somebody got beat up. Two, you're putting out restrictions."
10_12_2021,homeless,And the other one that I'm going to talk in a few is going to be public transportation. You do not provide public transportation to the homeless population on [ORGANIZATION]. So that's three arguments that I have.
10_12_2021,homeless,"oh they have an open container is this person a resident or are they homeless before they make a decision you'll get sued for that and this ordinance  crafted to single out those who are homeless you have made exceptions for everybody else but if you're homeless you're gonna pay and then you're gonna have this unending [STREET] between somebody who's an alcoholic and is drinking going to jail spending time in jail come back is homeless drinking back in jail back and forth back and forth the cycle is not broken you take up time with police  [STREET] time, paying for people in jail, possible injuries to our officers."
10_12_2021,homelessness,This is not a solution. This only perpetrates the homelessness that we have in this community. And you are targeting.
10_12_2021,homeless,"You're going to get hit with...  lawsuits for profiling and discrimination because you have singled out a portion of our population for special enforcement and they're going to nail you to the wall the only good thing coming out of that is they won't be homeless anymore they'll have a lot of money to live on i ask that you rethink this postpone it go back and look at the issue maybe you can find something that will actually work  incarceration of the homeless never works it hasn't worked it's not going to work you got to be smarter than the rock you're trying to break so please postpone this and rethink it thank you that concludes public comment on this item mayor thank you we have represent milliner Thank You mayor chief is out owed right now currently do you know if  [ORGANIZATION] is accepting Class C violations like someone has [DATE] or outstanding traffic tickets Business  It's been currently in effect and also when we look at this ordinance in regard to the health and food buffer and all, one of the things we need to keep in mind, and I stated earlier, it's not targeting the homeless individuals. It's protecting the neighborhood, homeless shelters, the homeless individuals because they can be vulnerable. Alcohol is not allowed in homeless shelters."
10_12_2021,homeless,"If we address it at that point, no one's talking about picking up individuals and incarcerating them. They have the opportunity in a,  courtroom to state their case as well. So again, it's to protect everyone to include the homeless."
10_12_2021,homeless,"I just have a couple of questions. You mentioned, is this just to blanket homeless or you said the general public? The general public representative."
10_12_2021,homeless,"So basically it's not gonna impact anyone living on their private property or their backyard as such. This is only for the alleys, the streets and the sidewalks. Again, to make sure that this is understood clearly,  It will address anyone in the area and not just the homeless."
10_12_2021,homeless,"Actually, it protects the homeless, like I stated earlier. They're vulnerable. They also need help."
10_12_2021,homeless,"So by not being allowed, obviously, for obvious reasons into a [INSTITUTION] with alcohol, sometimes you're exploited on the outside part of the areas. And I think this is something that will assist them as well. Okay, thank you."
10_12_2021,homeless,"And although we all have training in mental health and such, this would have to be something that would have to be explored. I wouldn't be in the position to say we could go administrative on it from the beginning or make references on it. Because again, it's not just gonna be the homeless that are out there that are gonna be receiving or being addressed in regards to this ordinance."
10_12_2021,homeless,"It's gonna be other individuals that come into the area as well to familiar territory and exploiting on the homeless. Okay, thank you. You're welcome."
10_12_2021,homeless,Would there be any any again? Help me understand I guess the process from operations relating to PD if there was a call-in for inebriated person near a [INSTITUTION] or some of these institutions Would there be a decision made to send out a see it [ORGANIZATION] crew? [ORGANIZATION] crew sorry  Or would a [ORGANIZATION] unit or would it be whatever officer was available?
10_12_2021,homeless,And that would be that would be a monetary cost or that would be jail time? Like Mr. [PERSON] mentioned earlier sir it would be up to a $[ADDRESS] that would determine the additional steps after that. And that $500 would be whether or not it was somebody that was having an open container outside their own home across from a [INSTITUTION] or somebody who was homeless themselves.
10_12_2021,homeless,So then a warrant would be added. And that's outside of law control as prosecutors and outside of law enforcement's control as well. So that would be a burden for a homeless person.
10_12_2021,unhoused,"While we know that a large population of our unhoused individuals do have mental  issues with mental health, have been diagnosed with mental health, if they are not in crisis, the ORG0 team is not appropriate for them. And so, and I'm not trying to attack, I'm just trying to clarify, right? So if someone is unhoused, they're at a shelter, they're drinking, they're not necessarily in crisis."
10_12_2021,homelessness,"We would immediately contact the folks at [ORGANIZATION], typically at the ORG1 site, and they would deploy someone trained  to have a conversation with someone experiencing homelessness about what services were available and make that sort of offer to them to intervene prior to it becoming a law enforcement issue. And so we saw a lot of success with that. We're continuing to see some success with that."
10_12_2021,unhoused,"So I just, I said that I know that the county has a [ORGANIZATION] program, which is to help with recidivism, I can't say that word, recidivism, with mainly unhoused or people in mental health crisis. And I don't know if the municipal [STREET] has a program like that at all. Recidivism?"
10_12_2021,homeless,"I know that we've been working with [ORGANIZATION] to put together a homeless coalition as part of the mental health coalition. I think that they're  there could be a better program out there. And I know that, again, Representative PERSON0, your constituents are frustrated and they want something resolved, but I don't feel comfortable supporting something out of kind of fear and anger and not out of the benefit for this community."
10_12_2021,homeless; unhoused,"Thank you Mayor [PERSON]. So I don't have any questions for for staff but I do wanted to share the perspective from our district and the constituents who reached out to our office. I'm in support of this policy change, primarily because the constituents, not only constituents, but businesses, have been drastically affected by not only persons who are unhoused, but persons who live in close proximity to [INSTITUTION]."
10_12_2021,homeless,"So some of the concerns our office has heard are persons sleeping on benches who are enumerated  whether or not we cannot determine whether or not they are homeless. So what I like about this policy is that it's going to give a violation to any person, regardless of sex, gender, so it's non-discriminatory, in my opinion. However, persons who are drinking are drinking outside on public right-of-ways."
10_12_2021,homeless,"And our office, as well as [ORGANIZATION] offices, have been working with [ORGANIZATION], been working with residents to report those complaints. So again, I agree that this should not just be a policy where we respond, incarcerate, and give citations, but also to put together...  I don't know, [ORGANIZATION] program so that we can work with homeless organizations, with our community development folks, and with police, as well as our prosecutors, so that we can come up with an approach, a program. This policy is only going to help identify, help officers to identify when there is a problem on the [STREET]."
10_12_2021,homeless,"It's gonna require [ORGANIZATION] to respond, which they're already doing. [ORGANIZATION]'s already responding, ORG1 offices are already responding. And they will tell you that not all of those persons are homeless."
10_12_2021,homeless,"A lot of those persons are the same people who are not allowed to go back into their home, and they're forced to go to the [STREET] to drink because their families have essentially abandoned them. And so the problem is more than just homeless, which is why I wanted to advocate for a citywide mandate. But at this point in time, I think a pilot program is appropriate."
10_12_2021,homeless,"I commit to continuing to work with the community of providers to add more alternative Non-punitive measures to the response and possibly bringing back amendments in the near future in [ORGANIZATION] We have created non police [STREET] outreach teams in partnership with other providers and they now provide the initial response to calls about the homeless and  That program is working great. I hope that this conversation shows that my colleagues are willing to increase the funding for expanded [STREET] outreach. For now, this ordinance change provides an additional tool in the more complicated cases that the [STREET] outreach teams are now not able to address."
10_12_2021,homeless,"I would hate for a policy change that has the support of residents, neighborhoods, the business community, the police, and the homeless shelters themselves,  It is rare to have everyone on board die here because of opposition from colleagues who were not involved in crafting it. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON]. Is there anybody else that has any other comments?"
10_12_2021,homeless,"So, okay, well, I have, it's still a, what? Anyways, I do have a concern that even though it's not discriminatory in practice, it basically sends out a net that would,  affect anybody within the buffer area of a [INSTITUTION] most homeless shelters and other institutions like that are located in some of those vulnerable and disenfranchised communities and neighborhoods that we have in our city the kind of neighborhoods and the kind of places where having a misdemeanor on there for outside drinking would not be something that would be easily attainable to hire a lawyer or to pay off  Um, and so I have some concerns. I also recognize, too,  the the concerns from the neighborhood and neighborhood associations as well i too agree with you represent representatives it would be great to have more members of this council be involved in crafting this i think your office was made aware of it"
10_12_2021,homeless,"Yes, sir. One thing I'd like to point out, but there's, I believe it was Lieutenant [PERSON] mentioned that there was a list of different homeless shelters. However, that information is not in the backup."
10_12_2021,homeless,"That's correct. To give us the time to get all the backup data  Also too, I don't know if staff can brief us individually, but I also want to understand more in terms of the state statute that states clearly the ability, because I do agree with Representative PERSON0, [PERSON], alternate mayor [PERSON], that really I think what would be beneficial is a much more blanket open container law. I don't think that, you  anybody whether they're within a thousand feet of the [INSTITUTION] or living in any part of the city really has the need to Walk around with an open container."
10_12_2021,homeless,"You see my card. If I put a basket, everybody tends to confuse this thing as a homeless card. And that is the reason I'm picky about it."
10_12_2021,homeless,"So when they see this, they assume this is a homeless card. So I get profiled. So, this is an oriental guy that owns the [STREET]."
05_25_2021,homeless,"We have had overflow operations for [ORGANIZATION]. We actually have set up some of our sites for food distribution, including FAC0, which is now the [ORGANIZATION] distribution site for [ORGANIZATION] fighting hunger. When they were about to lose their distribution site in the [ORGANIZATION], we worked very quickly with them to be able to get them this facility assigned within [ORGANIZATION]."
05_25_2021,homelessness,This is discussion and action that the mayor be authorized to execute an interlocal agreement between [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] to support continued operation of the [ORGANIZATION] temporary emergency shelter in order to address the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] during DATE0 Motion to approve. There is a motion and a second to approve item number 31.
06_11_2024,homeless,"and I have reported miss [ORGANIZATION] the next time they're assigned up for so number eight Excuse me The red item eight is a resolution authorizing the city manager to sign all contract contract amendments and related documents to receive an allocated 493 thousand eight hundred thirty four dollars in [ORGANIZATION] homeless housing and services program funds from [ORGANIZATION] and  You have [TIME], ma'am. Because of my experience with that same department, I would like to ask, since these funds are going to help homeless individuals and so forth, is there a list of individuals in the funds that have gone out that any member of the citizenry,  can go ahead and make an open records request to get that list so that there's a full accounting as to where all these funds are going."
08_30_2022,homeless,Let the homeless find a safe shelter. Let the lonely find friendship. And those that are hurting across our region find hope [ORGANIZATION].
08_30_2022,homeless,"I've been in the streets because of this situation. And it's not even fun to be out there, believe me. The majority say that homeless are out there because of their choice."
12_15_2020,affordable housing,"Of course, any improvement to affordable housing is appreciated, but the projects that I have seen in the past were more competitive, were more exciting, and were more aligned with the vision of council. And so I just, I'm not happy with the decision [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, Representative PERSON0."
12_15_2020,affordable housing,"Okay, so I really just wanted to share a little bit of my thoughts on this. I think, like you mentioned, whoever did apply, we don't want to lose those dollars to be invested in providing housing, or affordable housing, actually, in those areas. And one that is in my district, as you all know, my district has a lot of single-dwelling homes."
12_15_2020,homeless,"The Under One [PERSON] program is able to deploy assistance now, whereas the other program was on hold due to a lack of administrative capacity.  through [ORGANIZATION]. And so it was our decision and we request your approval to move those dollars so that we may open up rental assistance for [ORGANIZATION] families [LOCATION] [TIME] based on your approval DATE2. The next item in the change is a budget of $1.1 million from the, again, CDBG-CV, meaning the CDBG CARES-related funding  provide a block of 80 hotel rooms for [ORGANIZATION] so that's [ORGANIZATION] through [DATE] at 7815 [LOCATION] services provided will include meals and protective equipment disinfecting services security and support services for homeless individuals being sheltered on site in addition there is staff on  again, provide for those individuals."
12_15_2020,homeless,"Thanks Mayor. Could you go back to that slide, I guess [DATE]. So the, the hotel project that is open for any eligible families or is that, or is that essentially us moving our [INSTITUTION] to a hotel?"
02_13_2024,homelessness,"And we're asking this interest to be a different type of discipline than the ones that are they are looking, witnessing, and holding the sign as though for food as the total reason for this. And we're asking response as well what homelessness is, as avenues turn our [STREET] to a progressive interest in feeding, and utilizing the attitudes of the local community. But [ORGANIZATION] prepares new rules for it."
09_13_2022,houseless,His name is [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] fell on two hard times and became one of our houseless pet houseless community members. alongside with his [ORGANIZATION] fawn pit bull by the name of PERSON1.
10_24_2023,homeless,"And we continue to monitor any variants related to [ORGANIZATION]. The team also assists with outbreaks in the community that are in congregated settings such as nursing homes, detention facilities, assisted living facilities, migrant shelters, homeless shelters.  for any refugees seeking asylum. After the pandemic, I think just about everyone, every household finally understood what an epidemiologist was.  otherwise known as disease detectives."
10_24_2023,homelessness,"THIS IDENTIFICATION INCLUDES THE BASIC FUTURES OF ANY ID SEARCH HAS INDIVIDUAL'S [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], ADDRESS AND SIGNATURE. CURRENTLY, TEN OF THOUSANDS OF GPE0 RESIDENTS CANNOT A GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID, THIS INCLUDES  This includes senior citizen, veterans, individual experiencing homelessness, transgender, disabled, mixed status families, and victims of domestic violence. Without the right from [ORGANIZATION], a person may not be able to open a bank account or check a check or cash a check."
10_24_2023,homelessness,The stories of parents who were unable to pick up their child from school. The stories of heads of households who were unable to cash their hard-earned checks. I thought about the survivors of domestic violence and those who are currently experiencing homelessness.
10_24_2023,homelessness,"That includes many senior citizens, veterans of this country, individuals that are experiencing homelessness, the transgender community, people with disabilities,  [PERSON] FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITHOUT AN [LOCATION], A PERSON MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT, CASH A CHECK, PICK UP A SICK CHILD FROM SCHOOL, ACCESS MANY HEALTH CARE SERVICES, [ORGANIZATION] WITH THE [INSTITUTION], WHICH IS VERY NEEDED IN OUR [ORGANIZATION]. BORROW A BOOK FROM THE [PERSON], WHICH MANY PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO THE [LOCATION].  or even collect a package from the post office."
01_18_2023,homeless,"My personal experience with the [ORGANIZATION] program, specifically [ORGANIZATION], has been very positive, and it's apparent that this program works. We have [ORGANIZATION] cats in my neighborhood. However, thanks to the [ORGANIZATION] program, they are not reproducing multiple litters a year, thus leading to an increase in homeless unaltered cats."
03_26_2024,homelessness,"So we're actively working to address the homelessness and support individuals in crisis. So through the collaborative, we have been able to make a direct impact and success of the collaborative is evident. Through our intentional focus of homelessness prevention, we've been able to achieve great  great results."
03_26_2024,homelessness,"And last, the platform, it's created a direct access for community members to  to speak and work directly with the agency collaborators on solutions helping to address their needs. So we think of the need, even though we have made positive strides, we still face challenges when it comes to homelessness, as well as food insecurity. If we look at numbers, [ORGANIZATION], a program that we oversaw received over 2,700 applications for rental assistance."
03_26_2024,unhoused,"And this resulted in a request of over $12 million. Unfortunately, demand exceeded the resources available, and we were able only to support, I believe, an average of 25%, right? Okay.  um inflation increase in [ORGANIZATION] rental payments and um for housing instability has continued to exist and has been exasperated and we know there's been studies conducted by [ORGANIZATION] which identified an average of 35 percent of alpacians face food insecurity but within those 35 22 percent worry about making their [ORGANIZATION] rental payments or their mortgage payments with the results of becoming unhoused  So even though we've made positive strides, demand is evident, right?"
03_26_2024,homeless,"Good day. And I apologize for not being there in person, but my name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm the Deputy Director with [ORGANIZATION]."
03_26_2024,homeless,"And I wanted to speak in favor of agenda item number 50. I just heard a portion of [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation with [ORGANIZATION], and I do want to echo what she has indicated. But in addition to that, in looking at the vulnerability and the homeless needs within our community, it needs to be recognized.  that we are seeing significant increases in the number of individuals being served."
03_26_2024,homelessness,"And I'm specifically referencing the initiative through [ORGANIZATION] that is titled ORG1.  where you have entities that are working together with a common goal, not only to prevent homelessness, but to make homelessness rare and brief. So I do want to speak in favor of the proposal as reflected in item agenda number 50, and I'll close with that. Thank you."
03_26_2024,homelessness; affordable housing,"As you know, we do have [ORGANIZATION], which we are tasked with those four pillars. I think that one of the things we like to say is those are some of the most important challenges our community are facing nowadays. When you look at climate, you look at urbanization.  affordable housing, and then obviously homelessness."
03_26_2024,homeless,And so that has been an essential piece of addressing the homeless challenges we're seeing in our community. We're also thinking about how we can improve those services. And so that's just something to consider.
12_07_2021,homeless,"And the motion passes unanimously. Item number [ADDRESS] family resilience center project and add a homeless youth outreach and case management project [ORGANIZATION] and a second Ms. [PERSON] Yes sir there is a motion made by  [PERSON], seconded by Representative PERSON2 to approve."
08_13_2024,homeless,"It's a situation that's led to many of the concerns I share with several new families in [ORGANIZATION] as we worry for the safety of our children. There have been reports of prostitution, of drug dealings in nearby houses. There's a notable number of homeless people entering these houses, strange vehicles pulling up to them at [TIME]."
05_24_2022,homeless,"So we did have a lot of significant issue where there was, call them homeless people living there underneath the bridge. And they, of course, I, once again, on a field site visit, I did go by and, I mean, it's just,  shopping carts, sleeping beds, they had pop-up tents out there. That's, I believe it's already been addressed, but it seems to be there's still the accumulation of whatever the residuals were from those people there, and it still needs to be cleaned up."
05_24_2022,homeless,"And probably, I believe this is part of the 10-100 block of FAC0 where the people just discarded whatever they had outside of where they were living. And just so you know, we work really closely with [ORGANIZATION] when they clean up the homeless camps. So every so often they'll go in and, you know, just forcibly remove the homeless, but they leave behind everything."
05_24_2022,homeless,"So, again, that would be another concern I have. I know that there was a facility, for example, it was right near FAC0, and I actually had some people reach out to my office over by FAC1 behind FAC2. There's a large...  facility there and there was evidently a homeless encampment."
05_24_2022,homeless,"The water utility, it also had essentially acted as a nature preserve at that point, having been untouched as a water retention pond for [ORGANIZATION]. And the response from the water utility was to basically go in there with bulldozers and rip out all the vegetation in addition to some of the homeless encampments that were there. So I just think that moving forward, if we decide to move forward with this [ORGANIZATION], that the rules of engagement, the participation, and the level of participation is very, very, very clearly defined."
05_24_2022,homelessness; affordable housing,"We work predominantly in two other areas with the entitlement, human services, which is the work that we do in the context of providing funding to service providers in the areas of homelessness, health and well-being, as well as recreation and lifestyle. And finally, neighborhood development, which is where we push out our work in the context of housing, housing affordability, affordable housing, community revitalization, and quality of life. Next slide, please."
05_24_2022,homelessness,"So as a reminder, the entitlement that comes from [ORGANIZATION] is composed of four federal grants that are aimed at serving low to moderate income populations in the following areas primarily. Neighborhood development, as I mentioned, which is housing, community revitalization, and quality of life.  as well as human services, which are the dollars that we push out to provide services through our nonprofit partners in the areas of homelessness, health and well-being, and recreation and lifestyle. In those two areas, in this cycle, we are projecting that there will be $8.34 million available for neighborhood development."
05_24_2022,homelessness; affordable housing,"The four entitlement grants that I mentioned are the Community Development Block Grant with just over $6 million, [ORGANIZATION], which is focused on affordable housing and housing development, as well as single-family rehabilitation and first-time homebuyer programs at a little more than $2.5 million. [ORGANIZATION], which is wholly focused on addressing homelessness in our community at just over $1.5 million. And our ORG1 program at just over $700,000."
05_24_2022,homelessness,[ORGANIZATION] slide. A little more detail in the human services category. The bulk of these dollars are being invested in addressing homelessness in our community.
05_24_2022,homelessness,"A little over 1,000 individuals are projected to be served through 10 programs and seven program categories for a total of $1.56 million. Next slide, please. These funds, as they continue to address homelessness, are continuing to address the areas that we've talked about many times."
05_24_2022,homeless,"Homeless prevention in the form of rental assistance,  case management, which we know is so desperately needed in our community to help hold the hands of these individuals as they build back and get on their feet. [STREET] outreach so that we are accessing those individuals who are most vulnerable where they are and providing them access to services. providing expanded shelter and other support services, but ultimately culminating in what we hope will be permanent housing opportunities for those individuals."
05_24_2022,homelessness,"That is ultimately the formula for addressing homelessness in our community. All four of these areas are very critical in order to provide for the needs of the most vulnerable as we have learned very, very well over [ORGANIZATION]. Next slide, please."
05_24_2022,homeless; homelessness,"There is also a need to invest in some specialized service programs. Here what you're seeing is an investment of just over, I'm sorry, just under $300,000 in supporting women who are experiencing homelessness and folks who are experiencing or survivors of domestic violence through [ORGANIZATION] and the ORG1. We are also supporting through our innovative program in incubator [ORGANIZATION] at $80,000, a justice involved case management program with ORG2."
05_24_2022,homelessness,"We have observed over [ORGANIZATION] specifically that there is a large population of justice involved or criminal justice involved  individuals who are also experiencing homelessness. And so case management is extremely critical, again, in reducing recidivism back into the criminal justice system, but also getting folks ultimately housed. We are also supporting through our [ORGANIZATION] program, [ORGANIZATION]."
05_24_2022,homelessness,"We are also supporting programs that provide for persons with disabilities and our seniors. Again, looking at...  supporting the money management program for [ORGANIZATION], as well as elderly case management in the area of homelessness with ORG1. You can see here specifically that while we are supporting health and wellness, as well as recreation and lifestyle programs, we are still being informed by the vulnerability and the community needs assessments that have been already deployed over [ORGANIZATION] and really leaning in where we think we can have the most impact."
05_24_2022,affordable housing,"We are hoping to be able to invest in 89 affordable housing units in three different program areas [ORGANIZATION] in the amount of $4.2 million. This is through [ORGANIZATION]. And again, we have over [LOCATION] and predominantly over DATE2 our regional housing plan, adjusted our program policies so that we can encourage private sector investment and leveraging of funds so that we can produce even more affordable housing units  than ever before."
05_24_2022,affordable housing,"Just as a reminder, in [ORGANIZATION], the home entitlement was deployed on its own. Multifamily developments were built entirely utilizing home funds. In [LOCATION], we have changed that policy to encourage, again, that private sector investment and leveraging of home funds as a part of the capital stack to produce, again, more affordable housing units, which we know is more important than ever, given the state of the housing market DATE2 and the economic impact of [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homeless; homelessness,"One, two, three. And the next proclamation is [ORGANIZATION]. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] Homeless Awareness [PERSON] is [DATE], [LOCATION], and aims to educate about the problems of hunger and homeless."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"And whereas addressing hunger and homelessness is critical for the economic prosperity of [ORGANIZATION] families,  And whereas [ORGANIZATION] has made tremendous contributions to supporting and protecting the most vulnerable Alpacians by deploying federal and state funding for support in housing affordability, homelessness, utility cost burden, access to food, and supporting individual financial stability. And whereas there are many community organizations committed to sheltering and providing supportive services as well as meals and food supplies to people experiencing hunger and homelessness,  and whereas it is the responsibility of the ORG1 to serve as the catalyst for the community partnerships, collaboration, and change, ensuring equity, resilience, and sustainability for the most vulnerable [ORGANIZATION]ans by giving voice to the underrepresented, supporting a strong system of human services and investing in [ORGANIZATION] homes, family, and neighborhoods, and whereas [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] has shown incredible leadership  by integrating the needs of the individuals experiencing homelessness as a strategic city objective in [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION] Strategic Plan, and whereas [ORGANIZATION] Helps, [ORGANIZATION] Ayuda serves as a collaboration of organizations providing support to families in crisis, driving community stability and resilience,  as well as ensuring that individuals in crisis experiencing basic need insecurities are connected to the services immediately now therefore be it proclaimed by the mayor and [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] shall be known as hunger and homelessness [DATE] and it's signed by the Honorable Mayor [PERSON]"
11_19_2024,homelessness,"okay there we go good [TIME] mayor and council I guess it's been [TIME] since I stood here  [ORGANIZATION], Director of [ORGANIZATION]. This is going to be my eighth [ORGANIZATION] [DATE], and I think that one of the things that makes me most proud is that when I stand here, I am never standing here alone."
11_19_2024,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], my beautiful friends at ORG2,  and my beautiful friends at [ORGANIZATION]. It's because of these people that vulnerability in our community has a [STREET] to go. I would like to share just a little bit of data with you."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"I think that we've made a lot of progress in terms of addressing issues like homelessness. We work very hard to prevent homelessness from happening in the first [STREET]. But really, homelessness is one part of a larger continuum of challenges and vulnerabilities that exist in our community."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"DATE0 I had the privilege of joining [ORGANIZATION] on a ride along where we went out and we saw what these teams are doing [PERSON] and the need that is out there. And what I learned in [DATE] is that homelessness and vulnerability is not a homogenous problem. Every single human being that you see experiencing these challenges has a unique story, and they deserve to be treated uniquely."
11_19_2024,homeless,"And so very proud of the work that [ORGANIZATION] is doing. Females represented the largest group of clients in homeless prevention, transitional housing, and rapid rehousing programs. What we're learning is that it's very important for women to stay off the [STREET]."
11_19_2024,homeless,Women are incredibly vulnerable to predatory individuals and to be victims of crime when they are homeless. 29% of individuals served by the city's programs in [ORGANIZATION] self-identified as having a disability. I think it's also time that we start recognizing that folks of all abilities  require support in different ways.
11_19_2024,homelessness,"But the future is bright. We are spending a lot of effort, a lot of energy from these human beings on helping these folks. And so at [DATE], I just want to thank you for what you are doing by recognizing [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] Week DATE0."
11_19_2024,homelessness,"but that event is an open house from 10 a.m to 4 p.m we will be exhibiting artwork from the elementary school students at [ORGANIZATION] who have interpreted homelessness hunger and vulnerability through their artwork we'll be displaying that on [ORGANIZATION] and then at [DATE] we will be hosting a panel discussion to create broader awareness with the general public about what they can do to help address this issue thank you guys so much  Thank you, [ORGANIZATION]. Appreciate it. Appreciate everybody that's here and all the work that you guys do."
11_19_2024,affordable housing,"And so I'd like to express my sincerest gratitude to everyone for considering this item. I believe as has been said by everyone who's spoken, that this will be a truly transformational project for downtown [ORGANIZATION], bringing more housing, more affordable housing, more retail to the historic center of our city, bringing renewed vibrancy to the streetscape. and I believe being a catalyst for future redevelopment, both that I hope to undertake as I continue in my career and that I believe others will also be inspired to undertake."
03_14_2023,homeless,"Now, just so we understand, I've heard questions about whether [ORGANIZATION] is using the [ORGANIZATION] program. I sent a message to [ORGANIZATION]. For more information on how to help big dogs and other homeless pets, visit [ORGANIZATION] website and [ORGANIZATION] Network proven strategies."
03_14_2023,affordable housing,"The regional housing plan is on that timeline because we started to look at what? Creating housing affordability.  and building new affordable housing in the urban core of our community in five priority areas that really reduced the footprint of housing in our community in terms of materials built, in terms of reusing existing building stock. These are all climate action initiatives."
03_14_2023,homeless,"Finally, a wage increase may help veterans and families from being a risk  homeless and other insecurities thank you again for your time and thank you for your consideration thank you I want to thank Miss [PERSON] for her comments I think everything she said is a hundred percent correct I do want to point out however that we are currently at the city at $12 an hour this action [ORGANIZATION] would not  discourage council for moving above the $15 an hour at any point but there's been a lot of conversation about can we get there should we get there how do we get there and this at least sets a path for us moving into the budget cycle to say okay we need in instantly actually back up a little bit I believe we put about six million dollars in the last budget to get us to twelve  We were at [TIME] that. And so this at least puts us on a path through that budget cycle to get us there. Again, does not discourage this council, future councils, during any future budget to go above that at any point."
06_06_2023,homelessness,"And whereas veterans of the armed forces and active duty military members are disproportionately impacted by [DATE], and whereas many post-traumatic stress responses remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to lack of awareness about post-traumatic stress and the persistent stigma associated with mental health conditions, and whereas post-traumatic stress significantly increases the risk of post-traumatic stress responses, including anxiety, anxiety, and  depression, homelessness, substance abuse, and suicide, especially if left untreated. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] can call the [DATE] line or [ORGANIZATION], [PHONE] if they or a loved one are experiencing a mental health crisis. and whereas [ORGANIZATION] is recognized as [ORGANIZATION], a time for people to raise awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder treatment and recovery."
07_02_2024,homelessness,"Whereas [ORGANIZATION] ORG1  partnered with ORG2 to provide a rapid [PERSON] response called Operation Safe [INSTITUTION] to provide contactless intake at [ORGANIZATION], which served over 3,000 individuals in [ORGANIZATION], with no instances of [PERSON] originating from the housing shelters. And whereas in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] adopted a new strategic objective identified to develop solutions to increase access and resources to [ORGANIZATION]ans experiencing or at risk of homelessness. And whereas in [DATE], the city of [ORGANIZATION] received [ORGANIZATION] ARPA funding."
07_02_2024,homeless; unhoused,"And [ORGANIZATION] allocated its portion of funds for programs to stabilize the homeless service system and was able to use the lessons learned in Operation Safe [INSTITUTION] to construct a plan to leverage the power of local, non-governmental organizations . And, whereas Operation Safe [INSTITUTION] provided valuable insight into the needs of [ORGANIZATION] unhoused and vulnerable populations, [ORGANIZATION] was able to extend [ORGANIZATION]'s partnership and tap into their ORG2  to engage [PERSON], a local digital marketing company, to design workflow, user interface, and marketing materials for [LOCATION]. And [ORGANIZATION] from [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], in collaboration with the city's ORG6, developed the [URL], or ORG7 portal, to enable vulnerable populations to readily connect to a [ORGANIZATION] video  contact center manned by local NGOs and supported by [ORGANIZATION] services."
07_02_2024,homeless,"And whereas community and human development brought together these local NGOs providing critical services, including resource navigation, [STREET] outreach, rapid rehousing, homeless prevention, and mental health, resulting in the launch of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And whereas [ORGANIZATION] has recognized [ORGANIZATION]  with [ORGANIZATION] for the [ORGANIZATION]. We also recognize her leadership and honor the power of community services and the strength of bringing together local NGOs to collaborate and serve our community and look forward to the future phases planned to serve veterans and higher education student populations, thereby reaffirming our commitment to building sustainable and equitable communities for generations to come."
07_02_2024,homeless; homelessness,We came together [ORGANIZATION] supported us computer centers a computer center supported us and we just did it. It is an honor to be in [ORGANIZATION] and it is an honor to work for [ORGANIZATION] who recognizes the importance of the homeless issue. We've invested in homelessness in [PERSON] and you know it's good to know that we've invested here and I'm so tired of technology projects.
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"What the new proposal is for that northern third of the property, at the time that council gave resolutions of support for FAC0,  Part of that support was predicated on the evaluation score, which also received a higher score because this property was presented as being future light residential commercial development that would serve both the surrounding neighborhoods as well as [ORGANIZATION]  and would serve to sort of bring those residents together. At this time, it appears that that will not be happening and instead is targeted to be development for 40 affordable housing units for seniors. One of our concerns with this property is the lack of traffic control for ingress and egress out onto FAC1, which is a relatively high speed highway."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"Always, we are never disappointed in your work. With that being said, I did just want to share some thoughts with everyone on this dais. affordable housing is something that is very important to me."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"We have made it very clear what a project needs to accomplish in order to score well and receive our support. As a result of these changes, over [ORGANIZATION] we have gotten significantly better project proposals  And we have ultimately chosen to support some great projects that have added high quality, affordable housing stock in our beautiful city. The stark contrast against these quality project proposals from [LOCATION] is why I frankly am disappointed with the proposals that we have received DATE2."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"I know staff's recommendation is to provide no support for any of these proposals. While I do feel some reluctance to possibly lose these affordable housing dollars to outside of the city, I keep returning to the thought that we need quantity of units, but we also need quality. And it would feel like a disservice to give my support to proposals that score an F on our scorecard because they don't adequately provide for the future residents who would live there."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And so one of my concerns is looking at the condition and looking at what are the goals or some of the goals of  of our initiative our policy right and that is to go in and have these affordable housing developments that can be close that can ideally be within an interior of our city or at least they're not directly in the interior of our city be in an area that's close to education commercial or mass my concern is that by taking a very  whether it's an appropriate or not, but a very aggressive stance towards not giving any numbers or not giving any support, is that we're gonna essentially push these developments or the opportunity for developments in our community as a whole  out into the county into areas that have less access towards mass transit, less access towards education, and less access towards job sites as well."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"To go and develop in some of these areas in other parts of our cities that may not necessarily be within the sort of inner core, we're looking at a price maybe $4, $3, $4, $5 a square foot versus something like [ORGANIZATION], which is in [ORGANIZATION], which is probably closer to $20 a square foot. These are costs that a developer has to incur and factor in. And if we're going to be committed towards this vision of wanting to have affordable housing towards it, then we need to also have a conversation."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And  towards this wanting to see infill development and wanting to see these kind of affordable housing projects we need to be addressing that as well. My big concern here is with the staff's recommendation is that essentially we're going to be rewarding sprawl because if we don't go and give any numbers to this whether it's a resolution of support or otherwise we're going to be going essentially and not getting any support  If so facto, we're going to be encouraging these developments to occur in our county, which absolutely has less access to mass transit, educational and retail and job opportunities for our community. And so I'm not sure I can support staff suggestions [ORGANIZATION]."
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"And so the thing is that it's not like they were not aware. It's not like staff hadn't,  [ORGANIZATION] had made these regulations part of the deal in our vote so the main thing to say was that definitely public transportation some of those people that live in affordable housing don't have cars they don't have families that can go pick them up they don't have they either have to walk to their destination or take public transportation as you saw none of these projects had anywhere near the public public transportation that's much needed to  I feel that we weren't the city wasn't provided with any really viable project to vote on and I I'm really disappointed that because I didn't expect that from from the competitors the applicants"
02_01_2022,affordable housing,i promise you that but we do have some realities and those realities we've already talked about the cost of real estate the cost of materials etc covert or no covid our market is exploding we see that everywhere people are paying more for property apartment complexes  both in the in the market rate as well as in the affordable have wait lists for them that's not going to change in the near future i like representatives i'll see those recommendations and i'll make a commitment on behalf of all my clients to sit down at the table and work with you and talk these things through try to find some viable i don't want to use the term compromise but finding a ground a base for all of us to work together so that we can  achieve what we need which is more affordable housing all three of the companies in this region are doing this right now my client is before you [PERSON] is the only developer that does affordable senior communities in the community period for profit i'm out of time unfortunately but mr [ORGANIZATION] can come up and cover some of the other points that we spoke to thank you for your time thank you for being here thank you for your patience good [TIME] mr [ORGANIZATION] you have [TIME] mayor council  I do want to say a couple things.
02_01_2022,affordable housing,"so again i'm uh i'm lost to say why these are mediocre projects yes they did not score uh first of all i'm surprised that i've gotten you know i've never gotten enough in my life so i'm not sure why there's an f you know we've got enough on these deals i mean i'm passionate about affordable housing we've submitted three deals uh two of the properties we own the land  The other, [ORGANIZATION], we had to land a new contract."
05_23_2023,homeless,"Whereas [ORGANIZATION] is the home of approximately 165,000 service members and military families. Whereas veterans participate and make a direct economic impact in our community of six billion dollars DATE0. And whereas the city of [PERSON] is ranked seventh nationwide in best cities for veterans, homebuyers, and established a rental assistance program in [LOCATION] to assist veterans and reduce the number of homeless veterans in the city of [PERSON]."
05_23_2023,homeless,"It also provides food and clothing to [ORGANIZATION] homeless, whereas [ORGANIZATION] recognizes veterans' birthdays and newcomers to our veterans community, recognizes sick and shut-in veterans, family members, and departed loved ones,  also has a Veteran of the Year Award which recognizes individual veterans who have supported our veteran community. Whereas [ORGANIZATION] works with [PERSON], ORG2, and other veteran organizations in support of our veterans and community, the collaboration has resulted in the distribution of over 200,000 pounds of food and other necessities for our veterans, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and surrounding communities. And finally, whereas [ORGANIZATION], the President and [PERSON], ORG3, Public Affairs, [PERSON], [PERSON], along with its members, invite all to the [ORGANIZATION] breakfast held [LOCATION] except [PERSON] starting at 830."
05_23_2023,homeless,"And by the [STREET], I also am the director for the board of directors for [ORGANIZATION]. So these are populations that often get overlooked and under-minimized in value. So I ask and beseech this council to take us into consideration."
05_23_2023,homeless,"531 [LOCATION] kits were used by the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] alone the number increased to 645 in [ORGANIZATION]. each of these doses used represents a life saved we know that [LOCATION] helps to prevent fatal overdoses and saves lives the results from this funding will contribute a great deal towards helping to save lives in [ORGANIZATION] i look forward to city council members supporting this worthwhile endeavor and helping improve the health of our community  Sincerely, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], GPE1 [PERSON],  PERSON1, ORG5 President of [ORGANIZATION], PERSON2, PhD, MBA, ORG7, PERSON3, Border Substance Abuse Counsel, PERSON4, Deputy Director, [ORGANIZATION], PERSON5, Executive Director of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON]0, and [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]1, Chief Executive Officer. That concludes public comment on item 33."
05_23_2023,homeless,"And that's on me. But really the only community I feel like that could have brought me out of that was the one that I'm currently a part of.  which is the harm reduction and the peer support. And hearing somebody who's been in my shoes and who has been homeless and who has been in a [STREET] of hopelessness and despair where it seems like using needles is my only decision, not even my only decision but the right one, I think that's why harm reduction and peer support is so vital."
04_23_2024,homelessness,"Mayor [PERSON], you use brain drain often, but refuse to see city policies in favor of real estate developers  that are pushing our children out of our city with overtaxed and now soon to be renter over homeowner, new home built, which are across the [ORGANIZATION] contributing to homelessness, not home ownership. This killing systematically the American dream due to ever rising rents that now exceed what many mortgages  would have been for those same homeowners. The once promised American dream is being killed by our city council."
04_23_2024,homelessness,"When you allow real estate developers like the [ORGANIZATION] to get all that property in the [ORGANIZATION] to specifically build a development that is going to be a majority rented homes, not home owned. That across [ORGANIZATION] has been contributing to homelessness. And now you are bringing that to our door in our city."
04_23_2024,affordable housing,I offer the following factors for your consideration and your deliberation for next steps. Affordable housing has always been and continues to be a challenge in our community. The issue of affordable housing is growing across the nation as housing costs have only increased along with interest rates.
04_23_2024,affordable housing,"If council considers any action related to the ratepayers,  It may be more prudent to disperse that needed cost for infrastructure improvements among all rate payers. The impact to each water meter would be minimal and would provide [ORGANIZATION] with the funding needed to meet its obligations. And by the [STREET], the [ORGANIZATION]'s presentation earlier I think is somewhat timely as they underscore the cost of affordable housing [ORGANIZATION]."
10_10_2023,homelessness,"So the motion to authorize city manager and city attorney to identify a funding source for $500,000 and create a process to select an organization to support families that are at or below 80% adjusted median income with metrics and standards as required by relevant law and the relevant funding source in an effort to assist those at risk of eviction and prevention of homelessness. So that is the motion. I'm appreciative of [ORGANIZATION] concerns because I think a lot of the conversation around this has been there's no checks and balances."
10_10_2023,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] remember during the height of [ORGANIZATION] and then the emergency rental assistance program the era program  Which came following cares once those were depleted we were this council allocated nine million dollars in [ORGANIZATION] funding to address community vulnerability however rental census was not included in that because we prioritized those individuals experiencing homelessness those at risk of immediate homelessness rapid rehousing and [STREET] outreach and So there were no rental assistance funds included in the [ORGANIZATION] allocation for community development. And since those last allocations, do you think that the need has gone down?"
10_10_2023,homelessness,"Can you, how many motions do we have right now on the floor? Mayor [PERSON] made a motion to authorize city manager and city attorney to identify a funding source for $500,000 and create a process to select an organization to support families that are at or below 80% adjusted median income with metrics and standards as required by relevant law and the relevant funding source in an effort To assist those at risk of eviction and to prevent homelessness That was a motion made by Mayor [PERSON]. I did not hear a second."
10_10_2023,homelessness,"Okay, so on that motion, Mayor [PERSON], seconded by Representative PERSON1.  to authorize city manager and city attorney to identify a funding source for five hundred thousand dollars and create a process to select an organization to support families that are at or below 80 percent adjusted median income with metrics and standards as required by relevant law and the relevant funding source in an effort to assist those at risk of eviction and to prevent homelessness and return to council in [ORGANIZATION] on that motion call for the vote in the voting session  And the motion passes 5 to 1. Representative PERSON2 voting nay. [ORGANIZATION], PERSON4, PERSON5, [PERSON] voting aye."
01_04_2022,homeless,"They have been providing us rapid testing. We've been using it for congregate settings. We've been using it for first responders, for our homeless population."
07_16_2024,squatter,"Most of the hearings that have occurred earlier in the [ORGANIZATION],  as the Speaker was dealing with his runoff election, and so were a number of ORG1 members, they kind of had a little bit later start. But in those early hearings, cities, even on various topics, had a central seat in the discussion, if you will, that could be on housing availability and affordability, which they had a hearing on.  eviction processes and squatter rights which they had a hearing on cities were central to that utility matters in a variety of issues whether it's with electric utility or water and wastewater services we've had hearings on all those that cities are at the forefront of that discussion  As we move forward kind of identifying from those interim hearings we can get a good idea of what some of the proposals will be Some will be I'll just be candid some will be good and many will be we will probably consider Having issue with or needing changes and that's not unique from the position That we as local governments and cities have been in in  For a period of time, but really the idea and what we're working on this interim is to try to really enhance that notion That cities are the partners to the state. They're the service provider for the citizens and they carry out a lot of the state's  mission and work right here at the local level that y'all do in providing these services and so the more we can have that discussion the more that we can kind of keep the dialogue and policy debate in that while pursuing those things that y'all want to is where we have the best chance in this environment it's not where  the old days where cities large cities would come in and say these are the agenda items we'd like to see highlighted or considered and we get our [STREET] with that that that's not the the reality of the legislative environment that we operate in anymore sharing your your agenda item early as you have with your delegation and identifying which community partners  an active on those topics is very important we tend to have a much better success on whether it's proactive issues or getting change to issues that we might have opposed proposals if we have support outside of just government"
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"The development community and special interests debate  both large and small, go to [ORGANIZATION] to seek changes that often override certain community authorities. That's in this environment, too. We have already had one hearing in the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] have issues on housing availability and affordability, and not  affordable housing in the sense of subsidized or incentivized housing programs But truly in the private sector of how they allow more housing stock what has generally and what last session had been the the Bulk of the proposals to help with that were things that preempted city authority on zoning lot sizes  mandating by right accessory dwelling units or back houses all came very close to passing within [ORGANIZATION] period a number of those proposals died by very slim margins they're all back for consideration during the interim in that issue of that in the list that you see here  will all be considered and I suspect that we will be fighting to maintain some of those those issues it again have it back here you see under city administration this is another one I wanted to make sure and it's somewhat preemption we listed as community censorship or limitations on advocacy and  Go back to I mentioned that cities have more bills that impact departmental operations and citizen services than any other entities."
07_16_2024,affordable housing,"Again, a number of affordable housing and availability of housing around the state. That is one that I think [PERSON] and other cities are concerned about because it is going to ultimately get into y'all's authority of what you have here. It is definitely a challenge for cities right now with regards to kind of the relationship that the legislature Overall and particularly legislative leadership has had with local governments around the state"
08_03_2021,homeless,"There is, however, still an ongoing problem in these neighborhoods represented by both [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which are both in FAC0. In the time since we opened the temporary shelters for the homeless in these neighborhoods, around the beginning of the pandemic,  People are loitering in much greater number in public places like alleyways, bus stops, etc., consuming alcohol, which has led to altercations amongst themselves and with nearby residences and businesses. This issue has persisted even since the temporary shelters have transitioned out.  and been replaced with permanent facilities elsewhere."
08_03_2021,homeless,"So currently the only other location that we're allowed to regulate is anything that is within 1,000 feet of a [INSTITUTION] that is not located within a central business or also a substance abuse treatment center that is not located within a central business district. So does this give the city the ability to prohibit  alcohol licenses or alcohol consumption or is it just open container? It's an open container so you wouldn't be able to walk around with an open container within this area."
08_03_2021,homeless,"Right. So historically, the state of [ORGANIZATION] has preempted the sale of alcohol to municipalities through those regulations. So the only allowance under state law  currently for a municipality is to prohibit it within their central business association or anything that's within a thousand feet of a [INSTITUTION] or a substance abuse center that's the that's how much authority is afforded to a municipality at this time"
08_03_2021,homeless,"I will definitely work with [ORGANIZATION] to see if anything can be done in regards to that. especially at this time right now with the heat and such individuals, whether they're homeless or any other individuals in our city are going to seek some type of shade shelter and all. That's where we come in also working with our coalitions in the area to see what we can do to assist everyone out in the city."
08_03_2021,homeless,"Local rescues like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2 of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and others have stepped up to the plate and have been taking in as many of these lost and now homeless dogs and puppies [ORGANIZATION] Animal Services have illegally abandoned. The local rescues have become overworked, burned out, frustrated, and financially strapped. Just like [ORGANIZATION], the man who abandoned PERSON1, who was criminally charged and arrested for animal cruelty, so should [ORGANIZATION], the interim director of animal services."
09_12_2023,homelessness,"Life has thrown me many numerous challenges. poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, surviving domestic violence, battling physical, mental, emotional health challenges, including addiction. DATE0 I stand before you as a testament to the power of resilience, transformation, and the unwavering human spirit."
09_12_2023,homelessness,"Thank you. And the [STREET] my life has changed and the contrast between [ORGANIZATION] and where I was at is an absolutely, it's a beautiful thing. I'm a person who's experienced incarceration, homelessness."
09_14_2021,homeless,"We trust that these resources in your hands will stretch even further than we could hope. May the homeless find shelter, the sick find hope for healing, the vulnerable be protected, the lonely be visited. Let the hungry eat and the mourning find joy."
09_14_2021,homeless,"I'll cover that in a short time. But we also looked at the position of an open container or an alcoholic beverage within a public [STREET], public alley or a public sidewalk. And the option we have here is having an amendment to our ordinance within 1,000 feet of the property line of a [INSTITUTION] that is not in [ORGANIZATION]."
09_14_2021,homeless,"For [ORGANIZATION], we've had a total of 505. And the reason we want to talk about this is this is basically what would be applicable in the areas we're talking about, the homeless shelters. Next slide, please."
09_14_2021,homeless,"So what we did as a team along with the city attorney's office, we looked at the definition of the [INSTITUTION] and it's taken directly from the [ORGANIZATION] section. And it basically means that it's a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter or other facility that is designed to provide temporary living accommodations to individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate residence. So,  The amendment to the ordinance would be applicable from the boundary lines within 1,000 feet of the property line for any [INSTITUTION] that's not located within [ORGANIZATION]."
09_14_2021,homeless,"A violation under this ordinance would be a classy misdemeanor, plus initial bill of $2,500. So basically what we've been doing as a team is we've been reaching out to [ORGANIZATION] and looking at other areas as well. Basically, one of the things we want to show, if we could go to the next slide, please, is calls for service."
09_14_2021,homeless,"Now, keep in mind that the city of [ORGANIZATION], particularly [ORGANIZATION], only has statistics where this ordinance is currently enforced, which is the central business district. So we wanted to look out, reach out to the areas we're looking at to see if the data supports this. And we've used here as an example, and there's no intent here to...  to target the homeless or anyone."
09_14_2021,homeless,"We feel that  [ORGANIZATION] slide, please. We feel that by having this tool, it's not just protecting individuals in the area, the residents, the shelter, but it also protects the vulnerable individuals, those that are homeless, from being enticed to any other criminal activity that can be occurring. We feel it's our duty to also protect everyone, including the homeless."
09_14_2021,homeless,"And what we're doing with our fusion centers, we're mapping out the locations that we have identified as homeless shelters per the definition. And as we progress on it, we're going to bring all this back to you. DATE0 for the first hearing and discuss it further as to the implementation on the ordinance."
09_14_2021,homeless,"But again, every situation is a little different based on their proximity to include churches as well. So there's numerous layers out there to enforce it. What we're doing on this ordinance is taking that to other areas where we feel it'll help the community and not just the residents, but the homeless population as well."
09_14_2021,homeless,Well this is a public meeting right so that is you learn something [ORGANIZATION] The only time the city as an incorporated city can go in there with the layers we've added like the central business district or hopefully with the [INSTITUTION] when it's an option given to us through the state under [ORGANIZATION].
09_14_2021,homeless,"So I would go and make a suggestion that in addition to this alcohol-free zone and areas identified relating to  relating to the homeless shelters. I also would think it would make sense for staff to look at an additional area relating to the university,  [ORGANIZATION] current [STREET] area as well. You do have a lot of events that are going on around the university."
09_14_2021,homeless,"Maybe putting some provisions that you can't sell  you know, alcohol near schools, new churches, new daycare facilities, maybe near homeless shelters, adult and foster care locations. So there's a number of things that I would also like for you all to review as we're putting these comprehensive policies in [STREET]. Thank you."
09_14_2021,homeless,"The next speaker is Ms. [PERSON]. Her topic is [ORGANIZATION]. Good [TIME], ma'am."
09_14_2021,homelessness,"Okay. Good [TIME], Mayor, [ORGANIZATION], City Manager. DATE0, I emailed each of you a letter requesting that grants provided to the coalition and approved by council on DATE1 be reinstated to reflect the original scope of work and related deliverables that support the network of provider agencies serving those experiencing homelessness."
09_14_2021,homeless; homelessness,"That letter was endorsed by numerous member agencies of the [ORGANIZATION] that value our work and recognize the contribution we provide to [ORGANIZATION] and the entire region in addressing homelessness. I wanted to speak [ORGANIZATION] to provide some context regarding this request and the consequences of eliminating or reducing funding. Since DATE1, the [ORGANIZATION] supported the [ORGANIZATION] through a planning grant, enabling us to provide intensive training and technical assistance to agencies working directly with the homeless, supporting our work in addressing chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans, youth, and families."
09_14_2021,homeless,"This grant has been completely eliminated as [ORGANIZATION] incorporated deliverables that were outside of the scope of funding and department leadership was not agreeable to negotiate what was realistic and feasible. In [ORGANIZATION], the city decided to support the coalition's homeless management information system, enabling us to provide ORG1 services of training, technical assistance, and health desk support for recipients of the city's [ORGANIZATION] program and further allowed us to offset fees paid to the ORG1 vendor so we could essentially provide free ORG1 services to homeless assistance providers. This grant is currently in jeopardy as deliverables were recently added to the agreement that are not only outside the scope of the funding source, but that we don't have the funding or capacity to address."
09_14_2021,homeless,"These deliverables are burdensome on the coalition and will essentially pull our efforts away from the agencies that we are here to support. As the infrastructure planning entity and [ORGANIZATION] administrator for [ORGANIZATION] continuum of care, we are federally mandated to provide these services that were supported by these city grants. So the loss of funding won't fundamentally affect the coalition, but will financially impact the agencies providing direct services to the homeless."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"I am here to present you [ORGANIZATION] a management update in our efforts associated with multifamily affordable housing. I think this is something very, very exciting because this is a plan that represents an unprecedented local investment in our community in terms of the affordable housing units in production, what we're seeking to do in the future, and most importantly, how we're seeking...  to address the affordable housing challenges in our community. Next slide."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Obviously we have, and you guys have seen this recently, the adoption of climate sustainability. I think it makes perfect sense in terms of the work that we do for mitigation and adaptation for climate, but also  Overseeing civic empowerment, that is our volunteerism efforts, equity, access, we talked about those things. After that we have human services, right, with the task of overseeing our homelessness efforts."
11_07_2023,homelessness; affordable housing,"I think this is something that's very important, particularly as we transition out of the pandemic, to look at the work that we've done in terms of ensuring that folks stay out of homelessness,  And finally, the reason that I'm here, our neighborhood development, which is overseeing our affordable housing efforts. Very, very important that we give you this update because we're very excited to essentially let y'all know that  From our position, we know that homelessness is a housing problem. From our position, we know that investing in stable and affordable housing, along with support services, of course, is critical to the solution to ending homelessness."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"And of course, we understand and we coordinate very well with our sister departments how high cost and low wages can push families into homelessness that only places then a higher strength in our support systems. Of course you can read there our motto if you will. I'm not going to read it but if you want to take a look at it I think it's something that really captures what we do very well with community development."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So basically to give you a little bit of background we released a notice of funding availability [ORGANIZATION] where we've asked developers to come back to us with affordable housing deals within our sale limits. But one of the things we learned from this council and obviously from executive leadership is to make sure that we are actually pushing them to maximize the purchasing power of those sellers. Meaning to make sure that they're actually not just utilizing our funds, our [ORGANIZATION] funds, which is [ORGANIZATION], but also ensuring that they're leveraging their funds with their private investment."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,So a deal that is perhaps maybe $10 million could maybe be a deal that it's $20 million and really increase the...  production of affordable housing units and rehab those affordable housing units in our community. So we follow that model. We push that model.
11_07_2023,affordable housing,You make sure that there's also private money to make sure that you increase the affordable housing units. So we were very pleased that we put out $19.2 million of our funds. And what we got back from the developers was a total investment of $50 million.
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So we're talking about, in essence, an investment that will produce 258 affordable housing units. That's huge. That's never happened in our community in terms of a deal this size."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"Normally speaking...  We put deals like this, we put deals associated with federal funds, and then the developers only use those funds to produce these affordable housing units. This is something that it's a best model, it's a best practice, while frankly it's a model also that if you look at the inflationary markets that we're seeing, it's only relevant to address this issue. One of the things I wanted to spend time to talking to you folks about this is, of course, looking at some of the data, right?"
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"So we took this data, we digested this data, and we realized that of course, a reduction in bank injury rates means fewer affordable housing units, it means increased competition among tenants, right? More tenants, right?  higher rental costs, and then ultimately limiting the access to affordable housing units from our limited income clients. So this deal is exactly addressing that."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"We're very excited about that. One of the things that we are looking at is adopting this model for future deals, ensuring that we're releasing these funds in a [STREET] that folks don't just rely on city funds, bathroom funds, that is, from the [ORGANIZATION], to build affordable housing in our community. With that, I will take any questions y'all may have.  representative followed by representative thank you mr mayor first and foremost i want to thank you and miss [PERSON] for your uh your um briefing it was very informative"
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"but i really want to congratulate you and your team and the whole group for thinking outside the box and and bringing more affordable housing to our community it's thinking like that that's going to make us  really, really accessible and affordable for people in that market. So thank you, thank you for your support. Thank you, now we have Mayor Pro Tem then Representative PERSON0."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"so i i know that we have all met with [ORGANIZATION] before i thank you for that and just encouraging you to continue building that relationship in the future thank you ma'am [ORGANIZATION]  thank you mayor um yeah thank you for the update uh and for your work and miss [PERSON]'s work and all of your team's work um on this very important investment in these uh affordable housing units for for the city um you know as i've said before on a couple of different items that have come before us in [DATE] this isn't just about providing shelter  It's about strengthening the entire community, promoting equity, and making sure that we improve the quality of life for everybody, helping the most vulnerable [ORGANIZATION] lift everybody up. So as we heard in the presentation, it's about a $19.2 million investment of our home funds and our CDBG funds through the revolving loan program, revolving loan fund program."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"258 affordable units is huge. As you said, it's like a really unprecedented investment for us. Again I just want to emphasize affordable housing, it provides stability for families."
11_07_2023,affordable housing,"Good morning, everyone, or [TIME] already. [TIME]. I'm really excited about this opportunity I think it's going to make significant impact to [ORGANIZATION]ans all across the city [ORGANIZATION] the city of [ORGANIZATION] was recognized by as an all-American city because of our focus on helping affordable housing in our community and so we can't forget where we're at and the progress that we have [PERSON] I am a product"
11_07_2023,affordable housing,and I know other members of [ORGANIZATION] are the product of affordable housing when  children and families the same opportunity to every other family then there is a direct impact not only to the economy but our social responsibility to care for others and so this is going to be Really impactful but as representative [ORGANIZATION] said we got to move the needle I would challenge you all and I know you have really great ideas and  to find really eloquent responses like you presented [ORGANIZATION] on increasing that number because too many families unfortunately cannot afford their rent and big families are living in apartments. And so many thanks and congratulations to all of the folks who would get this benefit and we are counting on those developers to provide.  really nice rehabilitation in communities for all of our families I do have a question related to compliance we have in the past we have looked at [ORGANIZATION] levels or is there a benchmark or is there a requirement to serve the lowest income families with this or is it going to be the state standards which is I don't believe is
11_07_2023,homelessness,Right. So the lowest am eyes the folks that are struggling to stay out of homelessness. Right.
11_07_2023,homeless,"Okay, now I have my actual questions, y'all. Similar to Representative PERSON0, I'm looking at, I think they're upwards of 2,000 well I'll just say wanting to understand a little bit more about the contracts that are going out you know interested in how they are different [ORGANIZATION] for homeless versus the housing opportunity management"
11_07_2023,homelessness,"However, we feel that the $500 that was discussed would not be an issue as far as eligibility if the [ORGANIZATION] was to be dedicated or allocated towards this particular program and So again, we did look at a couple of different sources. We looked at the economic development funding that the city currently has although there is available funding currently the [STREET] that or what was discussed at the [ORGANIZATION] council meeting was that particular program would not fall within the impact fund or within the ORG1 policy Which has been approved by ORG2 We looked at the CDBG funding  Unfortunately, [LOCATION] notice of funding availability won't go out until DATE2 and this particular group that was mentioned at that [ORGANIZATION] meeting Would be eligible to apply to submit a proposal for That particular program and then finally as I mentioned looking at [ORGANIZATION] in which there was twelve million dollars that was approved by ORG2 towards the community development and  particularly related to the community recovery and so a couple of different items that were addressed and that presentation back in [LOCATION] which i sent to you all back on again that [PERSON] meeting so you've seen that presentation but particularly related to housing homelessness household stability and food stability so we feel that that would be probably the best use if there would be a reallocation of that funding that was approved back in [LOCATION] of [DATE] and so with that i'm going to turn it over to mr [ORGANIZATION] who will get a little bit more detail about the recommendation  thank you [ORGANIZATION] climate and sustainability officer for the record so as [ORGANIZATION] was mentioning our ultimate recommendation is going to be to reallocate funds from the existing [ORGANIZATION] allocation for community recovery and also as he mentioned  The reason community recovery is because the direction from ORG3 in that particular pot allocated to community and human development was targeted at addressing the most vulnerable in our community."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"And so when we take a look at what community recovery means to us, what vulnerability means to us as an organization and as a community,  a group of servant leaders in this community we are looking at the data that we've gathered over [ORGANIZATION] in the most recent community needs assessment we saw a very similar outcome in terms of the areas of need things like food security  resident empowerment, mental health, and addressing homelessness. As you all heard my assistant director, [ORGANIZATION] talk about earlier, you know, we're investing in multi-family housing, we're investing in human services that address the needs of those at risk of homelessness, but actual homelessness is also an extraordinary priority in this community. So those are the things that you all directed us to look at when we created the community recovery pot of [ORGANIZATION] funds."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Our recommendation at this point for this particular item for the cash assistance program would be to issue a notice of funding availability, which would address the process component of the council direction from the meeting [ORGANIZATION], so that we would solicit a nonprofit organization that could provide any service in alignment with the results of the most recent community needs assessment, as I've just described it,  with the metrics and standard as required by law and by ARPA regulation. That goes back a little bit to the slide and I'm happy to go back and talk a little more about ARPA regulation in terms of these types of programs, but we would want to make sure that that notice of funding availability was very, very clear  With the applicants with the sub recipient applicants about what the rules would be What kind of documentation we would be requiring so that again not only are we issuing? assistance through our sub recipients to this community in need, but we are also [LOCATION] the investments of the city of [ORGANIZATION] and ultimately of the taxpayers at [DATE] however, what I can tell you is that  out of the community needs assessment for [LOCATION], and just the experience that we've had on the ground with all of our nonprofit service organizations, is that the priority in our community right now is folks that are at risk of eviction or at risk of homelessness."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"yeah I just have a  A couple of questions. I noticed that the scope changed from the initial item, which was risk of eviction preventing homelessness and the new one [ORGANIZATION] says negative impact due to the pandemic."
11_07_2023,housing insecurity,"Here we go. Recipients may presume that low and moderate income households as defined in the final rule as well as households below.  that experienced unemployment, food insecurity, or housing insecurity did in fact experience a negative economic impact due to the pandemic. And so there's just that federal regulatory structure."
11_07_2023,homeless,"So let me make sure that I'm very, very clear. The question that I was answering was a similar type of program that we have operated through a subrecipient in the past is our rapid rehousing program. A rapid rehousing program places a family into an apartment unit before they become homeless and pays their rent for a certain period of time."
11_07_2023,homeless,"You all saw me here at the podium many times with [ORGANIZATION]. Folks like [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], ORG2.  others that really provided a direct service to the community but there is no physical [STREET] currently where that can be provided in in one location so the imagining of the community resilience center or community resilience hub  was a single [STREET] where [ORGANIZATION] could go in time of crisis to access services. That's how it was imagined."
11_07_2023,homelessness,There was a number of things that made that possible.  really difficult for a cash assistance program. Another example that we used during the budget process was the veteran homelessness program. The veteran homelessness program that we operated under the general fund in past cycles and we're not doing going forward is not appropriate for our other federal funding sources.
11_07_2023,homelessness,"Those kinds of things. Once they pass through that part of the process, it goes to the technical advisory, which,  are typically selected from nonprofit service providers in that space, in this sort of, whether it's mental health, homelessness, housing, in that space that are not also competing for those funds. We select from those groups, and they score the applications, and that's part of what we base our recommendation on to you all."
11_07_2023,homelessness,"There you go. Second by Representative PERSON0. And just to make sure this is the motion, and correct me if I'm wrong, it is to approve the staff's recommendation to reallocate funds from existing ORG0 community recovery and issue a notice of a funding availability competitive process soliciting a nonprofit organization to assist those at risk of eviction and prevent homelessness."
02_15_2022,homeless,"We've done 670 property cleanups, 19 illegal dumping cases, 10 homeless camps.  nearly 3,000 bulk pickups. This is extra trash that people leave on the curb. This is an on-demand service, so this is not part of the dumping issue."
09_28_2021,homeless,"And so for item number 29, I just had a quick question related to...  the definition of a [INSTITUTION] it refers back it refers back to say as defined as a [INSTITUTION] and so I just want to understand for a purpose of you know for public engagement can you define what is considered a [INSTITUTION] good [TIME] representative [ORGANIZATION] assistant chief [PERSON] for the record  The definition used for the ordinance amendment [INSTITUTION] comes from the regulation from the [ORGANIZATION] and that definition is verbatim under the authority given to utilize that option. OK."
09_28_2021,homeless,"And do you happen to have that definition by the [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, the definition means a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter or other facility that is designed to provide temporary living accommodations to individuals who lacks a fixed regular and adequate residence. Okay, so with this proposal, what is the distance in terms of between a [INSTITUTION] and consuming alcohol?"
09_28_2021,homeless,"From the [INSTITUTION] under that definition it's under 1,000 feet the buffer zone so it would be under just over three football fields to give you the visualization on it. And at our next meeting could we could we see a map that would show these buffer zones?  as it relates to the existing shelters we're coming back on [ORGANIZATION] with the full presentation on it for [ORGANIZATION] and we'll be able to answer any questions that you have okay"
09_28_2021,homeless,yeah what i would like to see is the existing homeless shelters and then where this would be applicable um okay thank you for that um regarding i had a number of questions for [ORGANIZATION]  I've emailed them. I'm happy to repeat them if you'd like me to.
09_28_2021,homeless,I just am requesting a briefing from [ORGANIZATION] before this is brought back to better understand exactly what  um a non-comment agreement for professional services to perform energy management services is yes we'll provide those briefings as well wonderful thank you so much may we have a motion to delete so moved is there a second there's a motion made by representative [ORGANIZATION] seconded by representative PERSON1 to delete the item on that motion call for the vote representative PERSON2 thank you in the voting session and the motion passes unanimously  the next item is [ORGANIZATION] this is discussion in action on a resolution to approve a 12th amendment to the city's [LOCATION] [ORGANIZATION]th [DATE] action plan for the emergency solutions grant coronavirus phase 2 to reduce the homeless welcome shelter center funds to supplement the opportunity center shelter and homeless management information system support project motion to approve second  there's a motion made by representative PERSON3 seconded by representative PERSON4 to approve there is public comment on this item from mr PERSON5 mr PERSON6 are you in the queue sir star six
09_28_2021,homeless,oh hello mr [ORGANIZATION] thank you sir you all have three very few comments i just wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to PERSON1 and the community and human development department they have been an excellent partner in working with the homeless within the community And I'm also here to answer any questions that you might have. Just so I didn't really have any prepared comments.
10_25_2022,homeless,"In [ORGANIZATION], we've also been able to serve 802 homeless individuals. 59% of our patients at [ORGANIZATION] are unfunded individuals. We do offer 24 program services to include primary care, pediatric, dental, pharmacy, behavioral health, outreach and enrollment."
10_25_2022,homeless,"As Ms. [PERSON] stated, 90% of the people they serve are homeless. Are in the category of poverty right now so reporting the this was the One out of five opacens was reported in the [ORGANIZATION] action plan Which is also was reported by [ORGANIZATION] for the city of [ORGANIZATION] on [LOCATION] next slide please here is the list of a  ZIP CODES IN THE AREA WERE NEARLY 52% OVER 65 OR DISABLED RESIDENTS HOMESTEAD EXEMPTIONS PROPERTIES ARE FILLED WITH THE EL PASO CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT ARE FILED WITH IT I'M SORRY OR FILED WITH CENTRAL APPRAISAL DISTRICT ITEM 23 OF CITY COUNCIL PRESENTATION SLIDE 5"
10_25_2022,affordable housing,I'm sorry under the [INSTITUTION] section to oppose any legislation that would limit municipalities ability to regulate peer-to-peer car sharing companies and And then under animal services add a support item that would allow shelter animals to be spayed and neutered by veterinarians That maybe have a license from a different state. That's not from [ORGANIZATION] We're also looking to add an affordable housing section section.
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"For affordable housing? Yes, so the support legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income housing, what is a viable transaction as defined by the 4% low income housing tax credit applications? So I believe we have [ORGANIZATION] on the line from [ORGANIZATION]."
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"As far as the second example that you cited, what you're hearing that there might be an effort made by the legislature to try to,  limit the municipality's authority to pass park fees. And then I'll transfer to some snappers joining us. I do know that there has been a lot of talk prior to this session concerning affordable housing."
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"And from the building community, there's been a lot of talk from that community basically saying that there are a lot of  regulations that municipalities have that prevent them from being able to provide more affordable housing. So the park fees that municipalities may be charging, that might be one of the things that they have talked about, but in general, that is something that more likely will also come up during this legislative session. The legislature will be looking at whether or not there really are regulations, ordinances that municipalities have  that may impact the ability of builders to provide affordable housing, for example, in some of the fees that municipalities have."
10_25_2022,homeless,"we did it for homeless shelters we did it for schools etc right in places where we knew that he needed to provide additional assistance in order to prevent the spread of covid under that same authority the city council supported his direction to issue a county-wide mass mandate and then those are reviewed periodically however there aren't any  expiration date set by statute, it's simply the authority given to him under state code and the health code to issue those types of orders to protect the public health and safety. That's what the authority was that Dr. [PERSON] issued his countywide mandate. And then it doesn't come back to council in terms of approval."
10_25_2022,affordable housing,yes It's the first item under the affordable housing section. So we would be postponing the item relating to [LOCATION] legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income tax credit applications
10_25_2022,affordable housing,"Okay, this is to postpone the section under affordable housing and  that supports legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low-income housing tax credit applications. For [ORGANIZATION], is that enough time? I think we would have to ask [ORGANIZATION]."
10_25_2022,affordable housing,So this is postponed for how long?  [ORGANIZATION]. Postponed for [LOCATION]. The three items under affordable housing section to support legislation that prioritizes viable transactions for 4% low income housing tax credit applications that support legislation that would repeal the two mile DATE2 rule for low income housing tax credits or allow municipalities to approve a waiver of the rule and support legislation that would limit housing finance corporations to operate only within the municipal city limits.
10_25_2022,homeless,Our [DATE] of operations for that was as well on [ORGANIZATION]. and in our covet isolation and quarantine hotels as we've been doing throughout the covet pandemic those continue to go on and that's to make sure we don't have those large outbreaks in a congregated setting so whether it's in the ngo or homeless shelters we're making sure that we can isolate them again we've covered this slide the last couple of presentations but
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"you all are aware, any agreements that are in [STREET], as long as the  applicants continue to perform we would continue to rebate in the terms of those agreements so streetcar service does not affect any active agreements with that said you know [PERSON] was talking a little bit about how we use public policy to create an economic ecosystem that's really reflective and supportive of things like the streetcar of our other businesses so we wanted to also flag some opportunities for growth so the downtown and uptown plan which is a little bit later on [ORGANIZATION]'s agenda  Key recommendations from the economic development side include things like a public facility corporation. This allows us to fill gaps on some of those housing projects. It does also require an affordable housing component, so helping us reach that 10,000 unit goal, but also making sure that we've got the affordability in [STREET] to make sure that our housing stock is sustainable.  things like a low interest revolving loan program."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"So that's the third key regulatory change. We're also looking at some key investment and financing structures. We identified in previous presentation some of the feasibility gaps that exist currently with bringing forward market rate projects and affordable projects, and that's where we really need to be taking a closer look at our Chapter 380 agreements, looking specifically at affordable housing as well as new construction, looking at adoption of an uptown TERS, again  We know that there's not only going to be issues with housing, but also how do we bring forward some of the recommendations related to infrastructure and the TERS is a really key component."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"Also looking at [ORGANIZATION] to attract the mixed income housing developments and affordable housing. And then finally looking at creating a housing trust or bond. Again, because those funds, the funding needs to be there in order to bring some developers to the table and to see these housing units that the plan proposes come to the study area."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"But in addition to that, we've added specific recommendations.  for anti-displacement measures. So part of those focuses on retaining the existing affordable housing units within the area, creating a program to identify and monitor and preserve at-risk affordable housing. The plan recommends that we consider a right-to-purchase ordinance which would give  current residents the ability to purchase a home that they're currently living in if the owner of that home decides to put the home up for sale Also, we want to look at encouraging developers to execute community benefits agreements again Just keeping in mind that these are all recommendations that we have to vet out from a legal standpoint from a feasibility standpoint But the plan provides that recommendation and gives us as staff the green light to start seriously exploring those implementation steps  Finally, we wanted to pass along the recommendation from [ORGANIZATION] at their meeting DATE0, sorry, probably DATE1 now."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"I was looking at the [LOCATION]-Downtown plan, what I could see on the Internet, and I asked myself, what's it for? So I did a little research there, and right there on page 3 of what in the agenda is called Setting the Stage, the presentation says the challenge, the demand...  for housing knowledge workers will require managing growth and preserving our creating affordable housing to ensure that downtown plus uptown maintain their economic diversity. The demand for housing knowledge workers will require managing growth."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,I have presented my concerns  before the plan the plan commission and personally and in writing to the subcommittee form to consider community responses to the plan. The association will present their concerns to you and I want you to know that I support the recommendations. I especially ask that the council rebuff any intention to displace current residents of the area in favor of more affluent residents also to assure that future development encourages homeownership of affordable housing energy independence and that local residents  are given the opportunity to participate in development decisions and small business creation in the affected area.
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"If there is one chronic and deleterious condition  condition that the city has tolerated for too long it is the lack of affordable housing for the large segment of our family who have low incomes live with the minimal resources and reside in substandard housing. Shortly after [ORGANIZATION] formed, we identified a number of priority issues. Among the 37 or so priority issues, approximately 10 were related to housing and the need for neighborhood improvements in [ORGANIZATION] and other poverty prone areas."
07_05_2023,affordable housing,"One last time to close us out. I just wanted to comment on what Representative PERSON0 had to say about focusing on on affordable housing. operating within this plan and then I think in addition to this plan I'm looking at other ways I would love to collaborate with you on on other ways that we can we can look to do this and community land trusts are a great option In [ORGANIZATION], there's a specific kind of I know you don't you you the [ORGANIZATION] gave you pause"
03_30_2021,homelessness,"Number one, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], which is out there, a regional park in  on FAC1. A lot of people are complaining about alcohol possession, alcohol consumption, sexual activities, homelessness, the congregation of vehicles and persons in the park after [TIME], and of course the noise issues, litter issues, and things like that. And I know we all can be out there at the right [STREET] at the right time, and I know budgets are tight right now, and we will be going into [ORGANIZATION], but I  I would think some point we need to really talk about security issues for whether besides just the [INSTITUTION], maybe some cameras, things like that."
03_30_2021,homelessness,"So the 159.2 is going to primarily be looked at for that first. It's not precluded, however, from other projects where we might be able to partner with other agencies, like the county, other nonprofits, depending on what the project is. For example, Wi-Fi or homelessness, trying to address those issues."
03_02_2021,homeless,"I am addressing you as chair of ORG0 Democrats. My remarks are prompted by some of the recent actions by the city that are very puzzling,  For one, for instance, while you strive to improve the lives of our homeless veterans, and rightfully so, at the same time you unfairly treat our library employees. Another example, while you strive to prevent the euthanasia of our beloved animals and mean offer curbside service, and rightfully so, then you turn around and deny our citizens' library curbside service."
10_11_2022,affordable housing,already since the streetcar is reintroduced. We've seen over five new hotels all within a thousand feet of a streetcar stop. We have two affordable housing actually three affordable housing projects that are all within a thousand feet of a streetcar stop including the art space hotel FAC0 and FAC1.
10_11_2022,homeless,"We do our sheltering through hotels. We're making sure we provide a meal, security, and shuttle transport to get them either to one of the charters that we've hired or to the [INSTITUTION] or bus terminals we talked about. We also continue with the [PERSON] isolation and quarantine hotels, and that's for our NGO hospitality sites and our homeless shelters alike."
10_11_2022,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide. So a little bit about [ORGANIZATION]. As the Chief PERSON0 had mentioned, it was originally set up for homeless assistance."
10_11_2022,homeless; homelessness,I would like to just add one more point on that is I don't know what additional funding that [ORGANIZATION] makes them entitled to I don't know of any grant fund specific I mean that right now what they're using through the [ORGANIZATION] emergency food and shelter grant as we've talked about that's for homelessness That's for regular homeless.
10_11_2022,homeless,"And I've been very adamant with [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], the Congresswoman, that we do not want to have anyone put out onto the [STREET] because we want to make sure that we don't make people homeless. you know, they have a [STREET] to sleep, they have a warm food and make sure that we can help them and assist. And I know it's been [ORGANIZATION] now that we've had any [STREET] releases and we'll continue to do that."
10_11_2022,homeless,And so and that's more for the homeless. They're just tailoring it to be utilized for this need in time. It doesn't reach meet the Stafford Act requirements.
06_07_2022,affordable housing,"So I'd like to talk to you about the good stuff. Let's chat about the new stuff we just finished and the $127 million in quality affordable housing that we're bringing to [ORGANIZATION]. If we could put the video up real quick, I'd appreciate it."
06_07_2022,affordable housing,"It's brand new. It looks just like the same architect down the west side behind the [ORGANIZATION]. This is but phase one of, we believe, three phases to provide affordable housing.  because it's right across from ORG1 right down the [STREET] from ORG2 club access to FAC0 with with great opportunity [ORGANIZATION] you might remember is one of the ones that we fought about for a nine percent this is one of the ones that we were really worried about right in the shadow of the [INSTITUTION] that is 120 units for elderly and disabled families this is what it looks like right now and so inside uh from [ORGANIZATION] when it was built  this is this is the the current conditions that we're gonna fix we raised 20 million dollars to build that and this is something that's fascinating and really gets my heart going this is a stem facility that right now was the old headquarters to ORG3 built in [LOCATION] a trost building that with CDBG money will provide science technology engineering and math to the kids in the [PERSON]'s all and in [ORGANIZATION] working with [PERSON]  and the philanthropic organization and [ORGANIZATION] to take care of the kids and hopefully get them up and out of their current conditions and become amazing and productive members within our society."
06_07_2022,affordable housing,"so they wait [ORGANIZATION] to get a chance to have a [STREET] to live to stabilize a house for their children go to a good school district and they can't even find a [STREET] to live because there's no apartments i don't know if you know but there's a lot of people moving to [ORGANIZATION] that are that are taking up some of the housing opportunities that used to be here back when we did a housing study We said that we were 3,000 affordable housing units short by [LOCATION]."
06_07_2022,affordable housing,i think you and i had this conversation before it's not affordable housing it's quality homes quality housing and i mean by that pictures you showed us it's very evident that it is quality housing and that's what our citizens deserve and then one of the good news that you know you always say there's a problem

And I think we have some great systems in [STREET]  there's always an involvement needed, evolving process needed, and I hope to be a contributing part of that as far as the mental health arena, as far as the homelessness arena, and as far as mentors, because they all contribute to life skills. They all contribute to education."
