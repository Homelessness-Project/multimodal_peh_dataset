Good morning. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
 I am Enrique Gomez, founder and co-director of El Paso Science Festival, and today I stand before you with a heartfelt gratitude and excitement as we come together to recognize a momentous occasion for our beloved city of El Paso. It is my privilege to extend heartfelt thanks to Mayor Oscar Leaser, the esteemed members of the City Council, and their dedicated staff
 for proclaiming April 6th through 13th as El Paso Science Week. This proclamation marks a significant milestone on our journey towards fostering a culture of scientific curiosity and innovation within our community. With this declaration we affirm our commitment to nurturing the minds of our youth and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.
 As we gather here today, I am thrilled to announce the upcoming El Paso Science Festival, which will take place on April 6 and 7 at the El Paso Convention Center. This event is not just a celebration of science, but a beacon of hope for our city's future.
 It places us among the ranks of illustrious cities like New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and others, all of which host annual science festivals that ignite the imaginations of our residents.
 This festival is the result of the effort of a community of more than 50 organizations on both sides of the border, colleges and universities, non-profit government agencies, and corporations. We thank our sponsors, notably El Paso Community Foundation, UTEP, Microsoft, and Marathon Petroleum, with overnight interactive exhibits and six-stage science performances designed to spark the curiosity of our children.
 and nine renowned speakers, including the sculptor Sebastian, whose sculptures like the Juarez 6 are inspired in mathematics, and astronaut Jose Hernandez, a young farm worker who dared to dream big, will make this the largest science gathering ever in El Paso. But El Paso Science Festival is more than a gathering. It is a platform for discovery, exploration, and collaboration.
 It is an opportunity for our community to come together and showcase the incredible advancements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that are happening right here in our own backyard. But beyond the excitement and festivities, the El Paso Science Festival holds a deeper significance. It represents our investment in the future, our investment in human intelligence,
 our investment in our children, and the well-being of our planet.
 In a world facing unprecedented challenges, we need more scientists and engineers and innovators to lead the way to a brighter tomorrow. And it starts right here in El Paso. So let us seize the moment to inspire our children to ignite the passion for discovery and to empower them to pursue careers in science and engineering together
 Let us build a future where every child in El Paso has the opportunity to dream big and reach for the stars. We invite you, the families, the children, to join us on April 6th and 7th at the Convention Center. You can find our program and the information you need at our website, which is easy, elpasosciencefestival.org.
 And once again, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mayor Oscar Leaser, the members of City Council, and their dedicated staff for their willing support of El Paso Science Festival and our collective vision for a brighter, more prosperous future. Lastly, I want to invite each one of you, Council Members and Mayor,

I'm Mike Acosta and I'm on the committee for the science festival with Enrique and our friend Richard Martinez and Romelia Acosta. Mayor Leaser, we totally agree with you. The future of our region is our youth.
 And we believe that science, engineering, and technology is and should be a big part of the future. And that's what the Science Festival is about. Those of us that are engineers and scientists our whole careers, education and professional, and some of us retired, are committed to give back.
 to our region and to our youth to promote this and to make our students and our parents, and we're going to have both at the Science Festival, aware of the tremendous opportunities in education and in professions for engineering, science, technology, and math.

 Good morning Mr. Leaser and members of the Council. I am Diana Serrano, the Community Outreach Specialist for Children's Disabilities Information Coalition. Here, our mission is to promote partnerships between parents, professionals, and various agencies to work together to combine resources and to find solutions to problems within the community that are affecting children with disabilities.
 I am also the project coordinator for the Civic Engagement and Community Action Program, which is a program where participants with disabilities engage in civil discourse and dialogue aimed at addressing issues important to their personal independence and inclusion in the community. The most important issue the group is currently trying to bring change to is increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities.
 I have Mr. Donovan Garcia, who is one of our participants, and he would like to share some thoughts. Good morning, Mr. Leaser and members of the council. My name is Donovan Garcia. I am 26 years old. This is my first time attending a council meeting. I am a peer support specialist in the civic engagement and the community action program. I joined this program because I am encountering the hardship of finding employment and want to bring a change.
 I have only had two jobs of which both were part-time and temporary jobs. The participants and I have a plan for increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. I am looking forward to meeting every member of the City Council and hope you all can support us after reading your bios on the City website. Most of you want to improve or enhance your district, better our City's future, and accomplish great things.
 But only one of you mentioned strengthening the economy by having all work together with us to have better employment opportunities for people with disabilities within the city of El Paso. You will be fulfilling a bit of everything you are working to accomplish. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much for being here. And Mayor, they do have the other organizations from the autism groups. I see them coming up.
 And then after that we'll go ahead and take item 27 that kind of fits what we're doing right now instead of Good morning. How are you? Good morning City Council. My name is Rebecca Sandoval I'm from the Autism Society of El Paso and I'm here with new board member Kay Rogers and board secretary Liz Paz Thank you so much for this proclamation last year I
 I want to thank all our members, all of these wonderful organizations behind me for making the hard work of changing it from autism acceptance, I mean awareness to autism acceptance. And today I wondered what would I say? And I realized that I have something really important to say. I have to explain to you what autism acceptance means. And I'm a little nervous today so forgive me for that. But this is highly important. Autism acceptance.
 First and foremost means letting go of judgment. When you look around, you see all kinds of different people. But that's not the only differences. We're not just different in how we look or where we're from, but also in how we communicate, how we behave, the things we do to calm ourselves, the things we do to get through daily lives. And those are the things that we need to have acceptance for.
 We need to look at people who are different and understand that that's okay. There's plenty that we can learn to look at and not judge. And you may ask yourself, why is that important? Why is it important that what I think up here, why does it matter to the autism community? It matters because we want to be part of the community at large.
 Those on the spectrum want to be part of things. They want friends, they wanna socialize, they wanna contribute, they wanna be important members of our community and we can only do that through acceptance. So I know all of you are asking, okay, well how does that happen? How do we make acceptance happen? We make acceptance happen by not staring, by offering help.
 By not complaining when there's an accommodation to be made, but seeing, hey, this isn't a big deal. We can make this accommodation, and if it means more can participate, that's better. It's by saying, instead of, oh, they're different or they're unique or special, saying the most important thing you can say. You're accepted here.
 It's by saying, oh, we can't invite so-and-so or we can't have this activity for such people because, you know, they need all, you know, they can't hear the loud noise or they won't like the loud group or they, it means making an accommodation.
 saying, you know what, how can we make this so more people can participate? How can we help? And you'd be surprised at how small and how little you have to offer to make things more welcoming and more acceptable to all of us so that we can participate. And so we can be there.
 So once again, I thank you so much for this proclamation. But I ask all of you, all of you out there who are listening to my words, to please, please, not just in April, but every month, please practice acceptance. Let go of your judgment and look for ways to practice acceptance. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You know, I do want to say that, you know,
 A lot of people can say a lot of words, but actions are very definitive of who we are and what we do. And it's important to always treat people with respect and don't ever disrespect anyone. But the number one thing I've always said, and I've said this forever, treat people the way you wanna be treated, you'll never be disappointed. And I think that's so important. And I thank you because those were strong words, now they need to be actions.
 Good morning, honorable representatives, honorable mayor. My name is Verica Serena, executive director of Angels Mission organization founded four years ago as a nonprofit. I have worked with families of people with disability including autism for 25 years.
 33 years ago, I didn't understand what the world was. I think very few people in our city knew the meaning. Resources were limited, and no one provided adequate treatment or therapy. The few of us who dared to embark on this path dissolved with the fears and ignorance that we were facing. We started from nothing in a completely strange world.
 Today we stand before you, the representatives of our community, a large group of families who despite our fears have faced a diagnosis that has not only directly impacted our families but an entire society.
 We are in front of you showing you the result of our work of fighting to raise awareness, educate and inform about autism. We are in front of you telling you that together we can achieve much more. We are in front of you demonstrating that a diagnosis does not slow our children down, limit them or exclude them.
 There is still much to do. There is still a lot of struggles ahead, but here we are in front of you and our beloved community in the city of El Paso, Texas, saying to you, thank you. Thank you for taking the first step towards full inclusion and integration with the families of people with autism.
 As the mother of a 33-year-old son diagnosed with autism, I have never been alone in my struggle as I have always been accompanying with all these mothers and fathers who are here today looking out for our children, looking out for the children of those who come after us.
 I have been accompanied by friends, professionals, doctors, teachers, and everyone who without having somewhat with autism, with autism diagnosis in their family have accompanied my son, me, and each of the families who today are represented the autism community in our city. Thank you so much. Thank you all.
 My name is Miwa Resurrection. I'm the founder of Artism Hope El Paso Inc. And this is my son, Vincent Resurrection. I appreciate El Paso Mayor Oscar Lisa and the city representative for making time and effort to proclaim April is Artism Acceptance Month.
 Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong condition. Many cases proved with age and appropriate services, people can complete many different tasks and overcome obstacles in their lifetime. Unfortunately, there is still a huge need for
 for appropriate services and inclusion in the world. With this proclamation and your support, we can bridge the gap between awareness and acceptance. I met young mother with a three-year-old son and her father at a local restaurant a month ago.
 This young boy was non-verbal and could only focus on his tablet. I noticed that her son is artistic, so I started to talk to her. She felt unwelcome everywhere she goes. Some people told her that she was spoiling her son.
 I realized I had similar experiences with my oldest son, who has autism. We still struggle and meet obstacles after 24 years. We will be ready for the next challenge.
 Can we change the minds and perceptions of those who would only see how different and not how wonderful they really are? I want to say thank you to the city of El Paso.
 for showing your support for each year's work towards complete artisan awareness and inclusion. We cannot do it without that city's support. Thank you so much. Good morning, Honorable Mayor Oscar Lisser and representatives. My name is Camille Maldonado-Rivera, and I am the Board of Directors Vice Chair for Beautiful Minds Mali. I am here with our director, Magda Gheghoza,
 Our treasurer, Ms. Michelle Lopez, and our secretary, Ms. Graciela Correa. Beautiful Minds Mali is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing opportunities to individuals with all abilities in the areas of science, engineering, and art. Thank you.
 We focus our effort on inclusivity, bringing all types of opportunities to our community. Focusing on individuals with disabilities and their family members allows us to include people with all abilities to grow together. We understand that providing certain accommodations and modifications makes it easier for all kinds of people to be part of any activity.
 We offer opportunities in science and engineering by guiding the participants in experiments and hands-on learning experiences that help them develop their curiosity and explore the possibilities of what is around them. In the area of art, we have a yearly art exhibition by individuals with different abilities and siblings and it is our biggest event. We have partnered with the El Paso Museum of Art to provide this opportunity for our
 The purpose of this exhibition is to include individuals with all abilities in a significant occasion that will showcase their strengths and skills. Sometimes the participants and their family members don't even know they have the skills. A lot of times they learn to develop the skills through our teachings. We provide materials, art sessions, accommodations, and modification of the work for each one of them to learn.
 Methods or ways of creating an art piece. At the end of the day, each participant learns a skill and he or she creates the art piece with what was taught. Most of the art pieces are created on canvas with the use of acrylic paint, alcohol ink, or even washable paint. Some pieces are created on wood with the use of rocks, resin, paint, and glitter.
 Materials like cardboard, foam board, fabric, clisters and lights are used to accentuate and make other details in the art. Every participant brings an idea and the Beautiful Minds Mali staff makes sure that they have the tools, I apologize, needed to execute the idea, as well as the appropriate accommodations for them to be a part of it. We want them to express themselves and learn about all the possibilities that are to do so.
 Our exhibition is a focused opportunity for individuals with disabilities and their siblings because as parents of an individual with a disability, we know how difficult it is to find these opportunities for our kids. I am the mom of a child that is on the autism spectrum and sometimes it is hard to think that we can be part of something that we've never even tried before. And for persons with disabilities, it is even scarier at some point.
 Opportunities like this are needed in the city of El Paso, so they know that trying something new is a good thing and that they can excel while doing it. Beautiful Minds Mali will continue to work in providing this and other opportunities to the community so that the individuals that have never had the chance to be a part of something like this can do so.
 We have a location at 7145 Industrial Avenue so that we can bring opportunities to everyone in our community, including those on the artisan spectrum.
 We are very proud of our participants. We want to continue encouraging families and the city's population to see the best in each of their members, especially those with a disability like autism. If opportunities like this continue to exist, our community will grow in understanding and acceptance, and all the members of our beautiful city of El Paso will feel included, respected, and loved.
 So thank you for proclaiming April as Autism Acceptance Month, making visible to the community the importance of understanding and creating an inclusive environment for disabled individuals to grow and embrace their differences. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. Mr. Mayor, council members, good morning. Good morning. My name is Antonio Moreno. The lady here is Argelia Garcia. She's the founder of Tu Mundo Es Mi Mundo.
 and also the mother of a kid with autism. At Dumundo Es Mi Mundo, we're dedicated to raising awareness, educating the community, promoting solutions, and support for families with people with the autism spectrum disorder, as well as related conditions.
 We achieve this by carrying out awareness campaigns on social networks, media, social events, participating with business and interactions with the people around us in every day. We are committed to increase the understanding and acceptance of people with autism, warranty the access to information and services, as well as increase the early diagnosis of the
 Our activities include summer camp, my friend's club, picnic and prayer, and a magazine called wellness. And I thank you, we thank you for your time and thank you for being aware of autism. Thank you. Thank you. You know, I think it's really important when you talk about children with autism as a parent or grandparent to see it and acknowledge it.
 do something. And I think that's one of the hardest things. I do have a grandson that's low on the spectrum, but sometimes you deny, you're in denial of, as a parent, and I think it's important that you get them help because there's so much available to them. And I thank you all for being here. And while you all were talking, I looked up the picture of my grandson and put a smile on my face. So thank you all.
 We're going to go to item 27 that kind of fits with this. So Ms. Pryne. Yes, sir. Item number 27 is discussion in action to approve a resolution recognizing world Down syndrome and the work being done to facilitate a long and productive life for people with Down syndrome. This item was placed by Mayor Pro Tem Kennedy. Good morning, Judge. The honorable Judge Moody. This is a change, Judge. Usually you're sitting up in front. That's right. On the other side. I'm on the other side.
 Whereas Down Syndrome Day is being observed in the City of El Paso, Texas on March 26, 2024 to promote awareness of the many ways that we benefit by ensuring that persons with Down Syndrome are supported, encouraged, and included in our communities, and whereas Down Syndrome, the most commonly occurring chromosomal condition, occurs in individuals
 who have a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. One of the 700 babies born in the United States each year is born with Down syndrome. And whereas medical advances have significantly increased the life expectancy of people with Down syndrome, which is now approaching that of peers without the condition, in addition to the advantages of modern medicine, support groups and other resources are now available in nearly every community in the United States
 and whereas when provided with quality education programs, a stimulating home environment, good healthcare, and support from family and friends, people with Down syndrome can lead fulfilling and productive lives, much progress has been made through the vision and hard work of parents, researchers, medical professionals, and other advocates who have helped secure the rights of people with Down syndrome to live at home, attend schools,
 access appropriate health care, get married, find work, and contribute to society, while research and early intervention have dramatically improved the lifespan and quality of persons with the condition, more work remains to be done to fully comprehend the causes and to explore potential treatments, and whereas in 2011 the United Nations General Assembly declared March 21st
 as World Down Syndrome Day.

The final proclamation is Greater El Paso Association of Realtors Day. See, this is proof that children come at all ages. Right, Scott?
 Children come at all ages, I said. They do. I do need to thank you for not bringing Andrew Haggerty with you. Whereas today we stand in proud recognition of the Greater El Paso Association of Realtors, or GEBHAR, and its Governmental Affairs Committee, their unwavering dedication and passionate advocacy over the past year have not only set a high standard for civic engagement, but have also brought distinguished honor to our beloved city of El Paso.
 It is with immense pride that we celebrate Gebhar's achievement of winning the prestigious 2024 Mark Lehman Local Board Governmental Affairs Achievement Award, an accolade that speaks volumes of their commitment to our community and the real estate profession. And whereas this year Gebhar exceeded over 10 other associations from major Texas cities, including Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, to clinch this esteemed award.
 This monumental victory is a testament to the tireless efforts and collective spirit of all volunteer members of Gephardt, who have dedicated countless hours to advocating for property rights, engaging in meaningful community initiatives, and ensuring that El Paso remains a wonderful place to live, work, and thrive.
 Whereas the Greater El Paso Association of Realtors achievements in governmental affairs have not only enhanced the local real estate landscape But have also contributed significant to the significantly to the betterment of our community There's successful campaigns including a remarkable victory against prop K and the development of short-term rental alliance exemplify their excellence in advocacy and their profound impact on the public policy and
 And whereas the city of El Paso congratulates Gebhaar for this well-deserved recognition, your hard work, passion for advocacy, and dedication to improving our community have truly made a difference.

 Witness thereof is the Honorable Mayor, Oscar Leaser. Congratulations. Thank you. My name is Scott Kestner. I have the honor of serving as Governmental Fair Chair for the Greater El Paso Association of Realtors in 2024. I'd like to introduce some of the leadership with me, Jackie York.
 is our Texas Realtor Issues Policy member, also TREPAC trustee alumni, Isabel Chacon, Political Involvement Committee. Jennifer Viescas is a Texas Realtor Director. DJ Mora, Texas Realtor RVP. AE, Tony Delgado, Association Executive Tony Delgado. And Ernesto Garcia, I think the best GAD in the entire state of Texas.
 And last but certainly not least, our 2024 president, Shai Rodriguez. Number one, thank you for the proclamation. The Mark Lehman Award is the most prestigious award in Texas for any local association. It's especially significant to me because I got to serve with Mark for 15 years as a volunteer at Texas Realtors. He truly made Texas Realtors the voice for real estate in Texas.
 The award is a result of outstanding volunteers in our association, not only in governmental affairs, but in all aspects of our community. I need to thank each representative and city staff for working with us in 2023 on a number of issues. Together we worked to make decisions that were in the best interest of homeownership, private property rights, and the City of El Paso. There was not always agreement, but there was always dialogue and respect for each person's position.
 Homeownership is the strength behind local communities and truly the American dream.
 In El Paso in the last year, over 2,000 veterans and their families bought and moved into the American Dream in El Paso. An additional 2,400 families bought in our community using FHA financing that is exclusively for owner-occupant, with the majority being first-time homebuyers. Greater El Paso Association of Realtors, over 3,000 members, will continue to help all home purchasers and sellers
 navigate the real estate transaction, and represent their fiduciary interest. 2024 will certainly bring challenges to all of us, but I say with confidence, the Greater El Paso Association of Realtors, under the leadership of 2024 President Chad Rodriguez, and with over 3,000 members, these challenges will be met. Again, thank you for the recognition, but most of all, thank you for working with us to make El Paso a great place to call home. Thank you.
 And I do want to thank Ms. York. She's been my appointment to CAD for eight years now, so thank you for serving. Yes, ma'am. Did you want to continue with a consent agenda? We'll finish the last with Cesar Chavez. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. And then we'll go to that. We now move to item number 28. Thank you.
 Item 28 is discussion in action to approve a resolution to recognize March 31st 2024 as Cesar E Chavez Day. Viva Cesar E Chavez si se puede. As part of continued efforts to address systematic barriers to racism inclusiveness fair and higher wages Celebrate and uplift communities of color this item was submitted by Representative Rivera. Thank you representative Rivera. Thank you mayor Thank You mr. Byrne resolution
 Whereas Cesar E. Chavez was an American born on March 31, 1927 to Mexican immigrants and proudly served in the United States Navy. And whereas Cesar E. Chavez was an American farm worker, labor leader, and civil rights activist, who with Dolores Huerta co-founded the National Farm Workers Association that later became the United Farm Workers Union.
 And whereas for 30 years Cesar E. Chavez tenaciously devoted himself to the problems of the workers in America and whereas the social movement Cesar E. Chavez inspired succeeded in raising salaries and improving working conditions for farm workers in California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida. And whereas on March 28, 2014, President Obama proclaimed March 31st as an international
 National Cesar E. Chavez Day, a day devoted to the promotion of service to the community in honor of his distinguished lifetime work and for what he's taught us about making America a stronger, more just, and more prosperous nation. And whereas on June 22nd,
 2022, the City of El Paso unanimously approved designating March 31st as a municipal holiday in honor of the late civil rights leader and activist Cesar E. Chavez, and whereas local organizations like Service Employees International Union honor Cesar E. Chavez's legacy by standing in solidarity, improving employees' lives by addressing systematic barriers and racism
 improving employment conditions and fighting for equal and higher wages for union members. And now, therefore, it be resolved by the Mayor and Council of the City of El Paso that March 31st, 2024 shall be known as Cesar Chavez Day. Viva Cesar Chavez. Make a motion. Motion to approve. Second. Second. So motion and a second, then a couple people to speak. Welcome. Good morning, Mayor and honorable members of the City Council.
 On behalf of our Health Care Workers Union, I stand before you with a heart filled with gratitude. It is a profound honor to receive recognition on Cesar Chavez Day, a day that celebrates the legacy of a true champion for social justice and workers' rights.
 The recognition bestowed upon us today serves as a reminder of the vital role that organized labor plays in our community. It reaffirms our commitment to advocating for fair wages, safe working conditions, and equitable treatment for all healthcare workers.
 As we celebrate Cesar Chavez Day, let us draw inspiration from his legacy and recommit ourselves to the ongoing struggle for social justice and workers' rights. Together, united in purpose and solidarity, we can build a brighter future for all.

And that revision is to include the funding source as zoo operating fund, account number 452-3400-52140-531100-P5242, and noting district as all. I'm glad you read the hard part.

And we have Ms. Lisa Turner, who signed up to speak. Ms. Turner, good morning. Good morning, Mayor, Council. For the sake of the public, could you give us a short breakdown of your plans? Thank you.
 Mayor, would you like to pull that item from consent to the regular agenda? She's asking for a breakdown of the application. There's no motion to pull it, so we'll leave it on there. We'll leave it in there. Thank you. Representative Rivera? I mean, I'm sorry. Firo? Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to item number 47 postponed for two weeks, please. To add to the consent?

 Seconded by a representative at non this and this is to approve the consent agenda as revised on that motion call for the vote And the voting session and that motion passes unanimously Can we research now, please? Is there a second? Is there a second to recess? Second there's a motion in the second to recess a City Council meeting all in favor anyone opposed? I?
 And the meeting is in recess at 1016 in order to take photos with his morning's honorees. Council, we have eight items that we are... Council member? Representative, none. This is right there. Can we have a motion to return? There's a motion and a second to reconvene the City Council meeting. All in favor? Anyone opposed? And the meeting is back in session at 1055 a.m. The next item on the agenda is item number 30.
 This is discussion in action on directing the city attorney to prepare resolution amending the City Council rules of order specifically section 13 right of citizens to be heard to specify that
 That public comment received in writing or letters submitted to become part of the record in accordance with the already established procedure shall upon the request of the submitter be read into the record by the city clerk or staff designee and that the duration of the reading of each submitted letter shall be limited to three minutes after which point the reading will be truncated by.
 but the entirety of the text will still be included as part of the record, and that the reading of such letters will occur during the public comment period, but after all speakers participating either in person or remotely, telephonically, have had the opportunity to address the city council. And this item was placed by Representative Canales. Motion to delete. Second. So motion and a second to delete the item. Miss Prine? We shall have a motion and a second to delete the item. There is a motion.
 by Mayor Pro Tem Kennedy, seconded by Alternate Mayor Pro Tem Molina to delete. Mayor, I have a point of clarification. If Representative Canales was first to speak, doesn't he get the opportunity to make the first motion? But once we get a motion to delete, it stops all conversation. Right, but doesn't one have to hold the floor to make a motion, theoretically? We haven't been doing that. This would be a new thing since everybody just seems to make a motion and a second. So we have a motion and a second to delete the item.
 Yes, there is a motion and a second to delete item number 30. On that motion, call for the vote in the voting session. And the motion passes 5-3. Representatives Kennedy, Molinar, Salcido, Fierro, Rivera voting aye. Representatives Acevedo, Hernandez, Canales voting nay. The motion to delete does carry. That brings us to item number 31.
 Item 31 is discussion of the progress toward implementation of the targeted code assessment Adopted by resolution by the City Council on October 10th, 2023 to include current status total funds expended progress toward Final review adoption which is targeted for February March 2024 in the council approved timeline and plan for completion and this item was submitted by representative canales represent canales Thank You mayor Yes, this is
 This is an item that I wanted to bring forward because the council in a meeting on October 10th of last year adopted a resolution to formally adopt the infill and redevelopment policy targeted code assessments that were proposed last year. This was a sizable project. The city hired an outside consultant.
 to help us develop these recommendations. And again, last year in October, the council formally adopted a resolution that directed the city manager and staff to implement the targeted code assessment in a manner generally consistent with the recommended strategies and policies contained within the plan and generally consistent with the recommended implementation phases. I have that recommended.
 timeline here in front of me and it shows fall of last year winter 2023 a public draft released mid-november public outreach beginning in early January of 2024 and a final review presented to the Council for adoption in February slash March of 2024 that hasn't come back to us yet
 I am not aware of any public outreach that's happened. And again, this is a council adopted plan with the council adopted timeline. The council adopted it unanimously by a vote of the council in October of last year. And so I'm seeking an update on where we are on this project. Again, I know we've expended a significant amount of funds. I believe it's budgeted at $350,000.
 And a lot of that has been expended already on the work of the consultant. And so I'm seeking an update. Yes, good morning, Mayor and Council. Sam Rodriguez, Chief Operations Officer. So we did receive a draft document late January, early February for a review. We've been vetting it internally with staff. And so we're developing a plan that reviews the proposed changes.
 as well as understand what it means from a comprehensive update for the whole title 20 as well and what future updates may be required so that it could be more implemented more comprehensively as well we're developing that plan we'll be running it by the city manager with an updated timeline and we'll be bringing back back to council likely through a work session so that we can get counsel to review it and then begin the public outreach on the full plan
 By the full plan, you mean the targeted code assessments that were adopted in October? It's the code amendments that have been proposed that were submitted in late January, but we want to make sure that we look at it comprehensively. So we've been working with plan inspection staff to understand the whole impact.
 of what that means again from title 18 as well we just kicked off the comp plan as well so we want to make sure that we understand how that fits all the puzzle pieces uh put the plan together and then bring forward any code amendments that were presented but also present the city council what additional amendments may be required comprehensively for title 20 as a whole so
 Mr. Rodriguez, with respect, there were two segments of code amendments that were proposed that the Council adopted back. Not the amendments weren't adopted, but the plan to implement them was adopted back in October. The first set was labeled quick fixes.
 These were code amendments that did not have to be done together with a comprehensive plan update. It didn't have to be done with a comprehensive rewrite of Title 18 or Title 20. These were supposed to be stand-alone, quick wins. They're labeled in staff's presentation as quick fixes that could be implemented quickly.
 There's another segment called longer term efforts and it details that public outreach happening this summer and adoption of those into the future. But those are very clearly segmented in the rollout plan for this. Again we were expecting and you know I've presented to many of my neighborhood associations about this. They were very involved.
 In the process of developing this, they worked together with the consultants on Onward Alameda and the Downtown, Uptown, and Surrounding Neighborhoods Plan and directly with the consultant, Clarion, on this particular project. So they've put in a lot of time and effort into this as well. And frankly, we were all expecting for that to return to us for adoption by, I mean, today is the last meeting of,
 of march it says february march 2024. again with respect i don't think that this has to be tied into an update of the comprehensive plan or an update of title 20 that's that's more comprehensive these are specific standalone code amendments that the council directed staff to prepare and present to us by today's meeting
 Understood representative again. We received a lot of document late January early February. So it's been through internal review We'll be developing the plan running that through the city manager through our strategic business review SBR process and bringing that forth to council but again, I think from a
 an implementation standpoint as well. A plan inspections needs to be involved through that process, so we wanna make sure that we get them online so these code amendments can be implemented, and that's part of the process that we're going through right now. We'll be bringing, again, likely through a work session, an updated plan with an updated timeline. We'll be happy to meet with you, to share with you what has been submitted in draft form so you can see what those quick fixes are and see what's coming and give you a preview of that. But we wanna make sure that we run it through our process and that we present a plan that can be implemented and sustained.
 we received the the draft back and after having some discussions with both planning and inspections and the capital improvements department felt like we needed to to do a little bit more with that before we would bring that forward to the city council so we'll make sure that you see how we're progressing with that this i don't anticipate that taking too long before able to bring that back to the city council
 We're certainly within the timeframe we had initially talked about. You're correct. So we bring it back by the last meeting. I would ask that we'd have just a little bit more time to get that so that it's a much more comprehensive look at these, at the targeted code amendments before we bring that forward to you all.
 Yeah, again, I think it's fair if staff needs more time, but again, because it's a council-adopted timeline, I would just ask that in the future you bring something to the council and say, we need more time to look at this, we received the draft amendments back late, something like that.
 Because, frankly, we haven't heard anything about this, and the public draft release was supposed to happen mid-November. I understand we didn't have it in mid-November because it didn't come back from the consultant. No, and we didn't get the draft back until a little bit later as well from the consultant. So I agree, giving you an update on where we are with it to make sure that we're within the time frames appropriate, and we'll make sure we do that.
 Do we have an anticipated time when the public outreach can begin? That was supposed to start early January. That's what I told to my constituents, to expect early January. Yeah, we need to develop that plan again. We're working on it. I need to run it by the city manager through our internal process, and we'll be happy to share that with council, again, via email, and then formally do a work session item to present that to you. Okay, that's all my questions for now. Thank you, Mr. Canales, Representative Fierro.
 Thank you, Mayor. I'm pushing the wrong button. No, thank you. First, you know, these amendment changes, changes to the code amendments have such far repercussions. And so I, for one, thank you for not bringing this to us earlier or half-baked.
 We've had examples of that in the past, like the short-term rental issues that we went through early on. I would encourage the city manager to continue to not bring things to the council half-baked. And so, Mr. Rodriguez, please continue to do your work and keep us informed and help us to keep our constituents safe and happy. Thank you, Mayor.
 Thank you, sir. Representative Nunes? No, I just wanted to reiterate that I agree with Representative Canales. Every time that we bring forward a resolution, it's not been addressed timely.
 And so what I would recommend, because there are timelines that we've put forward similarly to this that have not come forward. And so as it relates to the code amendments, this is a big investment that the city of El Paso has made with these consultants. In addition to that, the time and effort of staff and the public vetting. And so these plans aren't just plans, as other folks have said here, just so that you can shelve them. These are plans that are going to improve neighborhoods and that they're going to help with completing neighborhoods. And they're going to be...
 appropriately set the standards for neighborhoods so that we're not having to pay for them 20 30 years down the road and so I do want to re-emphasize that this is a priority for my district as well it should be for the entire city
 I agree, don't bring something forward to us that's not complete, but please educate us who are very interested in making sure that our policies are sound, they're improved, they're being inclusive, they're complete neighborhoods, that we are holding the developers accountable so that they finish the neighborhoods appropriately so that we're not having to do the work behind the scenes to put speed cushions, to put better sidewalks.
 to put trees, to put anything that a neighborhood needs that they waive, bike lanes. So right now your code allows for you to do all of those administrative amendments. We just waive all of our needs for our neighborhood. We're just waiving them administratively. I disagree with that. We need to have this plan forward.
 We need to take it seriously because my assumption here is that we're just shelving this aside after we've made this incredible investment. We owe it to the taxpayer to make sure that this comes to fruition. In addition to that, what I would like to see, and this might be a practice during your SBR, is...
 GO BACK OVER THE YEAR, LOOK AT ALL THE RESOLUTIONS AND ALL THE TIMELINES THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE I CAN NAME A FEW BUT I'VE ALREADY ASKED FOR UPDATES FROM THE CITY MANAGER BECAUSE I'M HAVING TO SEEK THOSE UPDATES BECAUSE NO ONE ON YOUR CITY MANAGEMENT TEAM IS COMING TO US PROACTIVELY TO KEEP WITH THESE TIMELINES. IF YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE THEM, JUST COMMUNICATE THAT. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION WITH ALL OF THESE REQUESTS BECAUSE I'M NOT SEEING IT ON MY END. MY HOPE IS THAT YOU
 particular work, mixed use development, reinvestment into neighborhoods. You're having a lot of development in the Northeast, Eastside and Westside where we're already experiencing long periods of traffic. We need to, like I'm saying, we need to get serious about this. I just want to reemphasize that if you're not taking it seriously, please do so. Thanks.
 If I can respond, Mayor, that's the reason why we're doing the comprehensive review, because the quick fixes that were anticipated to come before council were focused on the uptown-downtown core area. And so really understanding what that means from a citywide standpoint and how we can roll some of those changes beyond that and what other changes may be required to address the issues that Representative Hernandez was bringing forward is the reason why we're taking this time. But we understand the timing component, Representative Hernandez, and we'll be looking at those resolutions as well. Thank you.
 Well, I want to respond to that because I don't think it's fair to say that we're not taking it seriously. We are. We have done the work with the consultant. You don't have to look at staff. You can look to me. I know the draft is supposed to be done in this time frame. It's my responsibility to make sure I communicate that to you if that's not the case.
 I'll take the hit on this being pushed further, but I'm not allowing our staff to bring it forward If I don't believe that the draft work that's been done is comprehensive enough So so I'm responsible for that and I'll make sure that we bring that forward Thank you, sir. Mayor Pro Tem that you take yourself off or we're next go ahead. You're not just push the wrong button Have you been asked for updates on this issue? previously to this
 Not since the the council made the approval of the Adopted the timeline. No, I have not. Oh Thank you Canales Thank You Mary Um, I just I'm gonna emphasize one more time because I've heard a few times that the the targeted amendments have been held back Because of a need to look at citywide comprehensive amendments I want to I'm looking at slide 17 from the presentation that was given to the council in October and
 It lists the Tier 1 targeted code amendments, and then it says in quotes, quick fixes. It says that they will address commonly cited issues that are expected to have broad support. Quick fixes can be used to test new concepts or enhance tools, and that is an advance of Tier 2, the new tools, which is a more complex code update and other changes that warrant more in-depth discussion citywide, and so again, we very deliberately, and when I say we, I don't mean the council. The council adopted this, but this was something that staff developed
 developed this two-tier structure where the first tier would be implemented in the focused area looking only at a
 You know, it's it's it's the overlap of certain plan areas the downtown and uptown and surrounding neighborhoods plan the the Top incentive areas in the core of the city the onward Alameda corridor plan It's I would say 90% of the area is contained entirely within district 8 With small areas looking like they branch into maybe district 2 and district 3 but the bulk of this is within district 8 and
 because these were supposed to be done as a test before the comprehensive rewrite. And so I just wanna emphasize one more time, I don't think it's appropriate for these to be held back because they need to be incorporated into the citywide code rewrite effort. The whole point of these was to be done as a test before that.
 And that's what staff presented to the council and that's what the resolution that the council adopted emphasized and affirmed so again
 You know, we've gone through the process over several years now where the city has adopted the complete streets policy that plays into this, the TOD incentive policy that I know is being looked at but that plays into this, Onward Alameda, Downtown Uptown Surrounding Neighborhoods Plan, the infill and redevelopment policy which was refreshed in the last couple of years.
 This is the implementation strategy for the findings of all of those plans. And we do face criticism all the time that the city pays for plans and then they sit on the shelf. I've been assuring people that that's not the case anymore. We have robust implementation planned. I've shown them this presentation from October to try to put them at ease that, yes, we're spending all this money and we're asking them to invest all this time with the consultants, but this will be implemented.
 here's the timeline for it and that that's why I'm bringing this forward like I just I can't stress enough that I you know we are promising this publicly and then I'm wary of us not delivering on it and losing the trust that we have tried to build recently and again that's that's my motivation for bringing this forward today thank you mayor thank you sir thank you representative mayor Potem
 Yeah, I mean, I understand, and if it should have come back with an update, I understand that. I get concerned where we're not going to ask you any questions. We're just going to wait and trot it out in a council meeting and then ask for an update, and I just think it's bad policy to do that. Thank you. And...
 Again, there's no one else on here. I want to thank you and I think you all see the importance of us And I think council would rather see it complete and ready to go and start bringing something I think as representative said half-baked
 But we would like, and I think you said you would do some updates coming up. So I appreciate that. And I think everybody up here that spoke got their point across. But we do appreciate that you did bring it. You're willing to bring it back when ready. Thank you for that. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you.
 Ms. Prine, item 32. Yes, sir. Item 32 is discussion and action to direct the city manager to facilitate the hosting of no less than three public community meetings with hybrid virtual participation options on the proposed amendments adjustments to impact fees to include presentations from the city planning and inspections department and El Paso Water on the existing impact fee structure for water and wastewater services.
 the proposal to amend land use assumptions, the capital improvements plan, the calculated proposed impact fees, and the financial impact to rate payers, and that such meeting shall be held before the scheduled public hearing on April 23rd, 2024. This item was placed by representatives Hernandez and Canales. Move to approve. This motion.
 In the second to approve, Renee, can I ask you a question, sir? And then we have questions, too. And then you'll be. Yes, ma'am. I was just going to make a statement, but I'm happy if you would like to use your privilege to speak. I just want to ask a question. I know that we're looking at new impact fees and kind of calculating and see whether we'll change, will not change. So let's say I have a large development in part of town, and I've built 200 homes, and I still have,
 2,000 or 3,000, but I haven't brought the meters to this point because it's a planned community. If council adopts a higher rate, will that developer have to pay the higher rate? Good morning, Mayor. Rene Leon, Legislative Liaison with El Paso Water. If the developer is not
 applied for a permit for those remaining lots he would have to pay the higher rate at the time whatever may be adopted whenever after after whatever council does the new rates would be in effect at the time that he pulls those permits so any developer that has slots but they have not applied yet
 would be subject to any changes whether it's a planned community of thousands of homes or somebody that has subdivided thousands of lots that will be subject to the higher pay yes sir if they are in an impact fee zone yes sir yes
 Thanks for that. I appreciate that. Representative Hernandez? Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to make sure that the Council is aware that this item is just to ask for public community meetings. We're not asking for public hearings because that triggers other things here at City Council. The language is very specific just to talk about public community meetings. And so we had a conversation with City Management as well with El Paso Water.
 The reason why there is an appetite for this is because we're hearing from members of the community that they'd like to hear more directly from our land assumption models and including El Paso Water. The
 type of meetings. I think we could set that discretion to whatever works best for El Paso Water. We're very, very appreciative that you're willing to continue the conversation with the public with open dialogue and transparency. I think what's been a great model that's worked in the past for community meetings is open houses.
 So that because this is very technical that I think it would allow for that one on one with, you know, different residents who have specific questions, especially if they live in a impact area and how they could be potentially impacted. Of course, if they're planning to move to an area because this is all new development area. And so the.
 So again, the purpose is just to seek a meeting so that we can share the information about the process, land use assumptions, and the proposed rates by the consultant of El Paso Water. And then after those meetings are concluded,
 during our discussions at the time of public hearing what I would ask you know how did what kind of feedback you got from from those meetings both from our planning department as well as El Paso water but would would love to continue the dialogue with the public this is a very important issue and and we know the public could benefit from hearing more directly from El Paso water and our planning department so thank you for that cooperation and just for everyone's
 I think Representative Vernone has captured it perfectly. We're planning three community meetings, one near each impact fee zone, so that would be west, northeast central, and east. We'll do it ahead of the April 23rd public hearing, and we'll just try to bring as many people into the fold as possible to share information. Thank you, sir. Representative Canales?
 Thank you Mira and thank you for being here Renee I just want to be extra clear here too you know you're not our staff we're not directing you to do this I appreciate that El Paso water is willing to do this you know the direction was to our staff to help facilitate meetings and
 you know we're grateful that you're willing to to help present and take care of those meetings i think they're important because you know we've gotten a lot of questions from the public about what does this even mean what is an impact fee uh it's something that doesn't come up very often you know it's every every uh few years and uh it's it's also very highly technical so i think it's it's just a subject that a lot of people don't know a whole lot about
 And this will help people to get their questions answered, to understand the decision that the council is going to have to make.
 and to Just understand development a little bit better and and what it you know, what the impact of impact fees. Yeah. Thank you councilman Thank you We're already in coordination with planning to try to get the information distilled as easily as possible so that The public can hear it can understand it and can be informed when it comes time for the public hearing So we're working with Kevin Smith with Philip a tui staff and we'll make sure that everything's easily understandable
 a truncated version of the hour and a half presentation that we've given here before thank you excellent i appreciate it thank you very much representative fioro thank you mr mayor it's no secret that i'm i'm personally opposed to enhancing the county and horizon cities tax base by having these homes move on to those areas at the expense of the city um taxpayers
 Would you mind though, Mr. Leon, sharing whatever presentation you plan on showing the public with us, the council, before the presentation? Yes, sir. Once we put it together, we should have it complete by next week, and I'll send that to everyone. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Representative Moldenard? Yes, sir.
 Thank You mayor Mr. New and thank you very much for being here I just wanted to know who is going to actually take the lead and these presentations Can you over it's our study so it's our information that we want to present So we'll go ahead and take the lead, but we are gonna work in close coordination with city staff. I
 Okay, so you have already identified three different sites specifically you already have a site for the Northeast you mentioned central Northeast We haven't booked any venues pending today's vote But preliminarily we're looking at the Don Haskins Center on the West Probably the Veterans Park Recreation Center in the Northeast and the Far East Regional Park on the east side. Okay, and do you know the format of that meetings? I
 We're going to do an open house style format. So we're going to have stations with boards and information and staff ready to answer questions. And attendees can go from station to station, get information, get their questions answered. And it'll be a very easy to manage format rather than sitting down and presenting information for an hour and a half.
 Well, I respectfully disagree. I heard many times from different constituents whether they go to, let's just say, open house, whether it's TxDOT, and I'm not putting them down, or any other city meetings where they're open house style, if you will, and you're just free to roam and ask questions and you see diagrams. They also ask you to, hey, put a sticker here. If you accept this, put a blue sticker, put a green sticker. If you don't like this, put a red sticker.
 You know to me that's not necessarily the best the feedback that we receive doesn't work people are reluctant to participate Well, first of all, they're reluctant to attend and second they're reluctant to even participate in that manner So I would like to see if possible, you know with Mr. Ballou and your team and your effort to go back to open house or excuse me a a
 where you sit down, there's a PowerPoint presentation, it's English and Spanish, there's question and answer period and people get to understand, maybe even passing out some literature of some sort so that when people leave they have something to take home. If they have any questions they have a format that, hey, I can call this person, I can respond by sending an email, something like that. I think we can, we can,
 pick the best of both formats for this. The trouble we've had with sit-down formal presentations is someone can walk in late, misinformation. It's a lot of information, especially on this topic, to take in, which is why we feel the open house staff to attendee format is better. We can provide some sort of fact sheet so that people can walk away with the key facts on the issue. And another benefit of the open house is people can walk in whenever they want and start the process
 rather than having to walk in at the beginning and stay through the end. But what our staff can do to make sure that everyone feels as informed as possible is give a presentation on that station rather than just sit there and wait for questions to be asked. They can go through the information, make sure everyone understands it, answer questions on the spot, and if someone needs a little more time, staff is there to talk to them a little longer.
 And I know it's probably too early, but do you have a day of the week? No, sir, we don't yet. Okay. Would it be possible if you could come back to us as city representatives here at a future city council meeting during that same time period to get the announcement out, to get more feedback, more input from the community as well? Sure, we can work with your office or with Representative Fernandez or Canales' office to get on the agenda.
 But even before it makes it onto agenda we can send the information directly to you and your staff and if you want to publicize It that way that'll help us get it. Okay there. Hey, mr. Leona personally like to be briefed By El Paso water before you start the meetings. Thank you. We can get that range. Thank you Good morning mayor and City Council Kevin Smith with planning inspections. Good morning, sir So we'll work with El Paso water staff and our PIO office to arrange those meetings and and and
 Determine that and as well as work with the representative offices as well in case I can piggyback off of those meetings as well Thank you for that. Thank you. Well that much prime.

I'm sorry mayor I wasn't gonna try to get up until I knew I was gonna be able to speak and
 I'm not picking on District 5, but in September of last year, there was $4,000 to go to a TML conference. Now there's $5,000 going to this conference. If these trips serve the city, then I think it's best that my council put a line item in the budget for this and not come from discretionary funds. That's my suggestion. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Turner.

 Item number 40 is a public hearing on an ordinance changing the zoning from PI plan industrial to C3 commercial and imposing conditions at 1150 Vista de Autodrive. Representative Rivera. Mr. Garcia, was there any opposition to this?
 Good morning, Mayor, Councilor Rodriguez. There was no opposition to this. Sorry, but. No opposition received. And I'm not drinking coffee, okay? And so, but support for this thing? Yes, sir. Okay, so if you're not, what are you drinking? Thank you. Motion to approve. Second. Representative Acevedo. On this, I was looking through the backup, and can you give me more of a description on what charter school is gonna be built?
 We don't we as staff don't have that detailed information. We just know it's a charter school. That's that's what's been. I'm sorry That's we just know that it's a charter school Correct. That's one of the uses that would be permitted In this proposed c3 zoning that would just be one use of all other uses that would be submitted in c3 That would be allowed in c3
 Yeah and I talked to Representative Trivedi about this. I just fundamentally I don't think that we should be approving charter schools. I think that a lot of these networks are not really having great oversight and I have a lot of concerns with that so I'm not going to prove it and I think that
 Just to provide some clarity, schools, these particular schools would be permitted in all districts, but your comments. No, no, I get it. And that's why I said the comment to Mr. Rivera because 99.9% of the time I would be like, yes, it's your district. And I wanted to respectfully let him know that that's why I was doing that and just wanted to put that out there.
 Sorry respect that until you respect that sure. Thank you. Thank you. There's a motion in a second. Yes, sir There's a motion made by representative Rivera seconded by representative Fierro to approve the ordinance Excuse me on that motion call for the vote in the voting session and the motion passes six to one alternate mayor Pro Temo Lina not present and representative Acevedo voting nay
 The next item is 41 and this is a public hearing on an ordinance changing the zoning from R4 Residential to a to apartment and opposing a condition at 47 0 7 Atlas Avenue Move to approve and we do have public comment from mr. Raymond Seta I
 Good morning, Mr. Manceta. You have three minutes. Good morning, Mayor and City Council. I'm Ray Manceta, and in accordance with the lobby ordinance, I represent the client. We concur with staff comments, CPC, and the planning department. Thank you so much. With that, we have a motion and a second. Yes, sir. The motion was made by Representative Acevedo, seconded by Representative Fierro, and this is to approve item 41. On that motion, call for the vote and the voting session.
 And that motion passes unanimously. Item 42 is a public hearing on an ordinance changing the zoning from RF Ranch and Farm and R4 Residential to AO Apartment Office. And this is at 1165 Ranger Street. Motion to approve. Second. There's a motion made by Representative Rivera. Seconded by Representative Salcido to approve item 42. There's no public comment on that motion. Call for the vote in the voting session.
 And that motion passes unanimously. Item 43 is a public hearing on an ordinance amending Title 15, section 15.08.160 mobile billboards, ending the mobile billboard pilot program and allowing mobile billboard permits to be issued on a yearly basis. And we do have public comment. Ms. Turner. Yes. Question one, how much are we charging? Question two, can we put a requirement
 that the vehicle is used for these mobile billboards be licensed in the county of el paso texas and not have an out-of-state license is that possible we're going to plan inspections again in terms of the fee there is a 1500 dollar yearly fee that's assessed and i'm sorry mammy if you can repeat your other questions the other question is i see a lot of out-of-state license plates used by businesses in el paso so can we
 Make an amendment to this that if you're gonna have this that you have to license your vehicle within this county So they'll be paying the road taxes and such since they'll be driving up and down all our roads Now that is can we actually I don't think we can actually restrict somebody to register their vehicle If they're not residents of this over the city of El Paso
 I mean if the residents of New Mexico and we're telling that through I don't think that's within our jurisdiction Make somebody register vehicle within a county
 I believe you're correct, sir. Just to provide additional information, provision of insurance is definitely a requirement that is written into the ordinance as well. A list of other mitigation measure requirements that are written into the ordinance as well to allow us to oversight and keep an eye on these. And insurance and things like that. Yes, sir. Can we at least get a road use fee then? No.
 I mean, look, I have to pay for your garbage trucks. Franchise fee, maybe. I have to pay for your garbage trucks on the roads. You're talking about a franchise fee. I have a private pickup, but I still have to pay for your garbage trucks on my water bill. So...
 You know, a road use fee to me is fair. If you're going to be driving up and down in the traffic, polluting our air, I think this will be a small fee. And I think that's the permit fee that they're going to pay. You can call it whatever. That's just so they can drive up and down. I'm asking for some additional income. We're always looking for additional income, and this is the way to get it. They'll have to pay for the permit. Representative –
 I'm going to go with Representative Canales. Thank you, Mayor. I understand there are only two license holders currently who are operating under the pilot program. Yes. I did just a cursory search online yesterday, and I found, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 companies that advertise mobile billboard services in El Paso.
 That's El Paso. Can you tell me the two life current license holders? It's El Paso billboards and Lone Wolf trucking. Okay. Lone Wolf is not one of the ones I found. So that's an 11th.
 But I found El Paso billboard trucks, Sun City billboards, Texas mobile advertising, American mobile ads, Indisium display network, Blue Line media, Rolling Box media, MIG advertising and mobile billboards, EP LED mobile billboard trucks, and Do It Outdoors media, who the last one actually has an active job listing for a driver in El Paso right now. What actions have we taken to enforce unlicensed companies operating during the pilot period?
 So there have been court enforcement actions, procedures that have been performed in the past, and that's something that we can definitely continue to get these businesses to come in and comply. Do you know how many citations we've issued to businesses for operating without the proper license? Off the top of my head, that'd be difficult, but I know there's multiple. There's more than one, definitely. Okay.
 Okay, is there any enforcement mechanism that's built into the code in terms of what's currently the pilot and is being proposed?
 Yeah, I mean ultimately the permit can be revoked at the discretion of the city if there's any type of non-compliance in terms of overall The businesses you mentioned there has been the car code enforcement Established process what would kick in right but I'm not asking about revocation of the permit for Permit holders. I'm talking about enforcement of non permit holders operating without the license. What is the mechanism? they are code enforcement process that may ultimately end up in in front of court for no judge and
 Is that, it's a nuisance violation or? It's zoning code. Or in this case, a code violation, Title 15 violation. And that's, is it a, that's a misdemeanor? I'm sorry? Is it a misdemeanor to operate without the license? Citation, right? Just a citation? Yeah. It's a class C.
 And what is the fine for the class? That's at the discretion of the judge. If I'm not mistaken. A maximum 500 500 maximum. Traditionally most of our violations are $500. I don't know the specifics for this one and there's higher but I don't think this one falls under the higher. OK. I want to point out too.
 Currently, and this is, as far as I understand, there may be one other outlier out there that I wasn't able to find, but as far as I understand, during the period of the pilot program, El Paso, the city of El Paso, is the only municipality or county or state in the United States that allows mobile billboards on our right-of-way.
 and has a program that licenses them Clark County Nevada which is where the Las Vegas Strip is located had a limited run pilot program on the Strip only and they terminated that pilot program because it was found to be too dangerous they were seeing too many distracted driving incidents there is not a single other municipality in the United States that allows this I find it
 I find it difficult to believe the justification that we've had no complaints, and so it's not a problem. I think people aren't calling in to complain that they were distracted while they were driving by a billboard truck. Who would they even call? That's not something that people typically call in. I don't think people are even aware that these are prohibited in most of the United States.
 I personally have seen them while driving. I think I've seen some of the unlicensed ones while driving. They're not the two companies that you mentioned. And I personally find them incredibly distracting.
 at a time when we are taking efforts to pass like complete streets policies and you know working with partners like TxDOT to reduce traffic fatalities I think this brings us entirely in the opposite direction it's adding distractions to the road you know fixed billboards are they're fine they're distracting enough they
 for that reason are very strictly licensed by the state, especially on state highways and other highway right of way. You know, they're very specifically limited in number and spacing to ensure that they're not causing undue distraction to drivers. I think allowing billboards to be mobile and not just mobile in terms of repositioning them but actively mobile, driving on the streets with vehicles,
 is a real threat for distracted driving and will lead to incidents into the future, even if it hasn't during the course of the pilot period. So for that reason, I don't think I'm able to support this today. And, you know, I feel for the operators who have moved into the city during the pilot, but it's a pilot program for a reason.
 And I'm just not convinced by the success of it convinced of the success of it during the pilot period. Yes, sir No, I think thank you for your comments. Just just to add just a little bit more content That's why you see all the provisions and restrictions and requirements in this ordinance to get into account What's happening Clark County in other places? Okay. Are you aware of during the pilot period any other cities who have? Enacted anything similar to what we're proposing look closely at that. No, no, sir. Okay. Thank you mayor. I
 Thank you, sir. Representative Salcido. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Ralph, for this presentation. Quick questions. I know this was a pilot. Mr. Garcia, did you have a... Can you give us some findings of the pilot program? Anything that was notable? What did they do good? What did they do wrong? Or was it appropriate? How many citations did we get? I mean, I just want to know a little bit more about...
 Right, I mean, we really didn't encounter too many issues. Again, the opportunity is there for three permits. Of those three, only two have been claimed. Each permit allows three trucks. Of the permits that have been issued,
 Neither one of them have the three trucks. One of them has two, one of them has one. So we really haven't seen any issues in terms of the people coming in to apply for these permits. And we still have that one available permit that's open, I guess, giving a little glimpse into the demand for this type of business.
 Great. And then I know that during the pilot, we only allow two operators. Now that if it does pass and it's not a pilot anymore, it opens to everybody to come in? So the cap for three operators will remain? Yes, ma'am.
 And I think my last question also is in regards to enforcement. As Representative Canales mentioned, it's a little concerning to see that there is other companies advertising, right? And so as this pilot program is already commencing and let's say it goes in effect, I want to make sure we're collecting, right, that people are performing business here in El Paso, that the city is getting its fair share.
 I know that you mentioned enforcement on what procedures you all are doing in order to to Combat those bad out now. I want to combat operators just operators that are not complying with the city of El Paso What are you all doing? I can definitely look at these these advertisements. Obviously we can't control what other businesses what people advertise put out there but we can definitely take a look and follow up with within our guidelines of our code enforcement process and
 And I guess if I could suggest, and I don't know how we are doing it currently, I know that since it's a very small group, you're saying three operators, right? And they're going to have a list of who their customers are. And I know that it will help us as code enforcement is seeing these billboards, right? We'll know who their customer is. And if we do see a billboard that does not have a customer that's on their list.
 on the roster, it can help, I think. Correct. I don't know if that's a way that we could definitely look at finding out how we can enforce this, just so we can not allow that to happen. And I think second to that would be the, it's a class misdemeanor, right? Which is, I think, 500. Yeah.
 A FINE MAXIMUM AND I WANTED TO SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THAT CAUSE COMES AS A COST OF BUSINESS TO SOME BUSINESSES MEANING THEY'LL THEY'LL PERFORM WITH ILLEGAL ILLEGALLY BECAUSE I JUST CONSIDER THIS TO BE A COST OF FOR THEM TO DO BUSINESS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FEE HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH SO DISCOURAGE
 VENDORS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN PART OF THIS PROCESS AND IT'S NOT, THEY'RE NOT A PART OF OUR NETWORK THAT SHOULD NOT BE PERFORMING BUSINESS IN THE CITY OF EL PASO. SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME SUGGESTIONS I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THE FEE WE NEED, IT NEEDS TO ALWAYS HAVE MORE TEETH. I THINK IT REALLY DOES INVITE, YOU KNOW,
 Operators that are not in our network to to operate. So just just some suggestions and thank you so much for for sharing So I couldn't agree with you more on that. It's just built in everyday cost. Absolutely with that. We do have a motion though Yes, the motion was made by representative Rivera seconded by representative Fierro to approve item 43 on that motion call for the vote and the voting session and council please refrain from side conversations on that in the voting session and
 And the motion passes 6-1. Representative Canales voting nay and Representative Hernandez not present. That brings us to item 44, and this is a public hearing on an ordinance granting a special privilege license to Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe, Inc. to allow the surface encroachment of an existing backflow preventer over a city right-of-way located in the alley behind the property located at 700 South Ochoa Street. Move to approve. Second.
 There is a motion made by Representative Canales, seconded by Representative Salcido to approve item 44. There's no public comment. How are you? On that motion, call for the vote and the voting session. And that motion passes unanimously. Representative Hernandez not present.
 The next item is 45 and this is discussion in action on a resolution authorizing the city manager to sign a chapter 380 economic development program agreement between the city of El Paso and Eaton Corporation in support of a development project located at one Helen of Troy in El Paso, Texas 79912 Good morning Philip. Thank you for joining us sir. There's a motion in a second. I
 Yes, sir. There's a motion made by Representative Piero, seconded by alternate Mayor Pro Temo Lina to approve item 45 on that motion. Mayor, I'd request it to speak. Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir. Thank you. I would like to see the presentation, I think,
 When again, I'm supportive of this. I think it's a great thing that we're bringing in Eaton and if they're taking over at the property where they are it makes a lot of sense But I think when it's when we're talking about a an economic development incentive of this size It's beneficial for the public to hear more about it Thank you. Right when we see it. We'll see it with very impressive and being the Helen with our location and all that that I
 it's kind of been a staple property in our community so that's what i agree with
 Go ahead, ma'am. You got it. Karina Brescala, Economic and International Development. As stated on the agenda, this is the approval of a Chapter 380 agreement for Eaton Corporation. This is an expansion project in northwest El Paso, as mentioned, at the Helen of Troy building. The term sheet for this was approved in September of last year, so all of the agreement terms have already been cleared by Council, and the agreement is in alignment with that.
 So, project aligns with the city's 380 incentive policy targeting our capital investment, quality job creation, retention, target industry, and supply chain services. The project aligns with the Texas Economic Development Fund policy, which is where we will be funding the training and property tax rebates. And then the incentive value and cost of services, the expansion provides a net benefit to the city. That is always one of our criteria when we are looking at incentive agreements, and that is no different with this one.
 So right up front, staff's recommendation is for approval of the Chapter 380 agreement as it aligns with the term sheet already approved. Eaton Corporation, this particular expansion, so Eaton has an active 380 executed in November of 2018. They are in compliance with that agreement. They've got a team of over 85,000 professionals worldwide and 200 current employees in El Paso. They're a major employer in our region.
 and they have some recent changes in power delivery systems, which is part of their operations. That has driven a substantial manufacturing expansion. So in addition to maintaining their existing facility, they will be acquiring or have acquired the Helen of Troy complex,
 That is Class A office space, warehousing, and 50 plus acres of land, including 10 acres of undeveloped land, which could be used for future expansions. This expansion makes it the company's largest footprint in North America, joining Schneider Electric and a few others where we are the largest footprint for those companies.
 project metrics for the expansion minimum capital investment of 29 million dollars creating 575 full-time employees 75 of those will be salaried 500 of those are manufacturing jobs and an average salary of 43,000 plus benefits so meeting and exceeding our median County wage minimum metric
 Workforce training will be an investment of $2.3 million to both attract, you know, potentially workers from outside the region, but also upskill and train the workers that we already have here in El Paso for those manufacturing jobs. And then at their current operation and at this expansion, they will retain those 300 FTEs at at least median area county wage.
 A little bit more about Eaton Corp. They are a power management company. They do business in more than 175 countries. They have energy efficiency products and services, so they manage electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical power. Their focus is really on safety, sustainability, and giving people the tools to use power more efficiently.
 They work in different segments across industries, looking at electrical products, electrical systems, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and then recently e-mobility. Companies are often IT services, aviation, and electrical and electronic manufacturing make up the bulk of their clients. Okay.
 They've also had a recent partnership with Microsoft. So Eaton is outfitting all of Microsoft's data centers with grid interactive UPS, which is a way to monitor and react in real time to electric grid changes and help balance services on utilities. Thank you.
 So the current facility is at 78,000 Trade Center, expansion facility one, Helen of Troy. Anticipated investment, $70 million. The building acquisition is part of that. Capital investment, 29 million. And of course, District One. They are also a publicly traded Fortune 500 company. Again, global, a strong presence already in El Paso and Juarez, so we're excited to continue being a supportive partner to them.
 Here's an overview of the total city incentives. It's just around $3.4 million, and we are being matched by the county. So incremental property tax rebate, 15 years at 80%. Construction materials and permit fee rebates during that construction period as they do tenant improvements to the existing building. And then a workforce training rebate during that ramp-up period. Again, investing in our workforce, training and upskilling folks for those jobs, and also training existing employees.
 County matching us and then there's a skills training grant in the county portion as well total local incentive around four point five million about six point four percent of company investment and on the city side those incentives will be sourced from the Texas Economic Development Fund and
 Here's a quick overview of economic impact. Besides all of the kind of qualitative, the investment in the area, continuing to have that presence, the work that they do in the supply chain sector, there's also a direct and indirect impact from your jobs, your salaries, right, as people are employed, where they spend that money. So we wanted to highlight that as well, that under expanded current and then expanded operations. So total operation will have 875 direct jobs, right,
 You'd expect some spin-off of that, and then the salaries have a spin-off, so $1.3 million back to the economy over a 15-year incentive term.
 In terms of direct benefits, we always show this slide. So the community net tax benefit. So this is after incentives to local taxing entities. The city will still expect to see a little under $1.4 million. And then, of course, Sun Metro via sales tax 804,000. The county, UMC, EPCC and then EPISD collecting about $1.4 million net tax benefit over the incentive term, $6 million to all local taxing entities.
 And that concludes my presentation again, we're recommending approval. This is very exciting. They've been working Diligently with us since the approval of the term sheet again. They're in compliance with their existing agreement a Wonderful company really supportive of a lot of our work in this sector And as mentioned by the mayor a good use of that existing building Thank you for the presentation. I know it's all in our backup. I do. Thank you for the presentation
 We got a motion and a second. Yes, Mayor. The motion was made by Representative Fierro, seconded by Alternate Mayor Pro Temo Lina to approve on that motion. Call for the vote in the voting session. And the motion passes unanimously. Representative Hernandez not present. Mayor, it is noon. May we move to call to the public? Absolutely. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. The El Paso City Council is a local government charged with serving the citizens
 of the city and the meetings must be focused on the meeting at charge. The City Council meetings are public meetings under the Texas Open Meetings Act. Public comment is an accommodation and not a requirement of City Council. All persons in attendance are expected to display civility and decorum that is respectful to other persons without the use of insulting, profane, threatening or abusive language. Public comment will not be used for personal attacks against the person
 or group's character or integrity which are not pertinent to city business nor may any member of the public use this forum for political statements or campaigning please note that during call to the public the city council may not deliberate or decide any subject that is not on the agenda however council may propose that a topic brought forth be posted on a future agenda this afternoon we have seven members of the public that signed up to speak the first person is elizabeth crawford
 Ms. Crawford's topic is abortionist discrimination against females and the disabled. Good afternoon, Ms. Crawford. You have three minutes. Good afternoon, and thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, ma'am. We're told and done. Thank you.
 Good afternoon, sir. We're told in John chapter 1 of the Lord Jesus that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. God is the creator. March is designated as Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. March is also designated as Women's History Month.
 Does having a disability make a person unworthy of living? Does being female make a person unworthy of living? Statistically, an enormous percentage of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. In our nation, it's possibly well over 50 percent. Some nations in Western Europe, Denmark, Ireland, is between 98 and 100 percent.
 I spoke recently with a young lady from India who told me that one of her siblings was aborted simply for being female. In Asia, it's very common for couples and here in our land also, people from different ethnic backgrounds to abort someone simply because they're female.
 the largest number of femicides around the world are not those committed in juarez horrific as that may be the largest number is the slaughter of baby girls in the womb it's time for us as people to stop playing god to stop saying who deserves to live and who doesn't we're told in revelation 4 11 you are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor of power
 For you have created all things and for your pleasure they are and were created. Thank you so much. Hope you have a good day. Thank you. Thank you. The next speaker is Steven Strummer. I don't see him, ma'am. I don't see him either. We'll move on to Patricia Osmond. Miss Osmond's topic is ethics violations, mismanagement, self-dealing, and misappropriation by individuals paid by tax dollars. Good afternoon, Miss Osmond. Good afternoon, ma'am. We'll ask you to refrain from personal attacks and you'll have three minutes.
 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. So last city council meeting, we did a little follow the bouncing ball with documents I gave all of you. This table had them as well. And they were not attacks, but they were proof that the city's management teams are not actually doing their job of managing because what you are supposed to do
 is ensure that those under you are abiding by the rules of whether it's a corporation or the city of El Paso. Those are ethics rules. You can't steal something, no misappropriation of funds. Certain rules all of us should be living by in regards to just, you know, the reason why we have laws. But unfortunately, it's very evident that...
 Certain purchasing departments, they don't check whether employees are receiving bids, even from their own departments. Supervisors doing that. Directors not checking. Deputy city managers not checking. Hence why we need to make sure that there's an extensive search and a good one for the person that's going to replace Mr. Weston as the interim. Okay? Okay.
 I GAVE YOU ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS IN REGARDS TO THE MPC AND THE PLAN THAT WAS PUT OUT BY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT WHICH SHOWS A RIGHT-OF-WAY OVER HERE AT THE UNION PLAZA WE'VE GOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY WANTS TO ADD TWO LINES FROM EL PASO TO ALBUQUERQUE WHICH
 New Mexico has been trying to do the railroad down here for years, but the federal government wants to do it, and then a direct line from El Paso to Dallas-Fort Worth. Great economic development. I don't know if she's talking about that one. Okay. But instead, you know what? They gave you all a plan that they didn't even check with the Railroad Commission, so I don't see what those employees are doing or the management above them checking that it came to you all properly. But instead, y'all are just rubber stamping.
 solicitations okay from whatever department and I wonder if talking about Bible verses let's go with Matthew 19 24 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God so maybe we should wonder why people are getting all these solicitations because quite frankly there's some people that aren't going to end up in the kingdom
 since we're really good about praying. And I love Ms. Crawford's constant prayers. Thank you, Ms. Hosman. Thank you, ma'am. The next speaker is Lisa Turner. Ms. Turner's topic is handicapped parking around City Hall enforcement. She will be followed by Ron Como. Good afternoon again, Ms. Turner. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mayor Council. Ms. Turner. Let's talk parking. How many of your employees use parking around City Hall on Tuesday?
 so they don't have to pay somewhere else and who are all the the people who park over in the area that you set aside for people who are doing business with the city i mean the cars are there all day who are they do they work for you are they working somewhere else because if they're working for you if they're working somewhere else they don't belong in that lot
 That's not a parking lot for employees. It's not a parking lot for other businesses. It's a parking lot for those who come down here to do business with you. Now, I get upset about this because I'll be driving around at Sam's waiting for somebody to pull out of the disabled parking lot so I can get in and safely get my scooter down, get it off, get it inside. Same thing if I go up to Albertson's. And the funny thing is,
 I'll see all the carts for those who are disabled, but I won't see other disabled people in there using them. So my question is, is who are these people parking in disabled spots who apparently, quote, my observation, don't meet the requirements to have that tag in the first place? Why are they parking there? I mean, it's difficult. I hear a lot of noise. Pardon me.
 It's difficult trying to find a place to park when you go. You see people walking around in SAMs. They're on their feet for over an hour. They're self-checking out. They're pushing that big load out, and they're putting everything in their car, and they're in the handicapped spot. Excuse me, but if you're handicapped, you're not going to be able to do that. I mean, if you have problems with breathing, you're going to be sucking a lot of air or
 Or you'll be on oxygen. If you're on oxygen, it's easy to see because you've got the thing up there in your nose. You know, it's difficult. Sometimes I have to get further down in a parking lot and not take one space, but I have to take up several spaces simply for me to be able to get to my car, get my groceries in, and get my scooter on the lift safely.
 While we're talking about this downtown is not Handicap accessible if you're in a wheelchair or if you're using the scooter It's not that good. Thank you. The next speaker is Ron Como. Mr. Como's topic is animal services He will be followed by Barbara Valencia and mark Fierro. Good afternoon. Mr. Como. You have three minutes sir. Good afternoon I know you missed me last week Thank you for the candy though It's good stuff
 You know, I came back and I was delivering that stuff and I ran into a, I considered a problem. I was talking to a gentleman and I asked him about the list I gave you of the HOSS programs that are still in place at our shelter. I was asked which ones. The first one to come to mind is the disastrous finder to foster that we're having all these missing strays running around. The conversation went, let's see, what was it now? We cannot pick up all the strays.
 I believe they were told it was an open shelter. The next thing that happened was I was told that it doesn't go against the no-kill plans. Well, if you look at the one that they say they're on, it is an open admission shelter, not a limited intake. And he's already admitted that that's a way to limit intake. Two strikes. We had a short conversation, and then the comment was made yesterday.
 I made the comment about the 46,000 strays that weren't picked up over the period of four years. If you want to narrow it down with just the present director, if you round it off for 22 and 23, and the part of 22 was 20,000 strays that were left unaccounted for on the streets, whatever you want to call it. They're strays. They're not owned. They're not unowned. They're strays. Okay?
 Was astounded at the fact that he said he didn't know where I got the numbers. Well, ladies gentlemen I think I've said several times that these numbers that were given you come directly from the El Paso animal services shelter reports So I'm going to explain it out a little further. We take 2019 the 12 months Live intake we add it up. We do the same thing with 2020 subtract to see what the difference is 2122 and 23
 It's not that hard, but you have to look at shelter reports. The other thing is I wasn't here for the new gentleman That was here. I understand he worked for the SPCA in Houston SPCA is totally different than a city shelter We've already agreed we had no issues in 17 18 and 19 and we need to go back to that plan and put it in place I'm honestly really not interested in plans from the city of Houston, which has the worst stray problem in Texas and
 We have a plan that works. We need to put it completely back in place and stop the messing around. It's time, please. Thank you, Mr. Como. Thank you, sir. The next speaker is Barbara Valencia. Ms. Valencia's topic is animal services, negative outcome. Good afternoon, Ms. Valencia. Please refrain from personal attacks, and you'll have three minutes. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, ma'am.
 Tonight we're having beans for dinner everybody, so if you want to come be my guest Okay, when you add up all the lost animals in the animal services directors audit there are upwards of 800 lost animals Represented here. I couldn't bring 800 animals in here. I wouldn't fit but this is to give you an idea Those are the missing animals in the foster care program But we are not done yet
 Now we need to add the 841 animals missing from the last two years that are not included in his audit. All these animals, gone. Animals never to be seen again, and the Director of Animal Services has the audacity to attempt to minimize his responsibility by claiming the shelter didn't euthanize these animals. There is no difference if Animal Services stuck these animals with the death juice or not,
 They are permanently gone. Technically, they are all dead. They are dead because of this director's irresponsibility. That's why it's called a negative outcome. Nothing about what has happened to these animals is positive. The director failed to do his due diligence to ensure the animals and animal services shelter system are being cared for.
 He has known for two years the foster care program was failing, animals slipping through the cracks, yet he did nothing for two years. The director's bogus letter to the community in no way absolves him from failing to do his job. He can try to pass the buck by blaming COVID and a national vet shortage. Neither of those has anything to do with the director's responsibility to regularly follow up on the animals in the foster care and shelter system.
 The bottom line is this director failed to do his job, failed the community, and most of all, failed the animals he is responsible for. The bigger question is why the director hasn't been removed as Director of El Paso Animal Services. These animals were given that much needed second chance at life until this director consciously and purposely took that away from them. My hope is all of you look at these bags, look at all of these beings that represent an animal.
 They're representing dead animals. The innocent victims needlessly gone. As a direct result of the director, I hope you come up with some answers. Do some deep soul searching and self reflection and answer as to why you allow this to happen on your watch. The simplest answer is he needs to be removed as director of El Paso Animal Services. These animals deserved better. Thank you, ma'am. Ms. Valencia, you've reached your three minutes. Thank you. The next speaker is Mark Fierro.
 Mr. Fierro's topic is animal services. Good afternoon. Mr. Fierro. You have three minutes. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone Thank you for your time. Thank you. Good to see you. So recently we received the city that is received a letter from the director of animal services Addressing the community about an issue that back in February 173 animals were euthanized 29 died in our care
 532 animals were processed and as an outcome, they were lost in our care. This 532 animals for that month lost in care were part of an ongoing foster audit data. I'm sorry, foster data audit, a number that has accumulated since 2021. And as a transparent organization, what this means for our live release rate is that we complete this foster data audit
 we'll see a temporary negative impact on overall lives saved. What this really means is we haven't done anything about that for two years. Can you imagine a department failing to address something that is on every single report that they make and not look at what's really going on there? How can that be? These people are being paid to do that job. I would think that they would show up and do it. I noticed also that
 In this, there were concerns that were brought to the management regarding loss of contact with many fosters. Over the past few years, they've been continuing to work through the challenges of COVID, nationwide veterinary shortage, and overall staff shortage. Why did this take two years to raise a finger to do anything? What we really need is more compassion, people who understand, people who are experienced.
 Apparently we're changing policies and to quote, to include more rigorous counseling for fosters and dedicating more staff to the program. This should be more compassionate care for foster families, asking them what they need. How can we help you? Is your dog or cat spayed or neutered? The one that we provided you to care and you are providing the care for them. You should also read that we're providing more rigorous training for the staff, not for the counseling of our foster families.
 Thank you. Thank you, sir. Mayor and council that concludes call to the public. Thank you, ma'am We go back to item 46. Yes, sir Item 46 is discussion in action on a resolution authorizing the submission of a grant application Which requires no match from the city to the US Economic Development Administration by 2023 distressed area Recompete pilot program phase 2 no proof There is a motion made by
 Representative Salcido, seconded by Representative Rivera to approve item 46. Before we vote, I have Representative Canales, but I do wanna thank you all. I know this is phase two and you've done a lot of hard work on it and we're one of 22 finalists out of 500 and help me finish. 565. So great work and I know that you guys worked really, really hard to get us here.
 I know that at Denman we'll get $50 million, but we're hoping that we do get the $50 million, but we could get it from between there. So I want to thank Omar, you and you for the hard work and look forward to you guys telling us how much you all ended up getting for us because I know you worked really hard to earn the belief of the federal government that what we do here is very important and it really is.
 And you have to tell them they don't know that. So you actually have to go out there and tell them and explain to them what it means for our community to get $50 million and what it will do to our citizens, how it will impact our community, and how it will help us move forward. So, again, I want to thank you all and your team.
 for getting us to the top 22, and I look forward for you all coming in with a bigger smile and reporting how much money we got. So thank you for that. Representative Canales. Thank you, Mayor. Again, it's an excellent application and really an excellent use of grant funding for workforce training, job placement, business development, all different services to local communities
 workers local businesses local employers I Don't think you have to go through the entire presentation But if if you don't mind, I think it'd be a good benefit for for members of the public to understand what we're looking to fund Here, maybe we can you can pick it up from like slide 12 to the end. It's just three slides If that's okay essentially just showing what our projects are that we're looking to fund and and However, we're leveraging resources
 Yes, absolutely. And thank you very much. We're very optimistic and we hope to make our community proud in bringing these funds here. My name is Adrena Pulesio. I'm with the Economic Development. And I guess we're picking up from slide 12. Sorry. All right. So with the ReCompete pilot program, we have these three buckets that we're looking here in the slide. So these are going to be.
 three main areas that we're going to be looking to fund through this initiative. So we've got one here for training that we're hoping to bring some opportunity to our community. We're looking primarily at prime age workers, so between 24 and 55, that are either underemployed or unemployed. So just an opportunity to bring everyone back to our economy and be able to prepare our community for a lot of the opportunities that we've been seeing and a lot of the trends that we see in our regional economy.
 So we're working very closely with Workforce Solutions Borderplex and leading that outreach and that recruitment of our population and finding opportunities to connect with private industry. With UTEP, Fab Lab, and Microsoft bringing those digital skills and being able to have just-in-time curriculum for aerospace and defense, advanced manufacturing, intelligent infrastructure, and some work that we're doing in healthcare.
 And for our second project component, we're looking at job placement and business development services that we're teaming up with a lot of community partners. This is a part that's being spearheaded by the city of El Paso in being able to future-proof our small business and being able to bring a lot of those components that are necessary for growth and for development of our region here.
 It is worth noting that we do have a portion here in budget that will not have any kind of burden on the city when it comes to managing these funds and managing this grant that will last for up to 50 years. For five years, I wish it were 50, but no, it is five.
 So that is something that we're hoping we're going to cover here and really make the best of this opportunity for our region. And for our third project component, we're looking at wraparound services, again working closely with Workforce Solutions Borderplex.
 to make sure that we have a good comprehensive ecosystem for our community, that we can relieve a lot of the pressure and a lot of the boundaries that our community experiences when they're looking into training and looking into upscaling and advancing. So hopefully we'll be able to have all of that support and really be there with our community from the first day of training into their new job placement and making sure that all of those needs are met.
 Within the budget, we do have some set asides. We have five million that are dedicated for our transitioning military members, for our veterans, for their families, and for survivors. This is going to go very much in line with what we're seeing with other initiatives. So we're hoping to see that impact increase to about 600 participants.
 We're putting aside 4 million for intelligent infrastructure training. We're hoping this will impact about 150 participants and have all of this infrastructure stay in the region so we can be able to participate in a lot of trends that we're seeing and a lot of funding that we're receiving that I'll mention shortly, and we've got a
 500,000 that we're working with underserved communities foundation to make sure that we have a really equitable approach and that we can give everyone their best opportunity to participate and upskill and see improvement for their lives and for their families.
 And another set aside of 500,000 that we're working with the Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness and Data Collection, Tracking, and Reporting to make sure that we can really capture the impact of these funds and make sure that we can relay that information and see that impact in our community growth.
 These are some of the local resources that we're going to be leveraging with ReCompete. So this really ties all of these initiatives together, and it makes a more comprehensive system that we can implement. So with ReCompete, with all of these training programs, we're going to be preparing our community to take on a lot of the jobs and a lot of the growth that we're seeing from investments in Build Back Better,
 the NSF Innovation Grants Engine. A lot of what we're doing with intelligent infrastructure we're going to see reflected in the 15 million that we received for EV charging stations grants and pathways for heroes that are going to be augmented, being able to affect more of our community.
 And we expect to be able to have more, I guess, complimentary training and development for those that are in the innovation factory, strengthen our advanced manufacturing district, and be able to really use a lot of the allocations and a lot of the resources that we have, like with the business one-stop shop and a lot of the facilities that we have locally to really make sure that we have that access for everyone. So that's, in a quick nutshell, those last three slides there.
 Thank you. Yeah, I think it's very helpful to hear that. We, as the mayor said, are a finalist, a top 22 out of 565 folks who applied for this grant funding from the federal government, the Economic Development Administration, and they, I understand, will select four to eight finalists in the summer. Okay, I think we've put together... I shouldn't say we. I take no credit. You all have put together an excellent...
 application I'm confident that that we have a good chance to be selected and I think it'll be incredibly helpful to El Paso business across the scale small business to large business employers and employees for us to receive this so thank you for all the hard work you've done on it thank you thank you after looking at your presentation if anyone wants the rest of it of course it is on the back up but
 One of the things that we are leveraging is the greatest resource we do have, and that's our people. And when we go out to the federal government, it's a community of over 85% Hispanic minority community. We can really leverage the needs of our community and over 50,000 veterans in our community. So what you're leveraging, and you said there is no match, there's a big match, are people. So thank you again for that.
 And with that, we have a motion and a second. Yes, sir. The motion was made by Representative Salcido, seconded by Representative Rivera to approve Item 46. On that motion, call for the vote in the voting session.
 And the motion passes unanimously. Representative Hernandez not present. That brings us to item 48, and this is discussion in action that the city manager or designee be authorized to effectuate the listed budget transfer attached to the resolution as Exhibit A for the Police Department. There is a motion made by Representative Rivera, seconded by Alternate Mayor Potemolinar, to approve item 48. Thank you.

 Item 49 is discussion in action on the award of task order two under solicitation 2023-03 97 in support of the Wainwright Park phase 2 project to Keystone GC LLC motion approved We do have public comment from mr. I have a question Having grown up on the playground with merry-go-round swings monkey bars all those fun things You know seeing how far you can jump when you come out of us. I
 a swing and now swings are considered extremely dangerous as a plate for playground equipment I have to ask a question zip line what kind of liability does that present to the city is there any liability concerns with a zip line I mean if swings are dangerous as zip line has to be too
 Good afternoon, E. To respond to that, the zip line does have engineered wood fill for the fall protection. And so we've seen this within different public parks. And so it is a trend that a lot of the parks are going towards. So we have absolutely zero liability concerns with this.
 Is that what I'm hearing? We don't based on the protections we're putting in place, no different than other playground equipment. So it's been evaluated in terms of usage and protection for kids. Okay. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. Yes, sir. There's a motion made by Representative Salcido, seconded by Alternate Mayor Pro Temo Linares to approve Item 49. On that motion, call for the vote. And the voting session.

 Look at my sheet, I only had two people on my sheet. Good afternoon, you have three minutes. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Angelica Matta Lindstrom. I am the Senior Director of Community Resiliency with United Way of El Paso County.
 So United Way has been a very strong collaborator with the city when it comes to supporting a high quality of life and a place for our community. And we currently are a collaborator of the city's El Paso Helps initiative, right? So we're actively working to address the homelessness and support individuals in crisis. So through the collaborative, we have been able to make a direct impact and success of the collaborative is evident.
 Through our intentional focus of homelessness prevention, we've been able to achieve great
 great results. We've extended over 23,000 nights of individuals remaining housed. So we eliminated their eviction and kept them housed, which was really important for us. We are able to also apply savings that we were able to achieve for participants within our program and apply them to help address their food insecurity. And last, the platform, it's created a direct access for community members to
 to speak and work directly with the agency collaborators on solutions helping to address their needs. So we think of the need, even though we have made positive strides, we still face challenges when it comes to homelessness, as well as food insecurity.
 If we look at numbers, mid-2022 to the late 2023, a program that we oversaw received over 2,700 applications for rental assistance. And this resulted in a request of over $12 million. Unfortunately, demand exceeded the resources available, and we were able only to support, I believe, an average of 25%, right? Okay.
 um inflation increase in monthly rental payments and um for housing instability has continued to exist and has been exasperated and we know there's been studies conducted by utep which identified an average of 35 percent of alpacians face food insecurity but within those 35 22 percent worry about making their monthly rental payments or their mortgage payments with the results of becoming unhoused
 So even though we've made positive strides, demand is evident, right? And through dedicated resources and programming and key community stakeholders really working against a common goal, we're able to make these positive strides in fostering the stability for our community members. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor, Mr. Martin is in the queue. Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Martin, star six, please, to unmute your telephone, please. Good afternoon. You have three minutes. I apologize. I'm here.
 Yes, sir. Go ahead. We can hear you. You have three minutes. Good afternoon, sir.
 Good day. And I apologize for not being there in person, but my name is John Martin. I'm the Deputy Director with the Opportunity Center for the Homeless. And I wanted to speak in favor of agenda item number 50. I just heard a portion of Angelica's presentation with United Way, and I do want to echo what she has indicated. But in addition to that, in looking at the vulnerability and the homeless needs within our community, it needs to be recognized.
 that we are seeing significant increases in the number of individuals being served. I just recently looked at about four months worth of data and we've seen over 2000 unique individuals just within the past five months.
 If you contrast that to four or five years ago, that's twice, and we're not even through the year at this point. But one of the blessings that has come out of COVID and the work that we've done with the migrant influx is the value of working together. And I'm specifically referencing the initiative through the Community and Human Development Department that is titled El Paso Helps.
 where you have entities that are working together with a common goal, not only to prevent homelessness, but to make homelessness rare and brief. So I do want to speak in favor of the proposal as reflected in item agenda number 50, and I'll close with that. Thank you. Mayor, that concludes public comment on this item. And we do have Representative Canales. Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, El Paso Helps has been really a transformational effort, I think, in terms of
 Bringing all of these services together. They are all services that existed before but maybe that's not true Most of them are services that existed before but bringing them all together into one program so that people can receive services from one Location at one time. I would like to see the presentation on this. I think it's a An excellent thing that the public should be aware of that. We're investing our ARPA funds in everyone with the others with the Department of Community Human Development if IT can share the presentation and
 So I'm here to provide to you all today an update in terms of the appropriation for the $3 million for the ARPA funds that were designated towards community human development. I'm going to go through this in short order, Representative. As you know, we do have the Department of Community Human Development, which we are tasked with those four pillars. I think that one of the things we like to say is those are some of the most important challenges our community are facing nowadays. When you look at climate, you look at urbanization.
 affordable housing, and then obviously homelessness. So to your point, we're always trying to look at how we can best leverage each pillar to ensure that we maximize the benefits to the community. We know very well, and I think that was said by Ms. Mata, there's not enough funding to cover every single need. And so what we're doing is we're implementing business-like practices to make sure we maximize the use of those funds.
 Just a real quick overview, and I'll just like to add that it's been a resounding success, El Paso Helps. I mean, we're so happy and pleased with the agencies that we decided to partner. That is the United Way, Project Amistad, the Opportunity Center, and we also have Endeavors helping us provide those basic valuable services.
 and something that's never been done before in the city. Matter of fact, one of the things that we're hearing from other communities is they want a copier model, right? There are similar services, but nothing exactly quite like this where you can be in a big, significant crisis at any point in your life, access that portal, you just need access through a smartphone, and basically be able to identify shelter,
 identify housing, get connected with one of the wonderful coordinators from the United Way to assist you further. You know, your kids need a meal, like all those particulars are covered. So we really started with the basic services and we make sure that it's something that we want to continue. And so, you know, really deployed.
 Almost two years ago at this point resounding success one of the things I want to remind to you all this to this council particularly is when we get a Street outreach request to our office. We utilize El Paso helps So all we do is we take that information we go to the portal We then send a very quick street outreach team that tries to assist those folks tries to give them You know, when's the last time you had a meal, you know?
 Do you need any medicine? And so that has been an essential piece of addressing the homeless challenges we're seeing in our community. We're also thinking about how we can improve those services. And so that's just something to consider. So I'm not going to go through each of the services. At some point, we will be bringing back to the council updates.
 See how we can make this bigger, better. See if we can other services we can connect our folks. But again, just wanted to share that. Do you have those details you can share with us? Yes. Can you share those with us please? Yes, Mayor. Thank you. So next slide, we'll just look at the actual funding deployment for the services.
 Again, we want to make sure we're covering the emergency shelter Component with the Welcome Center the Opportunity Center. We also want to have available housing options for our folks in need with endeavors and also Amistad finally we have street averages. I just described it with Amistad and then we have research navigation and and also the integration of a
 the diversity, equity, and inclusion piece with the United Way. So that's basically our approach to completely deplete our ARPA allocation. We think it's an excellent allocation and we're excited to continue to work forward. Thank you. Yeah, again, I would say the majority of the shelter operations are, you know, operated by the various different partners that are located within my district.
 and many if not most of the partners are as well. So the transformation that this has on District 8 and I think on the whole city is immense. You mentioned it can be accessed
 online via even a smartphone right I just wanted to emphasize too there is an in-person location for the portal as well correct at the Center for Civic yes so the Center for Civic empowerment which you know 17th floor the blue flame we have a kiosk there yes absolutely you could access El Paso helps anyone who needs these services but doesn't have digital access of their own they can they can go there and access these services just the same yes sir 100%
 Excellent. Thank you. I appreciate all the work you've done on this I was there at the unveiling of this about a year ago, and it's great to see how far it's come. Thank you Yes, sir. There's a motion made by representative Salcido seconded by representative Fierro to approve item 50 on that motion call for the vote in the voting session and the motion passes unanimously representatives, Hernandez Fierro not present and
