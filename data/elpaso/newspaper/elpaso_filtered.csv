elpaso,How to help and get help in Texas as the winter storm causes power outages,2021-02-16T00:00:00Z,The Texas Tribune,El Paso Times,"Heres a list of the resources being offered in cities across the state. Statewide Texans who have power in their households need to reduce their energy usage as much as possible to reduce stress on the states power grid5. You can reduce your electricity usage by turning down the thermostats below 68 degrees, unplugging lights and appliances, and avoiding use of large appliances like ovens and washing machines. For people without power or heat, The National Weather Service encourages people to close blinds and curtains, close off rooms and stuff towels in the cracks under the door. Texans should also wear layers of warm and lightweight clothing and make sure to eat and drink to warm the body up. State officials are strongly discouraging unnecessary travel due to the hazardous conditions on the roads caused by the snow and ice. If you are in need of power and are able to travel, the Texas Division of Emergency Managements website6 includes a list of warming centers across the state. We still cannot guarantee the safety of the roads. If you absolutely must drive, please stay off freeways and bridges, treat roads like a school zone, remember stoplights are down, and get to where you will stay tonight by late afternoon Roads will worsen again then.

elpaso,Full text: The Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2021,2022-02-28T00:00:00Z,People's Daily Online - English,El Paso Times,"-- The United States has the worlds highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with 34.51 million confirmed cases and 480,000 fatalities, which far surpassed the numbers in 2020. Average life expectancy fell by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. -- Public security situation in the United States deteriorated and violent crimes remained prevalent. There were 693 mass shootings in 2021, up 10.1 percent from 2020. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence. -- More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 U.S. states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a healthy democracy, while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958. -- Around 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against Asian communities is rising. Hate crimes against Asians in the New York City jumped 361 percent from 2020. Fifty-nine percent of Americans said ethnic minority groups do not have equal job opportunities. -- In fiscal year 2021, the United States detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, the highest number since 1998, which more than doubled that of the previous fiscal year. -- A U.S. drone strike during its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children, among which the youngest was only two years old. The United States still held 39 detainees at the Guantanamo prison. Fernand de Varennes, a special rapporteur on minority issues of the United Nations, said the U.S. legal system of human rights protection is incomplete and outdated, which has led to growing inequality. As for the U.S. malpractice in creating human rights crises in other countries in the name of human rights, Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, said Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world. In 2021, the U.S. public persona of human rights defender was totally debunked as the so-called Summit for Democracy under the guise of safeguarding human rights became a farce. At the 48th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries blasted the United States for being the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world and urged the country to address its own severe human rights violations. I. A HEAVY PRICE FOR U.S. EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL Despite having worlds most advanced medical equipment and technology, the United States has the biggest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths globally. The U.S. government never rethinks its response measures and still lacks effective anti-epidemic plans. Instead, it stoked the origins-tracing of COVID-19, and has been keen on passing the buck, shifting the blame and political manipulation. Disregard for peoples rights to life and health. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other. U.S. politicians focused only on their political gains in disregard of peoples lives and health. The federal and local governments went their own way and constrained each other, which has not only made it very difficult to integrate and coordinate the management of medical resources, but also made people disoriented about epidemic prevention and control policies. And thus various anti-intellectual words and deeds that reject science and common sense have become prevalent. Misled by political manipulation, some Americans refused to wear masks, and even launched an anti-vaccine movement, which accelerated the spread of COVID-19. By the end of 2021, nearly 30 percent of Americans still had not been vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. The Associated Press AP reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that U.S. hospitals were overwhelmed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations caused by infections among the unvaccinated continued to surge. States, local governments and the public have now been left out on their own, American news website Vox said on Jan. 2, 2021. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, by late February 2022, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States had exceeded 78 million and the death toll surpassed 940,000. Its number of COVID-19 deaths recorded in 2021 has far surpassed the total for 2020. According to the analysis by researchers at the University of Southern California and Princeton University, the deaths caused by COVID-19 have reduced overall life expectancy by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. Life expectancy was estimated to fall by 2.10 years among African Americans and 3.05 years among Latinos, while the decline was 0.68 years among whites. The U.S. governments unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its peoples rights to life and health. The New York Times reported on Nov. 18, 2021 that the pandemic has proved to be a nearly two-year stress test that the United States flunked, and that the American peoples trust in their government has been bankrupt. Peoples mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. A study published in The Lancet Regional Health -- Americas in October 2021 found 32.8 percent of U.S. adults experienced elevated depressive symptoms in 2021, compared to 27.8 percent in the early 2020 months of the pandemic and 8.5 percent before the pandemic. According to a public opinion poll, more than a third of Americans aged between 13 and 56 said the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their lives. The poll finds teens and young adults have faced some of the heaviest struggles as they come of age during a time of extreme turmoil, the AP reported on Dec. 6, 2021. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy was cited by The Los Angeles Time as saying on Dec. 9, 2021 that the number of suspected suicide attempts in 2021 was 51 percent higher among adolescent girls compared to the same period in 2019. The number of the homeless is staggering. The Washington Post reported on Dec. 7, 2021 that homelessness is one of the United States greatest current challenges, no matter the region. The AP reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that the number of people without permanent shelter in Rhode Island had increased by more than 85 percent since January 2021. According to a report by the group Advocates for Children, more than 100,000 New York City schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the 2020-2021 school year. The total number of homeless students during the school year represented nearly one-tenth of the citys public school system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. The New York Times reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that in San Francisco one of every 100 residents was homeless. The elderly rights to life are flagrantly violated. U.S. politicians have followed the natural law of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior, declaring that the elderly could sacrifice for the country and that the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly. The U.S. CDC said that the vast majority of U.S. COVID-19 deaths have been among people aged 65 or older. According to Stat News, an American health-oriented news website, more than half a million elderly people in the United States have died from COVID-19, accounting for four-fifths of all fatalities. According to a report by Claudia Mahler, the United Nations independent expert on older people, on July 21, 2020, discrimination in the delivery of health care services, insufficient prioritization of nursing homes in responses to the virus, and lockdowns left older people more vulnerable to neglect or abuse. And there was a significant undercount of nursing home deaths in the United States during the pandemic. Serious damage to the global anti-pandemic cooperation. Washington vigorously pursues America First, not only withholding anti-epidemic materials from other countries, but also prohibiting the export of domestic medical materials and buying out the production capacity of drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The United States has repeatedly coerced the WHO, interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation. The United States has engaged in vaccine nationalism, pushing some underdeveloped countries and regions into a desperate situation of having no vaccines to administer. Since March 2021, the United States has thrown away at least 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, significantly more than many poor countries have prepared for their whole populations, according to NBC News on Sept. 1, 2021. Its really tragic that we have a situation where vaccines are being wasted while lots of African countries have not had even 5 percent of their populations vaccinated, said Sharifah Sekalala, an associate professor of global health law at Englands University of Warwick.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also slammed rich countries over their hoarding of vaccines, adding that they are just giving us the crumbs from their table. The greed they demonstrated was disappointing. The Biden administration is still pursuing U.S. interests in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the rest of the world, commented an article on the website of the U.S. Foreign Policy magazine. II. ENTRENCHED VIOLENT THINKING THREATENS LIVES The United States has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security. Deterioration of social order has accelerated the proliferation of guns. The United States is the country with the largest number of privately owned guns in the world. The U.S. public have lost confidence in the governments social security governance and felt extremely insecure, which drives many to purchase guns to protect themselves. The Small Arms Survey SAS researchers estimate that Americans own 393 million of the 857 million civilian guns available, which is around 46 percent of the worlds civilian gun cache. There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to the SAS. No other nation has more civilian guns than people. Everytown for Gun Safety also reported on Dec. 21, 2021 that over 15 million guns were sold through October. Ghost guns, which are assembled from parts purchased by individuals online, are even more proliferating. According to a report by The New York Times website on Nov. 20, 2021, over the past 18 months, ghost guns had accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes. By the beginning of October last year, the San Diego Police Department had recovered almost 400 ghost guns, about doubling the total for all of 2020 with nearly three months to go in the year. It also reported that since January 2016, about 25,000 privately made firearms had been confiscated by local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide. Gun violence seriously endangers peoples lives. The United States has the worst gun violence in the world. According to statistics released on Jan. 5, 2022 by the Gun Violence Archive website, the number of fatalities from shootings in the United States rose from 39,558 in 2019 to 43,643 in 2020, and further to 44,816 in 2021. In 2021, there were 693 mass shootings in the United States, up 10.1 percent from 2020. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 5, 2021 that children and teens in the United States are 15 times more likely to die from gunfire than their peers in 31 other high-income countries combined, quoting data from the Childrens Defense Fund. At least 30 shootings occurred on U.S. campuses during the school season from Aug. 1 to Sept. 15, 2021, killing at least five people and injuring 23, the highest number on record. A total of 1,229 teens aged 12 to 17 were killed and 3,373 injured in shootings in the United States in 2021. On Nov. 30, 2021, four students were killed in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school by a 15-year-old suspect who used the same gun that his father bought on Black Friday.CNN reported on Nov. 26, 2021 that Jason R. Silva, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at William Paterson University, said that the United States is the only developed country where mass shootings have happened every single year for the past 20 years. Shooting incidents have caused a large number of casualties and posed a major threat to public safety. According to an April 2021 Pew Research Center survey, 48 percent of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in the country today. Police brutality tramples human life. According to data compiled by Mapping Police Violence, at least 1,124 people died in 2021 due to U.S. police violence. The majority of killings occurred during non-violent offenses or when there was no crime at all. The USA TODAY website reported on June 21, 2021 that police in the United States fatally shoot about 1,000 people a year. Police have fatally shot more than 6,300 people since 2015, but only 91 officers have been arrested, or just 1 percent of those involved. The USA TODAY website reported on July 8, 2021 that a poll showed that just 22 percent of Americans believe that the U.S. police treat all Americans equally. Racial and ethnic groups are often subjected to unfair justice. The USA TODAY website reported on July 15, 2021 that a 20-year-old African-American man in Minnesota, Daunte Wright, was shot and killed by police after being pulled over outside Minneapolis for an expired license plate. Wrights death was one of a string of incidents in which African-Americans were pulled over for traffic violations and killed innocently. A study of 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina over more than a decade shows that African American drivers are twice as likely as white drivers to be pulled over by police. The USA TODAY website reported on May 24, 2021 that within a year of the death of George Floyd, who died after an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes, enforcement killed hundreds of people of ethnic minorities in the United States. According to the report, since the year 2000, there have been over 470 murders at the hands of law enforcement in Minnesota. Only one police officer was convicted in the history of Minnesota and that was a minority man that killed a white woman. The Christian Science Monitor website reported on Nov. 23, 2021 that the Urban Institute found that homicides with a white perpetrator and a black victim are ten times more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim. Human rights violations by prison staff are commonplace. The United States has the highest incarceration rate and the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. An Associated Press investigation has found that the U.S. federal Bureau of Prisons is a hotbed of graft, corruption and abuse. CTV News reported on Nov. 14, 2021 that crimes committed by federal prison staff in the United States are not uncommon. Since 2019, more than 100 U.S. federal prison staff members have been arrested and convicted of sexual abuse, murder and other offenses. Prisoners held in U.S. private prisons are at risk of being abused. The UN News reported on Feb. 4, 2021 that in 2019, there were about 116,000 U.S. prisoners held in privately operated facilities, representing about 7 percent of all state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners, quoting data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. On April 20, 2021, nine UN experts, including the UN Human Rights Council Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Older Persons, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Physical and Mental Health, issued a joint statement condemning U.S. human rights violations against Mumia Abu-Jamal, a prisoner of African descent. The statement said Abu-Jamal, who has been in prison for 40 years, was a social activist and journalist. The 67-year-old suffers from a number of diseases including chronic heart disease, liver cirrhosis and high blood pressure. In February 2021, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. While receiving treatment for heart failure in late February, he was handcuffed to his hospital bed for four days and when he was hospitalized again in early April for surgery, his family, lawyers and others were denied access to him. The statement calls on the U.S. government to comply with its international human rights obligations, take urgent measures to protect Abu-Jamals life and dignity, immediately stop the practice of withholding information, and allow outside visits to monitor his human rights situation. It also calls on the U.S. government to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of all detainees, especially the elderly and disabled prisoners who are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The credibility of the U.S. judicial system is in tatters. According to statistics released by the U.S. National Registry of Exoneration on Jan. 11, 2022, 2,933 people have been wrongly convicted in the United States since 1989, with a combined 25,600 years of wrongly imposed prison sentences. However, 14 U.S. states lack legal provisions related to compensation for wrongful convictions. The BBC reported on Nov. 23, 2021, that Kevin Strickland, 62, had maintained his innocence since his arrest at the age of 18. He was wrongly convicted of third-degree murder in June 1979, only to be found not guilty in 2021 before being imprisoned for more than 42 years, the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history. But under the states law, he is unlikely to receive any financial compensation. The USA Today website reported on July 8, 2021, that a survey showed that only 17 percent of Americans believe the U.S. criminal justice system treats everyone fairly. III. PLAYING WITH FAKE DEMOCRACY TRAMPLES ON POLITICAL RIGHTS Political donations bring about transfers of interests after elections, political polarization further intensifies antagonism and division in the U.S. society, and legislation and gerrymander restricting voting eligibility have become tools for parties to suppress the public opinion. The operation of the U.S. political system is moving away from the public will and social demands, the right of the majority of the public to participate in politics is essentially deprived of, and international confidence in the U.S. democratic system continues to decline. The American-style democracy has descended to a game of transferring interests. Money politics become increasingly rampant in the United States, which makes politicians more neglectful of peoples interests and demands. Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has pointed out that there is a positive correlation between Americans wealth and their influence on policy-making, and for about 70 percent on the income-wealth scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever and are effectively disenfranchised. Ray La Raja, professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, noted in an article for The Atlantic that Americas current system is democratic only in form, not in substance, as the nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists, while many presidential-primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views. According to The Guardian on Jan. 7, 2021, candidates spent 14 billion U.S. dollars alone on advertising for the 2020 U.S. president election cycle. The U.S. Consumer News and Business Channel CNBC reported on April 15, 2021 that Wall Street executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least 2.9 billion U.S. dollars into political initiatives during the 2020 election cycle. The U.S. media outlet Politico said on Nov. 17, 2021 that a secret-money group doled out 410 million U.S. dollars in 2020 to the Democratic Party, aiding the latters efforts to win back control of the Senate. In the 2020 presidential election, U.S. pharmaceutical companies made huge political donations to both parties, and the Democratic administration, after taking office, invested an enormous sum of money back to the companies involved, with Moderna alone earning profit of nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars. The federal government then funneled interests directly to pharmaceutical companies by purchasing large quantities of COVID-19 vaccines, resulting in massive hoarding and waste of vaccines in the United States. The U.S. government gave pharmaceutical companies a free hand in pricing COVID-19 vaccines, leading to continuous increases in vaccine prices. The Financial Times reported that Pfizer raised the price of its COVID-19 vaccine for the European Union from 15.5 euros to 19.5 euros, and the price of a Moderna jab increased to 25.5 euros from 19 euros. However, the production cost of a Moderna dose is estimated to be less than 3 U.S. dollars. Political polarization leads to an increasingly divided U.S. society. The election chaos in the United States has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart. On the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, prompted by the incitement and manipulation of extreme politicians, tens of thousands of Americans who rejected the 2020 presidential election result flooded to Washington, D.C., and a large number of demonstrators forced their way into the Capitol building and clashed with police, leaving five dead and more than 140 injured. The constitutional process to affirm the presidential election result was interrupted. A Brookings online article in May 2021 indicated that though all 50 states certified the 2020 election results, 77 percent of Republican voters still questioned the legitimacy of the elected president due to allegations of electoral fraud, a phenomenon that happened for the first time in nearly 100 years. Changes of government did not reduce or remove the political polarization in the United States. The American people are becoming more incompatible with each other over such issues as pandemic prevention and control, race relations, abortion rights and gun control, while the political struggle between Democrats and Republicans over infrastructure construction, social welfare bills, government debt ceiling and other legislation related to the economy and peoples livelihood have become more intense, and the Congress has been nearly dysfunctional. A Republican leader even went so far as to deliver a record 8.5-hour speech in the Congress to block and delay a vote on a Democratic-proposed bill. The Pew Research Center reported on Oct. 13, 2021 that the United States was regarded as the most politically polarized country in a survey involving 17 advanced economies, as 90 percent of the American respondents said there are at least strong conflicts between those who support different parties, and about six-in-ten thought their fellow citizens disagree not only over policies, but also over basic facts. Confrontations between political parties restrain and harm electors right to vote. In order to win elections, Republicans and Democrats used legislation and gerrymander as well as other tactics to aggressively prevent voters who do not favor them from casting a ballot. In 2021, 49 states in the United States introduced more than 420 bills that would restrict voting. These bills either reduced the amount of time voters have to request or mail in a ballot, restricted the availability of drop-off locations, imposed stricter signature requirements for mail-in voting, or enacted new and stricter voter-ID requirements, which made mail-in voting and early voting harder and built barriers for the elderly, disabled, minorities and other groups to exercise their voting rights. NBC News reported on March 8, 2021 that the state of Georgia was pushing dozens of restrictive voting bills targeting African American voters. Voting rights experts and civil rights groups have argued that the movement adds up to a national assault that would push voters of color out of the electorate. Gerrymander has become a tool to suppress the political influence of minority voters. The Democratic and Republican parties exploit their political clout in each state to increase the chances of winning by redrawing congressional districts, often at the expense of the rights of minorities.CNBC reported on Aug. 13, 2021 that the practice of redrawing congressional districts often targets voters of color and the gerrymandering in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania alone gave Republicans 16 to 17 more congressional seats. Daily newspaper the Chicago Tribune reported on Sept. 3, 2021 that Illinois redistricting aimed to keep Democrats in control of the state legislature for at least a decade. The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU reported on Nov. 30, 2021 that the redrawn congressional districts for Ohio give Republicans an unconstitutional partisan advantage, with which the Republicans can anticipate winning 67 percent to 80 percent of the congressional seats -- even though they are only likely to obtain about 55 percent of the vote. The Los Angeles Times reported on Dec. 8, 2021 that although Texas has seen a significant increase of the number of people of color, its new redistricting plan intentionally diminished the power of Latino and African American voters. Latino Texans make up nearly 40 percent of the population, but just seven of the 38 congressional districts are predominantly Latino. Texas is home to the largest African American population in the country, but not one of the 38 congressional districts in the state is predominantly black. In a survey of the American public on the fairness of congressional districting, only 16 percent of the surveyed thought that congressional districts would be re-drawn fairly in their states. The international communitys confidence in U.S. democracy continues to decline. A national poll of Americas 18- to 29-year-olds released on Dec. 1, 2021 by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School showed that only 7 percent of the surveyed viewed the United States as a healthy democracy, and 52 percent believed that the American democracy is either in trouble or failing. Data released by the Pew Research Center in May 2021 indicated that the American public trust in the government neared a historic low since 1958, as only 2 percent of Americans said they can trust the U.S. government to do what is right just about always, and only 22 percent said they can trust the government to do what is right most of the time. In an opinion published on June 12, 2021, The Washington Post said that in the past few years the world has been horrified by the chaos, dysfunction and insanity of American democracy, which was seen by U.S. allies as a shattered and washed-up has-been. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said what happened on the Capital Hill was disgraceful. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Capitol riot was the result of lies and more lies, of divisiveness and contempt for democracy, of hatred and incitement -- even from the very highest level. A research has showed that just 14 percent of Germans and fewer than 10 percent citizens in New Zealand saw American democracy as a desirable model for other countries. Despite the fact that the U.S. democracy is proved to be a complete failure and its global image is badly damaged, the U.S. government held the so-called Leaders Summit for Democracy in a high profile, politicizing democracy and using it as a tool to form cliques and force other countries to take sides, in an attempt to split the world. The so-called Leaders Summit for Democracy is in essence a summit that undermines global democracy, and has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community.French political scientist Dominique Moisi said that it is always difficult to preach what one does so badly itself. USA Today, The New York Times, and other American media have also commented that American democracy is falling apart and the United States must first address its own failings, and that critics questioned whether the United States could be an effective advocate for democracy amid problems at home. IV. INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE The virus of deeply-entrenched racism in the United States is spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with anti-Asian hate crimes happening frequently, discrimination against Muslim communities increasing steadily, and racial persecution of indigenous populations still remaining, which has led to an even widening racial economic divide and growing racial inequality. Asian Americans face increasingly severe discrimination and violent attacks. As a result of U.S. politicians manipulation over racial issue, the number of attacks targeting Asian Americans has drastically increased. According to a report published on Nov. 18, 2021 by the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate, from March 19, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to the organization, and a majority of the incidents took place in spaces open to the public like public streets and businesses. Statistics released by the New York Police Department on Dec. 8, 2021 showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of 2020. According to a report of The Washington Post on April 22, 2021, a Pew Research Center survey found that 81 percent of Asian adults said violence against the group was rising. The New York Times commented that no vaccine for racism. It said that Asian New Yorkers live in fear of attacks, and the psychological effects of anti-Asian violence have scarred Asian communities in the United States. U.S. broadcaster NPR reported on Oct. 22, 2021 that one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity. On March 16, 2021, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, a white male, launched gun attacks at three Asian-owned spas in Atlanta, killing eight people. Six of them are Asian women. The deadly shooting epitomizes an escalation of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian-Americans in the country in recent years, sparking unprecedented anger and fear. Thousands of Asians and people of other ethic groups took to the streets in massive Stop Asian Hate rallies and marches. On Jan. 28, 2021, an 84-year-old man from Thailand was deliberately knocked down to the ground and then died in San Francisco. On April 23, 2021, Ma Yaopan, a 61-year-old Chinese man, was attacked from behind and fell to the ground on a street in New York. He then was repeatedly kicked in the head, which caused facial fractures. After eight months in a coma, he eventually died in hospital. On Nov. 17, 2021, three Chinese high school students were violently assaulted on a subway train on their way home from school in Philadelphia. It was clear that they were picked on because they were Asian, said a local police officer. On April 3, 2021, a report of The New York Times documented more than 110 anti-Asian incidents in the past year with clear evidence of racial hatred. Over the last year, in an unrelenting series of episodes with clear racial animus, people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been vandalized, said the report. That was just a tip of the iceberg of racist attacks on Asians in the United States.BBC reported on July 22, 2021 that being regarded as a permanent alien is a painful experience shared by many Asian Americans, and under the combined effect of xenophobia and anti-communism, the U.S. government has been suspicious of Chinese scientists for more than half a century. Since the implementation of the so-called China Initiative in November 2018, Chinese scientists have frequently been subjected to gratuitous harassment, monitoring and crackdown by the U.S. government. Vile and absurd acts of the U.S. law enforcement authorities have been constantly exposed by the media. The New York Times on Nov. 29, 2021 reported on its website that about 2,000 academics at institutions including Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University have signed an open letter, expressing concerns that the initiative unduly targets researchers of Chinese descent. The Yale Daily News reported on Dec. 9, 2021 that nearly 100 Yale professors have jointly published an open letter condemning the China Initiative, saying that it is invasive and discriminatory, disproportionately targets researchers of Chinese origin, and poses threats to scientific inquiry and academic freedom. They called for an end to the initiative. According to an investigation by MIT Technology Review, a majority of cases under the initiative have had charges dismissed or are largely inactive. Several Asian-American civil rights groups in the United States said that investigation against Chinese under the initiative would lead to discrimination and stigmatization. Xi Xiaoxing, a Chinese scientist victimized by the initiative, said the current situation of scientists of Chinese origin is similar to that of Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, almost like a return to the McCarthy era. On July 28, 2021, Foreign Affairs published an article titled Rivalry Without Racism on its website, saying that U.S. foreign-policy makers consistent overexaggeration of Chinas threat to the United States is a vital element of the recent surge in anti-Asian incidents. Demonizing China leads to the demonization of Asians in the country, and until policymakers stop using China as a punching bag for all of the United States woes, Asian Americans will continue to be at risk, said the article. Discrimination and attacks against Muslims are on the rise. Bloomberg reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that over the past two decades since the 911 terrorist attacks, discrimination against Muslim Americans has surged. The Associated Press reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that a poll found 53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward Islam. In a 2021 report, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it receives more complaints of bullying and Islamophobic rhetoric every year. A report published by the councils California chapter on Oct. 28, 2021 showed that more than half of the students surveyed across California said they do not feel safe at school because they are bullied for their Muslim heritage. Thats the highest percentage the California chapter has documented since the survey started in 2013. A survey released on Oct. 29, 2021 by the Othering and Belonging Institute in University of California, Berkeley, found that 67.5 percent of the Muslim participants had experienced Islamophobia-related harms and that 93.7 percent of the respondents said they had been impacted by Islamophobia emotionally or physically. The aborigines have long suffered cruel racial persecution. The United States has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including Indians, who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide. An article titled The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides published on the website of Foreign Policy on Oct. 11, 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, more than 350 indigenous boarding schools were funded by the U.S. government, which aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly separating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities. Until the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of indigenous children had been uprooted from their homes and many had been abused to death in those boarding schools where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed. The United States is not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people, said the article. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Navajo Nation, the Cherokee Nation, the Sioux Nation and other Native Americans have struggled with disease and poverty, which, however, has all been systematically ignored. The Navajo Nation, which stretches across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, was once among the areas with the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the country. The Guardian reported on April 24, 2020 that early data indicated dramatically disproportionate rates of COVID-19 infection and death of Native Americans. Among about 80 percent of U.S. state health departments that have released some racial demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus, almost half of them did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label other. We are a small population of people because of genocide, said Abigail Echo-Hawk, chief research officer of Seattle Indian Health Board. If you eliminate us in the data, we dont exist.Russian news network RT reported on Jan. 8, 2022 that since the 1950s, among more than 1,000 clandestine nuclear tests the U.S. government has conducted, 928 took place on lands of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe, leaving 620,000 tons of radioactive dust. The amount of radioactive dust is nearly 48 times that of the nuclear explosion in Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. According to Ian Zabarte of the Shoshone Nation, more than 1,000 people of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe have died directly from the nuclear explosion, and many people have consequently suffered from cancer. The economic divide between races continues to widen. There has been a long-term and systematic economic inequality between ethnic minority groups and the white population in the United States, which is manifested in various aspects such as employment and entrepreneurship, wages, and financial loans. USA Today reported on April 7, 2021 that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48 percent of the Asian communitys estimated 615,000 unemployed were without work for six months-plus through the first quarter of 2021. The figure surpassed the portion of long-term unemployed among jobless workers of other ethnic groups. Alexandra Suh, executive director of the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance in Los Angeles, said that Asians in the United States have been racialized, steered toward jobs and industries like catering, laundries and domestic work, nursing and personal care, which are devalued, underpaid and impacted hardest during the pandemic. On July 30, 2021, USA Today reported on its website that a new Gallup poll showed that 59 percent Americans do not believe racial minorities have equal job opportunities. The Hill reported on its website on Sept. 11, 2021 that 27 percent of minority-owned small businesses remained closed, much higher than White-owned small businesses. White-owned startups are seven times more likely to obtain loans than Black-owned ones during their founding year. Throughout the pandemic, businesses owned by people of color did not receive equitable access to federal aid, being hit harder economically.CNN reported on July 15, 2021 that around 17 percent of African American households lack basic financial services compared to 3 percent of white households. On Dec. 15, 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported on its website that despite representing 19 percent of the U.S. population, Hispanic families hold just 2 percent of the nations total wealth. The median net worth of white families is more than five times greater than Hispanic families. Structural flaws in its system have led to increasing racial inequality in the United States. On Nov. 22, 2021, UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues Fernand de Varennes said at the end of a 14-day visit to the United States that when it comes to human rights and minorities, the United States is a nation where support for slavery led to one of the worlds most brutal civil wars, where racial segregation persisted late into the 20th century, and where indigenous peoples experiences have for centuries been one of dispossession, brutality and even genocide. With a legal system that is structurally set up to advantage and forgive those who are wealthier, while penalizing those who are poorer, particularly minorities, minorities such as African Americans and Latino Americans in particular are crushed into a generational cycle of poverty, de Varennes said. V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY The U.S. government has often interfered in other countries internal affairs by wielding the club of human rights. However, the policy of separating migrant children from their families has severely endangered the migrants lives, dignity, freedom and other human rights. The migrant and refugee crisis has even been used as an instrument for American partisan attacks and political strife. Constant government policy changes and police brutality adds to the sufferings of the migrants who have already been subject to extended custody, cruel torture, forced labor and many other inhumane treatments. Asylum seekers are subject to police brutality. In 2021, the humanitarian crisis continued to intensify as the southern border of the United States saw an increasing inflow of migrants, and border enforcement officers used increasingly violent means to expel or prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. Data released by U.S. Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the United States, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. Media reports say this does not reflect the dire situation on the U.S. southern border and the real number of migrant deaths may be greater. The USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021 that from January to November 2021, there have been more than 7,647 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults against asylum seekers. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. U.S. border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging towards the crowds to expel them into the river. The footage of the scene immediately sparked outrage when they were released.CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. The New York Times commented that there were the outrageous images of agents on horseback herding the migrants like cattle and the U.S. government in general always seems to say the right things on racial issues, but too often their deeds come up short when measured against their talk. Facing a flood of criticism, the U.S. government soon forcibly deported thousands of asylum seekers back to Haiti, most of whom had not lived there for nearly a decade since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. On Oct. 25, 2021, the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent issued a statement, condemning the systematic and mass deportation of Haitian refugees and migrants by the United States without assessing the individuals situation was a violation of international law, the mass deportations seemingly continue a history of racialized exclusion of Black Haitian migrants and refugees at U.S. ports of entry. Dissatisfied with the U.S. governments inhumane handling of Haitian migrants and refugees, Daniel Footie, the U.S. special envoy for Haiti, resigned in anger after just two months in office. Immigrant children face prolonged detention and abuse. And while Biden has officially ended Trumps policy of family separation, his use of Title 42 has created family separation 2.0, USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021. It forced many minors to separate from their parents. There are more than 5,000 unaccompanied children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody, CNN reported on April 23, 2021. Many of them have been staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit set by federal law, it added. A stash of redacted documents released to the human rights group Human Rights Watch after six years of legal tussles uncover more than 160 cases of misconduct and abuse by leading government agencies, notably Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol, The Guardian reported on Oct. 11, 2021. The papers record events between 2016 and 2021 that range from child sexual assault to enforced hunger, threats of rape and brutal detention conditions. Conditions in private detention facilities where migrants are held are poor. Most of the detention facilities in the United States are built and operated by private companies. In order to reduce operating costs and maximize profits, private companies generally build in accordance with the minimum standards contracted with the government, resulting in poor detention facilities and a harsh internal environment. A lack of supervision has led to chaotic management of the detention facilities and repeated violations of human rights, while detainees suffered varying degrees of physical and mental health damage.U.S. authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the Mexico border during the 2021 fiscal year that ended in September. Among them, up to 80 percent are held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children. Conditions were deteriorating inside the emergency intake shelter erected in the harsh desert of Fort Bliss Texas, reported the El Paso Times on June 25, 2021. There were nearly 5,000 children there, and some 1,500 children are still being held at the troubled site, where conditions in jam-packed tents resembled a stockyard, were traumatizing and risky for the childrens health and safety, according to half a dozen current and former workers, volunteers and civil servants, as well as internal emails obtained by the El Paso Times. Many immigrants are victims of human trafficking and forced labor in the United States. Tighter U.S. immigration policies, combined with weak supervision at home, have exacerbated human smuggling and labor trafficking targeting immigrants. A report by AP on Dec. 10, 2021 said that for years, immigrants who smuggled into the U.S. have been forced to work long hours on farms, living in filthy, overcrowded trailers, lacking food and clean drinking water, and facing threats of violence from regulators. The workers IDs and travel documents were withheld, which limits their ability to seek help to escape their predicament. A human trafficking indictment released on Nov. 22, 2021 on the website of U.S. Department of Justice documents that dozens of workers from Mexico and Central American countries have been smuggled to farms in the southern part of the state of Georgia, where they were illegally imprisoned under inhumane conditions as contract agricultural laborers, becoming victims of U.S. modern-day slavery. After being cheated into farms with the promise of an hourly salary of 12 U.S. dollars, they were required to dig onions with their bare hands, paid 20 cents for each bucket harvested, and threatened with guns and violence to keep them in line. At least two of the workers died as a result of workplace conditions and one suffered from multiple sexual assault. The New York Times website reported on Nov. 11, 2021 that hundreds of workers from India were lured to New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles etc. with the promise of fair pay and good hours, but instead they had nearly no time off from work that was grueling and frequently dangerous, moving stones that weighed several tons and facing health risks from exposure to harmful dust and chemicals. The workers were confined to their living quarters and had their passports confiscated, and were also threatened with retaliation, said the report. Exclusion of immigrants becomes more and more extreme. The immigration policy, that is wavering, inconsistent and often disregards human rights, is the main cause of border crisis and immigrants tragedy. The situation reflects that the policy is deeply affected by extreme xenophobia. According to an article published by Washington Post on Aug. 22 last year, with domestic debates in the U.S. over immigration increasingly driven by racialized resentment, anti-immigrant sentiment and entangled with domestic political battles, U.S. policymakers are more inclined to use techniques like force and coercion when resettling refugees. According to another article on Washington Post published on Oct. 20 last year, more than 1.7 million immigrants were detained by the U.S. Border Patrol along the southern border during the 2021 fiscal year, soaring to the highest level since 1986. The U.S. government hopes to deter illegal border crossing through tough law enforcement, which has made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to enter the country, resulting in them being forced to cross more dangerous areas. The situation in turn creates a larger humanitarian crisis. VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES The U.S. has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises, challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause. The website of USA Today commented on Aug. 26, 2021 that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was a total disaster. Tragedies like the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Vietnam show that Washington has a history of ignoring basic humanitarianism for its own selfish ends. In the chaos at Kabul airport, a U.S. C-17 transport plane forcibly took off regardless of the safety of Afghan civilians, with someone crushed to death in wheel well while the plane retracting landing gear, and others falling to their deaths from the air. Even in the last minutes of the frantic evacuation, U.S. armys air strikes caused heavy civilian casualties. However, the U.S. Defense Department publicly said that no U.S. military personnel would be punished for the deaths of civilians in drone strikes. The U.S. war on terror has killed millions of people. Since the 21st century, the United States has launched a series of global foreign military operations in the name of anti-terrorism, resulting in nearly one million deaths. The website of USA Today reported on Feb. 25, 2021 that the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by the United States in the past 20 years has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people, according to the costs of war study by Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs of Brown University. The 20-year U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. The New York Times reported on Dec. 18, 2021 that investigation found that more than 50,000 U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. The military has been concealing the number of casualties, and the actual number of civilian deaths is much higher than the militarys published figures. The most obvious case is the U.S. airstrike on the Syrian hamlet of Tokhar in 2016. The military claimed that about seven to 24 civilians intermixed with the fighters might have died, but the U.S. military actually attacked private houses and more than 120 innocent civilians were killed. The ongoing war and instability have made nearly a third of the Afghan population refugees. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly 23 million face extreme hunger, including 3.2 million children under the age of five. When the United States withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central Bank, causing the Afghan economy to be on the brink of collapse and making life worse for the people. According to an assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program which was released November 2021, only 5 percent of Afghans receive enough food on a daily basis. The New York Times reported that U.S. national defense contractors were the real winners in the war on terror and that the United States 20 years in Afghanistan really built not a country but more than 500 military bases and the personal wealth of those who supplied them. Only about 12 percent of the reconstruction aid the United States provided from 2020 to 2021 actually went to the Afghan government, with most of the rest going to American companies like Lewis Berger. The Gulf Today website of the United Arab Emirates published an article titled How the United States Destroyed Iraq on Dec. 19, 2021, saying that inadequate food supply and inflation have left Iraqis chronically hungry. As a result of the damage to power plants and water treatment facilities caused by U.S. bombings, the number of people suffering from diarrhoeal diseases was four times higher than pre-war level. The lack of medicine and medical equipment has left Iraqs health system in crisis, with the poor, children, widows, the elderly and other most vulnerable groups suffering the most. Unilateral sanctions affect negatively people of other countries. Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on Human Rights, highlighted the sanctions devastating impact on all of Venezuelas population, as well as on their enjoyment of human rights. The U.S. sanctions on Irans oil sector have resulted in Irans inability to import sufficient medical supplies, affecting the Iranians right to life and health. The U.S. embargoes against Syria have severely affected the Syrian peoples enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights. On June 23, 2021, the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution for the 29th consecutive year to call on the United States to end embargo on Cuba and start dialogue to improve bilateral ties with the country. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the United States continues to impose the embargo and sanctions against Cuba in the face of COVID-19, causing huge losses to the Cuban economy and society, and the Cuban people are suffering from the harm caused by this extremely inhumane act. Economic embargo is a massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the Cuban people and like the virus, the blockade asphyxiates and kills, it must stop, he added. The Guantanamo Bay prison has been the scene of repeated torture scandals. On Feb. 23, 2021, a group of 16 UN experts said many of the remaining detainees are vulnerable and now elderly individuals whose physical and mental integrity has been compromised by unending deprivation of freedom and related physical and psychological torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, are part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. CBS News reported on Oct. 29, 2021 that the United States still holds 39 people at Guantanamo Bay. Majid Khan, a former detainee there, publicly revealed for the first time the torture he suffered, including being beaten, given forced enemas, sexually assaulted, starved, and deprived of sleep. I thought I was going to die, he said, I would beg them to stop. He said he was suspended naked from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused repeatedly with ice water to keep him awake for days. He described having his head held under water to the point of near drowning. The independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the UN Human Rights Council issued a statement on Jan. 10, 2022, saying that two decades of practicing arbitrary detention without trial accompanied by torture or ill treatment violates international human right laws, and is a stain on the U.S. governments commitment to the rule of law. Despite forceful, repeated and unequivocal condemnation of the operation of this horrific detention and prison complex, the United States continues to detain persons many of whom have never been charged with any crime, the experts said. The experts urged the U.S. to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. They also called for reparations to be made for tortured and arbitrarily detained prisoners, and for those who authorized and engaged in torture to be held accountable, as required under international law.","homeless, homelessness"
elpaso,The Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2021,2022-03-01T00:00:00Z,China Daily,El Paso Times,"The number of the homeless is staggering. The Washington Post reported on Dec. 7, 2021 that homelessness is one of the United States greatest current challenges, no matter the region. The AP reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that the number of people without permanent shelter in Rhode Island had increased by more than 85 percent since January 2021. According to a report by the group Advocates for Children, more than 100,000 New York City schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the 2020-2021 school year. The total number of homeless students during the school year represented nearly one-tenth of the citys public school system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. The New York Times reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that in San Francisco one of every 100 residents was homeless.","homeless, homelessness"
elpaso,"Shifting Baselines in a Time of Climate Change, Systems Stagnation, Life and Death in a Time of Amnesia",2019-02-21T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,El Paso Times,"We were among the very few who were granted asylum. In 1988 I graduated from Bowie and studied at UTEP, receiving a bachelors of science.  Former refugee at a press conference1 in El Paso, at Annunciation House2I once volunteered at Annunciation House3, in El Paso, during the 1980s. I was chipping away at my graduate degree in English, teaching as a TA at UT-El Paso, as well as working freelance writing gigs with both the morning and evening newspapers, teaching one-on-one conversational English to an engineer in Juarez who was working for Packard Electric getting paid one-tenth the pay as his fellow Yankees, writing a couple of books, and being active in environmental and social justice issues tied to protesting the militarization of the border and the overuse of the Rio Grande as a toxic slough and drawing down of the Hueco Basin aquifer for golf courses. Heck, in El Paso during this time I even worked for Planned Parenthood helping write a media plan against a mean son-of-a-bitch who called himself a Jew for Christ who set upon the clinic no abortions done there mean as cuss religious zealots who tried to block women and families from seeking STD services and such.Ruben Garcia started the House in the late 1970s and by the time I got there, at Casa Anunciación, the dirty wars in Central America were really ramped up against teachers, unionists, activists, politicals on the left, priests, nuns and anyone questioning the right wing policies of US-backed governments and the thug henchmen of those administrations, the death squads in Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador, and the contras in Nicaragua. Part of the fallout created by those US-trained militarists, economists and lawyers who perpetrated that harm against their own people was that many small towns and villages - regular people of the land, la tierra - were being caught in the crossfire. Entire villages were told in the morning by the fascists to pack up and head out of their pueblitos by sundown. Many girls, women and old ladies were raped and murdered. Beheadings of husbands and grandfathers, fetuses cut out of bellies, and torture of anyone who was suspected of going against Death Squad Capitalism were the order of the day. As far as media coverage goes My baseline was different than that of twenty-somethings today. When I was in my mid-twenties, in El Paso and working along the border, there were much more robust forms of journalism and ground-truthing reporting going on than anyone today in their twenties could image. The baseline was a more open, aggressive Press willing to pull away more of the onion layers to get to the truth. Really, many editors and most of the newspaper journalists had no issue with peering through the looking glass to uncover truth, and their motto was that governments do and will tell lies. Now comparing the number of print newspapers, dailies, and weeklies and monthlies, even magazines and broadsheets, newsletters, and the like that were inking up paper in my time, and then looking at the Press now, going on 38 years of study and my own battles as a writer, anyone young can never really know what has been lost in this impetus of the Press then who were striving for independence, in a good way. Its the old saws of not having their own boots on the ground then, not having an authentic real point of view because they never lived and worked then, what is termed liberally by me as the shifting baseline syndrome. Im talking about small-town journalism, medium-sized market news, and quirky and unique monthlies. While the so-called liberal media SCLM was not liberal at all, what was happening in newsrooms and with editorial boards, for the most part, in the 1970s and Eighties was, compared to today, more nurturing to truth tellers, with a truer sense of why journalisms ethical code points us to looking at as many sides as possible to weigh in on editorial decision-making. Sort of akin to what a lot of people use as a baseline for liberal sic versus conservative, comparing todays neoliberal democrats, for instance, to someone like Barbara Jordan, or looking at Crypo-AngloZionist Republicans such as Ted Cruz today to so-deemed Rockefeller Republicans of old. When I was born, 1957, the Republican Partys platform was much more progressive and populist than that of the Pelosi-Schumer Party of the millionaires or billionaires when looking at proverbial Dem Billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Get a load of this, 62 years ago Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things, but their number is negligible and-and the president says-their number is negligible and they are stupid. Dwight Eisenhower, Republican President The platform for 1956 under the banner of the Republican Party included fighting for workers, the right to form a union, for health and safety measures at workplaces, for a strengthened eight-hour work, for social welfare programs for individual citizens to be strengthened, and more and more positive programs along the lines of todays milquetoast progressives. Ike was backed by the Republican Party, and it was Eisenhower who fought to keep the tax rate for the very rich fair, which in todays baseline would be considered way too high and communist! For instance, the top income tax bracket in the 1950s was 91. And, Eisenhower fought tooth and nail to ensure that it remained at that rate. Can you imagine Bernie Sanders or Obama or Clinton backing this? Forget the neocons, the professors of the Chicago School of Predatory and Culture-Destroying brainwashing Capitalism even wanting any tax rate other than zero percent 0.00  for the rich, for the corporations, who are now persons with full rights of person-hood. How many rich individuals and how many corporations pay no taxes today, and how many have tax shelters legit mafia-style money-laundering outfits overseas, in Cayman or Panama? We have winks and nods and complete red-faced debates and retorts against the accusation that the rich pay no taxes, or certainly not enough, with bald-faced defenses by tens of millions run-of-the-mill Americans who support their flavor of rich manrich woman in America. Imagine, rooting for millionaires and billionaires? By welfare recipients or middle-class soccer moms. What does George Lakoff call it, Narrative Frames? For decades this was considered unAmerican to support the rich over the poor! Thats one difference I have experienced - when I was a teenager and college puke, most people hated the rich for what they were. Many average working class people looked at rich as sociopaths who were only rich because they exploited the average American citizen. Add to the baseline shift from today versus back then my bosses at newspapers were not multimillionaires, and many more newspapers by a factor of 5 or 10 in the 1970s and 1980s were independent and competitive, compared to 2019. Back then, the baseline was that many reporters were vying to get the scoop on real news stories. Truth and facts were a given anything else rose to the level of pink slip offenses. That robust nature of things back then  even though for the most part, as a socialist and Marxist, I never did fit personally into any paradigm in a newsroom  was things that youd never see printed today in the few small town newspapers left there are hardly any left across America, anyway were vigorously printed in many more newspapers back then. From Salon4 According to University of North Carolinas research, the country has lost nearly 1,800 local newspapers since 2004, and many more have lost the ability to comprehensively cover their communities. Rural counties with poorer, older populations are most at risk  500 rural papers have shuttered since 2004. These communities are also less likely to see a digital start-up help fill the void  as funding for both for- and non-profit models are more available in metro areas, and many rural counties across the U.S. still lack broadband internet access, which is critical for delivering online news. More than 200 counties in the U.S. have no local paper, but thats just part of the story, or this new shifted baseline Local ownership of papers is eroding big time. Get this  nearly one-third of U.S. newspapers and two-thirds of dailies are now owned by 25 companies. GateHouse Media is rapacious, buying up small-town papers. That means the news is controlled by Big Brother Being The Oligarchs, many times edited a thousand miles or more from the towns or counties that are supposedly being covered. Copy-editing and editorial decisions for GateHouse originate in Austin, Texas. Its the number one small and medium newspaper owner in the USA, and its model of efficiency means many fewer reporters and a more insipid and irrelevant TV style content which is also replicated shared widely. Murders, celebrities, food, weather not global warming pet tricks, celebrity food, celebrity weather, celebrity pet tricks, celebrity murders idiocy of the umpteenth degree. I have a case in point a massive militarized police presence was in Beaverton, Oregon, last April, resulting in closing the main road east-west, locking down schools and the Salvation Army facility I worked at as a social worker. There were civilian-clothed snipers with high powered rifles w higher powered scopes all over dozens of multi-agency personnel out in public with pistols brandished, and two armored vehicles with gun turrets that rammed the offending ex-vets big pick-up truck. He had just been evicted from the Salvation Armys homeless veterans transition center for suspect reasons. The entire homeless facility was bombarded with SWAT-outfitted police thugs, and no one was allowed to enter or leave the facility, creating high levels of anxiety with already PTSD-addled veterans and their homeless families. The veteran was shot seven times, after only a few hours of staged hostage negation-like stuff, even though he was alone, pinned in his own pickup truck. The Salvation Army leadership later said it was a coup for them this bizarre religious organization - Thank goodness we controlled the story and very few media outlets picked it up. We want to protect our brand in Oregon . . . as the number one non-profit. Now, imagine if there had been one or two beat reporters, like myself in my teens and twenties, vying to find out what really happened and why so much force had been deployed for a suicidal veteran basically isolated in his pick-up who could do no harm to anyone but himself? My baseline would have been news coverage galore, and better yet, follow up coverage. Today, nothing, not even in the Portland, Oregon media market that serves millions of residents. And this is the Salvation Army, funded by the US taxpayer i.e., VA paying for beds for those veterans to be housed. This is the shifting baseline syndrome, which is a sickness tied to outfits like the Salvation Army using PR flaks and using the fact there are no newspapers in Washington County to cover local news and this disturbing show of military force and what the implications of a military operation in their neighborhood might mean in the future. No less, against a veteran who was getting services from a well-known homeless center. Local news, and then news that has national and international implications, lost. Not covered. In the memory hole! Shifting baseline syndrome means the public gets shafted and the administrators and gatekeepers of information  PR and marketers and development officers - get to lie through their teeth, or in the case of my police-involved shooting incident even that term is dripping with propagandist flavor, no one knew the ramifications of the Salvation Armys unprofessionalism and lack of trauma informed care leading up to the soldiers eviction and then the suicidal behavior and then the soldier almost killed, and now, recovering in County lock-up jail serving time. And hes still suicidal, untreated. Job well done by the keepers of the information flow. Shifting baseline disease. Read the three parts of my Salvation Army mess here, I5 II6 III7. In the 1980s, I had published pieces in small towns newspapers, and later in the El Paso Times and El Paso Herald-Post on Central American refugees, on people crossing the border seeking asylum, on groups, both religious and secular, helping undocumented people cross the border and get help once here and to apply for political asylum. Piece published on the front pages of many small town rags I worked for. My baseline then was we still had morning and evening rags, and weeklies, that debated hard the militarys presence in towns like Tucson or El Paso. Debated hard the debasement of the environment through the unchecked developers razing the desert. Debated hard the values of community health, welfare, safety and well-being over the wants and desires of small and large companies coming into communities and demanding tax abatements, giveaway land schemes, and more-more-more from the public coffers to do their trickster capitalism to make more-more-more for the owners, CEOs and stockholders. Now Democrats and Republican alike rah-rah cheer trillions in military spending. Job creation and Hollywood America the Greatest masturbation. - Im going back to Ike In his final address to the country, in 1961, while still a five-star general, and still a believer in the American way, in American exceptionalism, in Americas greatness both sides of the political isle yammer on and on to show their patriotism, he did at least put into check the US military industrial complex Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea. Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence  economic, political, even spiritual  is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. source8 Now, I have to back up a bit to reset this essay I continue today  just hitting 62  to call this myopia and concerted erasure of knowledge and historical context what Gore Vidal calls the United States of Amnesia shifting baseline syndrome covering many aspects of my life, the life of America and the implications to the world that the US Empire negatively effects. I explain this concept daily as I go about living and roaming, learning and teaching, struggling and rejoicing. Here, illustratively The baseline for divers like me, in the Sea of Cortes called the Aquarium of the World by many then, for the 1970s and 80s I was diving daily near San Carlos and Guaymas, out near Tiburon Island from the boat my buddy and I paid 500 from a lake fisherman from Phoenix. So, a typical dive - dozens of turtles of three or four species, dozens of moray eels of a dozen species pinnipeds like sea lions by the hundreds long beak and short beak dolphins by the dozens hammerhead sharks by the dozen over two hundred species of reef fish, crustaceans, and sponges and soft corals brown pelicans by the hundreds pelagic fish and groupers and barracuda and amazing surface fish, nudibranchs and, well, in one hour dive, more than what any overpaid Avatar CGI technical wonk could create, let alone dream of. Thats the baseline for an 18-year-old in 1975, me, a wanna be Jacques Cousteau and marine biology college major. Fast forward forty-four years, and the baseline of another Pablo diver, same age, well, now a decimated, overfished, multi-polluted ocean, with hardly a shadow of what I saw on typical dives in the 1970s. The baseline shifted, and today, the syndrome, in the shifting baseline syndromedisease analogy, would be the arrogance, historical stupidity, and hubris to believe that a healthy and normal reef dive is what it should be as experienced in 2019. The syndrome and disease of shifting baselines it that it is most likely even smart biologists might be working on staving off further decline in an ecosystem based on the present baseline. What you dont see now normalizes one to see what they see now as the correct baseline to go by. Wrong. Now transfer the shifting baseline syndromedisease to almost every aspect of US society no, the baseline for police involvement in our lives is not a Gestapo, shoot to kill first force, where we all are in fear, while witnessing pigs murder Latinos and African Americans with impunity. Judge, jury and executioner, no, is not the baseline we should be stuck with or happy with. Baseline sickness now applied to what it means to be a student - my baseline was a university where faculty had freedom to teach, that more were on the tenure track, where students would be experimenting with ideas and learning, without fear of Goldman Sachs thugs hobbling them for life with 100 K debt or censuring like a Phil Knight of Nike fame or Monsanto do regularly to researchers. Yes, the baseline in 1975 when I was coming of age was that we COULD protest in the streets without fear of felonies, without being sprayed upon with tear gas and rubber bullets at every event where cops were in small numbers, and there were no drones and militarized SWAT teams for peace demonstrations. Baseline was for 1975 one hell of a lot more book readers, more by a power of 10,000 regular thinkers, and more people who had newspapers in their hands and talked about local politics by a power of 1,000,000. Shifting baseline syndrome is now infecting every sector of our lives, where what is acceptable thinking, behavior, standard operating procedures and collective will NOW are so bastardized, retrograded and devolved that the conversation about anything on any tract - food-medicine-science-arts-law-education-international politics-community standards-health-safety-welfare of the environment-ownership-birth and death-cradle to cradle planning  is an effort in alien talk, as if people today are from a completely new set of gravitaional laws. Idiots call this the new normal, another shifting baseline of not only bastardizing language but Orwellizing it. War is Peace, Lies are Truth, Stupidity is Smarts. New normal! Now, back to we all are illegal aliens, where I helped push that bumper sticker in El Paso as a solidarity protest meme, to illustrate that no American First Nations leaders came together to endorse the free passage of all those whites to use their great Turtle Island as a haul-out like a bunch of molting fur seals. Here, my writing, 13 years ago, for Dissident Voice, just below. Talk about no shifting baseline for me, or in the case of this hatred of Mexicans and Central Americans, displayed by more than just Trump and his ilk. Oh, once you hit 50 or 60, the ramifications of this French doozy really sink in plus a change, plus cest la mme chose  the more things change the more they stay the same - It hearkens to the proverb, Turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo.What is the Empires status quo when it comes to people displaced by American Empire structural and military and economic and environmental violence? April 7, 2006This Land is Their Land, and We Are the Illegal Aliens9 By Paul. K Haeder, April 7, 2006 We are all illegal aliens. Its a bumper sticker many of us on the frontlines of the fight against the United States governments assault on Central Americans plastered on our car bumpers down El Paso way. That was in the 1980s.You know, when Reagan was running amok ordering his captains Ollie North, McFarland, Casper Weinberger, the whole lot of them, to send bombs, CIA-torture manuals and US agents in order to aid terrorist contras and other despotic sorts in killing hundreds of thousands of innocents in civil wars in Salvador and Guatemala and El Salvador. We worked with women and children who had witnessed fathers, uncles and husbands eviscerated by US-backed military monsters. Victims of torture, in Texas illegally. You know, what those brave Smith and Wesson-brandishing, chaise lounge Minutemen of today would call aliens. We worked with people in faith-based communities, mainstream churches, and non-profits throughout El Paso, Juarez and the general area known as La Frontera. Everyone I met working with in this refugee assistance stint had humanitarian blood coursing through their veins. We were proud of our law-breaking work  we gave refuge to terrorized and sometimes half-dead civilians. We were called lawbreakers by the Reaganites and the Minutemen of that time. Communists. Pinko-fags. Those were the good old days of low-tech surveillance and simple FBI lists. But what we did was human and humane, in the tradition of that very universal with roots in Quakerism belief in bearing witness and acting upon that which has been judged as unjust and inhumane. Of course, we were up against the laws of this land and coarse politically-driven judges who denied victim after victim permanent or temporary status while seeking asylum in the US. We have so many stories of people sent back who were at best imprisoned, and in the worse cases, mutilated, disappeared, and murdered. Guatemalan and Salvadorans, that is. My readers may not want to hear the narratives and visualize the descriptions of photos of those victims of torture. Ghastly things happened to teachers, nuns, medical workers and farmers, more heinous than what weve heard happened in the cells of Abu Ghraib. We were there to assist, but more importantly to bear witness to our countrys terror campaign. Some of us got so riled up that later in our lives  me included  we hoofed it to Central America. Kicked around. Wrote articles for the few newspapers in this country that even cared about poor, misbegotten, displaced people of Latin America. But no matter how hard-nosed we became, or how much we could withstand the photographs of womens sliced backs and beheaded fetuses, we couldnt shake the images of the children of torture at this two-story refugee house, Annunciation House. It was full of scruffy-looking East Coast volunteers who had hooked up with Ruben Garcia, the Houses director, through Catholic services organizations. It was their stint with public service, their spiritual duty calling. Part of their degree plans. But most were converted and slammed hard intellectually and spiritually by the violence their charges had suffered under in our name - as US citizens paying taxes. Those PTSD-induced cartoons those children drew sucked the air out of even the hard-ass border patrol guys who used to dump the Central Americans at Rubens door at all hours of the night. Who can believe it now, that once upon a time official INS and border patrol officers knowingly let their perps go  knew that Ruben and his volunteers could salve emotional and physical wounds of these tortured crossers. Their chance at freedom. Except for the piss-ant judges. And the memories of pregnant aunties being raped, their fetuses cut out alive, speared, and the laughing Reagan-loved military punks in the highlands and jungle. Annunciation House was bulging at 100 people  disheveled lives jammed in. Beans always cooking. Songs. Mattresses and piles of donated clothes. Guitars strumming. Gueros, the white ones, and the Chicanos would help with in-takes  asylum transcripts, translation, dotting all the is and crossing the ts. Help with getting jobs. Odd jobs in the community. Help with making sure the refugees didnt get caught again. But it was always those by-the-letter-of-the-law jurists helping to confound the torture. More than 70 percent of our brothers and sisters seeking asylum in the US were denied entry by some fat cat, many times cocaine-sniffing immigration judge who usually had a friend in the back pocket of some Bush or buddy of Bush somewhere. Then it was trying to get the denied victims off to Canada without being caught. You remember, the Canada back then which used to open its borders to refugees, the Canada of shifting baseline syndrome. The judges and politicians and Minutemen all professed, Send them back. Those aliens broke our immigration laws. But we are all illegal aliens as a rejoinder went much farther than USAs mayhem in Mesoamerica. We worked in solidarity with the housekeepers, bricklayers, agricultural workers and so many other worthy Mexicans who worked their butts off in the US for little pay and much less respect. These were workers who crossed the Rio Grande to find low-paying jobs with American families and businesses  working for mayors, bigwigs, even on government contracts. In Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, elsewhere. With a wink and a smile by the American exploiters. Mojado  wetback. Squatter. Beaner. Illegal alien. These were the more tame epithets. But lets not kid ourselves about the genesis of this new round of empowered Latinos fighting against racist laws put forward by the dispassionate conservatives running the ship of fools in DC. This is not a country of legal immigrants. Its a country based on colonialists, undocumented white people who helped displace native tribes through broken laws and genocide. Its a country based on illegal occupation of native lands and on Mexicos lands, pure and simple. Colonialists protected by Federal laws that deemed free white people as the only ones who had the right to be fully-fledged citizens. Manifest Destiny was a violent racist act to seize lands illegally. Everything this countrys current anti-Mexican and pro-Apartheid border war proponents stand upon  all that doctrine and those so-called laws  is based on illegally seizing lands of Native tribes. And worse  laws that removed natives. Laws that starved natives. Laws that approved of eradicating native families, entire tribes. The current massive turnout of students and workers alike in this countrys major cities is a testament to these Americans backbone to fight this new exclusionary law  HR437710  a Washington, DC-inspired racist act that has its roots in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Many Americans do express a certain humanity and dignity for the people many deem aliens, but its not awe-inspiring that some citizens of Copenhagen, Denmark or Limerick, Ireland, disobey the so-called immigration laws of this country during their initial years as landed immigrants. Lets make no bones about the motives of Jim Sensenbrenne11r, the author of this racist House bill He sees those brown-skinned south-of-the-border lettuce pickers, linen washers, house framers, and their US-born children as, what? Alien gang members terrorizing communities. Anyone spouting that we are a nation of immigrants and laws has a disease, what George Orwell called the illness of double-think. And until those many white Americans stop spewing that this is their land, a land of their laws, and a land made for Christians, the racist Minutemen will ramp up their gun brandishing on the southern and northern borders. And racist politicians will continue to play on the fears of uniformed constituents and try to pass the 21st Centurys racist exclusionary laws. I wonder what these modern-day Nazis would say about those childrens cartoons  images of bodies floating in rivers. Blood-soaked church walls. Military men with their M-16s trained on men while others are sketched in their rape hunch. Beautiful jungle birds flying in the sky next to US-paid-for helicopter gunships spraying the corn and coffee fields below. Dead mommies cradling dead babies. Yeah, Im an illegal alien. We all are illegal aliens, under the laws of these creeps in high office. Humanity and caring and simple benedictions for suffering so much, those are alien traits only held by a minority in this country of exclusion, and slavery. Yeah, those creeps on hate-radio and in the newspaper columns and on Capitol Hill, sure, they recognize all of us who see the lies and fight the injustice as aliens. And the children whose post-traumatic cartoons brought tears to men and women, some who had fought in Vietnam. Simple Crayola colorings brought tears to a county sheriff who had survived drug runners shooting up his town and unearthed bodies. Yeah, we are all illegal aliens. Except them.

You think I am ready to leave to go somewhere else, to some big sophisticated city, some harbinger of high tech and military industrial complex to find more sustainable and lucrative work? Each day, my skill sets, my background, all the ground-truthing and other on the job training, all the travel, all those deep learning moments in my life in several fields, all of that is mush to the masters of academia, the masters of companies that are small and large, getting on the gravy train of city, county, state, national and international money. Tax cheats and welfare queens and kings are those in the complex, the big C for the CRC, Corruption Racket Complex  military-banking-ag-energy-prison-pharma-education-medicine-mining-chemical-AI-surveillence-real estate-insurance-prison-legal-media-entertainment. Yep, bad that an environmental lawyer was under ankle bracelet house arrest for more than two years and faces six months in jail for contempt as a lawyer who sued the pants off of Chevron for killing and polluting communities south of this border. Sure, the hellfire and brimstone of this rotting empire is addictive, with all these blogs and newsfeeds and whatnot tapping into the lizard part of the collective American brain. Judge Loretta Preska, an advisor to the conservative Federalist Society, to which Chevron is a major donor, sentenced human rights attorney and Chevron nemesis Steven Donziger to six months in prison Friday for misdemeanor contempt of court after he had already spent 787 days under house arrest in New York. Preskas caustic outbursts she said at the sentencing, It seems that only the proverbial two-by-four between the eyes will instill in him any respect for the law  capped a judicial farce worthy of the antics of Vasiliy Vasilievich, the presiding judge at the major show trials of the Great Purges in the Soviet Union, and the Nazi judge Roland Freisler who once shouted at a defendant, You really are a lousy piece of trash! Original illustration by Mr. Fish So, note the proverbial two-by-four between the eyes comment from this judicial devil . . . . From a multimillionaire judge. Imagine that! If I told a pig that exact same thing, after stopping me for a dangling mud flap on my minivan, just think what might happen to me. Or if I told that she needed a proverbial two by four between the eyes to a judge during my trial or someone elses? Or, to the boss, uh? Or to the teacher if I was an 11th grader. Or, to the drill sergeant? Or the TSA guy smelling my feet at the airport. This judge is human scum, and while this is of national and international importance, I have been in courtrooms local, small and midsized town where women lost their children, where drug addicted got the book thrown at them, where homeless rough sleepers were fined and incarcerated, where people more sane than this judge were committed to mental ward. This is the truth about systems of oppression, about modern white civilization, a fucked up rule of law lawlessness. This is it in our world. But it happens every day a few ten thousand times. To we the small ass people. Now, multiple that by a factor a ten thousand  try suing Boeing, or Pfizer or FDA, or Ford, or General Mills, or Bayer, or Trump Towers or Bank of America, or Amazon, or Google, or the manufacturer of the air bag in the minivan or the pretzel maker your kid is choking on. Now, bring it back to a real perspective. Local, where cities have no money for infrastructure, where medical systems are threadbare at least, or missing altogether. No country for old men, for young people, for the sick, disabled, poor, mentally challenged, psychiatrically impaired. This is a country for no regular people. Yet, we will hear the media mental midgets yammer on and on about us bumkins, us flyover fucks, deplorables, or deploying any other laundry list of pejoratives or socio-psych mumbo jumbo for their elite brains to find more ways to subjugate the many in the name of profits, and in the words of their deep alter egos  The world of elites and beautiful and worthy and good members of society have to deal with these useless breeders, breathers and eaters. Really, all we want is whats best for the masses, for these misbegotten, less than high IQ, and multiple-dysfunctional people who in some cases, well, dont mean to be useless eaters, breeders, breathers, existers. But we can corral them into good deeds, and we can make so much money from their faults, chronic illnesses, their low IQs, their inbreeding, their constant bad bad bad decisions in life. Their mistakes and pain and dysfunction are our opportunity to make society the way we want it designed, with a few trillion of profits in greenbacks to boot. But we would never say this outright to Anderson Cooper or Oprah or NPR or what not. But reality is always local, no matter how much bullshit college sports and pro football teams and idiotic Republican and Democrat lying and spewing interferes with their noggins. For example, the outfit I work with, as a social services guy, doesnt ask our clients  developmental and intellectual disabled adults  if they have had the jab, but rather, they ask If an employer asks you to provide proof of vaccination, will that be a problem? That is the reality now  adults barely surviving, after their whole lives have been spent in special ed programs and being evaluated, separated, roomed, housed and institutionalized, and many coming from proverbial messed up families, dysfunction being the functional word  I have to navigate more of the same systems of oppression-poverty inducing-safety net fraying eating at our communities very souls. The chances of getting part-time work in a field tied to the five Fs food, fur, factory, filth, foliage  restaurants, dog cleaning, warehouses, janitorial, and landscaping are already slim, as so much is stacked against these folk. Think about the propaganda around those with developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to the covid so they need to be vaxxed first ideology. Many clients were so scared that they were more or less forced into getting the Pfizer or J amp38 J, both mRNA biomedical experimental treatments. Most live in supported housing, and most of these in group homes, sanctioned by the state, so the vaccine mandates are not just inferred, but demanded. Boosterism booster x, y, z, omega will continue to run rampant. More will be sick. Some will die, or course. The reality is I know people who are losing jobs, and they are not sitting on piles of cash like a lot of professionals you might read about that are opting out of the forced chemical jabs. These people do not have the luxury of taking a stand with unlimited credit card limits, or fully owned homes, or hobby gardens out back with the swimming pool. These are people who read up about this planned pandemic, who take precautions, who listen to experts. Their choice is to not get jabbed. Imagine, being a teacher, PhD in physics, after 20 years, and you have 130 accrued sick days paid and you refuse to do the jab but accept the draconian test and mask. You are still going to be fired, or put on unpaid leave, and those PTO days you have accrued, well, forget about them. LEAKED GRANT PROPOSAL DETAILS HIGH-RISK CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH12 The proposal, rejected by U.S. military research agency DARPA, describes the insertion of human-specific cleavage sites into SARS-related bat coronaviruses. source13 This is reality for one of my friends. Forget about the death proclamations of the Death Cult of Fauci. This guy is criminal, and he has sold millions a bill of goods. This bill of goods is dangerous, deadly, injurious. A bill of goods, man, the lies, the continuing criminal enterprises, and then, remade, make overs, etc. Take these middle of the road news sites Robert Scheer14 is not my favorite, but this takes the cake, no, as he appears as Mister New York Times and Most About USA is Good Scheer. So, no doubts about this fellow joining up with the CIA, and then now in Holly-Dirt? This is the very celebrity culture that Chris Hedges15 rails against. This is a sick little blurb here promoting Scheers podcast of this criminal  CIA is a criminal outfit of the highest order. A former CIA officer and Emmy award-winning creator of the hit FX series The Americans about two Soviet agents living secretly in Washington during the Cold War, Weisberg offers a refreshing perspective on the tense relationship between the two countries throughout his work. He joins Robert Scheer on this weeks Scheer Intelligence to talk about his latest book, Russia Upside Down An Exit Strategy for the Second Cold War16, in which he examines how he, like so many Americans, got Russia wrong. The author tells Scheer about his childhood growing up in a liberal Jewish household in Chicago, Ill. before studying Soviet politics at Yale University and joining the CIA, eager to do his duty as an American and fight what he considered then to be the evil Soviet empire. Now, after years of writing fiction about the Soviet Union in novels and TV scripts, Weisberg has decided to reflect on the historical events that he briefly played an active role in during his brief time at the CIA as the Soviet Union was collapsing through a more critical, factual lens. Based on both his personal experience as well as detailed research, Weisberg dispels common misconceptions about Russia that he once held to be true in Russia Upside Down17. Here we go More meaningless Hollywood-CIA-millionaire stuff that the average Joe in Tucson or Portland, in Kansas or Utah has zero connection to. But we get he is Jewish hmm, why this? a Yale graduate Yale being a CIA-Imperialist school, and lover of CIA and USA when he was young  what puke. Fiction writer, and now a book writer and TV series producer, wow, what a radical. This is the upper echelons of America Putridity, and you couple that with his millions thrown at him as a Holly-Dirt thing, and we have the mini-Celebrity fawning. Scheer Intelligence Is Americas View of Evil Russia Merely Projection?18 More TV junk! I was at a hospital two weeks ago, and the nurses must have thought I wasnt awake I never sleep in a hospital, in jail, or on a plane. They talked about the Samaritan Hospital system they work for introducing a no vaccine, no medical service protocol. They did not sound happy about it. And here we have it yesterday Leilani Lutali, foreground, and Jaimee Fougner pose for a photo, Thursday, Oct. 7, 2021 in Colorado Springs, Colo. Lutali recently found out her hospital wouldnt approve her kidney transplant surgery until she got the COVID-19 vaccine. Even though she has stage 5 kidney disease that puts her at risk of dying without a new kidney. AP PhotoThomas Peipertsource19 A hell of a country, and a hell of a follow the science kind of messed up system, no? Idiots of the Biden-Obama variety, like Thom Hartman, are yammering on and on about how these hospitals have a right to refuse un-jabbed folk. This is it for the liberals  you eat junk food, you drink booze, you suck on fags, you drive recklessly, you think this or that anti-Democratic Party thought, then we, the good beautiful, Hillary-Obama-Harris have a right to cut you off, cut you down, chop you off at the knees! Many people I speak with and communicate with are tired of the pro-pro-pro forced jab perspective we are getting from the leftist Counterpunch, and from St. Clair. I am referencing Roaming Charges, Counterpunch, 1082921, from the anti-science pro-some-science get-out-of-that-sciences way thinking coming from some of the articles posted on the site. Very sad in many ways, so sad that there is not a robust discussion of the vaccination that we see on Dissident Voice, even Mint Press, and especially Off-Guardian and Left Skeptics. Here, bullet points, direct quoting from Roaming Charges  Im against any exemptions our social contract should require either all of us to get it or that the jab be completely voluntary , but if theres a religious exemption there should beone for philosophy,20too. Dr. Anthony Fauci says hes worried that people resisting COVID-19 vaccine shots based on religious grounds may be confusing that with a philosophical objection.  Merck is selling its high-touted new Covid pill Molnupiravir, whose development was federally financed by NIH and the Department of Defense, back to the U.S. government for40 times21what it costs to make.  These people, if you want to call them that, seem to have taken their tactics from the Westboro God Hates Fags Baptist Church which used to and I suppose still does scream their godly obscenities at mourners during the funerals of people who died of AIDS.  Anti-vaxism is itself a kind of brain-eating virusA Cumberland, Maryland man murdered his brother and sister-in-law in their Ellicott City home last week because his brother, a local pharmacist, hadadministered COVID-19 vaccines22.  Cuba began vaccinating its population 150 days ago. In that time, it has administered192 doses per 100 people23. In contrast, the US began its vaccination program 297 days ago and has managed to administer only 119 doses per 100 people. The Covid death rate in Cuba is 684 per million. The death rate in the US is 2190 per million24. This seems to provide pretty clear evidence that the embargo has been placed on the wrong country for the last 60 years. end quote And therein lies the problem with fake leftists  attacking even doctors and virologists and journalists and educatededucators who have doubts about the entire pandemic and mRNA and coronavirus multiplicity of very pro-pro Capitalist and pro-pro Authoritarian and pro-pro Government Bureaucracy rhetoric. The reality is Cuba is not jabbing its people with mRNA All of Cubas vaccine candidatesAbdala, Soberana 1, Soberana 2, Soberana Plus, and Mambisa, are subunit protein vaccines, like the Novavax vaccine. Crucially, the vaccines do not require extreme refrigeration, are cheap to produce, and are easy for the country to manufacture at scale. They are made by fermentation in mammalian cells, a process Cuba already uses for monoclonal antibodies. Now, we are worried about more of the celebrities, this time, a professor who was sacked  Academic Fired Following Israel Lobby Smear David Miller Speaks Out w Lowkey25 Now, think about any criticism against any university, when you are employed by the institution. I was employed by the University of Texas at El Paso. I was an English Department faculty, part-time, a radical, and I fought like hell for adjuncts, for students, etc. I was part of a group of students as a faculty member who made a human chain to stop the group of overweight sheriff posse dudes dressed up as Conquistadors on horses strutting on campus. That was 1992, the 500th anniversary of that evil contact we call Columbus Day. The El Paso Times ran a front page photo of these undercover cops jumping out of the bushes, and wrangling students, clobbering male and female with forearms to the neck. I was right in the middle, and I had to answer for myself to the Provost and president. This is what a university, then, in 1992, was encapsulated inside, under a rich white president, a campus that was and still is 80-plus percent Mexican-American, Latinx, now. You cant protest without our permission and our approval of signs! This was a campus that introduced a free speech zone out of the way of foot traffic. A state sponsored school, with a limited small postage stamp of land near dumpsters where people can gain the public square for protesting. And the campus Nazis demanded permission, permits, and full written details of the protest or information gathering. Now, sure, talk about Covid, about Nuremburg protocol, about mandates, about those who have the jab and those who do not. Talk about NIH and Fauci and the shadowy origins of the SARS-CoV2, or the doctors who have protocols to stop not only Covid patients getting on ventilators, but getting patients out of the hospital and back home in recovery zone. Not allowed. These articles are verboten on campuses And, if I was still on that campus, how quickly would I be sacked for criticizing a campus- that pushes the Hispanic University of the World theme while colonizing Hispanics mostly Mexican Americans  for lock-step falling into the fold of the Corruption Racket Complex  military-banking-ag-energy-prison-pharma-education-medicine-mining-chemical-AI-surveillence-real estate-insurance-prison-legal-media-entertainment? This campus is the whoring field of military, aerospace, drone and weapons makers, and even more nefarious. What ugly optics! Four Star Murder Bomber Air Force General all smiles and the PhDs just lapping up the uniform! So, back into that ground-truthing  try being a radical, a revolutionary, a critic of bureaucracies and corporate mandates and this sort of bullshit on a local level. UTEP is a sell-out, an embarrassment, but so are most all the colleges and universities in this shit hole. Source26 I have gone up against every single college and university I have taught in. EVERY ONE. Can you imagine bringing this into the classroom  anti-war, anti-military, anti-corporation discourse and readings and critical thinking debates? Shit! Then, this? Pfizer Exposed!27 And while the big house is for us in the 80 percent, the ground-truthing in your neighborhood is littered with the poisons of that Complex, the Continuing Criminal Enterprise called capitalism. The aim of the international bankers was nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.  Professor Carroll Quigley, Tragedy amp38 Hope, p. 324 source28 Finally, another point from a friend Fishy Felonious Fraudulent Fauci Read Whitney Webbs latest. During the panel29, the moderatorMichael Specter oftheNew Yorkerasked the questionWhy dont we blow the system up? Obviously, we just cant turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say Hey! everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we havent given to anyone yet, butthere must be some way.Specter then mentioned how vaccine production is antiquated and asked how sufficient disruption could occur to prompt the modernization of the existing vaccination development and approval process. Hamburg responded first, saying that as a society we are behind where we need to be when it comes to moving toward a new, more technological approach and that it is now time to act to make that a reality. Several minutes later, Anthony Fauci stated that the superior method of vaccine production involves not growing the virus at all, but getting sequences, getting the appropriate protein and it sticking in on self-assembling nanoparticles, essentially referring to mRNA vaccines.Fauci then stated The critical challenge . . . is that in order to make the transition fromgetting out ofthe tried and true egg-growingmethod . . . to something that has to be much better,you have to prove that this works and then you have got to go through all of the critical trialsphase 1, phase 2, phase 3and show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years. That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take a decade.Fauci later statedthatthere is a need to alter the publics perceptionthat the flu is not a serious disease in order to increase urgency andthat it would be difficult to alter that perception along with the existing vaccine development and approval process unless the existing system takes the posture thatI dont care what your perception is,were going to address the problemin a disruptive way and an iterative way. During the panel, Bright statedthat we need to move as quickly as possible and urgently as possible to get these technologies that address speed and effectiveness of the vaccine before discussing how the White House Council of Economic Advisers had just issued a report emphasizing thatprioritizing fast vaccines was paramount. Bright then added that a mediocre and fastvaccine was better than a mediocre and slow vaccine. He then said that we can make better vaccines and make them faster and that urgency and disruption were necessary to produce the targeted and accelerated development of one such vaccine. Later in the panel, Brightsaid the best way to disrupt the vaccine field in favor of faster vaccines would be the emergence of an entity of excitement out there thats completely disruptive, thats not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes. He latervery directly said thatby faster vaccines he meant mRNA vaccines. The Bright-led BARDA and the Fauci-led NIAID in just a few months time became the biggest backers of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, investing billions and co-developing the vaccine with the company, respectively. As will be explained in Part II of this series,the partnership between Moderna and the NIH to co-develop what would soon become Modernas COVID-19 vaccinewas being forged as early as January 7, 2020, long before the official declaration of the COVID-19 crisis as a pandemic and before a vaccine was proclaimed as necessary by officials and other individuals. Not only did the COVID-19 vaccine quickly become the answer to nearly all Modernas woes but it also provided the disruptive scenario necessary to alter the publics perceptions of what a vaccine is and eliminate existing safeguards and bureaucracy in vaccine approval. Watch the 2019 Universal Flu Vaccine eventhere30. As Part II of this series will show, it was an alleged mix of serendipity and foresight from Modernas Stphane Bancel and the NIHs Barney Graham that propelled Moderna to the front of the Warp Speed race for a COVID-19 vaccine. That partnership, along with the disruptive effect of the COVID-19 crisis, created the very Hail Mary for which Moderna had been desperately waiting since at least 2017 while also turning most of Modernas executive team into billionaires and multi-millionaires in a matter of months. However, Modernas Hail Mary wont last - that is, unless the mass administration of its COVID-19 vaccine becomes an annual affair for millions of people worldwide. Even though real-world data since its administration began challenges the need for as well as the safety and efficacy of its vaccine, Moderna - and its stakeholders - cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through fingers. To do so would mean the end of Modernas carefully constructed house of cards.

elpaso,PwC Charge: Asset Managers are Digital Tech 'Laggards',2017-12-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KFOX,"They also say that asset managers have been filling gaps in the financial system that emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis - theyll need to capitalize on and expand these once-niche markets. Thirdly, while they make the common point that traditional active managers feel a squeeze between passive management on the one hand and alternatives on the other, they go further in that direction than other analysts have, saying that the way to react to this squeeze is not to try to beat back the competing forces but to join them, to turn a management firm into a multi-asset solutions firm. But perhaps the most surprising of the four points is the contention that asset management has been a refuge of digital technology laggards, and that this will change in the near future, as technology giants enter the sector, flexing their data analytics and distribution muscle. The race is on. Laggards? One might be excused for thinking on the contrary that this field has been a technology pace setter in recent years, with blockchains, Big Data, algorithmic execution, etc. Although, yes, PwC sees that some firms, especially heavily quantitative alternative investment firms, have been as these authors put it leveraging technology in specific areas of their business, it also contends that the first truly technology-enabled firm has yet to emerge. Ceasing to Be Laggards As such firms do emerge, some of the job descriptions to which were accustomed will disappear. For example, investment analyst. Research teams with lots of human investment analysts working together - that is over - replaced by exponential advances in computing power, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and big data. ETF managers are among the most innovative firms in the space, the least laggardly, and they will likely lead the way as the revolution comes. This report says that investment analysis is a task inherently suited to computers, it can be done with lots of data and correlation-seeking power, both of which are what the digital revolution has been all about. The back and middle offices will be automated or outsourced. Global utilities will emerge to be the recipient of the outsourcing of know-your-client, transfer agency, trade processing, and tax reporting functions. Of course, carbon-based people are going to have to guide the firms into this new world of streamlined front offices with silicon-based analysts. To hire the best people, the report says in a sidebar, diversity in all its forms will matter more than ever - from gender, generation, ethnicity, sexuality and disability to people with a broader range of skills, experience, and industry backgrounds. PwCs research indicates that firms still have a long way to go in making diversity a reality and realizing the benefits. Filling the Financing Gaps As noted above, one of the themes of the report is the emergence of certain financing gaps since the GFC, which have become profitable niches or more-than-niches for alpha generators. When the authors get around to fleshing this point out, they disclose that what they have in mind includes syndicated lending activities for large infrastructure projects. We anticipate soaring growth in real assets - mainly infrastructure and to a lesser extent real estate. PwC anticipates a 27.5 per annum growth rate in infrastructure through 2020, slowing to 15 in the five years after that. People in Latin America, Asia, and Africa are migrating to cities, creating an urgent need for infrastructure there waste, power, and transportation. Infrastructure is shifting from pure-play, low-risk to deal sourcing, evaluation, and asset management. In real estate, asset managers in the years to come will make greater use of ways to gain exposure such as REITS and will expand in non-traditional areas such as rental, multi-generational, and affordable housing.Be Sociable, Share!  1",affordable housing

elpaso,Sunburn   The morning read of what's hot in Florida politics   7.29.19,2019-07-29T00:00:00Z,Florida Politics,KTSM,"Rick Scott gets a little twisted on Meet the Press. Early in the interview Sunday morning with host Chuck Todd, Scott said, Look, I think weve got to do everything we can to bring this country back together  To which Todd replied, Why doesnt the president think that? Im not sure thats the right question to ask. Trump is not going to change. denigrating Cummings for his aggressive questioning2 of acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan over conditions where migrant children are being held should have earned a rebuke from multiple high-profile Republican members of Congress. It would have had an impact. Surely, you remember the exchange. Cummings You feel like youre doing a great job, right? McAleenan Were doing our level best in a very challenging situation. Cummings voice rising to a shout What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, cant take a shower? Come on, man. Whats that about? as is his way, tried to change the narrative by attacking Cummings, tweeting that he is a brutal bully. Scott tap-danced around the questions about Trumps tweetstorm with this exchange. Scott Well, Chuck, lets look at what he said, all right, and why he did it. Congressman Cummings sat there and attacked our Border Patrol agents, all right? This is, this reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from Vietnam. Todd But that justifies a racial resentment tweet in response? Is that presidential leadership? Scott Well, look, I, I, look, I didnt do the tweets, Chuck. I cant talk about why he did what he did. Scott stammered around long enough until he found a way to blame Cummings and Democrats. A basic sense of decency was not part of the equation. Rick Scott says he wasnt told about Russian election hacking in 20163 via CBS Miami Scott said on NBCs Meet the Press that the Department of Homeland Security never contacted him in 2016 about the infiltration. The Republican says he learned about most of the details this year. Current Gov. Ron DeSantis said in May that the hackers didnt manipulate any data and the election results werent compromised. Scott made his comments when asked about a Senate report that said all states were targeted to varying degrees by Russian hackers. Scott said he hasnt yet read the report, though he was briefed on it. Scott compares border agents to Vietnam vets while defending Donald Trump tweets4 via Christina Cabrera of Talking Points Memo Todd asked Scott if the tweets were good politics for the Republican Party. The Florida Senator pivoted to what prompted Trump to post the tweets a House Oversight Committee hearing with acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, during which Cummings angrily confronted McAleenan over the filthy conditions under which Border Patrol agents are keeping migrant children. Lets look at what Trump said and why he did it, Scott responded. This reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from Vietnam. That justifies a racial resentment tweet in response? Todd asked. Is that presidential leadership? Scott stuttered for a few seconds before saying, Well look, I didnt do the tweets, Chuck. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS RepCummings Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.

AsteadWesley Incredible how the president openly sees a struggling American city as someone elses responsibility LeonydusJohnson So, you can say that where we are as Americans is garbage, that America is racist, that half of the country are bigoted and deplorable Nazis, that we run concentration camps, that POTUS is a traitor, can even burn the flag But dont you dare talk about those rats in Baltimore BenShapiro Trumps pajamas rage-tweeting is bad for the country. But pointing out that Baltimore is one of the worst-run cities in America, rife with crime and plagued by poor living conditions, isnt racist. Its evident to anyone with two eyes and a functioning prefrontal cortex.

TOP STORY Judge sides with local governments on gun law5 via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida A Leon County circuit judge struck down a state law that threatened tough penalties if city and county officials approve gun regulations. Florida since 1987 has barred cities and counties from passing regulations that are stricter than state firearms laws. But in 2011, lawmakers went further by approving a series of penalties that local governments and officials could face if they violated the prohibition. Local governments challenged the 2011 law after last years mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson, in a 15-page ruling, found the law unconstitutional on a series of grounds. DATELINE TALLY Officials send a 2,700 bill for public records about their May trip to Israel6 via Michael Moline of The Florida Phoenix The state wants the Florida Phoenix to pay more than 2,700 before it turns over public records relating to a trip that Gov. DeSantis and nearly 100 people including the states elected Cabinet took May 25-31 to Israel. An Enterprise Florida spokeswoman says thats the cost in staff time spent processing 16,288 pages of emails and attachments where DeSantis administration staffers mentioned the search terms Jerusalem and mission leading up to the trip. State officials have yet to release the full cost of sending the state officials overseas, where they met with a variety of Israeli officials, political donors, and held a Florida Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. Records are showing that Israel trip was a pretty pricey affair.

Fees a sore subject as telehealth moves forward8 via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida The Florida panel that regulates medical doctors will begin putting in place rules next week that is designed to make the states new telehealth law a reality. But physicians who serve on the Florida Board of Medicine will have no say over one of the most contentious parts of the law registration costs for out-of-state doctors who can use telehealth to begin caring for Florida residents. Lawmakers this spring passed a bill HB 23 that creates a regulatory framework for telehealth, including authorizing the state to register doctors and collect fees. But a constitutional amendment required the Legislature to include the new fees in a separate piece of legislation HB 7067. DeSantis, however, vetoed HB 7067.

STATEWIDE Hurricane claims are to be paid in 90 days. Nine months after Michael, 21,000 pending9. via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times Thats about 15 percent of all claims from the historic Category 5 storm, Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner David Altmaier told DeSantis and the Cabinet. Altmaier said afterward that the figure is discouraging. By law, insurance companies are supposed to pay claims within 90 days of being filed, if the claims are not contested. After the meeting, Altmaiers office sent insurance companies another warning that they need to pay their claims on time. They sent another warning in December when 42,000 claims were still open. Insurers should redouble efforts to resolve all open claims, using whatever resources are necessary, to provide policyholders with the tools to rebuild their lives and property, Thursdays letter states. Experts complaint against Florida guardian Rebecca Fierle was ignored for years before scandal erupted10 via Monivette Cordeiro of the Orlando Sentinel 71-year-old Connie Rae Tibbetts tried to convince a mental health counselor that she could still take care of herself. I miss walking, Tibbetts told Marci Elliott on May 6, 2016. Im a person. I have a life. Elliott was a member of Orange Countys Guardianship Examining Committee, a group who determines whether someone is incapacitated, meaning they cant care for themselves or their property. Based on her evaluation and statements from Tibbetts estranged children, Elliott determined Tibbetts needed to be under constant supervision, which cleared the way for Rebecca Fierle to become her court-appointed guardian. It was a decision Elliott would later regret so much so that she resigned from the guardianship committee seven months after examining Tibbetts. Years of complaints about former professional guardian Rebecca Fierleas were ignored. Image via WTSP. Unequal treatment Childrens mental health dollars vary across state11 via Janine Zeitlin and Frank Gluck of the Fort Myers News-Press The mental health care a child receives depends on their insurance, where they live, and if their parents can afford to pay out-of-pocket for more credentialed professionals and programs not covered by insurance. Roughly half of Florida children with depression, anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not receive treatment, according to research featured in JAMA Pediatrics in April. Affordability is one likely factor, said the study author. Medicaid covers most children without private insurance. State-managed funding supports non-traditional services or all services if a child does not have Medicaid or another way to pay for it. These ways of paying are flawed and mount barriers to care, especially in rural and poor communities. 5.6 billion opioid pills flooded the state, and rogue South Florida doctors helped get them on the streets12 via Aric Chokey and Skyler Swisher of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel While the data shows most pills went to chain pharmacies like Publix and Walgreens, individual doctors and physicians also ordered millions of doses to their offices. Pill mills found fertile ground in Florida, where doctors were once allowed to prescribe and dispense the opioids in the same place. Shady operators recruited unscrupulous doctors through places like Craigslist to pump out prescriptions. Some clinics raked in 50,000 a day passing out pills. During one raid, law enforcement found 4 million stashed in cardboard boxes in an attic. South Florida became the go-to place for out-of-state addicts and dealers, who road-tripped down interstates 75 and 95 in search of cash-only deals through pain clinics. Dave Aronberg applauds Florida ethics board for sanctions against sham write-in candidates13 via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics The Florida Commission on Ethics has issued a new round of sanctions against so-called sham write-in candidates for filing inaccurate financial forms. Palm Beach County State Attorney Aronberg and Constitution Revision Commission member Sherry Plymale filed the ethics complaints. The filings were a means of sanctioning candidates that Aronberg and Plymale argue had been recruited to shut out voters from what would otherwise be an open primary process. The commission issued 500 fines against William Kruse, a former candidate for Nassau County Commission, and Barbara Hulse Brooke, a former candidate for Walton County Commission. A 250 fine was levied against Jared Reddick, who ran for the Marion County Commission. Broward clerk of courts takes dispute over funding to Florida Supreme Court14 via Miami Herald The Broward County clerk of courts wants Florida Supreme Court justices to take up a dispute about whether the state has unconstitutionally underfunded the clerks office. Attorneys for Clerk Brenda Forman filed a notice this week that is a first step in asking the Supreme Court to decide the issue, according to documents posted Friday on the courts website An appeals court said the case focused on portions of filing fees that clerks are required to send to the state, with the Legislature then diverting part of the money to other purposes. Death row inmate seeks stay of execution15 via the News Service of Florida With an execution scheduled Aug. 22, attorneys for Death Row inmate Gary Ray Bowles asked the Florida Supreme Court to grant a stay of execution and to order a hearing about whether Bowles is intellectually disabled. DeSantis last month signed a death warrant for Bowles, who was convicted of committing three murders, including a Jacksonville murder that sent him to Death Row. Bowles attorneys are trying to establish that he is intellectually disabled and that, as a result, it would be unconstitutional to execute him. A Duval County circuit judge this month rejected the arguments, finding that they are time-barred because the claims about intellectual disability were not filed earlier in Bowles appeals. Gary Ray Bowles also known as The I-95 Killer is seeking a stay of execution.

MATTERS Supreme Court says Trump can proceed with plan to spend military funds for border wall construction17 via Robert Barnes of The Washington Post A split Supreme Court said that the Trump administration could proceed with its plan to use 2.5 billion in Pentagon funds to build part of the presidents wall project along the southern border. The courts conservatives set aside a lower-court ruling for the Sierra Club and a coalition of border communities that said reallocating Defense Department money would violate federal law. The unsigned ruling came in response to an emergency filing from the administration during the courts summer recess. The majority said the government made a sufficient showing at this stage that private groups may not be the proper plaintiffs to challenge the transfer of money. One way or another, Donald Trump is going to get his wall. Senate intelligence report adds to confusion over Russian elections hacking in Florida18 via David Smiley and Alex Daugherty of the Miami Herald The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a 67-page report that appears to include new information about efforts by Russian hackers to probe and target elections networks in Florida including the FBIs suspicions in 2018 that four-county elections systems had been hacked rather than two. The report, which mentions that hackers may have carried out cyber reconnaissance missions across all 50 states, details attempts by the Russian intelligence GRU syndicate to probe elections systems in Illinois and 20 other unnamed states. It specifically discusses those efforts in Illinois and an unnamed State 2, where details about meetings and cybersecurity efforts appear to mostly jibe with whats previously been disclosed about the election system hacking attempts in Florida.

HHS could ask Florida Medicaid for 436M refund An inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services could soon ask Florida to refund the federal government 436 million in Medicaid funds improperly paid to the countrys largest public hospital, according to a report by Rachana Pradhan of POLITICO. The independent auditors report could be politically awkward for Florida Republicans closely allied with Trump. Florida officials warn the state and Jackson Memorial Hospital, which treats thousands of poor patients each year, could be devastated if the state is forced to pay back the money. Auditors found that Florida incorrectly claimed costs for certain care for undocumented immigrants and prisoners who received outpatient care, and the hospital omitted or underreported Medicare and Medicaid payments.

Cummings of Maryland and plunged the nation into yet another anguished debate over the presidents divisive rhetoric. And it came just two weeks after Trump called out four minority congresswomen with a racist go-back-to-your-country taunt. The assault on Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, prompted immediate condemnations from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young and several other top Democrats. The outburst also undercut efforts by many Republicans over the past two weeks to defend Trump. They insist that his earlier attacks were based in ideology rather than race.

FEC letter to Miami Beach candidate raises questions about 2018 campaign finances27 via Martin Vassolo of the Miami Herald Until the last few months, Kristen Rosen Gonzalez had her political sights focused on just one job, her old Miami Beach commission seat.

The federal letter asked her to account for 43,550 that was supposed to be set aside for the general election that Rosen Gonzalez never reached. Her campaign account when the primary ended had just 23,863. And once Rosen Gonzalez got the letter, she decided to run for still another political position Shalalas congressional seat nine years from now. Margaret Good angling to repeat a well-timed bid28 via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune House District 72 was held by Republicans for years, and Trump carried it by more than four percentage points. But the timing last year could not have been better for Goods underdog campaign. The seat became open because of former GOP Rep. Alex Millers resignation, forcing a Feb 12 special election. That meant the District 72 race was the only one on the ballot in Florida and across much of the nation at a time when Democrats were eager to make a statement and build momentum to push back against Trump in the 2018 midterm. Now Good is running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, and she wont be the only race on the Florida ballot, not even close.
