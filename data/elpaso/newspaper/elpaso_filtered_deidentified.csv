elpaso,2022-02-28T00:00:00Z,People's Daily Online - English,El Paso Times,"homeless, homelessness",Full text: The Report on Human Rights Violations in [LOCATION] in [DATE],"-- [ORGANIZATION] has the worlds highest number of [ORGANIZATION] cases and deaths, with 34.51 million confirmed cases and 480,000 fatalities, which far surpassed the numbers in [ORGANIZATION]. Average life expectancy fell by [ORGANIZATION], the biggest drop since the Second World War. -- Public security situation in [ORGANIZATION] deteriorated and violent crimes remained prevalent. There were 693 mass shootings in [DATE], up 10.1 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence. -- More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 [ORGANIZATION] states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a healthy democracy, while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since [ORGANIZATION]. -- Around 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against Asian communities is rising. Hate crimes against Asians in [PERSON] jumped 361 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. Fifty-nine percent of Americans said ethnic minority groups do not have equal job opportunities. -- In [DATE] [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, the highest number since DATE5, which more than doubled that of [ORGANIZATION]. -- A [ORGANIZATION] drone strike during its withdrawal of troops from [PERSON] killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children, among which the youngest was [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] still held 39 detainees at the FAC0 prison. [ORGANIZATION], a special rapporteur on minority issues of [ORGANIZATION], said the [ORGANIZATION] legal system of human rights protection is incomplete and outdated, which has led to growing inequality. As for the [ORGANIZATION] malpractice in creating human rights crises in other countries in the name of human rights, [PERSON], a professor of international relations at [ORGANIZATION], said Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world. In [DATE], the [ORGANIZATION] public persona of human rights defender was totally debunked as the so-called [ORGANIZATION] under the guise of safeguarding human rights became a farce. At the 48th session of [ORGANIZATION] Human Rights Council, many countries blasted [ORGANIZATION] for being the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world and urged the country to address its own severe human rights violations. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] AND CONTROL Despite having worlds most advanced medical equipment and technology, [ORGANIZATION] has the biggest number of [ORGANIZATION] infections and deaths globally. The [ORGANIZATION] government never rethinks its response measures and still lacks effective anti-epidemic plans. Instead, it stoked the origins-tracing of [ORGANIZATION], and has been keen on passing the buck, shifting the blame and political manipulation. Disregard for peoples rights to life and health. Since the outbreak of [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other. [ORGANIZATION] politicians focused only on their political gains in disregard of peoples lives and health. The federal and local governments went their own [STREET] and constrained each other, which has not only made it very difficult to integrate and coordinate the management of medical resources, but also made people disoriented about epidemic prevention and control policies. And thus various anti-intellectual words and deeds that reject science and common sense have become prevalent. Misled by political manipulation, some Americans refused to wear masks, and even launched an anti-vaccine movement, which accelerated the spread of [ORGANIZATION]. By the end of [DATE], nearly 30 percent of Americans still had not been vaccinated, according to the [ORGANIZATION] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [PERSON]. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] hospitals were overwhelmed as [ORGANIZATION] cases and hospitalizations caused by infections among the unvaccinated continued to surge. States, local governments and the public have now been left out on their own, American news website ORG7 said on [DATE], [DATE]. According to data from [LOCATION], by [ORGANIZATION]1, the number of confirmed [ORGANIZATION] cases in [ORGANIZATION] had exceeded 78 million and the death toll surpassed 940,000. Its number of [ORGANIZATION] deaths recorded in [DATE] has far surpassed the total for [ORGANIZATION]. According to the analysis by researchers at ORG9 and [ORGANIZATION]0, the deaths caused by [ORGANIZATION] have reduced overall life expectancy by [ORGANIZATION], the biggest drop since the Second World War. Life expectancy was estimated to fall by [ORGANIZATION]2 among African Americans and [ORGANIZATION]3 among [PERSON], while the decline was [ORGANIZATION]4 among whites. The [ORGANIZATION] governments unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its peoples rights to life and health. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the pandemic has proved to be a [ORGANIZATION]6 stress test that [ORGANIZATION] flunked, and that the American peoples trust in their government has been bankrupt. Peoples mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. A study published in [ORGANIZATION]2 [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]4 [DATE] found 32.8 percent of [ORGANIZATION] adults experienced elevated depressive symptoms in [DATE], compared to 27.8 percent in the early [ORGANIZATION] months of the pandemic and 8.5 percent before the pandemic. According to a public opinion poll, more than a third of Americans aged [ORGANIZATION]9 said the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their lives. The poll finds teens and young adults have faced some of the heaviest struggles as they come of age during a time of extreme turmoil, the ORG6 reported on [DATE], [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION] Surgeon General PERSON2 was cited by [ORGANIZATION]3 as saying on [DATE], [DATE] that the number of suspected suicide attempts in [DATE] was 51 percent higher among adolescent girls compared to [DATE]2 in [DATE]3. The number of the homeless is staggering. [ORGANIZATION]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that homelessness is one of [ORGANIZATION] greatest current challenges, no matter the region. The ORG6 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the number of people without permanent shelter in [ORGANIZATION] had increased by more than 85 percent since [DATE] [DATE]. According to a report by the group [ORGANIZATION]5, more than 100,000 GPE7 schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the [ORGANIZATION]-[DATE] school year. The total number of homeless students during [DATE]8 represented nearly one-tenth of the citys [INSTITUTION] system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that in [LOCATION] one of every 100 residents was homeless. The elderly rights to life are flagrantly violated. [ORGANIZATION] politicians have followed the natural law of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior, declaring that the elderly could sacrifice for the country and that the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly. The [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] said that the vast majority of [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] deaths have been among people aged [DATE]9 or older. According to [ORGANIZATION]7, an American health-oriented news website, more than half a million elderly people in [ORGANIZATION] have died from [ORGANIZATION], accounting for four-fifths of all fatalities. According to a report by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] independent expert on older people, on [DATE], [ORGANIZATION], discrimination in the delivery of health care services, insufficient prioritization of nursing homes in responses to the virus, and lockdowns left older people more vulnerable to neglect or abuse. And there was a significant undercount of nursing home deaths in [ORGANIZATION] during the pandemic. Serious damage to the global anti-pandemic cooperation. [PERSON] vigorously pursues [ORGANIZATION]8, not only withholding anti-epidemic materials from other countries, but also prohibiting the export of domestic medical materials and buying out the production capacity of drugs that may be used to treat [ORGANIZATION] patients. [ORGANIZATION] has repeatedly coerced the [ORGANIZATION]9, interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation. [ORGANIZATION] has engaged in vaccine nationalism, pushing some underdeveloped countries and regions into a desperate situation of having no vaccines to administer. Since March [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] has thrown away at least 15 million doses of [ORGANIZATION] vaccine, significantly more than many poor countries have prepared for their whole populations, according to [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], [DATE]. Its really tragic that we have a situation where vaccines are being wasted while lots of African countries have not had even 5 percent of their populations vaccinated, said [ORGANIZATION], an associate professor of global health law at ORG21.South African President PERSON5 also slammed rich countries over their hoarding of vaccines, adding that they are just giving us the crumbs from their table. The greed they demonstrated was disappointing. The [PERSON] administration is still pursuing [ORGANIZATION] interests in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the rest of the world, commented an article on the website of the [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]4 magazine. II. [ORGANIZATION] LIVES [ORGANIZATION] has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security. Deterioration of social order has accelerated the proliferation of guns. [ORGANIZATION] is the country with the largest number of privately owned guns in the world. The [ORGANIZATION] public have lost confidence in the governments social security governance and felt extremely insecure, which drives many to purchase guns to protect themselves. [ORGANIZATION] researchers estimate that Americans own 393 million of the 857 million civilian guns available, which is around 46 percent of the worlds civilian gun cache. There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to the ORG22. No other nation has more civilian guns than people. ORG23 also reported on [DATE], [DATE] that over 15 million guns were sold through [ORGANIZATION]4. Ghost guns, which are assembled from parts purchased by individuals online, are even more proliferating. According to a report by [ORGANIZATION]1 website on [DATE], [DATE], over [ORGANIZATION]6, ghost guns had accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes. By the beginning of [ORGANIZATION]4 [ORGANIZATION]56, ORG25 had recovered almost 400 ghost guns, about doubling the total for all of [ORGANIZATION] with [ORGANIZATION]8 to go in [ORGANIZATION]9. It also reported that since DATE40, about 25,000 privately made firearms had been confiscated by local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide. Gun violence seriously endangers peoples lives. [ORGANIZATION] has the worst gun violence in the world. According to statistics released on DATE41 by the ORG26 website, the number of fatalities from shootings in [ORGANIZATION] rose from 39,558 in [DATE]3 to 43,643 in [ORGANIZATION], and further to 44,816 in [DATE]. In [DATE], there were 693 mass shootings in [ORGANIZATION], up 10.1 percent from [ORGANIZATION]. [DATE] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that children and teens in [ORGANIZATION] are 15 times more likely to die from gunfire than their peers in 31 other high-income countries combined, quoting data from [LOCATION]. At least 30 shootings occurred on [ORGANIZATION] campuses during DATE43 from Aug. 1 to [DATE]5, [DATE], killing at least five people and injuring 23, the highest number on record. A total of 1,229 teens aged DATE45 were killed and 3,373 injured in shootings in [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE]. On [DATE], [DATE], four students were killed in a mass shooting at a [ORGANIZATION]0 high school by a DATE47 suspect who used the same gun that his father bought on DATE48.ORG29 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION], an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at ORG30, said that [ORGANIZATION] is the only developed country where mass shootings have happened DATE50 for DATE51. Shooting incidents have caused a large number of casualties and posed a major threat to public safety. According to an [DATE] [DATE] ORG31 survey, 48 percent of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in the country DATE53. Police brutality tramples human life. According to data compiled by ORG32, at least 1,124 people died in [DATE] due to [ORGANIZATION] police violence. The majority of killings occurred during non-violent offenses or when there was no crime at all. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that police in [ORGANIZATION] fatally shoot about 1,000 people [ORGANIZATION]1. Police have fatally shot more than 6,300 people since DATE55, but only 91 officers have been arrested, or just 1 percent of those involved. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a poll showed that just 22 percent of Americans believe that the [ORGANIZATION] police treat all Americans equally. Racial and ethnic groups are often subjected to unfair justice. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a DATE58 African-American man in [ORGANIZATION]1, PERSON8, was shot and killed by police after being pulled over outside [ORGANIZATION]2 for an expired license plate. PERSON9 death was one of a string of incidents in which African-Americans were pulled over for traffic violations and killed innocently. A study of 20 million traffic stops in [ORGANIZATION]3 over DATE59 shows that African American drivers are twice as likely as white drivers to be pulled over by police. The [ORGANIZATION] website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that within [ORGANIZATION]1 of the death of [PERSON]0, who died after an officer knelt on his neck for [TIME], enforcement killed hundreds of people of ethnic minorities in [ORGANIZATION]. According to the report, since [ORGANIZATION]9 2000, there have been over 470 murders at the hands of law enforcement in [ORGANIZATION]1. Only one police officer was convicted in the history of [ORGANIZATION]1 and that was a minority man that killed a white woman. The ORG34 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that ORG35 found that homicides with a white perpetrator and a black victim are ten times more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim. Human rights violations by prison staff are commonplace. [ORGANIZATION] has the highest incarceration rate and the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. An ORG36 investigation has found that the [ORGANIZATION] federal ORG37 is a hotbed of graft, corruption and abuse. ORG38 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that crimes committed by federal prison staff in [ORGANIZATION] are not uncommon. Since [DATE]3, more than 100 [ORGANIZATION] federal prison staff members have been arrested and convicted of sexual abuse, murder and other offenses. Prisoners held in [ORGANIZATION] private prisons are at risk of being abused. ORG39 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that in [DATE]3, there were about 116,000 [ORGANIZATION] prisoners held in privately operated facilities, representing about 7 percent of all state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners, quoting data from the [ORGANIZATION] Bureau of Justice Statistics. On [DATE] 20, [DATE], nine [PERSON]1 experts, including the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent, [PERSON]1 Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by [PERSON], [PERSON]1 Right to Physical and [ORGANIZATION], issued a joint statement condemning [ORGANIZATION] human rights violations against [PERSON]2, a prisoner of African descent. The statement said [PERSON]3, who has been in prison for [ORGANIZATION]7, was a social activist and journalist. The [ORGANIZATION]8 suffers from a number of diseases including chronic heart disease, liver cirrhosis and high blood pressure. In [DATE] [DATE], he was diagnosed with [ORGANIZATION]. While receiving treatment for heart failure in [ORGANIZATION]0, he was handcuffed to his hospital bed for [ORGANIZATION]1 and when he was hospitalized again in [ORGANIZATION]2 for surgery, his family, lawyers and others were denied access to him. The statement calls on the [ORGANIZATION] government to comply with its international human rights obligations, take urgent measures to protect [PERSON]3s life and dignity, immediately stop the practice of withholding information, and allow outside visits to monitor his human rights situation. It also calls on the [ORGANIZATION] government to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of all detainees, especially the elderly and disabled prisoners who are disproportionately affected by the [ORGANIZATION] outbreak. The credibility of the [ORGANIZATION] judicial system is in tatters. According to statistics released by the [ORGANIZATION] National Registry of Exoneration on [ORGANIZATION]3, 2,933 people have been wrongly convicted in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]4, with a combined [ORGANIZATION]5 of wrongly imposed prison sentences. However, 14 [ORGANIZATION] states lack legal provisions related to compensation for wrongful convictions. The [PERSON]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE], that [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION]6, had maintained his innocence since his arrest at [ORGANIZATION]7. He was wrongly convicted of third-degree murder in [ORGANIZATION]8, only to be found not guilty in [DATE] before being imprisoned for [ORGANIZATION]9, the longest wrongful imprisonment in [ORGANIZATION]4 history. But under the states law, he is unlikely to receive any financial compensation. The [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE], that a survey showed that only 17 percent of Americans believe the [ORGANIZATION] criminal justice system treats everyone fairly. III. PLAYING WITH FAKE DEMOCRACY TRAMPLES ON POLITICAL RIGHTS Political donations bring about transfers of interests after elections, political polarization further intensifies antagonism and division in the [ORGANIZATION] society, and legislation and gerrymander restricting voting eligibility have become tools for parties to suppress the public opinion. The operation of the [ORGANIZATION] political system is moving away from the public will and social demands, the right of the majority of the public to participate in politics is essentially deprived of, and international confidence in the [ORGANIZATION] democratic system continues to decline. The American-style democracy has descended to a game of transferring interests. Money politics become increasingly rampant in [ORGANIZATION], which makes politicians more neglectful of peoples interests and demands. [PERSON]6, a political commentator and social activist at [PERSON]6, has pointed out that there is a positive correlation between Americans wealth and their influence on policy-making, and for about 70 percent on the income-wealth scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever and are effectively disenfranchised. [PERSON]7, professor at [PERSON]7, noted in an article for [PERSON]8 that [ORGANIZATION] current system is democratic only in form, not in substance, as the nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists, while many presidential-primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views. According to [PERSON]9 on [DATE], [DATE], candidates spent 14 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars alone on advertising for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] president election cycle. The [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]0 and [ORGANIZATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]2 reported on [DATE] 15, [DATE] that Wall [STREET] executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least 2.9 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars into political initiatives during the [ORGANIZATION] election cycle. The [ORGANIZATION] media outlet [ORGANIZATION] said on [DATE], [DATE] that a secret-money group doled out 410 million [ORGANIZATION] dollars in [ORGANIZATION] to [LOCATION], aiding the latters efforts to win back control of the [ORGANIZATION]5. In the [ORGANIZATION] presidential election, [ORGANIZATION] pharmaceutical companies made huge political donations to both parties, and the Democratic administration, after taking office, invested an enormous sum of money back to the companies involved, with [ORGANIZATION]6 alone earning profit of nearly 1 billion [ORGANIZATION] dollars. The federal government then funneled interests directly to pharmaceutical companies by purchasing large quantities of [ORGANIZATION] vaccines, resulting in massive hoarding and waste of vaccines in [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] government gave pharmaceutical companies a free hand in pricing [ORGANIZATION] vaccines, leading to continuous increases in vaccine prices. [ORGANIZATION]7 reported that [ORGANIZATION]8 raised the price of its [ORGANIZATION] vaccine for [ORGANIZATION] from 15.5 euros to 19.5 euros, and the price of a [ORGANIZATION]6 jab increased to 25.5 euros from 19 euros. However, the production cost of a [ORGANIZATION]6 dose is estimated to be less than 3 [ORGANIZATION] dollars. Political polarization leads to an increasingly divided [ORGANIZATION] society. The election chaos in [ORGANIZATION] has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart. On [TIME] of [DATE], [DATE], prompted by the incitement and manipulation of extreme politicians, tens of thousands of Americans who rejected the [ORGANIZATION] presidential election result flooded to [LOCATION], and a large number of demonstrators forced their [STREET] into the FAC1 building and clashed with police, leaving five dead and more than 140 injured. The constitutional process to affirm the presidential election result was interrupted. A [ORGANIZATION]9 online article in [DATE] [DATE] indicated that though all 50 states certified the [ORGANIZATION] election results, 77 percent of Republican voters still questioned the legitimacy of the elected president due to allegations of electoral fraud, a phenomenon that happened for the first time in DATE84. Changes of government did not reduce or remove the political polarization in [ORGANIZATION]. The American people are becoming more incompatible with each other over such issues as pandemic prevention and control, race relations, abortion rights and gun control, while the political struggle between Democrats and Republicans over infrastructure construction, social welfare bills, government debt ceiling and other legislation related to the economy and peoples livelihood have become more intense, and the [PERSON] has been nearly dysfunctional. A Republican leader even went so far as to deliver a record [TIME] speech in the [PERSON] to block and delay a vote on a Democratic-proposed bill. The ORG31 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] was regarded as the most politically polarized country in a survey involving 17 advanced economies, as 90 percent of the American respondents said there are at least strong conflicts between those who support different parties, and about six-in-ten thought their fellow citizens disagree not only over policies, but also over basic facts. Confrontations between political parties restrain and harm electors right to vote. In order to win elections, Republicans and Democrats used legislation and gerrymander as well as other tactics to aggressively prevent voters who do not favor them from casting a ballot. In [DATE], 49 states in [ORGANIZATION] introduced more than 420 bills that would restrict voting. These bills either reduced the amount of time voters have to request or mail in a ballot, restricted the availability of drop-off locations, imposed stricter signature requirements for mail-in voting, or enacted new and stricter voter-ID requirements, which made mail-in voting and early voting harder and built barriers for the elderly, disabled, minorities and other groups to exercise their voting rights. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the state of [ORGANIZATION]6 was pushing dozens of restrictive voting bills targeting African American voters. Voting rights experts and civil rights groups have argued that the movement adds up to a national assault that would push voters of color out of the electorate. [PERSON] has become a tool to suppress the political influence of minority voters. The Democratic and Republican parties exploit their political clout in each state to increase the chances of winning by redrawing congressional districts, often at the expense of the rights of minorities.[ORGANIZATION]2 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the practice of redrawing congressional districts often targets voters of color and the gerrymandering in [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]7 and [ORGANIZATION]8 alone gave Republicans 16 to 17 more congressional seats. DATE88 newspaper [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION]9 redistricting aimed to keep Democrats in control of the state legislature for DATE90. ORG63 ORG64 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the redrawn congressional districts for [ORGANIZATION]7 give Republicans an unconstitutional partisan advantage, with which the Republicans can anticipate winning 67 percent to 80 percent of the congressional seats -- even though they are only likely to obtain about 55 percent of the vote. [ORGANIZATION]3s reported on [DATE], [DATE] that although [ORGANIZATION]0 has seen a significant increase of the number of people of color, its new redistricting plan intentionally diminished the power of [ORGANIZATION] and African American voters. [ORGANIZATION] Texans make up nearly 40 percent of the population, but just seven of the 38 congressional districts are predominantly [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]0 is home to the largest African American population in the country, but not one of the 38 congressional districts in the state is predominantly black. In a survey of the American public on the fairness of congressional districting, only 16 percent of the surveyed thought that congressional districts would be re-drawn fairly in their states. The international communitys confidence in [ORGANIZATION] democracy continues to decline. A national poll of [ORGANIZATION] 18- to DATE92 released on [DATE], [DATE] by [ORGANIZATION] at ORG67 showed that only 7 percent of the surveyed viewed [ORGANIZATION] as a healthy democracy, and 52 percent believed that the American democracy is either in trouble or failing. Data released by the ORG31 in [DATE] [DATE] indicated that the American public trust in the government neared a historic low since [ORGANIZATION], as only 2 percent of Americans said they can trust the [ORGANIZATION] government to do what is right just about always, and only 22 percent said they can trust the government to do what is right most of the time. In an opinion published on [DATE], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]4 said that in DATE95 the world has been horrified by the chaos, dysfunction and insanity of American democracy, which was seen by [ORGANIZATION] allies as a shattered and washed-up has-been. British Prime Minister [PERSON]8 said what happened on FAC2 was disgraceful. German President [PERSON]9 said the FAC1 riot was the result of lies and more lies, of divisiveness and contempt for democracy, of hatred and incitement -- even from the very highest level. A research has showed that just 14 percent of Germans and fewer than 10 percent citizens in [ORGANIZATION]1 saw American democracy as a desirable model for other countries. Despite the fact that the [ORGANIZATION] democracy is proved to be a complete failure and its global image is badly damaged, the [ORGANIZATION] government held the so-called Leaders [ORGANIZATION] in a high profile, politicizing democracy and using it as a tool to form cliques and force other countries to take sides, in an attempt to split the world. The so-called Leaders [ORGANIZATION] is in essence a summit that undermines global democracy, and has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community.French political scientist PERSON20 said that it is always difficult to preach what one does so badly itself. [PERSON]5, [ORGANIZATION]1, and other American media have also commented that American democracy is falling apart and [ORGANIZATION] must first address its own failings, and that critics questioned whether [ORGANIZATION] could be an effective advocate for democracy amid problems at home. IV. INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE The virus of deeply-entrenched racism in [ORGANIZATION] is spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with anti-Asian hate crimes happening frequently, discrimination against Muslim communities increasing steadily, and racial persecution of indigenous populations still remaining, which has led to an even widening racial economic divide and growing racial inequality. Asian Americans face increasingly severe discrimination and violent attacks. As a result of [ORGANIZATION] politicians manipulation over racial issue, the number of attacks targeting Asian Americans has drastically increased. According to a report published on [DATE], [DATE] by [ORGANIZATION], from [DATE], [ORGANIZATION] to [DATE]0, [DATE], a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and [LOCATION] people were reported to the organization, and a majority of the incidents took [STREET] in spaces open to the public like public streets and businesses. Statistics released by ORG70 on [DATE], [DATE] showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of [ORGANIZATION]. According to a report of [ORGANIZATION]4 on [DATE] 22, [DATE], a ORG31 survey found that 81 percent of Asian adults said violence against the group was rising. [ORGANIZATION]1 commented that no vaccine for racism. It said that Asian [ORGANIZATION]4ers live in fear of attacks, and the psychological effects of anti-Asian violence have scarred Asian communities in [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity. On [DATE], [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]01 PERSON21, a white male, launched gun attacks at three Asian-owned spas in [ORGANIZATION]2, killing eight people. Six of them are Asian women. The deadly shooting epitomizes an escalation of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian-Americans in the country in [ORGANIZATION]02, sparking unprecedented anger and fear. Thousands of Asians and people of other ethic groups took to the streets in massive [ORGANIZATION] rallies and marches. On [DATE]8, [DATE], an [ORGANIZATION]04 man from [ORGANIZATION]3 was deliberately knocked down to the ground and then died in [LOCATION]. On [DATE] 23, [DATE], PERSON22, a [ORGANIZATION]06 Chinese man, was attacked from behind and fell to the ground on a [STREET] in [ORGANIZATION]4. He then was repeatedly kicked in the head, which caused facial fractures. After [ORGANIZATION]07 in a coma, he eventually died in hospital. On [DATE], [DATE], three Chinese high school students were violently assaulted on a subway train on their [STREET] home from school in [ORGANIZATION]5. It was clear that they were picked on because they were Asian, said a local police officer. On [DATE] 3, [DATE], a report of [ORGANIZATION]1 documented more than 110 anti-Asian incidents in [ORGANIZATION]09 with clear evidence of racial hatred. Over [ORGANIZATION]10, in an unrelenting series of episodes with clear racial animus, people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been vandalized, said the report. That was just a tip of the iceberg of racist attacks on Asians in [ORGANIZATION].[PERSON]4 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that being regarded as a permanent alien is a painful experience shared by many Asian Americans, and under the combined effect of xenophobia and anti-communism, the [ORGANIZATION] government has been suspicious of Chinese scientists for [ORGANIZATION]12. Since the implementation of the so-called [ORGANIZATION]6 Initiative in [ORGANIZATION]13, Chinese scientists have frequently been subjected to gratuitous harassment, monitoring and crackdown by the [ORGANIZATION] government. Vile and absurd acts of the [ORGANIZATION] law enforcement authorities have been constantly exposed by the media. [ORGANIZATION]1 on [DATE], [DATE] reported on its website that about 2,000 academics at institutions including [ORGANIZATION], ORG73 and [ORGANIZATION]0 have signed an open letter, expressing concerns that the initiative unduly targets researchers of Chinese descent. The ORG75 DATE88 News reported on [DATE], [DATE] that nearly 100 ORG75 professors have jointly published an open letter condemning the [ORGANIZATION]6 Initiative, saying that it is invasive and discriminatory, disproportionately targets researchers of Chinese origin, and poses threats to scientific inquiry and academic freedom. They called for an end to the initiative. According to an investigation by [ORGANIZATION], a majority of cases under the initiative have had charges dismissed or are largely inactive. Several Asian-American civil rights groups in [ORGANIZATION] said that investigation against Chinese under the initiative would lead to discrimination and stigmatization. PERSON23, a Chinese scientist victimized by the initiative, said the current situation of scientists of Chinese origin is similar to that of [PERSON]5ese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, almost like a return to the PERSON24 era. On [DATE], [DATE], ORG77 published an article titled Rivalry Without Racism on its website, saying that [ORGANIZATION] foreign-policy makers consistent overexaggeration of [ORGANIZATION]6s threat to [ORGANIZATION] is a vital element of the recent surge in anti-Asian incidents. Demonizing [ORGANIZATION]6 leads to the demonization of Asians in the country, and until policymakers stop using [ORGANIZATION]6 as a punching bag for all of [ORGANIZATION] woes, Asian Americans will continue to be at risk, said the article. Discrimination and attacks against Muslims are on the rise. ORG78 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that over [ORGANIZATION]16 since the [ORGANIZATION]17 terrorist attacks, discrimination against Muslim Americans has surged. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [DATE], [DATE] that a poll found 53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward ORG79. In a [DATE] report, [ORGANIZATION] said it receives more complaints of bullying and [ORGANIZATION] rhetoric [ORGANIZATION]18. A report published by the [LOCATION]1 [ORGANIZATION]7 chapter on [DATE], [DATE] showed that more than half of the students surveyed across [ORGANIZATION]7 said they do not feel safe at school because they are bullied for their Muslim heritage. Thats the highest percentage the [ORGANIZATION]7 chapter has documented since the survey started in [ORGANIZATION]20. A survey released on [DATE], [DATE] by [LOCATION]2 in University of [ORGANIZATION]7, [LOCATION], found that 67.5 percent of the Muslim participants had experienced [LOCATION]-related harms and that 93.7 percent of the respondents said they had been impacted by [LOCATION] emotionally or physically. The aborigines have long suffered cruel racial persecution. [ORGANIZATION] has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including [ORGANIZATION], who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide. An article titled [ORGANIZATION] Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides published on the website of [LOCATION]4 on [DATE], [DATE] noted that over the course of [ORGANIZATION]23, more than 350 indigenous boarding schools were funded by the [ORGANIZATION] government, which aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly separating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities. Until [ORGANIZATION]24, hundreds of thousands of indigenous children had been uprooted from their homes and many had been abused to death in those boarding schools where their American GPE41n, [PERSON], and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed. [ORGANIZATION] is not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people, said the article. During the [ORGANIZATION] pandemic, [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]9, [PERSON]0 and other Native Americans have struggled with disease and poverty, which, however, has all been systematically ignored. [PERSON]1, which stretches across [PERSON]2, [LOCATION] and [PERSON]3, was once among the areas with the highest rates of [ORGANIZATION] infection across the country. [PERSON]9 reported on [DATE] 24, [ORGANIZATION] that early data indicated dramatically disproportionate rates of [ORGANIZATION] infection and death of Native Americans. Among about 80 percent of [ORGANIZATION] state health departments that have released some racial demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus, almost half of them did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label other. We are a small population of people because of genocide, said PERSON25, chief research officer of [LOCATION]6. If you eliminate us in the data, we dont exist.Russian news network [LOCATION]7 reported on [ORGANIZATION]26 that since [ORGANIZATION]27, among more than 1,000 clandestine nuclear tests the [ORGANIZATION] government has conducted, 928 took [STREET] on lands of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe, leaving [ORGANIZATION]60,000 tons of radioactive dust. The amount of radioactive dust is nearly 48 times that of the nuclear explosion in [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5 in [ORGANIZATION]28. According to PERSON26 of [PERSON]6, more than 1,000 people of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe have died directly from the nuclear explosion, and many people have consequently suffered from cancer. The economic divide between races continues to widen. There has been a long-term and systematic economic inequality between ethnic minority groups and the white population in [ORGANIZATION], which is manifested in various aspects such as employment and entrepreneurship, wages, and financial loans. [PERSON]5 reported on [DATE] 7, [DATE] that, according to [LOCATION]8, 48 percent of the Asian communitys estimated 615,000 unemployed were without work for [ORGANIZATION]30 through [DATE] of [DATE]. The figure surpassed the portion of long-term unemployed among jobless workers of other ethnic groups. PERSON27, executive director of [LOCATION]9 in [PERSON]7, said that Asians in [ORGANIZATION] have been racialized, steered toward jobs and industries like catering, laundries and domestic work, nursing and personal care, which are devalued, underpaid and impacted hardest during the pandemic. On [DATE], [DATE], [PERSON]5 reported on its website that a new ORG90 poll showed that 59 percent Americans do not believe racial minorities have equal job opportunities. The ORG91 reported on its website on [DATE]1, [DATE] that 27 percent of minority-owned small businesses remained closed, much higher than White-owned small businesses. White-owned startups are seven times more likely to obtain loans than Black-owned ones during [ORGANIZATION]34. Throughout the pandemic, businesses owned by people of color did not receive equitable access to federal aid, being hit harder economically.ORG29 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that around 17 percent of African American households lack basic financial services compared to 3 percent of white households. On [DATE]5, [DATE], the [PERSON]7 Times reported on its website that despite representing 19 percent of the [ORGANIZATION] population, Hispanic families hold just 2 percent of the nations total wealth. The median net worth of white families is more than five times greater than Hispanic families. Structural flaws in its system have led to increasing racial inequality in [ORGANIZATION]. On [DATE], [DATE], [PERSON]1 Special Rapporteur on minority issues [ORGANIZATION] said at the end of a [ORGANIZATION]37 visit to [ORGANIZATION] that when it comes to human rights and minorities, [ORGANIZATION] is a nation where support for slavery led to one of the worlds most brutal civil wars, where racial segregation persisted late into [ORGANIZATION]38, and where indigenous peoples experiences have for [ORGANIZATION]39 been one of dispossession, brutality and even genocide. With a legal system that is structurally set up to advantage and forgive those who are wealthier, while penalizing those who are poorer, particularly minorities, minorities such as African Americans and [ORGANIZATION] Americans in particular are crushed into a generational cycle of poverty, [ORGANIZATION] said. V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY The [ORGANIZATION] government has often interfered in other countries internal affairs by wielding the club of human rights. However, the policy of separating migrant children from their families has severely endangered the migrants lives, dignity, freedom and other human rights. The migrant and refugee crisis has even been used as an instrument for American partisan attacks and political strife. Constant government policy changes and police brutality adds to the sufferings of the migrants who have already been subject to extended custody, cruel torture, forced labor and many other inhumane treatments. Asylum seekers are subject to police brutality. In [DATE], the humanitarian crisis continued to intensify as the southern border of [ORGANIZATION] saw an increasing inflow of migrants, and border enforcement officers used increasingly violent means to expel or prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. Data released by [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol shows that in [DATE] [DATE], as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of [ORGANIZATION], more than double [ORGANIZATION], hitting the highest number since records began in DATE5. [ORGANIZATION] reports say this does not reflect the dire situation on the [ORGANIZATION] southern border and the real number of migrant deaths may be greater. The [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that from [DATE] to [DATE] [DATE], there have been more than 7,647 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults against asylum seekers. In [ORGANIZATION]49 [DATE], more than 15,000 asylum seekers from [PERSON]8 crowded under a bridge in the [ORGANIZATION]0 border town of [PERSON]9, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. [ORGANIZATION] border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging towards the crowds to expel them into the river. The footage of the scene immediately sparked outrage when they were released.ORG29 commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. [ORGANIZATION]1 commented that there were the outrageous images of agents on horseback herding the migrants like cattle and the [ORGANIZATION] government in general always seems to say the right things on racial issues, but too often their deeds come up short when measured against their talk. Facing a flood of criticism, the [ORGANIZATION] government soon forcibly deported thousands of asylum seekers back to [PERSON]8, most of whom had not lived there for [ORGANIZATION]42 since the [ORGANIZATION]43 earthquake in [PERSON]8. On [DATE], [DATE], the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and ORG95 issued a statement, condemning the systematic and mass deportation of [PERSON]8an refugees and migrants by [ORGANIZATION] without assessing the individuals situation was a violation of international law, the mass deportations seemingly continue a history of racialized exclusion of Black [PERSON]8an migrants and refugees at [ORGANIZATION] ports of entry. Dissatisfied with the [ORGANIZATION] governments inhumane handling of [PERSON]8an migrants and refugees, PERSON29, the [ORGANIZATION] special envoy for [PERSON]8, resigned in anger after [ORGANIZATION]45 in office. Immigrant children face prolonged detention and abuse. And while [PERSON] has officially ended [ORGANIZATION]0 policy of family separation, his use of Title 42 has created family separation 2.0, [PERSON]5 website reported on [DATE], [DATE]. It forced many minors to separate from their parents. There are more than 5,000 unaccompanied children in [ORGANIZATION] ORG98 custody, ORG29 reported on [DATE] 23, [DATE]. Many of them have been staying in custody for longer than the [TIME] limit set by federal law, it added. A stash of redacted documents released to the human rights group [PERSON] after [ORGANIZATION]46 of legal tussles uncover more than 160 cases of misconduct and abuse by leading government agencies, notably ORG98 and [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol, [PERSON]9 reported on [DATE], [DATE]. The papers record events between [ORGANIZATION]63 and [DATE] that range from child sexual assault to enforced hunger, threats of rape and brutal detention conditions. Conditions in private detention facilities where migrants are held are poor. Most of the detention facilities in [ORGANIZATION] are built and operated by private companies. In order to reduce operating costs and maximize profits, private companies generally build in accordance with the minimum standards contracted with the government, resulting in poor detention facilities and a harsh internal environment. A lack of supervision has led to chaotic management of the detention facilities and repeated violations of human rights, while detainees suffered varying degrees of physical and mental health damage.[ORGANIZATION] authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the GPE40 border during the [DATE] [DATE] that ended in [ORGANIZATION]49. Among them, up to 80 percent are held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children. Conditions were deteriorating inside the emergency intake shelter erected in the harsh desert of FAC3 [ORGANIZATION]0, reported ORG99 on [DATE], [DATE]. There were nearly 5,000 children there, and some 1,500 children are still being held at the troubled site, where conditions in jam-packed tents resembled a stockyard, were traumatizing and risky for the childrens health and safety, according to half a dozen current and former workers, volunteers and civil servants, as well as internal emails obtained by ORG99. Many immigrants are victims of human trafficking and forced labor in [ORGANIZATION]. Tighter [ORGANIZATION] immigration policies, combined with weak supervision at home, have exacerbated human smuggling and labor trafficking targeting immigrants. A report by ORG6 on [DATE]0, [DATE] said that for [ORGANIZATION]52, immigrants who smuggled into the [ORGANIZATION] have been forced to work long hours on farms, living in filthy, overcrowded trailers, lacking food and clean drinking water, and facing threats of violence from regulators. The workers IDs and travel documents were withheld, which limits their ability to seek help to escape their predicament. A human trafficking indictment released on [DATE], [DATE] on the website of [ORGANIZATION] Department of Justice documents that dozens of workers from GPE40 and Central American countries have been smuggled to farms in the southern part of the state of [ORGANIZATION]6, where they were illegally imprisoned under inhumane conditions as contract agricultural laborers, becoming victims of [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] slavery. After being cheated into farms with the promise of an [TIME] salary of 12 [ORGANIZATION] dollars, they were required to dig onions with their bare hands, paid 20 cents for each bucket harvested, and threatened with guns and violence to keep them in line. At least two of the workers died as a result of workplace conditions and one suffered from multiple sexual assault. [ORGANIZATION]1 website reported on [DATE], [DATE] that hundreds of workers from GPE41 were lured to [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]2, GPE43, GPE44, [PERSON]7 etc. with the promise of fair pay and good hours, but instead they had nearly no time off from work that was grueling and frequently dangerous, moving stones that weighed several tons and facing health risks from exposure to harmful dust and chemicals. The workers were confined to their living quarters and had their passports confiscated, and were also threatened with retaliation, said the report. Exclusion of immigrants becomes more and more extreme. The immigration policy, that is wavering, inconsistent and often disregards human rights, is the main cause of border crisis and immigrants tragedy. The situation reflects that the policy is deeply affected by extreme xenophobia. According to an article published by [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION]54, with domestic debates in the [ORGANIZATION] over immigration increasingly driven by racialized resentment, anti-immigrant sentiment and entangled with domestic political battles, [ORGANIZATION] policymakers are more inclined to use techniques like force and coercion when resettling refugees. According to another article on [ORGANIZATION] published on [ORGANIZATION]55 [ORGANIZATION]56, more than 1.7 million immigrants were detained by the [ORGANIZATION] Border Patrol along the southern border during the [DATE] [DATE], soaring to the highest level since [ORGANIZATION]57. The [ORGANIZATION] government hopes to deter illegal border crossing through tough law enforcement, which has made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to enter the country, resulting in them being forced to cross more dangerous areas. The situation in turn creates a larger humanitarian crisis. VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER CO[PERSON]1TRIES The [ORGANIZATION] has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises, challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause. The website of [PERSON]5 commented on [DATE], [DATE] that the [ORGANIZATION] withdrawal from [PERSON] was a total disaster. Tragedies like the [ORGANIZATION] withdrawal from [PERSON] and GPE45 show that [PERSON] has a history of ignoring basic humanitarianism for its own selfish ends. In the chaos at GPE46 [INSTITUTION], a [ORGANIZATION] C-17 transport plane forcibly took off regardless of the safety of Afghan civilians, with someone crushed to death in wheel well while the plane retracting landing gear, and others falling to their deaths from the air. Even in [TIME] of the frantic evacuation, [ORGANIZATION] armys air strikes caused heavy civilian casualties. However, the [ORGANIZATION] Defense Department publicly said that no [ORGANIZATION] military personnel would be punished for the deaths of civilians in drone strikes. The [ORGANIZATION] war on terror has killed millions of people. Since [ORGANIZATION]59, [ORGANIZATION] has launched a series of global foreign military operations in the name of anti-terrorism, resulting in nearly one million deaths. The website of [PERSON]5 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by [ORGANIZATION] in DATE51 has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people, according to the costs of war study by [ORGANIZATION]04 of [ORGANIZATION]05. The [ORGANIZATION]61 [ORGANIZATION] military operations in [PERSON] have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported on [DATE]8, [DATE] that investigation found that more than 50,000 [ORGANIZATION] airstrikes in GPE47, GPE48 and [PERSON] were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. The military has been concealing the number of casualties, and the actual number of civilian deaths is much higher than the militarys published figures. The most obvious case is the [ORGANIZATION] airstrike on the GPE48n hamlet of GPE49 in [ORGANIZATION]63. The military claimed that about seven to 24 civilians intermixed with the fighters might have died, but the [ORGANIZATION] military actually attacked private houses and more than 120 innocent civilians were killed. The ongoing war and instability have made nearly a third of the Afghan population refugees. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly 23 million face extreme hunger, including 3.2 million children under [ORGANIZATION]64. When [ORGANIZATION] withdrew its troops from [PERSON], it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central Bank, causing the Afghan economy to be on the brink of collapse and making life worse for the people. According to an assessment by the [PERSON]1 Food and Agriculture Organization and [ORGANIZATION]07 which was released [DATE] [DATE], only 5 percent of Afghans receive enough food on a [DATE] basis. [ORGANIZATION]1 reported that [ORGANIZATION] national defense contractors were the real winners in the war on terror and that [ORGANIZATION] 20 [ORGANIZATION]52 in [PERSON] really built not a country but more than 500 military bases and the personal wealth of those who supplied them. Only about 12 percent of the reconstruction aid [ORGANIZATION] provided from [ORGANIZATION] to [DATE] actually went to the Afghan government, with most of the rest going to American companies like [ORGANIZATION]08. The [ORGANIZATION]09 website of [PERSON]0 published an article titled How [ORGANIZATION] Destroyed GPE47 on [DATE], [DATE], saying that inadequate food supply and inflation have left [LOCATION] chronically hungry. As a result of the damage to power plants and water treatment facilities caused by [ORGANIZATION] bombings, the number of people suffering from diarrhoeal diseases was four times higher than pre-war level. The lack of medicine and medical equipment has left GPE47s health system in crisis, with the poor, children, widows, the elderly and other most vulnerable groups suffering the most. Unilateral sanctions affect negatively people of other countries. [ORGANIZATION]1, [PERSON]1 Special Rapporteur on Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on Human Rights, highlighted the sanctions devastating impact on all of [LOCATION] population, as well as on their enjoyment of human rights. The [ORGANIZATION] sanctions on Irans oil sector have resulted in Irans inability to import sufficient medical supplies, affecting the Iranians right to life and health. The [ORGANIZATION] embargoes against GPE48 have severely affected the GPE48n peoples enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights. On [DATE], [DATE], the [PERSON]1 General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution for [ORGANIZATION]69 to call on [ORGANIZATION] to end embargo on [PERSON]1 and start dialogue to improve bilateral ties with the country. [PERSON]1n Foreign Minister [ORGANIZATION]2 said [ORGANIZATION] continues to impose the embargo and sanctions against [PERSON]1 in the face of [ORGANIZATION], causing huge losses to the [PERSON]1n economy and society, and the [PERSON]1n people are suffering from the harm caused by this extremely inhumane act. Economic embargo is a massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the [PERSON]1n people and like the virus, the blockade asphyxiates and kills, it must stop, he added. The [LOCATION] prison has been the scene of repeated torture scandals. On [DATE], [DATE], a group of 16 [PERSON]1 experts said many of the remaining detainees are vulnerable and now elderly individuals whose physical and mental integrity has been compromised by unending deprivation of freedom and related physical and psychological torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts, including [PERSON]1 promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, are part of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]11 reported on [DATE], [DATE] that [ORGANIZATION] still holds 39 people at [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION]3, a former detainee there, publicly revealed for the first time the torture he suffered, including being beaten, given forced [PERSON], sexually assaulted, starved, and deprived of sleep. I thought I was going to die, he said, I would beg them to stop. He said he was suspended naked from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused repeatedly with ice water to keep him awake for [ORGANIZATION]71. He described having his head held under water to the point of near drowning. The independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the [PERSON]1 Human Rights Council issued a statement on [ORGANIZATION]72, saying that [ORGANIZATION]73 of practicing arbitrary detention without trial accompanied by torture or ill treatment violates international human right laws, and is a stain on the [ORGANIZATION] governments commitment to the rule of law. Despite forceful, repeated and unequivocal condemnation of the operation of this horrific detention and prison complex, [ORGANIZATION] continues to detain persons many of whom have never been charged with any crime, the experts said. The experts urged the [ORGANIZATION] to close the [LOCATION] prison. They also called for reparations to be made for tortured and arbitrarily detained prisoners, and for those who authorized and engaged in torture to be held accountable, as required under international law."
elpaso,2022-03-01T00:00:00Z,China Daily,El Paso Times,"homeless, homelessness",The Report on Human Rights Violations in [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION],"The number of the homeless is staggering. [ORGANIZATION] reported on [ORGANIZATION] that homelessness is one of [ORGANIZATION] greatest current challenges, no matter the region. The ORG1 reported on [LOCATION] that the number of people without permanent shelter in [PERSON] had increased by more than 85 percent since DATE2. According to a report by the group ORG2, more than 100,000 GPE2 schoolchildren were homeless at some point during [DATE].

elpaso,2019-02-21T00:00:00Z,Dissident Voice,El Paso Times,"homeless, squatter","Shifting Baselines in a Time of Climate Change, Systems Stagnation, Life and Death in a Time of Amnesia","We were among the very few who were granted asylum. In DATE0 I graduated from [ORGANIZATION] and studied at [ORGANIZATION], receiving a bachelors of science.  Former refugee at a press conference1 in [ORGANIZATION], at FAC0 once volunteered at ORG2, in [ORGANIZATION], during [LOCATION]. I was chipping away at my graduate degree in English, teaching as a TA at UT-[ORGANIZATION], as well as working freelance writing gigs with both [TIME] and [TIME] newspapers, teaching one-on-one conversational English to an engineer in [PERSON] who was working for [LOCATION] getting paid one-tenth the pay as his fellow [ORGANIZATION], writing a couple of books, and being active in environmental and social justice issues tied to protesting the militarization of the border and the overuse of [ORGANIZATION] as a toxic slough and drawing down of the [PERSON] aquifer for golf courses. Heck, in [ORGANIZATION] during this time I even worked for [ORGANIZATION] helping write a media plan against a mean son-of-a-bitch who called himself a Jew for [ORGANIZATION] who set upon the clinic no abortions done there mean as cuss religious zealots who tried to block women and families from seeking [ORGANIZATION] services and such.[PERSON] started the ORG6 in [DATE] and by the time I got there, at FAC1, the dirty wars in LOC2 were really ramped up against teachers, unionists, activists, politicals on the left, priests, nuns and anyone questioning the right wing policies of [ORGANIZATION]-backed governments and the thug henchmen of those administrations, the death squads in [LOCATION], [PERSON], and [PERSON], and the contras in [LOCATION]. Part of the fallout created by those [ORGANIZATION]-trained militarists, economists and lawyers who perpetrated that harm against their own people was that many small towns and villages - regular people of the land, la tierra - were being caught in the crossfire. Entire villages were told in [TIME] by the fascists to pack up and head out of their pueblitos by sundown. Many girls, women and old ladies were raped and murdered. Beheadings of husbands and grandfathers, fetuses cut out of bellies, and torture of anyone who was suspected of going against [ORGANIZATION] Capitalism were the order of [ORGANIZATION]. As far as media coverage goes My baseline was different than that of [PERSON]. When I was in [ORGANIZATION], in [ORGANIZATION] and working along the border, there were much more robust forms of journalism and ground-truthing reporting going on than anyone [PERSON] in [LOCATION] could image. The baseline was a more open, aggressive ORG7 willing to pull away more of the onion layers to get to the truth. Really, many editors and most of the newspaper journalists had no issue with peering through the looking glass to uncover truth, and their motto was that governments do and will tell lies. Now comparing the number of print newspapers, dailies, and weeklies and [ORGANIZATION], even magazines and broadsheets, newsletters, and the like that were inking up paper in my time, and then looking at the ORG7 now, going on DATE8 of study and my own battles as a writer, anyone young can never really know what has been lost in this impetus of the ORG7 then who were striving for independence, in a good [STREET]. Its the old saws of not having their own boots on the ground then, not having an authentic real point of view because they never lived and worked then, what is termed liberally by me as the shifting baseline syndrome. Im talking about small-town journalism, medium-sized market news, and quirky and unique [ORGANIZATION]. While the so-called liberal media [ORGANIZATION] was not liberal at all, what was happening in newsrooms and with editorial boards, for the most part, in [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]1 was, compared to [PERSON], more nurturing to truth tellers, with a truer sense of why journalisms ethical code points us to looking at as many sides as possible to weigh in on editorial decision-making. Sort of akin to what a lot of people use as a baseline for liberal sic versus conservative, comparing [PERSON]s neoliberal democrats, for instance, to someone like [ORGANIZATION], or looking at [ORGANIZATION] Republicans such as PERSON3 [PERSON] to so-deemed ORG9 Republicans of old. When I was born, [LOCATION]3, the Republican [ORGANIZATION]0 platform was much more progressive and populist than that of [ORGANIZATION]1 of the millionaires or billionaires when looking at proverbial [PERSON]. Get a load of this, [LOCATION]4 Should any political party attempt to abolish [ORGANIZATION]2, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things, but their number is negligible and-and the president says-their number is negligible and they are stupid. PERSON5, Republican President The platform for [LOCATION]5 under the banner of [ORGANIZATION]3 included fighting for workers, the right to form a union, for health and safety measures at workplaces, for a strengthened [TIME] work, for social welfare programs for individual citizens to be strengthened, and more and more positive programs along the lines of [PERSON]s milquetoast progressives. [PERSON] was backed by [ORGANIZATION]3, and it was [ORGANIZATION] who fought to keep the tax rate for the very rich fair, which in [PERSON]s baseline would be considered [STREET] too high and communist! For instance, the top income tax bracket in [LOCATION]6 was [DATE]. And, [ORGANIZATION] fought tooth and nail to ensure that it remained at that rate. Can you imagine PERSON8 or PERSON9 or [PERSON]0 backing this? Forget the neocons, the professors of [ORGANIZATION]4 brainwashing Capitalism even wanting any tax rate other than zero percent 0.00  for the rich, for the corporations, who are now persons with full rights of person-hood. How many rich individuals and how many corporations pay no taxes [PERSON], and how many have tax shelters legit mafia-style money-laundering outfits overseas, in GPE7 or [PERSON]? We have winks and nods and complete red-faced debates and retorts against the accusation that the rich pay no taxes, or certainly not enough, with bald-faced defenses by tens of millions run-of-the-mill [LOCATION]ns who support their flavor of rich manrich woman in [LOCATION]. Imagine, rooting for millionaires and billionaires? By welfare recipients or middle-class soccer moms. What does [PERSON]1 call it, [ORGANIZATION]? For [LOCATION]7 this was considered un[LOCATION]n to support the rich over the poor! Thats one difference I have experienced - when I was a teenager and college puke, most people hated the rich for what they were. Many average working class people looked at rich as sociopaths who were only rich because they exploited the average [LOCATION]n citizen. Add to the baseline shift from [PERSON] versus back then my bosses at newspapers were not multimillionaires, and many more newspapers by a factor of 5 or 10 in [LOCATION]0 and [LOCATION]9 were independent and competitive, compared to [DATE]0. Back then, the baseline was that many reporters were vying to get the scoop on real news stories. [LOCATION] and facts were a given anything else rose to the level of pink slip offenses. That robust nature of things back then  even though for the most part, as a socialist and Marxist, I never did fit personally into any paradigm in a newsroom  was things that youd never see printed [PERSON] in the few small town newspapers left there are hardly any left across [LOCATION], anyway were vigorously printed in many more newspapers back then. From Salon4 According to [ORGANIZATION]5 research, the country has lost nearly 1,800 local newspapers since [DATE]1, and many more have lost the ability to comprehensively cover their communities. Rural counties with poorer, older populations are most at risk  500 rural papers have shuttered since [DATE]1. These communities are also less likely to see a digital start-up help fill the void  as funding for both for- and non-profit models are more available in metro areas, and many rural counties across the [PERSON]0 still lack broadband internet access, which is critical for delivering online news. More than 200 counties in the [PERSON]0 have no local paper, but thats just part of the story, or this new shifted baseline Local ownership of papers is eroding big time. Get this  nearly one-third of [PERSON]0 newspapers and two-thirds of dailies are now owned by 25 companies. GateORG6 [ORGANIZATION] is rapacious, buying up small-town papers. That means the news is controlled by Big Brother Being The Oligarchs, many times edited a thousand miles or more from the towns or counties that are supposedly being covered. Copy-editing and editorial decisions for GateORG6 originate in [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2. Its the number one small and medium newspaper owner in the [ORGANIZATION]A, and its model of efficiency means many fewer reporters and a more insipid and irrelevant TV style content which is also replicated shared widely. Murders, celebrities, food, weather not global warming pet tricks, celebrity food, celebrity weather, celebrity pet tricks, celebrity murders idiocy of the umpteenth degree. I have a case in point a massive militarized police presence was in [PERSON]4, [PERSON]5, [DATE]2, resulting in closing the main [STREET] east-west, locking down schools and the [ORGANIZATION]8 facility I worked at as a social worker. There were civilian-clothed snipers with high powered rifles w higher powered scopes all over dozens of multi-agency personnel out in public with pistols brandished, and two armored vehicles with gun turrets that rammed the offending ex-vets big pick-up truck. He had just been evicted from the [ORGANIZATION]8s homeless veterans transition center for suspect reasons. The entire homeless facility was bombarded with [ORGANIZATION]-outfitted police thugs, and no one was allowed to enter or leave the facility, creating high levels of anxiety with already PTSD-addled veterans and their homeless families. The veteran was shot seven times, after [TIME] of staged hostage negation-like stuff, even though he was alone, pinned in his own pickup truck. The [ORGANIZATION]8 leadership later said it was a coup for them this bizarre religious organization - Thank goodness we controlled the story and very few media outlets picked it up. We want to protect our brand in [PERSON]5 . . . as the number one non-profit. Now, imagine if there had been one or two beat reporters, like myself in [DATE]3, vying to find out what really happened and why so much force had been deployed for a suicidal veteran basically isolated in his pick-up who could do no harm to anyone but himself? My baseline would have been news coverage galore, and better yet, follow up coverage. [DATE]4, nothing, not even in the [PERSON]6, [PERSON]5 media market that serves millions of residents. And this is the [ORGANIZATION]8, funded by the [ORGANIZATION] taxpayer i.e., ORG22 paying for beds for those veterans to be housed. This is the shifting baseline syndrome, which is a sickness tied to outfits like the [ORGANIZATION]8 using PR flaks and using the fact there are no newspapers in [PERSON]7 to cover local news and this disturbing show of military force and what the implications of a military operation in their neighborhood might mean in the future. No less, against a veteran who was getting services from a well-known homeless center. Local news, and then news that has national and international implications, lost. Not covered. In the memory hole! Shifting baseline syndrome means the public gets shafted and the administrators and gatekeepers of information  PR and marketers and development officers - get to lie through their teeth, or in the case of my police-involved shooting incident even that term is dripping with propagandist flavor, no one knew the ramifications of the [ORGANIZATION]8s unprofessionalism and lack of trauma informed care leading up to the soldiers eviction and then the suicidal behavior and then the soldier almost killed, and now, recovering in [PERSON]8 lock-up jail serving time. And hes still suicidal, untreated. Job well done by the keepers of the information flow. Shifting baseline disease. Read the three parts of my [ORGANIZATION]8 mess here, [PERSON]. In [LOCATION], I had published pieces in small towns newspapers, and later in the [ORGANIZATION] ORG23 and [ORGANIZATION] ORG24 on LOC2n refugees, on people crossing the border seeking asylum, on groups, both religious and secular, helping undocumented people cross the border and get help once here and to apply for political asylum. Piece published on the front pages of many small town rags I worked for. My baseline then was we still had [TIME] and [TIME] rags, and weeklies, that debated hard the militarys presence in towns like [PERSON]9 or [ORGANIZATION]. Debated hard the debasement of the environment through the unchecked developers razing the desert. Debated hard the values of community health, welfare, safety and well-being over the wants and desires of small and large companies coming into communities and demanding tax abatements, giveaway land schemes, and more-more-more from the public coffers to do their trickster capitalism to make more-more-more for the owners, CEOs and stockholders. Now Democrats and Republican alike [ORGANIZATION] cheer trillions in military spending. Job creation and [ORGANIZATION]0 [LOCATION] the Greatest masturbation. - Im going back to [PERSON] In his final address to the country, in [DATE]5, while still a five-star general, and still a believer in the [LOCATION]n [STREET], in [LOCATION]n exceptionalism, in [LOCATION]s greatness both sides of the political isle yammer on and on to show their patriotism, he did at least put into check the [ORGANIZATION] military industrial complex Our military organization [PERSON] bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or [ORGANIZATION]1. Until the latest of our world conflicts, [ORGANIZATION]2 had no armaments industry. [LOCATION]n makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, [DATE] men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We [DATE] spend on military security more than the net income of all [ORGANIZATION]3 corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the [LOCATION]n experience. The total influence  economic, political, even spiritual  is felt in every city, every ORG25 house, every office of the ORG26 government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent [LOCATION]7. source8 Now, I have to back up a bit to reset this essay I continue [PERSON]  just hitting [DATE]7  to call this myopia and concerted erasure of knowledge and historical context what [PERSON]2 calls [ORGANIZATION]2 of [LOCATION] shifting baseline syndrome covering many aspects of my life, the life of [LOCATION] and the implications to the world that the [ORGANIZATION] Empire negatively effects. I explain this concept [DATE]8 as I go about living and roaming, learning and teaching, struggling and rejoicing. Here, illustratively The baseline for divers like me, in [ORGANIZATION] called FAC2 by many then, for [LOCATION]0 and [DATE]9 I was diving [DATE]8 near [PERSON] and [PERSON], out near LOC7 from the boat my buddy and I paid 500 from a lake fisherman from [ORGANIZATION]6. So, a typical dive - dozens of turtles of three or four species, dozens of moray eels of a dozen species pinnipeds like sea lions by the hundreds long beak and short beak dolphins by the dozens hammerhead sharks by the dozen over two hundred species of reef fish, crustaceans, and sponges and soft corals brown pelicans by the hundreds pelagic fish and groupers and barracuda and amazing surface fish, nudibranchs and, well, in [TIME] dive, more than what any overpaid ORG27 CGI technical wonk could create, let alone dream of. Thats the baseline for an [ORGANIZATION]0 in [ORGANIZATION]1, me, a wanna be [PERSON]3 and marine biology college major. Fast forward [ORGANIZATION]2, and the baseline of another [PERSON]4 diver, same age, well, now a decimated, overfished, multi-polluted ocean, with hardly a shadow of what I saw on typical dives in [LOCATION]0. The baseline shifted, and [PERSON], the syndrome, in the shifting baseline syndromedisease analogy, would be the arrogance, historical stupidity, and hubris to believe that a healthy and normal reef dive is what it should be as experienced in [DATE]0. The syndrome and disease of shifting baselines it that it is most likely even smart biologists might be working on staving off further decline in an ecosystem based on the present baseline. What you dont see now normalizes one to see what they see now as the correct baseline to go by. Wrong. Now transfer the shifting baseline syndromedisease to almost every aspect of [ORGANIZATION] society no, the baseline for police involvement in our lives is not a ORG28, shoot to kill first force, where we all are in fear, while witnessing pigs murder [PERSON] and African [LOCATION]ns with impunity. Judge, jury and executioner, no, is not the baseline we should be stuck with or happy with. Baseline sickness now applied to what it means to be a student - my baseline was a university where faculty had freedom to teach, that more were on the tenure track, where students would be experimenting with ideas and learning, without fear of ORG29 thugs hobbling them for life with 100 K debt or censuring like [PERSON]5 of ORG30 fame or ORG31 do regularly to researchers. Yes, the baseline in [ORGANIZATION]1 when I was coming of age was that we COULD protest in the streets without fear of felonies, without being sprayed upon with tear gas and rubber bullets at every event where cops were in small numbers, and there were no drones and militarized [ORGANIZATION] teams for peace demonstrations. Baseline was for [ORGANIZATION]1 one hell of a lot more book readers, more by a power of 10,000 regular thinkers, and more people who had newspapers in their hands and talked about local politics by a power of 1,000,000. Shifting baseline syndrome is now infecting every sector of our lives, where what is acceptable thinking, behavior, standard operating procedures and collective will NOW are so bastardized, retrograded and devolved that the conversation about anything on any tract - food-medicine-science-arts-law-education-international politics-community standards-health-safety-welfare of the environment-ownership-birth and death-cradle to cradle planning  is an effort in alien talk, as if people [PERSON] are from a completely new set of gravitaional laws. Idiots call this the new normal, another shifting baseline of not only bastardizing language but Orwellizing it. War is Peace, Lies are [LOCATION], Stupidity is Smarts. New normal! Now, back to we all are illegal aliens, where I helped push that bumper sticker in [ORGANIZATION] as a solidarity protest meme, to illustrate that no [LOCATION]n [ORGANIZATION] leaders came together to endorse the free passage of all those whites to use their great LOC8 as a haul-out like a bunch of molting fur seals. Here, my writing, [ORGANIZATION]3, for ORG32, just below. Talk about no shifting baseline for me, or in the case of this hatred of Mexicans and LOC2ns, displayed by more than just [PERSON]6 and his ilk. Oh, once you hit 50 or 60, the ramifications of this French doozy really sink in plus a change, plus cest la mme chose  the more things change the more they stay the same - It hearkens to the proverb, Turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo.What is the [ORGANIZATION] status quo when it comes to people displaced by [LOCATION]n Empire structural and military and economic and environmental violence? [ORGANIZATION]4 Their Land, and We Are the Illegal Aliens9 By [PERSON]7 [PERSON]8, [ORGANIZATION]5 We are all illegal aliens. Its a bumper sticker many of us on the frontlines of the fight against [ORGANIZATION]2 governments assault on LOC2ns plastered on our car bumpers down [ORGANIZATION] [STREET]. That was in [LOCATION].You know, when [PERSON]9 was running amok ordering his captains [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]2, the whole lot of them, to send bombs, ORG33-torture manuals and [ORGANIZATION] agents in order to aid terrorist contras and other despotic sorts in killing hundreds of thousands of innocents in civil wars in [PERSON] and [LOCATION] and El [PERSON]. We worked with women and children who had witnessed fathers, uncles and husbands eviscerated by [ORGANIZATION]-backed military monsters. Victims of torture, in [PERSON]2 illegally. You know, what those brave [PERSON] and ORG34-brandishing, chaise lounge Minutemen of [PERSON] would call aliens. We worked with people in faith-based communities, mainstream churches, and non-profits throughout [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and the general area known as [ORGANIZATION]. Everyone I met working with in this refugee assistance stint had humanitarian blood coursing through their veins. We were proud of our law-breaking work  we gave refuge to terrorized and sometimes half-dead civilians. We were called lawbreakers by the [PERSON]9ites and the Minutemen of that time. Communists. Pinko-fags. Those were [DATE] of low-tech surveillance and simple ORG35 lists. But what we did was human and humane, in the tradition of that very universal with roots in Quakerism belief in bearing witness and acting upon that which has been judged as unjust and inhumane. Of course, we were up against the laws of this land and coarse politically-driven judges who denied victim after victim permanent or temporary status while seeking asylum in the [ORGANIZATION]. We have so many stories of people sent back who were at best imprisoned, and in the worse cases, mutilated, disappeared, and murdered. [LOCATION]n and [PERSON]ans, that is. My readers may not want to hear the narratives and visualize the descriptions of photos of those victims of torture. Ghastly things happened to teachers, nuns, medical workers and farmers, more heinous than what weve heard happened in the cells of [PERSON]. We were there to assist, but more importantly to bear witness to our countrys terror campaign. Some of us got so riled up that later in our lives  me included  we hoofed it to LOC2. Kicked around. Wrote articles for the few newspapers in this country that even cared about poor, misbegotten, displaced people of Latin [LOCATION]. But no matter how hard-nosed we became, or how much we could withstand the photographs of womens sliced backs and beheaded fetuses, we couldnt shake the images of the children of torture at this two-story refugee house, Annunciation ORG6. It was full of scruffy-looking [PERSON]1 volunteers who had hooked up with [PERSON], the ORG6s director, through Catholic services organizations. It was their stint with public service, their spiritual duty calling. Part of their degree plans. But most were converted and slammed hard intellectually and spiritually by the violence their charges had suffered under in our name - as [ORGANIZATION] citizens paying taxes. Those PTSD-induced cartoons those children drew sucked the air out of even the hard-ass border patrol guys who used to dump the LOC2ns at [ORGANIZATION]3 door at [TIME]. Who can believe it now, that once upon a time official ORG38 and border patrol officers knowingly let their perps go  knew that [ORGANIZATION]4 and his volunteers could salve emotional and physical wounds of these tortured crossers. Their chance at freedom. Except for the piss-ant judges. And the memories of pregnant aunties being raped, their fetuses cut out alive, speared, and the laughing [PERSON]9-loved military punks in the highlands and jungle. Annunciation ORG6 was bulging at 100 people  disheveled lives jammed in. Beans always cooking. Songs. Mattresses and piles of donated clothes. Guitars strumming. Gueros, the white ones, and the Chicanos would help with in-takes  asylum transcripts, translation, dotting all the is and crossing the ts. Help with getting jobs. Odd jobs in the community. Help with making sure the refugees didnt get caught again. But it was always those by-the-letter-of-the-law jurists helping to confound the torture. More than 70 percent of our brothers and sisters seeking asylum in the [ORGANIZATION] were denied entry by some fat cat, many times cocaine-sniffing immigration judge who usually had a friend in the back pocket of some [ORGANIZATION]5 or buddy of [ORGANIZATION]5 somewhere. Then it was trying to get the denied victims off to [ORGANIZATION]8 without being caught. You remember, the [ORGANIZATION]8 back then which used to open its borders to refugees, the [ORGANIZATION]8 of shifting baseline syndrome. The judges and politicians and Minutemen all professed, Send them back. Those aliens broke our immigration laws. But we are all illegal aliens as a rejoinder went much farther than [ORGANIZATION]As mayhem in [PERSON]2. We worked in solidarity with the housekeepers, bricklayers, agricultural workers and so many other worthy Mexicans who worked their butts off in the [ORGANIZATION] for little pay and much less respect. These were workers who crossed [ORGANIZATION] to find low-paying jobs with [LOCATION]n families and businesses  working for mayors, bigwigs, even on government contracts. In [PERSON]2, [ORGANIZATION]9, [LOCATION]0, elsewhere. With a wink and a smile by the [LOCATION]n exploiters. [LOCATION]1  wetback. Squatter. [PERSON]. Illegal alien. These were the more tame epithets. But lets not kid ourselves about the genesis of this new round of empowered [PERSON] fighting against racist laws put forward by the dispassionate conservatives running the ship of fools in [LOCATION]2. This is not a country of legal immigrants. Its a country based on colonialists, undocumented white people who helped displace native tribes through broken laws and genocide. Its a country based on illegal occupation of native lands and on [LOCATION]9s lands, pure and simple. Colonialists protected by ORG26 laws that deemed free white people as the only ones who had the right to be fully-fledged citizens. [PERSON] was a violent racist act to seize lands illegally. Everything this countrys current anti-Mexican and [PERSON] border war proponents stand upon  all that doctrine and those so-called laws  is based on illegally seizing lands of Native tribes. And worse  laws that removed natives. Laws that starved natives. Laws that approved of eradicating native families, entire tribes. The current massive turnout of students and workers alike in this countrys major cities is a testament to these [LOCATION]ns backbone to fight this new exclusionary law  HR437710  a [LOCATION]3, [LOCATION]2-inspired racist act that has its roots in the Chinese Exclusion Act of [ORGANIZATION]6. Many [LOCATION]ns do express a certain humanity and dignity for the people many deem aliens, but its not awe-inspiring that some citizens of [LOCATION]4, [LOCATION]5 or [LOCATION]6, [LOCATION]7, disobey the so-called immigration laws of this country during [DATE] as landed immigrants. Lets make no bones about the motives of [ORGANIZATION]6, the author of this racist ORG6 bill He sees those brown-skinned south-of-the-border lettuce pickers, linen washers, house framers, and their [ORGANIZATION]-born children as, what? Alien gang members terrorizing communities. Anyone spouting that we are a nation of immigrants and laws has a disease, what [ORGANIZATION]7 called the illness of double-think. And until those many white [LOCATION]ns stop spewing that this is their land, a land of their laws, and a land made for [ORGANIZATION]ians, the racist Minutemen will ramp up their gun brandishing on the southern and northern borders. And racist politicians will continue to play on the fears of uniformed constituents and try to pass the [ORGANIZATION]7 Centurys racist exclusionary laws. I wonder what these [ORGANIZATION]8 Nazis would say about those childrens cartoons  images of bodies floating in rivers. Blood-soaked church walls. Military men with their M-16s trained on men while others are sketched in their rape hunch. Beautiful jungle birds flying in the sky next to [ORGANIZATION]-paid-for helicopter gunships spraying the corn and coffee fields below. Dead mommies cradling dead babies. Yeah, Im an illegal alien. We all are illegal aliens, under the laws of these creeps in high office. Humanity and caring and simple benedictions for suffering so much, those are alien traits only held by a minority in this country of exclusion, and slavery. Yeah, those creeps on hate-radio and in the newspaper columns and on ORG39, sure, they recognize all of us who see the lies and fight the injustice as aliens. And the children whose post-traumatic cartoons brought tears to men and women, some who had fought in [LOCATION]8. Simple [LOCATION]0 colorings brought tears to a county sheriff who had survived drug runners shooting up his town and unearthed bodies. Yeah, we are all illegal aliens. Except them. [ORGANIZATION]8 worked in LOC2 and [LOCATION]9 writing for newspapers during [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION]9. Hes currently in [PERSON]0, [LOCATION]3, as an instructor of writing at [PERSON]0 Falls Community College and writes sustainability-energy-environmental pieces for the towns DATE40, [LOCATION]1.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11"

Original ill[PERSON]tration by Mr. [PERSON] So, note the proverbial two-by-four between the eyes comment from this judicial devil . . . . From a multimillionaire judge. Imagine that! If I told a pig that exact same thing, after stopping me for a dangling mud flap on my minivan, j[PERSON]t think what might happen to me. Or if I told that she needed a proverbial two by four between the eyes to a judge during my trial or someone elses? Or, to the boss, uh? Or to the teacher if I was an 11th grader. Or, to the drill sergeant? Or the ORG8 guy smelling my feet at the [INSTITUTION]. This judge is human scum, and while this is of national and international importance, I have been in courtrooms local, small and midsized town where women lost their children, where drug addicted got the book thrown at them, where homeless rough sleepers were fined and incarcerated, where people more sane than this judge were committed to mental ward. This is the truth about systems of oppression, about modern white civilization, a fucked up rule of law lawlessness. This is it in our world. But it happens [ORGANIZATION] a few ten tho[PERSON]and times. To we the small ass people. Now, multiple that by a factor a ten tho[PERSON]and  try suing ORG9, or ORG10 or [ORGANIZATION], or ORG12, or ORG13, or ORG14, or [PERSON] or ORG16, or ORG17, or ORG18, or the manufacturer of the air bag in the minivan or the pretzel maker your kid is choking on. Now, bring it back to a real perspective. Local, where cities have no money for infrastructure, where medical systems are threadbare at least, or missing altogether. No co[ORGANIZATION]try for old men, for yo[ORGANIZATION]g people, for the sick, disabled, poor, mentally challenged, psychiatrically impaired. This is a co[ORGANIZATION]try for no regular people. Yet, we will hear the media mental midgets yammer on and on about [PERSON] bumkins, [PERSON] flyover fucks, deplorables, or deploying any other la[ORGANIZATION]dry list of pejoratives or socio-psych mumbo jumbo for their elite brains to find more ways to subjugate the many in the name of profits, and in the words of their deep alter egos  The world of elites and beautiful and worthy and good members of society have to deal with these [PERSON]eless breeders, breathers and eaters. Really, all we want is whats best for the masses, for these misbegotten, less than high IQ, and multiple-dysf[ORGANIZATION]ctional people who in some cases, well, dont mean to be [PERSON]eless eaters, breeders, breathers, existers. But we can corral them into good deeds, and we can make so much money from their faults, chronic illnesses, their low IQs, their inbreeding, their constant bad bad bad decisions in life. Their mistakes and pain and dysf[ORGANIZATION]ction are our opport[ORGANIZATION]ity to make society the [STREET] we want it designed, with a few trillion of profits in greenbacks to boot. But we would never say this outright to PERSON8 or PERSON9 or ORG19 or what not. But reality is always local, no matter how much bullshit college sports and pro football teams and idiotic Republican and Democrat lying and spewing interferes with their noggins. For example, the outfit I work with, as a social services guy, doesnt ask our clients  developmental and intellectual disabled adults  if they have had the jab, but rather, they ask If an employer asks you to provide proof of vaccination, will that be a problem? That is the reality now  adults barely surviving, after their whole lives have been spent in special ed programs and being evaluated, separated, roomed, ho[PERSON]ed and institutionalized, and many coming from proverbial messed up families, dysf[ORGANIZATION]ction being the f[ORGANIZATION]ctional word  I have to navigate more of the same systems of oppression-poverty inducing-safety net fraying eating at our comm[ORGANIZATION]ities very souls. The chances of getting part-time work in a field tied to the five Fs food, fur, factory, filth, foliage  restaurants, dog cleaning, wareho[PERSON]es, janitorial, and landscaping are already slim, as so much is stacked against these folk. Think about the propaganda aro[ORGANIZATION]d those with developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to the covid so they need to be vaxxed first ideology. Many clients were so scared that they were more or less forced into getting the ORG10 or J amp38 J, both mRNA biomedical experimental treatments. Most live in supported ho[PERSON]ing, and most of these in group homes, sanctioned by the state, so the vaccine mandates are not j[PERSON]t inferred, but demanded. Boosterism booster x, y, z, [ORGANIZATION] will continue to r[ORGANIZATION] rampant. More will be sick. Some will die, or course. The reality is I know people who are losing jobs, and they are not sitting on piles of cash like a lot of professionals you might read about that are opting out of the forced chemical jabs. These people do not have the luxury of taking a stand with [ORGANIZATION]limited credit card limits, or fully owned homes, or hobby gardens out back with the swimming pool. These are people who read up about this planned pandemic, who take precautions, who listen to experts. Their choice is to not get jabbed. Imagine, being a teacher, PhD in physics, after [PERSON], and you have DATE8 paid and you ref[PERSON]e to do the jab but accept the draconian test and mask. You are still going to be fired, or put on [ORGANIZATION]paid leave, and DATE9 you have accrued, well, forget about them.

He joins [PERSON] [PERSON]1 on DATE10 [PERSON]1 [ORGANIZATION] to talk about his latest book, R[PERSON]sia Upside Down An Exit Strategy for the Second Cold War16, in which he examines how he, like so many [ORGANIZATION]5ns, got R[PERSON]sia wrong.

Based on both his personal experience as well as detailed research, [PERSON]4 dispels common misconceptions about R[PERSON]sia that he once held to be true in R[PERSON]sia Upside Down17.

Many people I speak with and comm[ORGANIZATION]icate with are tired of the pro-pro-pro forced jab perspective we are getting from the leftist ORG31, and from [ORGANIZATION]7. I am referencing [PERSON], ORG31, DATE14, from the anti-science pro-some-science get-out-of-that-sciences [STREET] thinking coming from some of the articles posted on the site. Very sad in many ways, so sad that there is not a rob[PERSON]t disc[PERSON]sion of the vaccination that we see on ORG32, even [ORGANIZATION], and especially ORG34. Here, bullet points, direct quoting from [PERSON]  Im against any exemptions our social contract should require either all of [PERSON] to get it or that the jab be completely vol[ORGANIZATION]tary , but if theres a religio[PERSON] exemption there should beone for philosophy,20too. Dr. [PERSON]5 says hes worried that people resisting [ORGANIZATION] vaccine shots based on religio[PERSON] gro[ORGANIZATION]ds may be conf[PERSON]ing that with a philosophical objection.  ORG35 is selling its high-touted new [LOCATION] pill [PERSON], whose development was federally financed by ORG36 and ORG37, back to the GPE4 government for40 times21what it costs to make.

The reality is [ORGANIZATION]1 is not jabbing its people with mRNA All of [ORGANIZATION]1s vaccine candidatesAbdala, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] Pl[PERSON], and [PERSON], are sub[ORGANIZATION]it protein vaccines, like the [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. Crucially, the vaccines do not require extreme refrigeration, are cheap to produce, and are easy for the co[ORGANIZATION]try to manufacture at scale. They are made by fermentation in mammalian cells, a process [ORGANIZATION]1 already [PERSON]es for monoclonal antibodies. Now, we are worried about more of the celebrities, this time, a professor who was sacked  Academic Fired Following [ORGANIZATION]3 Lobby Smear [PERSON]6 Speaks Out w Lowkey25 Now, think about any criticism against any [ORGANIZATION]iversity, when you are employed by the institution. I was employed by ORG39. I was an [LOCATION]0 faculty, part-time, a radical, and I fought like hell for adj[ORGANIZATION]cts, for students, etc. I was part of a group of students as a faculty member who made a human chain to stop the group of overweight sheriff posse dudes dressed up as Conquistadors on horses strutting on camp[PERSON]. That was DATE19, the 500th anniversary of that evil contact we call Columb[PERSON] Day. [LOCATION]1 ran a front page photo of these [ORGANIZATION]dercover cops jumping out of the b[PERSON]hes, and wrangling students, clobbering male and female with forearms to the neck. I was right in the middle, and I had to answer for myself to the Provost and president. This is what a [ORGANIZATION]iversity, then, in DATE19, was encapsulated inside, [ORGANIZATION]der a rich white president, a camp[PERSON] that was and still is 80-pl[PERSON] percent Mexican-[ORGANIZATION]5n, [LOCATION], now. You cant protest without our permission and our approval of signs! This was a camp[PERSON] that introduced a free speech zone out of the [STREET] of foot traffic. A state sponsored school, with a limited small postage stamp of land near dumpsters where people can gain the public square for protesting. And the camp[PERSON] Nazis demanded permission, permits, and full written details of the protest or information gathering. Now, sure, talk about [LOCATION], about [ORGANIZATION]4 protocol, about mandates, about those who have the jab and those who do not. Talk about ORG36 and [LOCATION]2 and the shadowy origins of the SARS-CoV2, or the doctors who have protocols to stop not only [LOCATION] patients getting on ventilators, but getting patients out of the hospital and back home in recovery zone. Not allowed. These articles are verboten on camp[PERSON]es And, if I was still on that camp[PERSON], how quickly would I be sacked for criticizing a camp[PERSON]- that p[PERSON]hes the Hispanic [LOCATION]3 theme while colonizing Hispanics mostly Mexican [ORGANIZATION]5ns  for lock-step falling into the fold of [ORGANIZATION]  military-banking-ag-energy-prison-pharma-education-medicine-mining-chemical-AI-surveillence-real estate-insurance-prison-legal-media-entertainment?

So, back into that gro[ORGANIZATION]d-truthing  try being a radical, a revolutionary, a critic of bureaucracies and corporate mandates and this sort of bullshit on a local level.

The aim of the international bankers was nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each co[ORGANIZATION]try and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.  Professor [PERSON]7, [PERSON], p. 324 source28 Finally, another point from a friend [PERSON]y Felonio[PERSON] Fraudulent [LOCATION]2 Read [LOCATION]5 latest. During the panel29, the [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]9 ofthe[ORGANIZATION]erasked the questionWhy dont we blow the system up? Obvio[PERSON]ly, we j[PERSON]t cant turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say Hey! everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we havent given to anyone yet, butthere m[PERSON]t be some [STREET].[PERSON]9 then mentioned how vaccine production is antiquated and asked how sufficient disruption could occur to prompt the modernization of the existing vaccination development and approval process. [ORGANIZATION]0 responded first, saying that as a society we are behind where we need to be when it comes to moving toward a new, more technological approach and that it is now time to act to make that a reality. [TIME], [PERSON]5 stated that the superior method of vaccine production involves not growing the vir[PERSON] at all, but getting sequences, getting the appropriate protein and it sticking in on self-assembling nanoparticles, essentially referring to mRNA vaccines.[LOCATION]2 then stated The critical challenge . . . is that in order to make the transition fromgetting out ofthe tried and true egg-growingmethod . . . to something that has to be much better,you have to prove that this works and then you have got to go through all of the critical trialsphase 1, phase 2, phase 3and show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of [ORGANIZATION]1. That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take [ORGANIZATION]2.[LOCATION]2 later statedthatthere is a need to alter the publics perceptionthat the flu is not a serio[PERSON] disease in order to increase urgency andthat it would be difficult to alter that perception along with the existing vaccine development and approval process [ORGANIZATION]less the existing system takes the posture thatI dont care what your perception is,were going to address the problemin a disruptive [STREET] and an iterative [STREET]. During the panel, [ORGANIZATION]1 statedthat we need to move as quickly as possible and urgently as possible to get these technologies that address speed and effectiveness of the vaccine before disc[PERSON]sing how the White Ho[PERSON]e Co[ORGANIZATION]cil of Economic Advisers had j[PERSON]t issued a report emphasizing thatprioritizing fast vaccines was paramo[ORGANIZATION]t. [ORGANIZATION]1 then added that a mediocre and fastvaccine was better than a mediocre and slow vaccine. He then said that we can make better vaccines and make them faster and that urgency and disruption were necessary to produce the targeted and accelerated development of one such vaccine. Later in the panel, [ORGANIZATION]1said the best [STREET] to disrupt the vaccine field in favor of faster vaccines would be the emergence of an entity of excitement out there thats completely disruptive, thats not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes. He latervery directly said thatby faster vaccines he meant mRNA vaccines. The [ORGANIZATION]1-led [LOCATION]7 and the [LOCATION]2-led [LOCATION]8 in j[PERSON]t a few [ORGANIZATION]7 time became the biggest backers of the [LOCATION]9 [ORGANIZATION] vaccine, investing billions and co-developing the vaccine with the company, respectively. As will be explained in Part II of this series,the partnership between [LOCATION]9 and the ORG36 to co-develop what would soon become [LOCATION]9s [ORGANIZATION] vaccinewas being forged [ORGANIZATION]4, long before the official declaration of the [ORGANIZATION] crisis as a pandemic and before a vaccine was proclaimed as necessary by officials and other individuals. Not only did the [ORGANIZATION] vaccine quickly become the answer to nearly all [LOCATION]9s woes but it also provided the disruptive scenario necessary to alter the publics perceptions of what a vaccine is and eliminate existing safeguards and bureaucracy in vaccine approval. Watch the [ORGANIZATION]5 [PERSON]. As Part II of this series will show, it was an alleged mix of serendipity and foresight from [LOCATION]9s [ORGANIZATION]3 and the ORG36s [ORGANIZATION]4 that propelled [LOCATION]9 to the front of the Warp Speed race for a [ORGANIZATION] vaccine. That partnership, along with the disruptive effect of the [ORGANIZATION] crisis, created the very [PERSON] for which [LOCATION]9 had been desperately waiting since [ORGANIZATION]6 while also turning most of [LOCATION]9s executive team into billionaires and multi-millionaires in a matter of [ORGANIZATION]7. However, [LOCATION]9s [PERSON] wont last - that is, [ORGANIZATION]less the mass administration of its [ORGANIZATION] vaccine becomes an [ORGANIZATION]8 affair for millions of people worldwide. Even though real-world data since its administration began challenges the need for as well as the safety and efficacy of its vaccine, [LOCATION]9 - and its stakeholders - cannot afford to let this opport[ORGANIZATION]ity slip through fingers. To do so would mean the end of [LOCATION]9s carefully constructed ho[PERSON]e of cards.

elpaso,2017-12-01T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,KFOX,affordable housing,[ORGANIZATION] Charge: Asset Managers are [ORGANIZATION][ORGANIZATION]',"They also say that asset managers have been filling gaps in the financial system that emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis - theyll need to capitalize on and expand these once-niche markets. Thirdly, while they make the common point that traditional active managers feel a squeeze between passive management on the one hand and alternatives on the other, they go further in that direction than other analysts have, saying that the [STREET] to react to this squeeze is not to try to beat back the competing forces but to join them, to turn a management firm into a multi-asset solutions firm. But perhaps the most surprising of the four points is the contention that asset management has been a refuge of digital technology laggards, and that this will change in the near future, as technology giants enter the sector, flexing their data analytics and distribution muscle. The race is on. [ORGANIZATION]? One might be excused for thinking on the contrary that this field has been a technology pace setter in [ORGANIZATION], with blockchains, [ORGANIZATION], algorithmic execution, etc. Although, yes, [ORGANIZATION] sees that some firms, especially heavily quantitative alternative investment firms, have been as these authors put it leveraging technology in specific areas of their business, it also contends that the first truly technology-enabled firm has yet to emerge. Ceasing to Be [ORGANIZATION] As such firms do emerge, some of the job descriptions to which were accustomed will disappear. For example, investment analyst. Research teams with lots of human investment analysts working together - that is over - replaced by exponential advances in computing power, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and big data. [ORGANIZATION] managers are among the most innovative firms in the space, the least laggardly, and they will likely lead the [STREET] as the revolution comes. This report says that investment analysis is a task inherently suited to computers, it can be done with lots of data and correlation-seeking power, both of which are what the digital revolution has been all about. The back and middle offices will be automated or outsourced. Global utilities will emerge to be the recipient of the outsourcing of know-your-client, transfer agency, trade processing, and tax reporting functions. Of course, carbon-based people are going to have to guide the firms into this new world of streamlined front offices with silicon-based analysts. To hire the best people, the report says in a sidebar, diversity in all its forms will matter more than ever - from gender, generation, ethnicity, sexuality and disability to people with a broader range of skills, experience, and industry backgrounds. [ORGANIZATION]s research indicates that firms still have a long [STREET] to go in making diversity a reality and realizing the benefits. Filling the Financing Gaps As noted above, one of the themes of the report is the emergence of certain financing gaps since the [ORGANIZATION], which have become profitable niches or more-than-niches for alpha generators. When the authors get around to fleshing this point out, they disclose that what they have in mind includes syndicated lending activities for large infrastructure projects. We anticipate soaring growth in real assets - mainly infrastructure and to a lesser extent real estate. [ORGANIZATION] anticipates a 27.5 per annum growth rate in infrastructure through [LOCATION], slowing to 15 in [DATE] after that. People in [LOCATION], [PERSON], and LOC2 are migrating to cities, creating an urgent need for infrastructure there waste, power, and transportation. Infrastructure is shifting from pure-play, low-risk to deal sourcing, evaluation, and asset management. In real estate, asset managers in [ORGANIZATION] will make greater use of ways to gain exposure such as REITS and will expand in non-traditional areas such as rental, multi-generational, and affordable housing.Be Sociable, Share!  1"

Im not sure thats the right question to ask. [ORGANIZATION] is not going to change. denigrating [PERSON] for his aggressive [DATE] of acting ORG1 Secretary [PERSON] over conditions where migrant children are being held should have earned a rebuke from multiple high-profile Republican members of ORG2. It would have had an impact. Surely, you remember the exchange. [PERSON] You feel like youre doing a great job, right? [ORGANIZATION] Were doing our level best in a very challenging situation. [PERSON] voice rising to a shout What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, cant take a shower? Come on, man. Whats that about? as is his [STREET], tried to change the narrative by attacking [PERSON], tweeting that he is a brutal bully. [ORGANIZATION] tap-danced around the questions about [ORGANIZATION]s tweetstorm with this exchange. [ORGANIZATION] Well, PERSON9, lets look at what he said, all right, and why he did it. ORG2man [PERSON] sat there and attacked our [ORGANIZATION] agents, all right? This is, this reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] But that justifies a racial resentment tweet in response? Is that presidential leadership? [ORGANIZATION] Well, look, I, I, look, I didnt do the tweets, PERSON9. I cant talk about why he did what he did. [ORGANIZATION] stammered around long enough until he found a [STREET] to blame [PERSON] and Democrats. A basic sense of decency was not part of the equation. [ORGANIZATION] says he wasnt told about Russian election hacking in [LOCATION] via ORG4 [ORGANIZATION] said on ORG5 [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] never contacted him in [ORGANIZATION] about the infiltration. The Republican says he learned about most of the details [ORGANIZATION]. Current Gov.

Lets look at what [ORGANIZATION] said and why he did it, [ORGANIZATION] responded. This reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from [ORGANIZATION]. That justifies a racial resentment tweet in response? [ORGANIZATION] asked. Is that presidential leadership? [ORGANIZATION] stuttered for [TIME] before saying, Well look, I didnt do the tweets, PERSON9. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS Rep[PERSON] Mr. President, I go home to my district DATE5. Each [TIME], I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of ORG12. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents. [ORGANIZATION]3 Does GPE2 have challenges? All big cities have challenges. But it is certainly a better [STREET] to be than the [PERSON] the President wants us to live in. Urban cities arent perfect, but they are welcoming, diverse, vibrant serve as engines of innovation. They make us great. [ORGANIZATION]4 Incredible how the president openly sees a struggling [ORGANIZATION] city as someone elses responsibility [ORGANIZATION]5 So, you can say that where we are as [ORGANIZATION]s is garbage, that [PERSON] is racist, that half of the country are bigoted and deplorable Nazis, that we run concentration camps, that [ORGANIZATION]6 is a traitor, can even burn the flag But dont you dare talk about those rats in GPE2 BenShapiro [ORGANIZATION]s pajamas rage-tweeting is bad for the country. But pointing out that GPE2 is one of the worst-run cities in [PERSON], rife with crime and plagued by poor living conditions, isnt racist. Its evident to anyone with two eyes and a functioning prefrontal cortex. [ORGANIZATION]DATE9 Im unfollowing the President of GPE4 [ORGANIZATION] on ORG13, because his feed is the most hate-filled, racist, and demeaning of the 200 I follow, and it regularly ruins my day to read it. So Im just going to stop. I cant believe I just typed that. [ORGANIZATION]9 look, if youre a DATE7 ORG14 political columnist who pals around with the Speaker of the [PERSON] you are, in fact, a decadent aristocrat. If you dont have the self-awareness to know that, then Im not sure what to tell you [ORGANIZATION]0 Been in [PERSON] for [TIME] and already feel ready to go on the record that those little motorized scooters are a very bad fit for this city [ORGANIZATION]1 Just out of the GPE6 mountains.

An Enterprise [ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman says thats the cost in staff time spent processing 16,2DATE9DATE9 pages of emails and attachments where [ORGANIZATION]8 administration staffers mentioned the search terms GPE21 and mission leading up to the trip. State officials have yet to release the full cost of sending the state officials overseas, where they met with a variety of GPE20i officials, political donors, and held a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] meeting in GPE21.

But physicians who serve on the [ORGANIZATION] Board of Medicine will have no say over one of the most contentious parts of the law registration costs for out-of-state doctors who can use telehealth to begin caring for [ORGANIZATION] residents. [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON] passed a bill [LOCATION] that creates a regulatory framework for telehealth, including authorizing the state to register doctors and collect fees. But a constitutional amendment required the ORG41 to include the new fees in a separate piece of legislation [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]8, however, vetoed [ORGANIZATION].

[ORGANIZATION]3 said afterward that the figure is discouraging. By law, insurance companies are supposed to pay claims within DATEDATE83 of being filed, if the claims are not contested. After the meeting, [ORGANIZATION]3s office sent insurance companies another warning that they need to pay their claims on time. They sent another warning in [ORGANIZATION]7 when 42,000 claims were still open. Insurers should redouble efforts to resolve all open claims, using whatever resources are necessary, to provide policyholders with the tools to rebuild their lives and property, [ORGANIZATION]8 letter states.

Based on her evaluation and statements from [ORGANIZATION]8 estranged children, [PERSON]0 determined [ORGANIZATION]8 needed to be under constant supervision, which cleared the [STREET] for [ORGANIZATION]5 to become her [STREET]-appointed guardian. It was a decision [PERSON]0 would later regret so much so that she resigned from the guardianship committee [ORGANIZATION]2 after examining [ORGANIZATION]8.

Unequal treatment [ORGANIZATION] mental health dollars vary across [LOCATION] via [PERSON]2 and [PERSON] of ORG47 The mental health care a child receives depends on their insurance, where they live, and if their parents can afford to pay out-of-pocket for more credentialed professionals and programs not covered by insurance. Roughly half of [ORGANIZATION] children with depression, anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not receive treatment, according to research featured in ORG48 in [ORGANIZATION]4. Affordability is one likely factor, said the study author. ORG49 covers most children without private insurance. State-managed funding supports non-traditional services or all services if a child does not have ORG49 or another [STREET] to pay for it. These ways of paying are flawed and mount barriers to care, especially in rural and poor communities. 5.6 billion opioid pills flooded the state, and rogue South [ORGANIZATION] doctors helped get them on the [LOCATION] via [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 of the South [ORGANIZATION] ORG140 While the data shows most pills went to chain pharmacies like ORG51 and ORG52, individual doctors and physicians also ordered millions of doses to their offices. Pill mills found fertile ground in [ORGANIZATION], where doctors were once allowed to prescribe and dispense the opioids in the same [STREET]. Shady operators recruited unscrupulous doctors through places like [ORGANIZATION] to pump out prescriptions. Some clinics raked in 50,000 a day passing out pills. During one raid, law enforcement found 4 million stashed in cardboard boxes in an attic. South [ORGANIZATION] became the go-to [STREET] for out-of-state addicts and dealers, who [STREET]-tripped down FAC0 and 95 in search of cash-only deals through pain clinics. [PERSON]6 applauds [ORGANIZATION] ethics board for sanctions against [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] via [PERSON]7 of [ORGANIZATION] Politics The [ORGANIZATION] Commission on Ethics has issued a new round of sanctions against so-called [ORGANIZATION] candidates for filing inaccurate financial forms. [PERSON] Attorney [PERSON]8 and ORG56 member [PERSON]9 filed the ethics complaints. The filings were a means of sanctioning candidates that [PERSON]8 and [PERSON]0 argue had been recruited to shut out voters from what would otherwise be an open primary process. The commission issued 500 fines against [PERSON]1, a former candidate for ORG57, and [PERSON]2, a former candidate for ORG58. A [LOCATION]00 fine was levied against [PERSON]3, who ran for ORG59. GPEDATE83 clerk of courts takes dispute over funding to [ORGANIZATION] ORG6714 via [PERSON] Herald The GPEDATE83 County clerk of courts wants [ORGANIZATION] ORG67 justices to take up a dispute about whether the state has unconstitutionally underfunded the clerks office. Attorneys for [PERSON] [PERSON]4 filed a notice [ORGANIZATION]5 that is a first step in asking ORG63 to decide the issue, according to documents posted [ORGANIZATION]6 on the courts website An appeals [STREET] said the case focused on portions of filing fees that clerks are required to send to the state, with the ORG41 then diverting part of the money to other purposes. Death row inmate seeks stay of execution15 via the News Service of [ORGANIZATION] With an execution scheduled [ORGANIZATION]7, attorneys for FAC1 inmate [PERSON]5 asked the [ORGANIZATION] ORG67 to grant a stay of execution and to order a hearing about whether [PERSON]6 is intellectually disabled. [ORGANIZATION]8 [ORGANIZATION]8 signed a death warrant for [PERSON]6, who was convicted of committing three murders, including a GPE27 murder that sent him to FAC1. [PERSON]6 attorneys are trying to establish that he is intellectually disabled and that, as a result, it would be unconstitutional to execute him. A GPE28 circuit judge [ORGANIZATION]9 rejected the arguments, finding that they are time-barred because the claims about intellectual disability were not filed earlier in [PERSON]6 appeals. [PERSON]5 also known as [PERSON]7 is seeking a stay of execution. Finish line nears for dog racing businesses16 via ORG65 FL What happens when the government, acceding to the will of the electorate, declares your business illegal?

Or try to. [ORGANIZATION]1 MATTERS ORG67 says [ORGANIZATION] can proceed with plan to spend military funds for border wall construction17 via [PERSON]8 of [PERSON] A split ORG67 said that the [ORGANIZATION] administration could proceed with its plan to use 2.5 billion in [ORGANIZATION] funds to build part of the presidents wall project along the southern border. The courts conservatives set aside a lower-[STREET] ruling for ORG70 and a coalition of border communities that said reallocating ORG71 money would violate federal law. The unsigned ruling came in response to an emergency filing from the administration during the courts [PERSON]0 recess. The majority said the government made a sufficient showing at this stage that private groups may not be the proper plaintiffs to challenge the transfer of money. One [STREET] or another, Donald [ORGANIZATION] is going to get his wall.
