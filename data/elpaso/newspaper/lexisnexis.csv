Millions of Texans are without power, heat and essential services during a winter storm[2] that has led to freezing temperatures[3] and hazardous road conditions[4] throughout the state. City officials, local outreach teams and other organizations are providing warming shelters and support for people seeking help. Many nonprofit organizations are also asking for donations so they can help people experiencing homelessness or those who are in need of support. </p><p>Here's a list of the resources being offered in cities across the state.  Statewide: Texans who have power in their households need to reduce their energy usage as much as possible to reduce stress on the state's power grid[5]. You can reduce your electricity usage by turning down the thermostats below 68 degrees, unplugging lights and appliances, and avoiding use of large appliances like ovens and washing machines. For people without power or heat, The National Weather Service encourages people to close blinds and curtains, close off rooms and stuff towels in the cracks under the door. Texans should also wear layers of warm and lightweight clothing and make sure to eat and drink to warm the body up.  State officials are strongly discouraging unnecessary travel due to the hazardous conditions on the roads caused by the snow and ice. If you are in need of power and are able to travel, the Texas Division of Emergency Management's website[6] includes a list of warming centers across the state.  We still cannot guarantee the safety of the roads. If you absolutely must drive, please stay off freeways and bridges, treat roads like a school zone, remember stoplights are down, and **get to where you will stay tonight by late afternoon** Roads will worsen again then.

[8]    Texans can find more details about community resources and warming centers in their area by calling 877-541-7905 or 211, the state's free 24-hour helpline. Information about specific local resources, assistance and guidance can also likely be found on local city government websites and social media accounts.  Houston: Lakewood Church, the Gallery Furniture store and multiple other warming shelters have opened in the area. Accommodations vary by shelter, but most have blankets and other supplies for people in the Houston area seeking warmth. The George R. Brown Convention Center opened as a warming center, but it is at full capacity and it is no longer accepting more people, according to KHOU[9]. Homeless outreach teams from the sheriff's office, police department, and homeless outreach groups have worked to provide rides to the warming centers. Houston area residents can call the Harris County Sheriff's Office non-emergency line at 713-221-6000 or 311 for information about shelter or transportation. The sheriff's office Homeless Outreach Team (HOT) has been providing items like coats, blankets and tents to people experiencing homelessness who are not in a warming center. People can donate here[10] to any of the organizations in The Way Home, a coalition of organizations working to prevent homelessness.   Austin: Austin officials are encouraging individuals in need of shelter to go to the Palmer Event Center. Families should go to the Downtown Salvation Army Shelter. Officials have also opened three other shelters at Mendez Middle School, Northeast Early College High School and Del Valle High School. People with pets will not be turned away and they will be accommodated through Animal Services, according to Austin Emergency Management[11]. CapMetro suspended its regular services[12] Tuesday, and the bus service anticipates that service will be impacted Wednesday as well. People who need transportation to a warming shelter can call 211, and they can call the cold weather shelter hotline at 512-305-ICEE for more information about warming shelters.  Various organizations in Austin are accepting donations to help people who need resources to help the homeless or those in need of resources. The Austin Area Urban League is organizing an emergency drive here[13] and Front Steps, a nonprofit that offers resources to the homeless, is asking for blanket donations here[14].  San Antonio: At least seven shelters are open in San Antonio, including Haven for Hope, the city's largest shelter, which is offering cold weather clothing and beds, according to San Antonio Report[15]. A resource list created by the Christian Assistance Ministry with details about shelters in San Antonio and specifics about accommodations can be found here[16]. Ministries and outreach teams are also looking for volunteers who can safely access the shelters. Outreach teams from SAMMinistries, Haven for Hope, Corazon Ministries and other organizations have been working to transport people to shelter, according to the South Alamo Regional Alliance for the Homeless, or SARAH. SARAH is providing details about organizations seeking help on their Facebook page here[17]. The city of San Antonio's homeless hotline, at 210-207-1799, is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m . to 4:30 p.m. The hotline will help people experiencing homeless find resources. If people need help outside of those hours, they can leave a voicemail or email <email normalizedValue=""mailto:homelessoutreach@sanantonio.gov"">homelessoutreach@sanantonio.gov</email> .;  DFW: Dallas opened the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center as a warming center, where people will be provided with a chair, table and light snacks. The center is not providing cots and it is not an overnight shelter, according to a press release[18]. Dallas is also working to identify more city resources, like recreation centers and libraries, to be used as warming centers. Multiple Dallas-area organizations, including The Salvation Army, OurCalling and The Bridge Homeless Recovery Center, are working to provide transportation to the convention center, food and tests for COVID-19, according to The Dallas Morning News[19]. Donations can be made here[20] to OurCalling, which manages the convention center. Fort Worth has opened the Fort Worth Convention Center as an overnight shelter with cots. The city has also opened four warming centers from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, but they do not have snacks or cots available. People in Fort Worth can call the non-emergency line at 817-392-1234 for directions to one of the city's warming centers and help seeking transportation. More details can be found here[21].

Unlike previous groups, many Venezuelans lack strong family connections in the U.S. or sponsors able to help them financially.

Greg Abbott[9]'s order banning COVID-19 restrictions; people experiencing homelessness in Austin[10]; and the decision by the University of Texas at Austin to leave the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference[11]. <br/><br/> Most of the Tribune fellowships are in Austin; one reporting fellow is typically based in Washington, D.C.<br/> Over the years, Tribune fellows have gone on to exciting jobs and fellowships at news organizations across the nation including Politico, The Dallas Morning News, Texas Public Radio, The New York Times, The Sacramento Bee, Bloomberg News and The Washington Post. And a number of Texas Tribune staffers — including Bobby Blanchard, Eddie Gaspar, Emily Goldstein, Malú Gonzlez, Regina Mack, Cassi Pollock, Alexa Ura, Reese Oxner and Allyson Waller — first joined us through the fellowship program. <br/> The Tribune's paid fellowship program[12] is part time in the spring and fall and full time in the summer. We pair each student with a mentor and design workshops for them on topics like investigative reporting and Texas politics. We'll add information to this page in the fall about how to apply for the 2022 program. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> From left: Jorge Barrueta, Neelam Bohra, Michael Gonzalez and Kalley Huang.  <br/><br/><br/><br/> Jorge Barrueta, a senior studying computer science at St. Edward's University, is an engineering fellow.

Now Chicago. </p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Officials from Texas and Arizona have been sending <url normalizedValue=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/11/texas-nyc-mayor-buses-migrants-big-apple/10295802002/"">busloads of asylum seekers</url> to those cities to the east for months. On Wednesday, Chicago joined New York and Washington when the first busloads of migrants from Texas arrived there. </p><p nitf:lede=""true"">""President Biden's inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans --- and Americans -- at risk and is overwhelming our communities,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a <url normalizedValue=""https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-first-bus-of-migrants-arrives-in-chicago"">statement</url> late Wednesday. ""To continue providing much-needed relief to our small, overrun border towns, Chicago will join fellow sanctuary cities Washington, D.C. and New York City as an additional drop-off location."" </p><p nitf:lede=""true"">In a statement, Ryan Johnson, spokesman for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, said Abbott is ""without shame or humanity"" for busing in asylum-seekers but welcomed the migrants. ""As a city, we are doing everything we can to ensure these immigrants and their families can receive shelter, food and most importantly protection,"" it said. </p><p>The migrant families don't always have contacts in the cities and wind up sleeping in bus stations, park benches, homeless shelters and hotels, according to immigrant advocates. Their numbers – from Venezuela, Colombia, Africa and elsewhere – are rising at such alarming rates that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser last month requested a National Guard deployment to help receive them. </p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/11/USAT/8894d014-6c90-44b4-856d-fb0985f04d3b-AFP_AFP_32GC9NE.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><p>The <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-mayors-request-for-national-guard-to-help-with-migrants-denied-by-dept-of-defense/3126302/"">Pentagon denied the request</url> but Bowser’s appeal for help underscores the growing tension of what many call a political battle between clashing parties: Republican governors from Texas and Arizona busing asylum-seekers from the U.S.-Mexico border to Democrat-led cities.</p><p>The busing efforts also reveal a disconnect in how states describe their intention: State governors say the destination cities are targeted because of their ""sanctuary city"" policies, while also saying the bus rides are voluntary and migrants choose where they want to go.</p><p>Advocates say this is sowing uncertainty and raises concerns that states are disrupting the asylum process. </p><p>""It's creating unnecessary confusion and leaving the asylum-seekers in a really vulnerable place,"" said Kennji Kizuka, associate director for research &amp; analysis for refugee protection at New York-based Human Rights First. ""And it's all for political show.""</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">More: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/24/mexico-southern-border-title-42-mpp-asylum-delays/7864233001/"">End of Trump-era policy rejoiced by advocates, but here's why the border is still clogged</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">How many asylum-seekers have been bused from the border to New York and Washington? </emphasis></h><p>Nearly 11,000 migrants have been bused from both states to New York and Washington, according to the governor's offices of each state. Texas has shipped over 7,500 to Washington and more than 1,800 to New York City since April. Arizona has bused more than 1,500 just to Washington. </p><p>Two buses filled with around 60 asylum-seekers, mostly from Venezuela, arrived in Chicago late Wednesday. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Who are the asylum-seekers? </emphasis></h><p>Those arriving in New York from Texas have been overwhelmingly Venezuelan, though many Colombians and some Africans are also arriving, said Camille Mackler,founder and executive director of the Immigrant Advocates Response Collaborative, a New York-based coalition of attorneys and legal groups, who has interacted with the migrants.</p><p>Those taking the 40-hour bus ride from Yuma, Arizona, to Washington have been from Colombia (55%), Peru (16%) and Venezuela (13%), as well as Cuba and other countries, said C.J. Karamargin, spokesman to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. </p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/11/USAT/7ba1150e-24f9-4ff7-87af-2abaee34ff90-AFP_AFP_32GC9NH.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Is it legal for a state to bus asylum-seekers from the Southwest border to other U.S. cities? </emphasis></h><p>Yes – if migrants are takingthe bus rides voluntarily, said Denise Gilman, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin. The migrants from Texas have arrived in the Northeast cities with signed releases stating they are, in fact, agreeing to the rides. </p><p>But Gilman said some of the asylum-seekers may have been directed to sign and take the bus or may not have understood what they were getting into. Texas officials have not revealed exactly how the migrants end up on the buses, she said. </p><p>In a statement, Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze said: “These migrants willingly chose to go to New York City or our nation’s capital, having signed a voluntary consent waiver available in multiple languages, upon boarding that they agreed on the destination. Migrants are allowed to disembark at any of these stops, as they have been processed and released by the federal government.”</p><p>In Arizona, when migrants cross between ports of entry and are picked up by Border Patrol, they're processed by the federal agency, then released to a nongovernmental organization in Yuma, where they're offered bus rides, Karamargin said. Most of the migrants want to go to either New York, New Jersey, or Florida – but all are bused to Washington, he said.</p><p>""Washington is the source of this problem,"" Karamargin said. ""That's where we’re taking these migrants.""</p><p>The bus rides call into question the states' role in immigration enforcement and processing – a task assigned to the federal government under the U.S. Constitution and something for which Texas has been repeatedly criticized since launching Operation Lone Star last year, Gilman said.</p><p>Under that operation, Abbott deployed hundreds of National Guardsmen and state troopers to the border to arrest migrants who slip past Border Patrol. Critics have complained that it's led to racial profiling and other civil rights violations.</p><p>The Texas bus rides are an extension of that operation, Gilman said. ""We need the federal government, who should have control over immigration, to re-exert its control,"" she said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/11/USAT/f3ee1fa0-6a84-414c-8ad9-099d93b74033-AFP_AFP_32GC9XK.jpg"">Link to Image</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Why are Texas and Arizona busing migrants away from the border? </emphasis></h><p>Abbott has criticized first President Joe Biden for what he calls lax border policies, then New York City Mayor Eric Adams for claiming that New York was a ""sanctuary city"" where migrants should feel safe.</p><p>On Wednesday, he took aim at Lightfoot.</p><p>""Mayor Lightfoot loves to tout the responsibility of her city to welcome all regardless of legal status, and I look forward to seeing this responsibility in action as these migrants receive resources from a sanctuary city with the capacity to serve them,"" he said in a statement.  </p><p>In Arizona, busing migrants from Yuma to Washington spares the small border community from dealing with a steady crush of migrants released from federal custody but also sends a message to the White House, Karamargin said. </p><p>""It is partially a statement,"" he said. ""Arizona will not stand by and do nothing while a border security and humanitarian crisis plays out in our community."" </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">How much do the bus rides cost and who's paying for them? </emphasis></h><p>Texas's migrant busing program has <url normalizedValue=""https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2022/08/30/gov-greg-abbott-migrant-busing-program-immigration/65463574007/"">cost $12 million</url> since it began, or an average of about $1,300 per person per ride to the East Coast destinations, according to the El Paso Times. </p><p>Arizona has paid more than $3.5 million to take 1,574 asylum-seekers on 43 bus rides so far, according to Ducey's office. That comes out to about $2,200 per person per ride. </p><p>State taxpayers foot the bills. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">Are the bus rides disrupting the migrants' asylum claims process? </emphasis></h><p>Immigrant advocates and attorneys said it's hard to tell because of the lack of information so far arising about how the migrants get to the buses.</p><p>Karamargin said the migrants leaving from Yuma have agreed to be bused to Washington and will likely have an immigration court date in their final destination, whether it's Washington, New York, or some other place. </p><p>But Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center, which has provided services to the migrants, said around 10% of the migrants arriving in Washington don't have any contact in the U.S. Some of the addresses on their paperwork were scribbled in by Border Patrol agents.</p><p>Nuñez said some of the migrants didn't want to be in Washington and his organization coordinated transportation for them back to Texas. As a whole, Arizona buses have been better coordinated than the Texas ones, which often arrive with little or no notice, he said.</p><p>""If Texas wants to continue doing (bus rides) in a coordinated way, it’s a win-win,"" Nuñez said. ""But the way they're approaching it is really detrimental."" </p><p>Most of the migrants he's dealt with have been paroled into the United States, meaning they usually have 90 days to apply for asylum and need to check in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at their final destination, he said. But the destination listed on their paperwork is often not Washington, creating a hurdle for the asylum-seeker, Nuñez said. </p><p>Many of the migrants bused to New York City from Texas also didn't know anyone there and were forced to navigate the city and the complex immigration procedure on their own, Mackler said.</p><p>Those without a place to go were taken to city homeless shelters but some promptly left and ended up on park benches, she said. Others were continuing to Chicago, Georgia and other destinations. Without a good address for them, immigration officials will have a tough time tracking them and they may miss court appearances or mandatory check-ins, Mackler said. </p><p>And with New York's immigration backlog, it often takes more than 1½ years for qualifying asylum seekers to receive permission to work, she said. </p><p>""They arrive here and they have no place to go,"" Mackler said. ""They have no phones, no access to the internet, don’t speak English. We really don’t know how this is going to play out.""</p><p>Nuñez said Abbott's plan could backfire: He expects the number of migrants crossing into Texas to grow. </p><p>""Everybody in Venezuela now knows: If you cross in Texas, you get a free bus ride.""</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Follow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""it"">This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/02/texas-arizona-busing-migrants-to-other-us-cities/7949381001/"">Texas, Arizona bus migrants to U.S. cities, and now Chicago.

Now, the Atlanta mayor has a message for America. He's my guest.</p><p>Let's go OUTFRONT.</p><p>Good evening. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Erin Burnett.</p><p>OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news. Trump's fake electors cut a deal. Eight Republican fake electors from Georgia who were central in attempts to overturn the 2020 election have just been granted immunity. Striking that deal with Fulton County's district attorney Fani Willis who has said she could file criminal charges against former President Trump and his allies as early as this summer.</p><p>Georgia is ground zero for investigators when it comes to Trump's election schemes. And all of this could put Trump himself in more jeopardy, legal jeopardy. This major development comes as Trump's videotaped deposition in E. Jean Carroll's rape and defamation case against him has just been released.</p><p>Under oath, Trump was combative, and his attacks were personal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT: He's accusing me of rape, of raping her. The worst thing you can do, the worst charge. It's a big fat hoax. She's a liar and she's a sick person in my opinion, really sick. Something wrong with her.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: The president also pressed about his infamous comments from that ""Access Hollywood"" tape where he talked about having the right to grope women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, historically, that's true with stars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's true with stars that they can grab women by the pussy?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, that's -- if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true, not always, but largely true, unfortunately, or fortunately.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you consider yourself to be a star?</p><p>TRUMP: I think you can say that, yeah.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: Unfortunately or fortunately.</p><p>The jury heard this deposition yesterday, and now the question, will Trump take the stand and go before that jury. The judge in the case is giving the former president a deadline of 5:00 p.m. on Sunday to make up his mind on whether he'll testify.</p><p>We have reporters covering both stories tonight. I want to start with Sara Murray.</p><p>Sara, you have been covering the case in Georgia. What else do we know about these immunity deals and what it could mean for Trump?</p><p>SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we learned from a court filing today that eight of these Republican fake electors in the state of Georgia, at least of them, had accepted these immunity deals in exchange for sharing information with prosecutors. And this is significant because previously the district attorney in this case had told all 16 Republican fake electors that they were targets as part of her investigation. As you can imagine, Pam, that made it difficult to get any testimony from them.</p><p>And, so in, cutting these deals, she is able to get insight into a key area of her investigation into election interference in Georgia. And that's, of course, the fake elector probe, the effort to put forward these fake slates of Republican Trump electors to block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.</p><p>Now, the district attorney had previously said that these electors were flipping on each other or incriminating each other. One of the lawyers involved in this insists they are not. But, again, this is more information for the district attorney to weigh to consider as she decides who to bring charges against in this case.</p><p>She has said she's going to make her announcement about who if anyone will be facing charges between July and September. We've been told part of what was influencing that time line to try to get these cooperators and sift through whatever information they could provide. You know, she's been looking at potential conspiracy charges, potential racketeering charges, and as part of that, you really want to look at how all of this information fits together.</p><p>So what do these folks know about who is directing this effort in Georgia, who might've been directing it from the Trump campaign's point of view, what did potentially Donald Trump know about this effort? And she's going to try to piece all of that together in deciding who to bring charges against.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, this immunity key development in this case. Sara, thanks so much.</p><p>And this is coming just hours after the release of Trump's nearly hour-long deposition in the civil rape and defamation case.</p><p>[19:05:02]</p><p>That's another case where he appears to be vulnerable.</p><p>Paula Reid is OUTFRONT with more on the highly combative and hostile deposition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: She's accusing me of rape, a woman that I have no idea who she is.</p><p>PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Brand-new video released showing former President Donald Trump being grilled for nearly an hour in the civil battery and defamation case that writer E. Jean Carroll brought against him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What you're saying there is -- Ms. Carroll fabricated her claim that you sexually assaulted her, correct?</p><p>TRUMP: Yes. Totally, 100 percent.</p><p>REID: The tape coming out in evidence during a weeks-long trial all centered around Carroll's allegation that Trump forced himself on her in a New York department store in the 1990s, a claim Trump has denied both in public and during his deposition under oath in October of last year.</p><p>TRUMP: She said that I did something to her that never took place. I will tell you I made that statement, and I said, well, it's politically incorrect, she's not my type. And that's 100 percent true, she's not my type.</p><p>REID: Trump at times getting combative with Carroll's lawyers questioning him. TRUMP: The worst thing you can do, the worst charge, and you know it's not true, too, you're a political operative also. You're a disgrace.</p><p>REID: At one point, Trump confusing Carroll for his ex-wife in a 1980s photo with him in it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You say Marla's in the photo?</p><p>TRUMP: That's Marla, yeah, that's my wife.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Which woman are you pointing to?</p><p>TRUMP: Here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The person you just pointed to was E. Jean Carroll.</p><p>REID: This was the only time the jury in the trial heard from Trump, as there's now no plan for him to testify, and closing arguments are expected early next week.</p><p>Carroll took the stand early in the trial, telling the jury, I'm here because Donald Trump raped me. And when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I'm here to try to get my life back.</p><p>Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina, known for his brash and sometimes confrontational style defending clients pressed Carroll on her allegations. Using your own words, the facts you have alleged in this story, you have alleged here are odd, Tacopina said. Carroll responded, certain parts of this story are difficult to conceive of. Yes.</p><p>Tacopina pressed Carroll on why she wasn't making a scene during the alleged assault. I'm not a screamer. I was too much in panic to scream. You can't beat up on me for not screaming. Tacopina shot back, I'm not beating you up, I'm asking you questions, Ms. Carroll.</p><p>Through tears, Carroll asserted, I'm telling you he raped me, whether I screamed or not. I don't need an excuse for not screaming.</p><p>(END VIDETAPE)</p><p>REID (on camera): One of the lawyers on one of Trump's criminal cases said he would prefer that Trump not get on the stand in this case as he's concerned about how he could potentially open himself up to further legal jeopardy. Now, the jury is expected to start deliberations after closing arguments wrap up early next week -- Pam.</p><p>BROWN: All right. Paula, thanks so much.</p><p>OUTFRONT now, Ryan Goodman, former special counsel at the Defense Department.</p><p>So, a lot to talk about on this Friday night, Ryan. Let's start with Georgia. How significant is it that at least eight of these fake electors for Donald Trump have accepted these immunity deals?</p><p>RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: It's very significant. The district attorney seems to have a multipronged criminal investigation, but one of those prongs is about the fake electors, these individuals who try to sign these documents claiming that they were the rightful electors in the state that Joe Biden had won, and that also seems to be a part of the federal criminal investigation.</p><p>But here, she's got eight people who are now fully cooperating. They could be people who had given narrative to the jury if there's an indictment, explaining what happened on the inside. And she gets them on her side so that she can work her way up the chain of command.</p><p>Who is up that chain of command? Just based on the January 6th Select Committee's report, Rudy Giuliani is running the fake electors scheme. Mark Meadows has his hands fully deep in it, according to Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony that only came out in the final report. He has charts of all the fake electors. He's making dozens of phone calls and meetings about it.</p><p>And Donald Trump does not keep his hands clean. He actually has a phone conversation with the head of the RNC getting the RNC to organize the fake electors. So I think that's what's very significant in the case because it might very well mean she can break with these individuals into the upper echelon of the scheme that she's looking into.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, and the fact that there's eight she can corroborate their stories, align their stories. So it seems significant.</p><p>I want to turn now to Trump's deposition. Let's replay that moment where Donald Trump confuses a photo of his accuser, E. Jean Carroll there on the left, with his second wife Marla Maples.</p><p>[19:10:07]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don't even know who the woman -- let's see, I don't know who -- it's Marla.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You say Marla's in this photo?</p><p>TRUMP: That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Which woman are you pointing to?</p><p>TRUMP: Here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The person you just pointed to was E. Jean Carroll.</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, I see. Who is that person?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And the woman on the right is your then-wife Ivana.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know, this was the picture.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: So, he thought his accuser here E. Jean Carroll was actually his ex-wife, which is notable, Ryan, because he had said throughout his deposition that he was -- would never be attracted to E. Jean Carroll.</p><p>So, does this just completely undercut his case, one would think he'd be attracted to his ex-wife, right?</p><p>GOODMAN: Yes. And you think his ex-wife would be his type, since he married her. There's so many damning parts of the deposition. I must imagine his defense counsel don't like it from so many different angles.</p><p>On this particular episode, absolutely, it goes to the heart of what he's been saying, not my type. Obviously, he's failing to distinguish E. Jean Carroll from his own wife, suggests it would be his type.</p><p>Second, it also goes to the real theory behind the case that this is an act of rape from a misogynist. He's finding two women indistinguishable, can't even extinguish his wife from the accuser in the case. It goes to the misogyny of the actual argument that he wouldn't have raped her because she wasn't his type, which is grotesque, because if she was his type, he would?</p><p>And a certain -- other point in the deposition, she says of the female lawyer for E. Jean Carroll, that she's not his type. And the jury will see the entire deposition. So, just a remarkable set of moments to witness and now the entire American public gets to see this as well.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, he got very, very personal several times throughout it.</p><p>I want to turn to other reporting coming in tonight from our Paula Reid. She is reporting that Hunter Biden, the president's son, is taking a more aggressive legal strategy as he faces possible charges for alleged tax and gun crimes. He hired famed defense attorney Abbe Lowell. He represented Jared Kushner. He's been around D.C. a long time. The strategy caused, we're told, anxiety at the White House.</p><p>What does it tell you about how serious the case against Hunter Biden may be?</p><p>GOODMAN: So it sounds as though this is because Hunter Biden's team thinks that the case is maybe not as serious against them, that they feel emboldened. So the CNN report says in fact they decided to launch into this approach after months had gone by in which there was no movement in the case. And that the charges, if they are boiling down to tax crimes and the gun related crime rather than something that could have been gigantic in terms of money laundering, that might be the other reason that it's emboldening them, sort of --</p><p>BROWN: Can I just quickly ask you a question because we're running out of time?</p><p>GOODMAN: Yeah.</p><p>BROWN: If it was just about -- and there's a lot we don't know -- but if it was just about the tax and the gun crime, and this has been going on for months and months and months, wouldn't that already be brought?</p><p>GOODMAN: You would have thought -- I would have thought that they would have made a decision one way or the other by this time because they have had all the information and they've been sitting on the information. And as the defense attorneys knew as well that there had been no movement for months, there's something odd in that. And we've had reports from ""The Washington Post"" and also in the CNN report that there's an IRS agent that has been worried about the fact that there is not more movement.</p><p>The so-called whistle-blower, who might be a whistleblower, has actually said that they think that there's been politicization because the case is not bigger than it otherwise is. So that is consistent with this emboldened approach on Hunter Biden's part.</p><p>BROWN: All right. Ryan Goodman, thanks so much. Again, good to see you.</p><p>And OUTFRONT next, an ultimatum from Putin's private army. The head of the Wagner group demanding ammunition, or he is threatening to pull out of Bakhmut. We are live in Ukraine.</p><p>Plus, demands for answers as another day passes without an arrest in the New York subway chokehold death.</p><p>And people lining up overnight just hours before King Charles' coronation. We are live in London with Richard Quest.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:18:03]</p><p>BROWN: Tonight, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is lashing out against the Kremlin. The head of Russia's private army is threatening to pull his men out of Bakhmut just as Ukraine prepares to launch its counteroffensive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, CHIEF OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator): My guys will not be taking useless fights in Bakhmut without ammunition. So, on May 10, 2023, we are pulling out of Bakhmut.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: Prigozhin is also vowing to make sure Putin's top defense officials take the fall for the tens of thousands of men killed in what he called a, quote, heavy merciless bloody war.</p><p>And he isn't the only one lashing out. You're looking right here at a summit in Turkey. Just watch as a Russian delegate storms over to the Ukrainian delegate and takes his flag -- wow. The scuffle, of course, nothing compared with the ongoing bloodshed on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p>Nic Robertson is OUTFRONT tonight in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER GROUP (translated): These guys here are Wagner men who died today. The blood is still fresh. Film all of them.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Russia's top mercenary is turning on Moscow again with a vengeance.</p><p>PRIGOZHIN (translated): You **** who aren't giving (us) ammunition, you b****** will in hell have your guts eaten out!</p><p>ROBERTSON: Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin screaming at President Putin's defense minister and army chief of staff, accusing them of killing his troops in Bakhmut by starving them of ammunition.</p><p>PRIGOZHIN (through translator): We are pulling out of Bakhmut. We have only two or so kilometers left to capture out of 45.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Hours later, an ultimatum -- send ammo or he'll pull his troops out of Bakhmut just as they are close to taking it.</p><p>Also troubling for the Kremlin, Prigozhin hired Mikhail Mizintsev as a Wagner deputy commander.</p><p>[19:20:01]</p><p>Until last week, he was Russia's deputy defense minister. It hints at a pending Wagner/Kremlin showdown.</p><p>Ukraine's military spokesman says Bakhmut could be at a turning point if Russia doesn't fix its ammunition supply problem. He also says that Prigozhin cannot afford to continue losing troops at this rate. If he does, the spokesman says, Wagner will be destroyed. Prigozhin, he says, has no option but to pull out.</p><p>Prigozhin's machinations having no impact on the fighting around the devastated city Friday. Both sides still feeding men into the front lines known as Ukraine's meat grinder.</p><p>And the fighting not just on the battlefield. In Turkey, a Russian diplomat rips down the Ukrainian flag and is quickly punched at a parliamentary assembly intended to get both sides to agree to an extension to the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal.</p><p>Russia's diplomats also hitting out at the United States. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov announcing the U.S. and Russia are on the verge of open-armed conflict, a further escalation of recent unsubstantiated Kremlin rhetoric claiming the United States directed Ukraine to fly drones over the Kremlin in an attempt to assassinate President Putin, an allegation both Kyiv and Washington categorically deny.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): And tonight, there are early indications that perhaps Ukraine's counteroffensive is getting close in the Russian- controlled part of Zaporizhzhia oblast region. The Russian controlled area is beginning to bus civilians out of towns that they say are seeing increased levels of heavy shelling. That is an area where Russia is concerned about the possibility of a counteroffensive, and busing people out is exactly what the Russians did in Kherson last year just before the Ukrainians advanced in that area -- many of those civilians ending up being taken to Russia.</p><p>BROWN: Nic Robertson, thank you so much. That is telling.</p><p>OUTFRONT now, former director of national intelligence and retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General James Clapper.</p><p>So, you just heard this ultimatum issued by Wagner boss Prigozhin, send ammunition or he is withdrawing his troops from Bakhmut by May 10th.</p><p>Does this surprise you that a private army would issue an ultimatum like this to the actual military in Russia?</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLLIGENCE: Well, Pamela, to me, this is emblematic of the disarray of this whole operation. Here you have a private army not responsible or responsive necessarily to the Russian minister of defense, laying down an ultimatum to pull out unless he gets appropriate allocation of ammunition. You can sympathize with him.</p><p>But, to me, this is so characteristic of disarray here where one of the most effective fighting forces, and this is a relative term, a relative characterization of Russia is a private army. It's not even the official armed forces of Russia.</p><p>So, for him to do this and do it publicly, I suspect this sort of thing has been bubbling up privately for some time. But for him to do it publicly is a pretty bold thing. I would think he will avoid going above a second story in any building and stay away from windows. So it's quite remarkable that he would speak publicly and so critically.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, he used, he was a key Putin ally, right? And for him to speak publicly like this criticizing Russia, it really is striking. And it makes you wonder whether Putin could win this war without the help of Wagner troops. What do you think?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I think he's in a bad place anyway in terms of winning the war. There are many that think he's already lost it. There's a shortfall in manpower, whether they're a private army like the Wagner group, or the Russian military. They are just going to run out of people, manpower, at the rate they are killing their own troops by subjecting them to essentially a meat grinder.</p><p>So, this -- it's just, again, so emblematic of the whole -- of the failure of the whole Russian effort.</p><p>BROWN: And then there are these mysterious drone attacks on the Kremlin.</p><p>[19:25:03]</p><p>And I spoke yesterday with an exiled Russian lawmaker who told me that the drones were the work of Russian partisans. He says he knows them and he has spoken directly with them.</p><p>Here's what else he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ILYA PONOMAREV, EXILED RUSSIAN LAWMAKER: What's happening in Moscow for sure it's not Ukrainians. And it's out of range. The reason why antimissile defense of Russia did not intercept those drones were because those drones were launched right next to Moscow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: Do you agree with that assessment that the drones were launched by Russian partisans?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, it's a certainly plausible thesis. But there's another one, I think also, at least as equally plausible. This could have been contrived by the Russian intelligence services intentionally for a variety of purposes as justification for doing something -- more serious against Ukraine to have garnered domestic support, or whatever.</p><p>So, yeah, it could be Russian dissidents, or it could be the Russians themselves as part of a disinformation effort. This is a hall of mirrors kind of thing.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah. But then, you know, you wonder wouldn't this be embarrassing for Putin? Because he prides himself on security and being protected. So, it's certainly still a mystery, but interesting to hear your perspective and your analysis on this.</p><p>Director Clapper, thanks so much.</p><p>CLAPPER: Thanks, Pamela.</p><p>BROWN: OUTFRONT next, calls for action in the case of a man who died while on a New York city subway after being put in a chokehold by another passenger. So far no charges have been filed. But will that change?</p><p>Plus, just hours from King Charles' coronation, thousands making their way to Buckingham Palace as the royal family's very public feud is front and center with Prince Harry arriving for the festivities.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:30:28]</p><p>BROWN: Well, tonight, the father of subway chokehold victim Jordan Neely is demanding answers as another day passes without an arrest in his son's death.</p><p>Andre Zachary told ""The New York Daily News"", quote, I just want something to be done.</p><p>Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness was killed on the subway after another rider put him in a chokehold. Witnesses say he had been acting erratically and yelling at passengers.</p><p>Jason Carroll is OUTFRONT.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More calls for justice as Manhattan's District Attorney Alvin Bragg continues his investigation into the death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely, the man who died after being placed in a chokehold by another passenger on a New York City subway.</p><p>JUMAANE WILLIAMS, NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: There was a homeless man that was talking about his needs. He was choked to death.</p><p>JILLIAN SNIDER, CRIMINAL JUSTICE &amp; CIVIL LIBERTIES POLICY DIR., R STREET INSTITUTE: I don't want to call it vigilantism. I want to say it was an attempt to subdue someone who, yes, was mentally ill.</p><p>CARROLL: The 24-year-old former marine who placed Neely in a chokehold was interviewed by police after the incident and released, according to a law enforcement source. He has hired criminal defense attorney Thomas Kenniff to represent him. Kenniff who lost the race to become New York's district attorney to Bragg, confirmed the former marine is his client, but had no further comment.</p><p>GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D), NEW YORK: I do want to acknowledge how horrific it was to view a video of Jordan Neely being killed for being a passenger on our subway trains. His family deserves justice.</p><p>CARROLL: The passenger who recorded this disturbing video says Neely had been acting erratically before the incident and that he shouted ""I don't care if I die, I don't care if I go to jail, I don't have any food."" But he says he did not see Neely try to attack anyone on the train.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We arrived at the station, the door was open, all the people run away, and the guy stays in this position about eight or -- seven or eight minutes.</p><p>CARROLL: CNN has not been able to independently confirm what happened leading up to the incident, nor how long Neely was restrained. The law firm representing Neely's family released a statement, saying: We have people being killed for ringing the wrong doorbell, pulling in the wrong driveway, and screaming out in desperation on the subway. We cannot let that stand.</p><p>Neely had been a dancer and a Michael Jackson impersonator in Times Square and on New York subways. He had struggled with mental illness and had a history of prior arrests. Family and friends say Neely was deeply impacted by his mother's murder in 2007.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He never got over that. There was a lot of pain inside that was unresolved.</p><p>CARROLL: In a city still struggling with subway crimes and strapped mental health facilities, the circumstances surrounding Neely's death has generated debate among those still trying to understand what happened.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is definitely a blurry line of what is too excessive, what is not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think you can go around putting people in chokeholds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm afraid there's no answers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARROLL (on camera): And, Pamela, right now, a demonstration underway. You can see there are a number of supporters who have gathered here calling for justice for Jordan Neely. We've seen a number of these types of protests pop up over the last the past 36 hours or so.</p><p>The mayor told all of those people who have taken an interest in terms of what has happened there on the subway on Monday to wait for the investigative process to play itself out -- Pamela.</p><p>BROWN: All right. Jason Carroll, thank you for that report from New York.</p><p>And OUTFRONT now, the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, Andre Dickens.</p><p>Mayor Dickens, thanks for your time tonight.</p><p>I know how much you have going on in your own city. There are a lot of issues at play here, right? Homelessness, mental health, crime, public safety. These are all problems that you have dealt with as mayor of a major American city. I'm wondering how do you view this situation?</p><p>MAYOR ANDRE DICKENS (D), ATLANTA: Yeah. You know, as I continue to watch it on the news, you know, my heart goes out to this family of Jordan, and just hope that we never get to the point where this is comfortable in any city in America.</p><p>I trust that Mayor Eric Adams, a very competent and capable leader along with his investigators and team will figure out what the right answers are for this situation. But just know that across this country, we see mental health challenges that are on the rise, homelessness continues to occur because the rising cost of housing, the interest rates are high, inflation is up, and people have more month than money.</p><p>[19:35:11]</p><p>And with substance abuse, mental health challenges, people are finding themselves sleeping on the trains, sleeping in the woods, sleeping on the streets all across America. And we should never get so comfortable with that. And also, just watching chokeholds, the city of Atlanta, our police department, we've banned the use of chokeholds.</p><p>So when I see a citizen using a chokehold, I'm also alarmed. And so, you know -- you know, this is all concerning and alarming across the country. But I trust that the leadership in New York City will bring justice to the situation.</p><p>BROWN: I want to turn to your city now, Atlanta police released audio from a 911 call as a mass shooting unfolded in a hospital on Wednesday, killing one person, injuring four others. I want to play some of it for you. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CALLER: We hear gunshots in the hall. One of the doctors says he thinks he sees -- he thinks he sees someone on the floor by the elevators on the 11th floor, but it's definitely loud.</p><p>911 DISPATCHER: Are they still shooting?</p><p>CALLER: We don't -- they're not shooting at this moment, but there were several shots that we heard.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: My colleague Jake Tapper talked with a Georgia lawmaker who was right next door to that shooting. He said he was, quote, overwhelmed that this is how people are expected to live now.</p><p>Do you accept this as the new normal?</p><p>DICKENS: Absolutely not. This can not be the new normal. And we must do all we can to continue to make sure that guns are not in the hands of individuals that pose a risk.</p><p>I actually know that State Senator Josh, he and I are friends. And I had so many calls and text messages from members of the community that were saying, you know, thanks for the shelter in place, what's next, what's happening? People were scared.</p><p>And, you know, at the end of the day, the suspect was brought to justice and caught between the good collaboration of Atlanta police department and Cobb County and Fulton County and along with the outstanding work by Grady Hospital to help get those people on the mend, the four women that were shot. And, unfortunately, we lost one life, a wonderful person, Amy St. Pierre. And so this tragedy has come to our city this week. But as we've known, it was in Nashville, it was in Louisville. And there's almost 200 mass shootings in this country, and we're only in may this year.</p><p>BROWN: You say, you know, this can not be the new normal. But the reality is it's happening to cities all across America. No one is immune.</p><p>Are we just tolerating it as a way of life in America? I mean, is that what's happening now?</p><p>DICKENS: Unfortunately, our legislative actions are tolerating it. And so what we need to do is reverse that. We need to put real sensible common sense gun laws to work. We know which ones work in major cities and states.</p><p>And, so, we are now calling on the state. We're calling on the federal leadership and legislative bodies in leadership to make changes. We know the common sense gun laws that we should have.</p><p>Universal background checks should be just adopted and established as a norm. We should not allow convicted felons to have the ability to buy guns and violent misdemeanors. Anyone that's mentally unstable, we should disallow them to have access to guns as well.</p><p>So we need to make sure that we look at how mental health and gun access are tied together that are now leading to mass shootings across our country.</p><p>BROWN: Mayor Dickens, thank you for your time tonight.</p><p>DICKENS: Thank you very much.</p><p>BROWN: And OUTFRONT next, live pictures from Buckingham Palace where the coronation of King Charles III is set to begin in just hours. We're going to take you live to London. We have Richard Quest standing by.</p><p>Plus, a new warning tonight from the secretary of homeland security about America's southern border now that a Trump-era policy is about to expire.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:42:52]</p><p>BROWN: Tonight, you're looking at live pictures of Buckingham Palace ahead of King Charles' coronation in just a few hours.</p><p>In London tonight, people are sleeping in the streets. They are camped out for a front row seat. Thousands will be in attendance. But the guest who is perhaps getting the most attention is Prince Harry who is attending alone in the midst of very public family tensions.</p><p>Bianca Nobilo is OUTFRONT.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hours away from being crowned king of England, a royal PR offensive by father and his son.</p><p>His other child, the prodigal son Prince Harry, the centerpiece of years of royal scandal, set to attend his father's coronation Saturday. But his wife Meghan staying behind in California.</p><p>Just months ago, even Harry's presence was uncertain, revealing the breakdown in family relationships in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>PRINCE HARRY: The relationship is space at the moment.</p><p>NOBILO: But Harry will attend the ceremony here at Westminster Abbey.</p><p>But his appearance on Buckingham Palace's balcony with his family still far from certain. His ties to the family tormented by a violent rift with his brother, detailed in a Netflix docuseries.</p><p>PRINCE HARRY: It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me and my father say things that just simply weren't true.</p><p>NOBILO: And what he felt was his family's inability to accept Meghan as his wife.</p><p>REPORTER: Can you just let me know, is the royal family a racist family, sir?</p><p>PRINCE WILLIAM: No, we're very much not a racist family.</p><p>NOBILO: January saw the release of Harry's memoir, a deeply intimate portrait of a young man trapped between the sharp flash of media attention and his struggle as the spare to his brother's heir to the throne.</p><p>The book an embarrassing moment for the royal family, the inner dynamics of a secretive institution and a private family laid bare for all to read.</p><p>This weekend, it's Harry's honesty about his stepmother Camilla, queen of England, that may sting the most.</p><p>[19:45:01]</p><p>He recalled begging his father not to marry Camilla, fueled by suspicions of their adultery and fears that she would be a wicked stepmother.</p><p>As a child, he wrote: We sensed the presence of the other woman because we suffered the downstream effects.</p><p>A year of continued upheaval for the royal family, seismic for the crown, personal for the prince as he wrote in his book: granny was gone, pa was king.</p><p>Bianca Nobilo, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BROWN: And Richard Quest is OUTFRONT now live from London with more. So, Richard, Britain hasn't witnessed the coronation of a monarch since Queen Elizabeth 70 years ago.</p><p>For those here in the United States, tell us about why this is such a big deal, the anticipation, and what we can expect to see tomorrow.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR, ""QUEST MEANS BUSINESS"": What you can expect to see, let's start with the easy bit, if we may. What you can expect to see is a pageantry of pomp, of circumstance the like of which you won't see anywhere else, as the prime minister put it. Nobody does it quite like the Brits on this sort of occasion.</p><p>There will be thousands of soldiers and hundreds of horses, two gold coach, state coach, crowns up the wazoo. You have the imperial state crown, you have the Queen Mary crown. So there's going to be a huge amount of pageantry for us to enjoy.</p><p>But underneath it will be this very solemn moment where the king, King Charles, basically pledges his life of service to God, the allegiance, the sacred moment, and, at the same time, he is then installed as -- he's already the king, but it's sort of, if you like, made official signed, sealed and delivered.</p><p>BROWN: So, there's been this uproar over the bishop of Canterbury's office to pledge an oath of loyalty and allegiance to King Charles tomorrow.</p><p>King Charles' friend had this to say about that request.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN DIMBLEBY, CLOSE FRIEND TO THE KING: I can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent. He's never wanted to be revered. He's never wanted to have anyone pay homage except in mock terms as a joke.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: So now there's an update we're learning. Tell us about it.</p><p>QUEST: Yes. Well, forgive me for look down at my phone because it has just come out. We've now got the embargo is lifted on the order of service. Now, instead of asking people outside in the country and ordinary people to say I swear I'll pay true allegiance to your majesty, blah, blah, blah, heirs, and so on, now the archbishop is going to say. I now invite those who wish to offer their support to do so with the moment of reflection and joining in by saying ""God save King Charles"".</p><p>So, if you've got the words in front of you, I guess you can say it. But it's quite a big change. It's a small change and a big effect because, essentially, it's been such an uproar that they've watered it down, to put it bluntly.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, quite the scale back there in the language.</p><p>All right. Richard Quest, thanks so much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>BROWN: Have fun tomorrow.</p><p>And Anderson Cooper is live in London with all the pomp and circumstance as the world waits for the first British coronation in 70 years. That's coming up next on ""AC360.""</p><p>OUTFRONT next, we are live in the southern border. A new warning tonight as tens of thousands of migrants eagerly await the end of a Trump-era policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, DHS SECRETARY: I think that there is no question that this is going to be extremely challenging.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: Plus, a CNN investigation into claims made by thousands of men and women that a certain type of baby powder gave them cancer. More on that after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:52:17]</p><p>BROWN: New tonight, a warning from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, calling what the U.S. is about to encounter at the border, quote, extremely challenge, and it come as the pandemic era policy known as Title 42, which border officials used more than 3 million times to expel migrants from the U.S., is about to expire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYORKAS: I think that there is no question that this is going to be extremely challenging. I do not want to understate the severity of the challenge that we expect to encounter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: And as our next guest has seen firsthand, there is already a massive surge of migrants at the southern border.</p><p>So, OUTFRONT now is Lauren Villagran who is a border reporter for ""The El Paso Times"".</p><p>Lauren, just how much of a buildup are a seeing right now at the border? LAUREN VILLAGRAN, BORDER REPORTER, EL PASO TIMES: You know, migrants are not waiting for May 11th and the end of Title 42. We are seeing hundreds if not thousands of migrants amassing at the southern border here in El Paso or crossing illegally through holes in flood gates in the border fence. What we're seeing here in El Paso is already a humanitarian crisis.</p><p>BROWN: And we're seeing right now, there are pictures up we're showing from your latest reporting showing the number of migrants rushing across the border highway. They're in El Paso, after crossing the border wall. Just how dangerous has this gotten for migrants as well as the drivers?</p><p>VILLAGRAN: You know, there seems to be a lot of frustration with the CBP 1 app and people are not waiting to be processed. They are trying to sneak across the border in some cases, and here in El Paso, we have a border highway. It's six lanes. It runs along the U.S./Mexico border fence.</p><p>And, you know, just yesterday, I was out with the El Paso times team, and 20 people ran across in front of the vehicle. We stopped and border patrol apprehended about 20 migrants.</p><p>You know, some people are trying to seek asylum, but they're not waiting to turn themselves in. As border patrol prepares to process migrants under the nation's title 8 immigration law, you know, you're going to see consequences for illegal crossing that you're not seeing right now. So things are about to change, and the tensions are building.</p><p>BROWN: Because what that does is crack down on recidivism, right? So for them to keep -- they'll be charges when they come back each time, correct?</p><p>VILLAGRAN: Yeah, I mean, that's the way Title 42 played out. It's been a revolving door where people can cross unlawfully and very quickly be sent back to Mexico and they try to cross again.</p><p>[19:55:07]</p><p>You know, next week when the border patrol starts processing people under Title 8, they could face civil penalty penalties, a five-year ban on returning or even criminal prosecution.</p><p>BROWN: Yeah, which is just stunning. Your reporting is so important, Lauren, to help us understand what is unfolding there in El Paso right there at the border. Thank you for coming on and sharing it with us. We appreciate it, Lauren Villagran.</p><p>VILLAGRAN: Thank you.</p><p>BROWN: OUTFRONT next, a CNN investigation into the claims a certain type of baby powder gave people cancer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BROWN: Finally tonight, a stunning accusation. Thousands of men and women claim a certain type of baby powder made by Johnson &amp; Johnson gave them cancer. I investigated for CNN's new show, ""THE WHOLE STORY"" over these last few month, and here's a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was starting to feel like I wanted to have kids, so I saw a doctor, and she told me, yeah, we should do your follicle count. And the next day, I got the results that just said, yeah, your count is fine, but you have malignant masses.</p><p>I just never imagined that something that you would use on babies was unsafe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: And I spoke to an attorney for Johnson &amp; Johnson as part of my reporting. The company says it has investigated this with, quote, the very best testing and laboratories, adding it found, quote, there's no confirmed finding of asbestos. That asbestos is not in our product and that our product doesn't cause cancer.</p><p>So, be sure to watch my full special report, this investigation on ""THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER"". That's this Sunday night at 8:00 p.m. Eastern and 5:00 Pacific.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>""AC360"" starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">CNNTRN-2023050501CNV31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:685M-8TJ1-F072-X508-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2023-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""6876""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=""05"" month=""05"" year=""2023""><dateText>May 5, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""typeofdoc""><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Georgia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>E.

INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE<br/><br/> V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY<br/><br/> VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES<br/><br/> FOREWORD<br/><br/> The human rights situation in the United States, which has notorious records, worsened in 2021. Political manipulation led to a sharp surge in COVID-19 deaths; Shooting deaths hit a new record; Fake democracy trampled on people's political rights; Violent law enforcement made life harder for migrants and refugees; Discrimination against ethnic minority groups, especially Asians, intensified. In the meantime, unilateral U.S. actions created new humanitarian crises across the globe.</p><p><br/><br/> -- The United States has the world's highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with 34.51 million confirmed cases and 480,000 fatalities, which far surpassed the numbers in 2020. Average life expectancy fell by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War.<br/><br/> -- Public security situation in the United States deteriorated and violent crimes remained prevalent. There were 693 mass shootings in 2021, up 10.1 percent from 2020. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence.<br/><br/> -- More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 U.S. states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a ""healthy democracy,"" while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958.<br/><br/> -- Around 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against Asian communities is rising. Hate crimes against Asians in the New York City jumped 361 percent from 2020. Fifty-nine percent of Americans said ethnic minority groups do not have equal job opportunities.<br/><br/> -- In fiscal year 2021, the United States detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, the highest number since 1998, which more than doubled that of the previous fiscal year.<br/><br/> -- A U.S. drone strike during its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children, among which the youngest was only two years old. The United States still held 39 detainees at the Guantanamo prison.<br/><br/> Fernand de Varennes, a special rapporteur on minority issues of the United Nations, said the U.S. legal system of human rights protection is incomplete and outdated, which has led to growing inequality.<br/><br/> As for the U.S. malpractice in creating human rights crises in other countries in the name of human rights, Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, said ""Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world.""<br/><br/> In 2021, the U.S. public persona of ""human rights defender"" was totally debunked as the so-called ""Summit for Democracy"" under the guise of safeguarding human rights became a farce. At the 48th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries blasted the United States for being the ""biggest destroyer"" of human rights in the world and urged the country to address its own severe human rights violations.<br/><br/> I. A HEAVY PRICE FOR U.S. EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL<br/><br/> Despite having world's most advanced medical equipment and technology, the United States has the biggest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths globally. The U.S. government never rethinks its response measures and still lacks effective anti-epidemic plans. Instead, it stoked the origins-tracing of COVID-19, and has been keen on passing the buck, shifting the blame and political manipulation.<br/><br/> Disregard for people's rights to life and health. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other. U.S. politicians focused only on their political gains in disregard of people's lives and health. The federal and local governments went their own way and constrained each other, which has not only made it very difficult to integrate and coordinate the management of medical resources, but also made people disoriented about epidemic prevention and control policies. And thus various anti-intellectual words and deeds that reject science and common sense have become prevalent. Misled by political manipulation, some Americans refused to wear masks, and even launched an anti-vaccine movement, which accelerated the spread of COVID-19. By the end of 2021, nearly 30 percent of Americans still had not been vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that U.S. hospitals were overwhelmed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations caused by infections among the unvaccinated continued to surge. States, local governments and the public ""have now been left out on their own,"" American news website Vox said on Jan. 2, 2021. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, by late February 2022, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States had exceeded 78 million and the death toll surpassed 940,000. Its number of COVID-19 deaths recorded in 2021 has far surpassed the total for 2020. According to the analysis by researchers at the University of Southern California and Princeton University, the deaths caused by COVID-19 have reduced overall life expectancy by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. Life expectancy was estimated to fall by 2.10 years among African Americans and 3.05 years among Latinos, while the decline was 0.68 years among whites. The U.S. government's unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its people's rights to life and health. The New York Times reported on Nov. 18, 2021 that the pandemic has proved to be a nearly two-year stress test that the United States ""flunked,"" and that the American people's trust in their government has been ""bankrupt.""<br/><br/> People's mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. A study published in The Lancet Regional Health -- Americas in October 2021 found 32.8 percent of U.S. adults experienced ""elevated depressive symptoms"" in 2021, compared to 27.8 percent in the early 2020 months of the pandemic and 8.5 percent before the pandemic. According to a public opinion poll, more than a third of Americans aged between 13 and 56 said the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their lives. The poll finds teens and young adults have faced some of the heaviest struggles as they come of age during a time of extreme turmoil, the AP reported on Dec. 6, 2021. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy was cited by The Los Angeles Time as saying on Dec. 9, 2021 that the number of suspected suicide attempts in 2021 was 51 percent higher among adolescent girls compared to the same period in 2019.<br/><br/> The number of the homeless is staggering. The Washington Post reported on Dec. 7, 2021 that ""homelessness is one of the United States' greatest current challenges, no matter the region."" The AP reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that the number of people without permanent shelter in Rhode Island had increased by more than 85 percent since January 2021. According to a report by the group Advocates for Children, more than 100,000 New York City schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the 2020-2021 school year. The total number of homeless students during the school year represented nearly one-tenth of the city's public school system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. The New York Times reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that in San Francisco one of every 100 residents was homeless.<br/><br/> The elderly' rights to life are flagrantly violated. U.S. politicians have followed the natural law of ""selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior,"" declaring that ""the elderly could sacrifice for the country"" and that ""the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly."" The U.S. CDC said that the vast majority of U.S. COVID-19 deaths have been among people aged 65 or older. According to Stat News, an American health-oriented news website, more than half a million elderly people in the United States have died from COVID-19, accounting for four-fifths of all fatalities. According to a report by Claudia Mahler, the United Nations independent expert on older people, on July 21, 2020, discrimination in the delivery of health care services, insufficient prioritization of nursing homes in responses to the virus, and lockdowns left older people more vulnerable to neglect or abuse. And there was ""a significant undercount of nursing home deaths"" in the United States during the pandemic.<br/><br/> Serious damage to the global anti-pandemic cooperation. Washington vigorously pursues ""America First,"" not only withholding anti-epidemic materials from other countries, but also prohibiting the export of domestic medical materials and buying out the production capacity of drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The United States has repeatedly coerced the WHO, interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation.<br/><br/> The United States has engaged in ""vaccine nationalism,"" pushing some underdeveloped countries and regions into a desperate situation of having no vaccines to administer.<br/><br/> Since March 2021, the United States has thrown away at least 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, significantly more than many poor countries have prepared for their whole populations, according to NBC News on Sept. 1, 2021.<br/><br/> ""It's really tragic that we have a situation where vaccines are being wasted while lots of African countries have not had even 5 percent of their populations vaccinated,"" said Sharifah Sekalala, an associate professor of global health law at England's University of Warwick.<br/><br/>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also slammed rich countries over their hoarding of vaccines, adding that ""they are just giving us the crumbs from their table. The greed they demonstrated was disappointing.""<br/><br/> The Biden administration is still pursuing U.S. interests in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the rest of the world, commented an article on the website of the U.S. Foreign Policy magazine.<br/><br/> II. ENTRENCHED VIOLENT THINKING THREATENS LIVES<br/><br/> The United States has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security.<br/><br/> Deterioration of social order has accelerated the proliferation of guns. The United States is the country with the largest number of privately owned guns in the world. The U.S. public have lost confidence in the government's social security governance and felt extremely insecure, which drives many to purchase guns to protect themselves.<br/><br/> The Small Arms Survey (SAS) researchers estimate that Americans own 393 million of the 857 million civilian guns available, which is around 46 percent of the world's civilian gun cache.<br/><br/> There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to the SAS. No other nation has more civilian guns than people.<br/><br/> Everytown for Gun Safety also reported on Dec. 21, 2021 that over 15 million guns were sold through October.<br/><br/> ""Ghost guns,"" which are assembled from parts purchased by individuals online, are even more proliferating.<br/><br/> According to a report by The New York Times website on Nov. 20, 2021, over the past 18 months, ghost guns had accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes.<br/><br/> By the beginning of October last year, the San Diego Police Department had recovered almost 400 ghost guns, about doubling the total for all of 2020 with nearly three months to go in the year.<br/><br/> It also reported that since January 2016, about 25,000 privately made firearms had been confiscated by local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide.<br/><br/> Gun violence seriously endangers people's lives. The United States has the worst gun violence in the world. According to statistics released on Jan. 5, 2022 by the Gun Violence Archive website, the number of fatalities from shootings in the United States rose from 39,558 in 2019 to 43,643 in 2020, and further to 44,816 in 2021. In 2021, there were 693 mass shootings in the United States, up 10.1 percent from 2020.<br/><br/> The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 5, 2021 that children and teens in the United States are 15 times more likely to die from gunfire than their peers in 31 other high-income countries combined, quoting data from the Children's Defense Fund.<br/><br/> At least 30 shootings occurred on U.S. campuses during the school season from Aug. 1 to Sept. 15, 2021, killing at least five people and injuring 23, the highest number on record.<br/><br/> A total of 1,229 teens aged 12 to 17 were killed and 3,373 injured in shootings in the United States in 2021. On Nov. 30, 2021, four students were killed in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school by a 15-year-old suspect who used the same gun that his father bought on Black Friday.<br/><br/>CNN reported on Nov. 26, 2021 that Jason R. Silva, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at William Paterson University, said that the United States is the only developed country where mass shootings have happened every single year for the past 20 years.<br/><br/> Shooting incidents have caused a large number of casualties and posed a major threat to public safety. According to an April 2021 Pew Research Center survey, 48 percent of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in the country today.<br/><br/> Police brutality tramples human life. According to data compiled by Mapping Police Violence, at least 1,124 people died in 2021 due to U.S. police violence. The majority of killings occurred during non-violent offenses or when there was no crime at all.<br/><br/> The USA TODAY website reported on June 21, 2021 that police in the United States fatally shoot about 1,000 people a year. Police have fatally shot more than 6,300 people since 2015, but only 91 officers have been arrested, or just 1 percent of those involved.<br/><br/> The USA TODAY website reported on July 8, 2021 that a poll showed that just 22 percent of Americans believe that the U.S. police treat all Americans equally.<br/><br/> Racial and ethnic groups are often subjected to unfair justice. The USA TODAY website reported on July 15, 2021 that a 20-year-old African-American man in Minnesota, Daunte Wright, was shot and killed by police after being pulled over outside Minneapolis for an expired license plate. Wright's death was one of a string of incidents in which African-Americans were pulled over for traffic violations and killed innocently.<br/><br/> A study of 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina over more than a decade shows that African American drivers are twice as likely as white drivers to be pulled over by police.<br/><br/> The USA TODAY website reported on May 24, 2021 that within a year of the death of George Floyd, who died after an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes, enforcement killed hundreds of people of ethnic minorities in the United States.<br/><br/> According to the report, since the year 2000, there have been over 470 murders at the hands of law enforcement in Minnesota. Only one police officer was convicted in the history of Minnesota and that was a minority man that killed a white woman.<br/><br/> The Christian Science Monitor website reported on Nov. 23, 2021 that the Urban Institute found that homicides with a white perpetrator and a black victim are ten times more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim.<br/><br/> Human rights violations by prison staff are commonplace. The United States has the highest incarceration rate and the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. An Associated Press investigation has found that the U.S. federal Bureau of Prisons is a hotbed of graft, corruption and abuse.<br/><br/> CTV News reported on Nov. 14, 2021 that crimes committed by federal prison staff in the United States are not uncommon. Since 2019, more than 100 U.S. federal prison staff members have been arrested and convicted of sexual abuse, murder and other offenses.<br/><br/> Prisoners held in U.S. private prisons are at risk of being abused. The UN News reported on Feb. 4, 2021 that in 2019, there were about 116,000 U.S. prisoners held in privately operated facilities, representing about 7 percent of all state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners, quoting data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.<br/><br/> On April 20, 2021, nine UN experts, including the UN Human Rights Council Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Older Persons, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Physical and Mental Health, issued a joint statement condemning U.S. human rights violations against Mumia Abu-Jamal, a prisoner of African descent.<br/><br/> The statement said Abu-Jamal, who has been in prison for 40 years, was a social activist and journalist. The 67-year-old suffers from a number of diseases including chronic heart disease, liver cirrhosis and high blood pressure. In February 2021, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. While receiving treatment for heart failure in late February, he was handcuffed to his hospital bed for four days; and when he was hospitalized again in early April for surgery, his family, lawyers and others were denied access to him.<br/><br/> The statement calls on the U.S. government to comply with its international human rights obligations, take urgent measures to protect Abu-Jamal's life and dignity, immediately stop the practice of withholding information, and allow outside visits to monitor his human rights situation.<br/><br/> It also calls on the U.S. government to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of all detainees, especially the elderly and disabled prisoners who are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.<br/><br/> The credibility of the U.S. judicial system is in tatters. According to statistics released by the U.S. National Registry of Exoneration on Jan. 11, 2022, 2,933 people have been wrongly convicted in the United States since 1989, with a combined 25,600 years of wrongly imposed prison sentences. However, 14 U.S. states lack legal provisions related to compensation for wrongful convictions.<br/><br/> The BBC reported on Nov. 23, 2021, that Kevin Strickland, 62, had maintained his innocence since his arrest at the age of 18. He was wrongly convicted of third-degree murder in June 1979, only to be found not guilty in 2021 before being imprisoned for more than 42 years, the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history. But under the state's law, he is unlikely to receive any financial compensation.<br/><br/> The USA Today website reported on July 8, 2021, that a survey showed that only 17 percent of Americans believe the U.S. criminal justice system treats everyone fairly.<br/><br/> III. PLAYING WITH FAKE DEMOCRACY TRAMPLES ON POLITICAL RIGHTS<br/><br/> Political donations bring about transfers of interests after elections, political polarization further intensifies antagonism and division in the U.S. society, and legislation and gerrymander restricting voting eligibility have become tools for parties to suppress the public opinion. The operation of the U.S. political system is moving away from the public will and social demands, the right of the majority of the public to participate in politics is essentially deprived of, and international confidence in the U.S. democratic system continues to decline.<br/><br/> The American-style democracy has descended to a game of transferring interests. Money politics become increasingly rampant in the United States, which makes politicians more neglectful of people's interests and demands.<br/><br/> Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has pointed out that there is a positive correlation between Americans' wealth and their influence on policy-making, and for about 70 percent on the income-wealth scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever and are effectively disenfranchised. Ray La Raja, professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, noted in an article for The Atlantic that America's current system is democratic only in form, not in substance, as the nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists, while many presidential-primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views.<br/><br/> According to The Guardian on Jan. 7, 2021, candidates spent 14 billion U.S. dollars alone on advertising for the 2020 U.S. president election cycle. The U.S. Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) reported on April 15, 2021 that Wall Street executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least 2.9 billion U.S. dollars into political initiatives during the 2020 election cycle. The U.S. media outlet Politico said on Nov. 17, 2021 that a secret-money group ""doled out"" 410 million U.S. dollars in 2020 to the Democratic Party, aiding the latter's efforts to win back control of the Senate.<br/><br/> In the 2020 presidential election, U.S. pharmaceutical companies made huge political donations to both parties, and the Democratic administration, after taking office, invested an enormous sum of money back to the companies involved, with Moderna alone earning profit of nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars. The federal government then funneled interests directly to pharmaceutical companies by purchasing large quantities of COVID-19 vaccines, resulting in massive hoarding and waste of vaccines in the United States. The U.S. government gave pharmaceutical companies a free hand in pricing COVID-19 vaccines, leading to continuous increases in vaccine prices. The Financial Times reported that Pfizer raised the price of its COVID-19 vaccine for the European Union from 15.5 euros to 19.5 euros, and the price of a Moderna jab increased to 25.5 euros from 19 euros. However, the production cost of a Moderna dose is estimated to be less than 3 U.S. dollars.<br/><br/> Political polarization leads to an increasingly divided U.S. society. The election chaos in the United States has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart. On the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, prompted by the incitement and manipulation of extreme politicians, tens of thousands of Americans who rejected the 2020 presidential election result flooded to Washington, D.C., and a large number of demonstrators forced their way into the Capitol building and clashed with police, leaving five dead and more than 140 injured. The constitutional process to affirm the presidential election result was interrupted. A Brookings online article in May 2021 indicated that though all 50 states certified the 2020 election results, 77 percent of Republican voters still questioned the legitimacy of the elected president due to allegations of electoral fraud, a phenomenon that happened for the first time in nearly 100 years.<br/><br/> Changes of government did not reduce or remove the political polarization in the United States. The American people are becoming more incompatible with each other over such issues as pandemic prevention and control, race relations, abortion rights and gun control, while the political struggle between Democrats and Republicans over infrastructure construction, social welfare bills, government debt ceiling and other legislation related to the economy and people's livelihood have become more intense, and the Congress has been nearly dysfunctional. A Republican leader even went so far as to deliver a record 8.5-hour speech in the Congress to block and delay a vote on a Democratic-proposed bill.<br/><br/> The Pew Research Center reported on Oct. 13, 2021 that the United States was regarded as the most politically polarized country in a survey involving 17 advanced economies, as 90 percent of the American respondents said there are at least strong conflicts between those who support different parties, and about six-in-ten thought their fellow citizens disagree not only over policies, but also over basic facts.<br/><br/> Confrontations between political parties restrain and harm electors' right to vote. In order to win elections, Republicans and Democrats used legislation and gerrymander as well as other tactics to aggressively prevent voters who do not favor them from casting a ballot. In 2021, 49 states in the United States introduced more than 420 bills that would restrict voting. These bills either reduced the amount of time voters have to request or mail in a ballot, restricted the availability of drop-off locations, imposed stricter signature requirements for mail-in voting, or enacted new and stricter voter-ID requirements, which made mail-in voting and early voting harder and built barriers for the elderly, disabled, minorities and other groups to exercise their voting rights. NBC News reported on March 8, 2021 that the state of Georgia was pushing dozens of restrictive voting bills targeting African American voters. Voting rights experts and civil rights groups have argued that ""the movement adds up to a national assault that would push voters of color out of the electorate.""<br/><br/> Gerrymander has become a tool to suppress the political influence of minority voters. The Democratic and Republican parties exploit their political clout in each state to increase the chances of winning by redrawing congressional districts, often at the expense of the rights of minorities.<br/><br/>CNBC reported on Aug. 13, 2021 that the practice of redrawing congressional districts often targets voters of color and the gerrymandering in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania alone gave Republicans 16 to 17 more congressional seats. Daily newspaper the Chicago Tribune reported on Sept. 3, 2021 that Illinois' redistricting aimed to keep Democrats in control of the state legislature for at least a decade. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported on Nov. 30, 2021 that the redrawn congressional districts for Ohio give Republicans an unconstitutional partisan advantage, with which the Republicans can anticipate winning 67 percent to 80 percent of the congressional seats -- even though they are only likely to obtain about 55 percent of the vote.<br/><br/> The Los Angeles Times reported on Dec. 8, 2021 that although Texas has seen a significant increase of the number of people of color, its new redistricting plan intentionally diminished the power of Latino and African American voters. Latino Texans make up nearly 40 percent of the population, but just seven of the 38 congressional districts are predominantly Latino. Texas is home to the largest African American population in the country, but not one of the 38 congressional districts in the state is predominantly black. In a survey of the American public on the fairness of congressional districting, only 16 percent of the surveyed thought that congressional districts would be re-drawn fairly in their states.<br/><br/> The international community's confidence in U.S. democracy continues to decline. A national poll of America's 18- to 29-year-olds released on Dec. 1, 2021 by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School showed that only 7 percent of the surveyed viewed the United States as a ""healthy democracy,"" and 52 percent believed that the American democracy is either ""in trouble"" or ""failing."" Data released by the Pew Research Center in May 2021 indicated that the American public trust in the government neared a historic low since 1958, as only 2 percent of Americans said they can trust the U.S. government to do what is right ""just about always,"" and only 22 percent said they can trust the government to do what is right ""most of the time.""<br/><br/> In an opinion published on June 12, 2021, The Washington Post said that in the past few years the world has been horrified by the chaos, dysfunction and insanity of American democracy, which was seen by U.S. allies as a shattered and washed-up has-been. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said what happened on the Capital Hill was ""disgraceful."" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Capitol riot was ""the result of lies and more lies, of divisiveness and contempt for democracy, of hatred and incitement -- even from the very highest level."" A research has showed that just 14 percent of Germans and fewer than 10 percent citizens in New Zealand saw American democracy as a desirable model for other countries.<br/><br/> Despite the fact that the U.S. democracy is proved to be a complete failure and its global image is badly damaged, the U.S. government held the so-called ""Leaders' Summit for Democracy"" in a high profile, politicizing democracy and using it as a tool to form cliques and force other countries to take sides, in an attempt to split the world. The so-called ""Leaders' Summit for Democracy"" is in essence a summit that undermines global democracy, and has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community.<br/><br/>French political scientist Dominique Moisi said that it is always difficult to preach what one does so badly itself. USA Today, The New York Times, and other American media have also commented that American democracy is ""falling apart"" and the United States must first address its own failings, and that critics questioned ""whether the United States could be an effective advocate for democracy amid problems at home.""<br/><br/> IV. INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE<br/><br/> The ""virus"" of deeply-entrenched racism in the United States is spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with anti-Asian hate crimes happening frequently, discrimination against Muslim communities increasing steadily, and racial persecution of indigenous populations still remaining, which has led to an even widening racial economic divide and growing racial inequality.<br/><br/> Asian Americans face increasingly severe discrimination and violent attacks. As a result of U.S. politicians' manipulation over racial issue, the number of attacks targeting Asian Americans has drastically increased. According to a report published on Nov. 18, 2021 by the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate, from March 19, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to the organization, and a majority of the incidents took place in spaces open to the public like public streets and businesses.<br/><br/> Statistics released by the New York Police Department on Dec. 8, 2021 showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of 2020. According to a report of The Washington Post on April 22, 2021, a Pew Research Center survey found that 81 percent of Asian adults said violence against the group was rising. The New York Times commented that ""no vaccine for racism."" It said that Asian New Yorkers live in fear of attacks, and the psychological effects of anti-Asian violence have scarred Asian communities in the United States. U.S. broadcaster NPR reported on Oct. 22, 2021 that one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity.<br/><br/> On March 16, 2021, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, a white male, launched gun attacks at three Asian-owned spas in Atlanta, killing eight people. Six of them are Asian women.<br/><br/> The deadly shooting epitomizes an escalation of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian-Americans in the country in recent years, sparking unprecedented anger and fear. Thousands of Asians and people of other ethic groups took to the streets in massive ""Stop Asian Hate"" rallies and marches.<br/><br/> On Jan. 28, 2021, an 84-year-old man from Thailand was deliberately knocked down to the ground and then died in San Francisco.<br/><br/> On April 23, 2021, Ma Yaopan, a 61-year-old Chinese man, was attacked from behind and fell to the ground on a street in New York. He then was repeatedly kicked in the head, which caused facial fractures. After eight months in a coma, he eventually died in hospital.<br/><br/> On Nov. 17, 2021, three Chinese high school students were violently assaulted on a subway train on their way home from school in Philadelphia. ""It was clear that they were picked on because they were Asian,"" said a local police officer.<br/><br/> On April 3, 2021, a report of The New York Times documented more than 110 anti-Asian incidents in the past year with clear evidence of racial hatred. ""Over the last year, in an unrelenting series of episodes with clear racial animus, people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been vandalized,"" said the report. That was just a tip of the iceberg of racist attacks on Asians in the United States.<br/><br/>BBC reported on July 22, 2021 that being regarded as a ""permanent alien"" is a painful experience shared by many Asian Americans, and under the combined effect of xenophobia and anti-communism, the U.S. government has been suspicious of Chinese scientists for more than half a century.<br/><br/> Since the implementation of the so-called ""China Initiative"" in November 2018, Chinese scientists have frequently been subjected to gratuitous harassment, monitoring and crackdown by the U.S. government. Vile and absurd acts of the U.S. law enforcement authorities have been constantly exposed by the media.<br/><br/> The New York Times on Nov. 29, 2021 reported on its website that about 2,000 academics at institutions including Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University have signed an open letter, expressing concerns that the initiative unduly targets researchers of Chinese descent.<br/><br/> The Yale Daily News reported on Dec. 9, 2021 that nearly 100 Yale professors have jointly published an open letter condemning the China Initiative, saying that it is invasive and discriminatory, disproportionately targets researchers of Chinese origin, and poses threats to scientific inquiry and academic freedom. They called for an end to the initiative.<br/><br/> According to an investigation by MIT Technology Review, a majority of cases under the initiative have had charges dismissed or are largely inactive.<br/><br/> Several Asian-American civil rights groups in the United States said that investigation against Chinese under the initiative would lead to ""discrimination and stigmatization.""<br/><br/> Xi Xiaoxing, a Chinese scientist victimized by the initiative, said the current situation of scientists of Chinese origin is similar to that of Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, almost like a return to the McCarthy era.<br/><br/> On July 28, 2021, Foreign Affairs published an article titled Rivalry Without Racism on its website, saying that ""U.S. foreign-policy makers' consistent overexaggeration of China's threat to the United States"" is a vital element of the recent surge in anti-Asian incidents. Demonizing China leads to the demonization of Asians in the country, and ""until policymakers stop using China as a punching bag for all of the United States' woes, Asian Americans will continue to be at risk,"" said the article.<br/><br/> Discrimination and attacks against Muslims are on the rise. Bloomberg reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that over the past two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, discrimination against Muslim Americans has surged.<br/><br/> The Associated Press reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that a poll found 53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward Islam.<br/><br/> In a 2021 report, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it receives more complaints of bullying and Islamophobic rhetoric every year. A report published by the council's California chapter on Oct. 28, 2021 showed that more than half of the students surveyed across California said they do not feel safe at school because they are bullied for their Muslim heritage. That's the highest percentage the California chapter has documented since the survey started in 2013.<br/><br/> A survey released on Oct. 29, 2021 by the Othering and Belonging Institute in University of California, Berkeley, found that 67.5 percent of the Muslim participants had experienced Islamophobia-related harms and that 93.7 percent of the respondents said they had been impacted by Islamophobia emotionally or physically.<br/><br/> The aborigines have long suffered cruel racial persecution. The United States has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including Indians, who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide.<br/><br/> An article titled ""The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides"" published on the website of Foreign Policy on Oct. 11, 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, more than 350 indigenous boarding schools were funded by the U.S. government, which aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly separating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities.<br/><br/> Until the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of indigenous children had been uprooted from their homes and many had been abused to death in those boarding schools where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed.<br/><br/> The United States is not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people, said the article.<br/><br/> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Navajo Nation, the Cherokee Nation, the Sioux Nation and other Native Americans have struggled with disease and poverty, which, however, has all been systematically ignored. The Navajo Nation, which stretches across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, was once among the areas with the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the country.<br/><br/> The Guardian reported on April 24, 2020 that early data indicated dramatically disproportionate rates of COVID-19 infection and death of Native Americans. Among about 80 percent of U.S. state health departments that have released some racial demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus, almost half of them did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label ""other."" ""We are a small population of people because of genocide,"" said Abigail Echo-Hawk, chief research officer of Seattle Indian Health Board. ""If you eliminate us in the data, we don't exist.""<br/><br/>Russian news network RT reported on Jan. 8, 2022 that since the 1950s, among more than 1,000 clandestine nuclear tests the U.S. government has conducted, 928 took place on lands of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe, leaving 620,000 tons of radioactive dust. The amount of radioactive dust is nearly 48 times that of the nuclear explosion in Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. According to Ian Zabarte of the Shoshone Nation, more than 1,000 people of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe have died directly from the nuclear explosion, and many people have consequently suffered from cancer.<br/><br/> The economic divide between races continues to widen. There has been a long-term and systematic economic inequality between ethnic minority groups and the white population in the United States, which is manifested in various aspects such as employment and entrepreneurship, wages, and financial loans.<br/><br/> USA Today reported on April 7, 2021 that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48 percent of the Asian community's estimated 615,000 unemployed were without work for six months-plus through the first quarter of 2021. The figure surpassed the portion of long-term unemployed among jobless workers of other ethnic groups.<br/><br/> Alexandra Suh, executive director of the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance in Los Angeles, said that Asians in the United States have been racialized, steered toward jobs and industries like catering, laundries and domestic work, nursing and personal care, which are devalued, underpaid and impacted hardest during the pandemic.<br/><br/> On July 30, 2021, USA Today reported on its website that a new Gallup poll showed that 59 percent Americans do not believe racial minorities have equal job opportunities.<br/><br/> The Hill reported on its website on Sept. 11, 2021 that 27 percent of minority-owned small businesses remained closed, much higher than White-owned small businesses. White-owned startups are seven times more likely to obtain loans than Black-owned ones during their founding year. Throughout the pandemic, businesses owned by people of color did not receive equitable access to federal aid, being hit harder economically.<br/><br/>CNN reported on July 15, 2021 that around 17 percent of African American households lack basic financial services compared to 3 percent of white households.<br/><br/> On Dec. 15, 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported on its website that despite representing 19 percent of the U.S. population, Hispanic families hold just 2 percent of the nation's total wealth. The median net worth of white families is more than five times greater than Hispanic families.<br/><br/> Structural flaws in its system have led to increasing racial inequality in the United States. On Nov. 22, 2021, UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues Fernand de Varennes said at the end of a 14-day visit to the United States that when it comes to human rights and minorities, the United States is a nation ""where support for slavery led to one of the world's most brutal civil wars, where racial segregation persisted late into the 20th century, and where indigenous peoples' experiences have for centuries been one of dispossession, brutality and even genocide.""<br/><br/> With a legal system that is structurally set up to advantage and forgive those who are wealthier, while penalizing those who are poorer, particularly minorities, minorities such as African Americans and Latino Americans in particular are crushed into a generational cycle of poverty, de Varennes said.<br/><br/> V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY<br/><br/> The U.S. government has often interfered in other countries' internal affairs by wielding the club of ""human rights."" However, the policy of separating migrant children from their families has severely endangered the migrants' lives, dignity, freedom and other human rights. The migrant and refugee crisis has even been used as an instrument for American partisan attacks and political strife. Constant government policy changes and police brutality adds to the sufferings of the migrants who have already been subject to extended custody, cruel torture, forced labor and many other inhumane treatments.<br/><br/> Asylum seekers are subject to police brutality. In 2021, the humanitarian crisis continued to intensify as the southern border of the United States saw an increasing inflow of migrants, and border enforcement officers used increasingly violent means to expel or prevent asylum seekers from entering the country.<br/><br/> Data released by U.S. Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the United States, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. Media reports say this does not reflect the dire situation on the U.S. southern border and ""the real number of migrant deaths may be greater.""<br/><br/> The USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021 that from January to November 2021, there have been more than 7,647 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults against asylum seekers.<br/><br/> In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. U.S. border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging towards the crowds to expel them into the river. The footage of the scene immediately sparked outrage when they were released.<br/><br/>CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. The New York Times commented that ""there were the outrageous images of agents on horseback herding the migrants like cattle"" and the U.S. government in general always seems to say the right things on racial issues, but too often their deeds come up short when measured against their talk.<br/><br/> Facing a flood of criticism, the U.S. government soon forcibly deported thousands of asylum seekers back to Haiti, most of whom had not lived there for nearly a decade since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.<br/><br/> On Oct. 25, 2021, the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent issued a statement, condemning the systematic and mass deportation of Haitian refugees and migrants by the United States without assessing the individuals' situation was a violation of international law, ""the mass deportations seemingly continue a history of racialized exclusion of Black Haitian migrants and refugees at U.S. ports of entry.""<br/><br/> Dissatisfied with the U.S. government's inhumane handling of Haitian migrants and refugees, Daniel Footie, the U.S. special envoy for Haiti, resigned in anger after just two months in office.<br/><br/> Immigrant children face prolonged detention and abuse. ""And while Biden has officially ended Trump's policy of 'family separation,' his use of Title 42 has created family separation 2.0,"" USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021. It forced many minors to separate from their parents.<br/><br/> ""There are more than 5,000 unaccompanied children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody,"" CNN reported on April 23, 2021. Many of them have been staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit set by federal law, it added.<br/><br/> ""A stash of redacted documents released to the human rights group (Human Rights Watch) after six years of legal tussles uncover more than 160 cases of misconduct and abuse by leading government agencies, notably Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol,"" The Guardian reported on Oct. 11, 2021. ""The papers record events between 2016 and 2021 that range from child sexual assault to enforced hunger, threats of rape and brutal detention conditions.""<br/><br/> Conditions in private detention facilities where migrants are held are poor. Most of the detention facilities in the United States are built and operated by private companies. In order to reduce operating costs and maximize profits, private companies generally build in accordance with the minimum standards contracted with the government, resulting in poor detention facilities and a harsh internal environment. A lack of supervision has led to chaotic management of the detention facilities and repeated violations of human rights, while detainees suffered varying degrees of physical and mental health damage.<br/><br/>U.S. authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the Mexico border during the 2021 fiscal year that ended in September.<br/><br/> Among them, up to 80 percent are held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children.<br/><br/> ""Conditions were deteriorating inside the 'emergency intake' shelter erected in the harsh desert of Fort Bliss (Texas),"" reported the El Paso Times on June 25, 2021.<br/><br/> ""There were nearly 5,000 children there, and some 1,500 children are still being held at the troubled site, where conditions in 'jam-packed' tents resembled 'a stockyard,' were 'traumatizing' and risky for the children's health and safety, according to half a dozen current and former workers, volunteers and civil servants, as well as internal emails obtained by the El Paso Times.<br/><br/> Many immigrants are victims of human trafficking and forced labor in the United States. Tighter U.S. immigration policies, combined with weak supervision at home, have exacerbated human smuggling and labor trafficking targeting immigrants.<br/><br/> A report by AP on Dec. 10, 2021 said that for years, immigrants who smuggled into the U.S. have been forced to work long hours on farms, living in filthy, overcrowded trailers, lacking food and clean drinking water, and facing threats of violence from regulators. The workers' IDs and travel documents were withheld, which limits their ability to seek help to escape their predicament.<br/><br/> A human trafficking indictment released on Nov. 22, 2021 on the website of U.S. Department of Justice documents that dozens of workers from Mexico and Central American countries have been smuggled to farms in the southern part of the state of Georgia, where they were illegally imprisoned under inhumane conditions as contract agricultural laborers, becoming victims of U.S. modern-day slavery.<br/><br/> After being cheated into farms with the promise of an hourly salary of 12 U.S. dollars, they were required to dig onions with their bare hands, paid 20 cents for each bucket harvested, and threatened with guns and violence to keep them in line. At least two of the workers died as a result of workplace conditions and one suffered from multiple sexual assault.<br/><br/> The New York Times website reported on Nov. 11, 2021 that hundreds of workers from India were lured to New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles etc. with the promise of fair pay and good hours, but instead they had nearly no time off from work that was grueling and frequently dangerous, moving stones that weighed several tons and facing health risks from exposure to harmful dust and chemicals. The workers were confined to their living quarters and had their passports confiscated, and were also threatened with retaliation, said the report.<br/><br/> Exclusion of immigrants becomes more and more extreme. The immigration policy, that is wavering, inconsistent and often disregards human rights, is the main cause of border crisis and immigrants' tragedy. The situation reflects that the policy is deeply affected by extreme xenophobia. According to an article published by Washington Post on Aug. 22 last year, with domestic debates in the U.S. over immigration increasingly driven by racialized resentment, anti-immigrant sentiment and entangled with domestic political battles, U.S. policymakers are more inclined to use techniques like force and coercion when resettling refugees. According to another article on Washington Post published on Oct. 20 last year, more than 1.7 million immigrants were detained by the U.S. Border Patrol along the southern border during the 2021 fiscal year, soaring to the highest level since 1986. The U.S. government hopes to deter illegal border crossing through tough law enforcement, which has made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to enter the country, resulting in them being forced to cross more dangerous areas. The situation in turn creates a larger humanitarian crisis.<br/><br/> VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES<br/><br/> The U.S. has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises, challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause.<br/><br/> The website of USA Today commented on Aug. 26, 2021 that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was a total disaster. Tragedies like the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Vietnam show that Washington has a history of ignoring basic humanitarianism for its own selfish ends.<br/><br/> In the chaos at Kabul airport, a U.S. C-17 transport plane forcibly took off regardless of the safety of Afghan civilians, with someone crushed to death in wheel well while the plane retracting landing gear, and others falling to their deaths from the air.<br/><br/> Even in the last minutes of the frantic evacuation, U.S. army's air strikes caused heavy civilian casualties. However, the U.S. Defense Department publicly said that no U.S. military personnel would be punished for the deaths of civilians in drone strikes.<br/><br/> The U.S. war on terror has killed millions of people. Since the 21st century, the United States has launched a series of global foreign military operations in the name of anti-terrorism, resulting in nearly one million deaths. The website of USA Today reported on Feb. 25, 2021 that the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by the United States in the past 20 years has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people, according to the ""costs of war"" study by Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs of Brown University. The 20-year U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. The New York Times reported on Dec. 18, 2021 that investigation found that more than 50,000 U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. The military has been concealing the number of casualties, and the actual number of civilian deaths is much higher than the military's published figures. The most obvious case is the U.S. airstrike on the Syrian hamlet of Tokhar in 2016. The military claimed that about seven to 24 civilians ""intermixed with the fighters"" might have died, but the U.S. military actually attacked private houses and more than 120 innocent civilians were killed.<br/><br/> The ongoing war and instability have made nearly a third of the Afghan population refugees. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly 23 million face extreme hunger, including 3.2 million children under the age of five. When the United States withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central Bank, causing the Afghan economy to be on the brink of collapse and making life worse for the people. According to an assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program which was released November 2021, only 5 percent of Afghans receive enough food on a daily basis. The New York Times reported that U.S. national defense contractors were the real winners in the ""war on terror"" and that the United States' 20 years in Afghanistan ""really built not a country but more than 500 military bases and the personal wealth of those who supplied them."" Only about 12 percent of the reconstruction aid the United States provided from 2020 to 2021 actually went to the Afghan government, with most of the rest going to American companies like Lewis Berger. The Gulf Today website of the United Arab Emirates published an article titled ""How the United States Destroyed Iraq"" on Dec. 19, 2021, saying that inadequate food supply and inflation have left Iraqis chronically hungry. As a result of the damage to power plants and water treatment facilities caused by U.S. bombings, the number of people suffering from diarrhoeal diseases was four times higher than pre-war level. The lack of medicine and medical equipment has left Iraq's health system in crisis, with the poor, children, widows, the elderly and other most vulnerable groups suffering the most.<br/><br/> Unilateral sanctions affect negatively people of other countries. Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on Human Rights, highlighted the sanctions' devastating impact on all of Venezuela's population, as well as on their enjoyment of human rights. The U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil sector have resulted in Iran's inability to import sufficient medical supplies, affecting the Iranians' right to life and health. The U.S. embargoes against Syria have severely affected the Syrian people's enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights. On June 23, 2021, the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution for the 29th consecutive year to call on the United States to end embargo on Cuba and start dialogue to improve bilateral ties with the country. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the United States continues to impose the embargo and sanctions against Cuba in the face of COVID-19, causing huge losses to the Cuban economy and society, and the Cuban people are suffering from the harm caused by this extremely inhumane act. Economic embargo is a massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the Cuban people and ""like the virus, the blockade asphyxiates and kills, it must stop,"" he added.<br/><br/> The Guantanamo Bay prison has been the scene of repeated torture scandals. On Feb. 23, 2021, a group of 16 UN experts said many of the remaining detainees are vulnerable and now elderly individuals whose physical and mental integrity has been compromised by unending deprivation of freedom and related physical and psychological torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, are part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. CBS News reported on Oct. 29, 2021 that the United States still holds 39 people at Guantanamo Bay. Majid Khan, a former detainee there, publicly revealed for the first time the torture he suffered, including being beaten, given forced enemas, sexually assaulted, starved, and deprived of sleep. ""I thought I was going to die,"" he said, ""I would beg them to stop."" He said he was suspended naked from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused repeatedly with ice water to keep him awake for days. He described having his head held under water to the point of near drowning.<br/><br/> The independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the UN Human Rights Council issued a statement on Jan. 10, 2022, saying that two decades of practicing arbitrary detention without trial accompanied by torture or ill treatment violates international human right laws, and is a ""stain on the U.S. government's commitment to the rule of law."" Despite forceful, repeated and unequivocal condemnation of the operation of this horrific detention and prison complex, the United States continues to detain persons many of whom have never been charged with any crime, the experts said. The experts urged the U.S. to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. They also called for reparations to be made for tortured and arbitrarily detained prisoners, and for those who authorized and engaged in torture to be held accountable, as required under international law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">PDOENG-9473535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">PDOENG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:64WH-GRG1-JC5R-23CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">420303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2022-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""9930""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 People's Daily</copyright><publicationName>People's Daily Online - English</publicationName><publicationDate day=""28"" month=""02"" year=""2022""><dateText>February 28, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem score=""91""><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=""91""><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""86""><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODAxMkJDODE1OEM0NERCNzhFOUU1OTdGRTA1OUI1NTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""77""><className>Vote Dilution</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDQzM0M0RThDN0NBNENGQjlBMjIwRTRBNjRENkQ1N0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""60""><className>Interference With Voting Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ0MzYzMjE3NDZCNEI5Q0I2REQyOUU0Q0YwNzA1RTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1MEVBQUFGMjc2NDk4Qjg0QkY0OUM4N0QyNkNCNjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""88""><className>Criminal Law &amp;

ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>The human rights situation in the United States, which has notorious records, worsened in 2021. Political manipulation led to a sharp surge in COVID-19 deaths; Shooting deaths hit a new record; Fake democracy trampled on people's political rights; Violent law enforcement made life harder for migrants and refugees; Discrimination against ethnic minority groups, especially Asians, intensified. In the meantime, unilateral U.S. actions created new humanitarian crises across the globe.</p><p>－The United States has the world's highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with 34.51 million confirmed cases and 480,000 fatalities, which far surpassed the numbers in 2020. Average life expectancy fell by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War.</p><p>－Public security situation in the United States deteriorated and violent crimes remained prevalent. There were 693 mass shootings in 2021, up 10.1 percent from 2020. More than 44,000 people were killed in gun violence.</p><p>－More than 420 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 U.S. states. Only 7 percent of young Americans view the country as a ""healthy democracy,"" while public trust in the government has fallen to almost historical low since 1958.</p><p>－Around 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against Asian communities is rising. Hate crimes against Asians in the New York City jumped 361 percent from 2020. Fifty-nine percent of Americans said ethnic minority groups do not have equal job opportunities.</p><p>－In fiscal year 2021, the United States detained more than 1.7 million migrants at its southern border, including 45,000 children. Violent law enforcement claimed 557 lives, the highest number since 1998, which more than doubled that of the previous fiscal year.</p><p>－A U.S. drone strike during its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children, among which the youngest was only two years old. The United States still held 39 detainees at the Guantanamo prison.</p><p>Fernand de Varennes, a special rapporteur on minority issues of the United Nations, said the U.S. legal system of human rights protection is incomplete and outdated, which has led to growing inequality.</p><p>As for the U.S. malpractice in creating human rights crises in other countries in the name of human rights, Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, said ""Americans must first fix what has gone wrong at home and rethink how they deal with the rest of the world.""</p><p>In 2021, the U.S. public persona of ""human rights defender"" was totally debunked as the so-called ""Summit for Democracy"" under the guise of safeguarding human rights became a farce. At the 48th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, many countries blasted the United States for being the ""biggest destroyer"" of human rights in the world and urged the country to address its own severe human rights violations.</p><p>I. A HEAVY PRICE FOR U.S. EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL</p><p>Despite having world's most advanced medical equipment and technology, the United States has the biggest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths globally. The U.S. government never rethinks its response measures and still lacks effective anti-epidemic plans. Instead, it stoked the origins-tracing of COVID-19, and has been keen on passing the buck, shifting the blame and political manipulation.</p><p>Disregard for people's rights to life and health. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, the epidemic prevention and control has been highly politicized, which has become a tool and a bargaining chip for Republicans and Democrats to attack, reject and confront each other. U.S. politicians focused only on their political gains in disregard of people's lives and health. The federal and local governments went their own way and constrained each other, which has not only made it very difficult to integrate and coordinate the management of medical resources, but also made people disoriented about epidemic prevention and control policies. And thus various anti-intellectual words and deeds that reject science and common sense have become prevalent. Misled by political manipulation, some Americans refused to wear masks, and even launched an anti-vaccine movement, which accelerated the spread of COVID-19. By the end of 2021, nearly 30 percent of Americans still had not been vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that U.S. hospitals were overwhelmed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations caused by infections among the unvaccinated continued to surge. States, local governments and the public ""have now been left out on their own,"" American news website Vox said on Jan. 2, 2021. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, by late February 2022, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States had exceeded 78 million and the death toll surpassed 940,000. Its number of COVID-19 deaths recorded in 2021 has far surpassed the total for 2020. According to the analysis by researchers at the University of Southern California and Princeton University, the deaths caused by COVID-19 have reduced overall life expectancy by 1.13 years, the biggest drop since the Second World War. Life expectancy was estimated to fall by 2.10 years among African Americans and 3.05 years among Latinos, while the decline was 0.68 years among whites. The U.S. government's unscientific, unequal and irresponsible epidemic prevention and control conducts have seriously undermined its people's rights to life and health. The New York Times reported on Nov. 18, 2021 that the pandemic has proved to be a nearly two-year stress test that the United States ""flunked,"" and that the American people's trust in their government has been ""bankrupt.""</p><p>People's mental health deteriorated due to the uncontrolled outbreak. A study published in The Lancet Regional Health－Americas in October 2021 found 32.8 percent of U.S. adults experienced ""elevated depressive symptoms"" in 2021, compared to 27.8 percent in the early 2020 months of the pandemic and 8.5 percent before the pandemic. According to a public opinion poll, more than a third of Americans aged between 13 and 56 said the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their lives. The poll finds teens and young adults have faced some of the heaviest struggles as they come of age during a time of extreme turmoil, the AP reported on Dec. 6, 2021. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy was cited by The Los Angeles Times as saying on Dec. 9, 2021 that the number of suspected suicide attempts in 2021 was 51 percent higher among adolescent girls compared to the same period in 2019.</p><p>The number of the homeless is staggering. The Washington Post reported on Dec. 7, 2021 that ""homelessness is one of the United States' greatest current challenges, no matter the region."" The AP reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that the number of people without permanent shelter in Rhode Island had increased by more than 85 percent since January 2021. According to a report by the group Advocates for Children, more than 100,000 New York City schoolchildren were homeless at some point during the 2020-2021 school year. The total number of homeless students during the school year represented nearly one-tenth of the city's public school system. Some students had to live in cars, parks or abandoned buildings. The New York Times reported on Dec. 19, 2021 that in San Francisco one of every 100 residents was homeless.</p><p>The elderly's rights to life are flagrantly violated. U.S. politicians have followed the natural law of ""selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior,"" declaring that ""the elderly could sacrifice for the country"" and that ""the national economy is more important than the lives of the elderly."" The U.S. CDC said that the vast majority of U.S. COVID-19 deaths have been among people aged 65 or older. According to Stat News, an American health-oriented news website, more than half a million elderly people in the United States have died from COVID-19, accounting for four-fifths of all fatalities. According to a report by Claudia Mahler, the United Nations independent expert on older people, on July 21, 2020, discrimination in the delivery of health care services, insufficient prioritization of nursing homes in responses to the virus, and lockdowns left older people more vulnerable to neglect or abuse. And there was ""a significant undercount of nursing home deaths"" in the United States during the pandemic.</p><p>Serious damage to the global anti-pandemic cooperation. Washington vigorously pursues ""America First,"" not only withholding anti-epidemic materials from other countries, but also prohibiting the export of domestic medical materials and buying out the production capacity of drugs that may be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The United States has repeatedly coerced the WHO, interfering and dragging down global anti-pandemic cooperation.</p><p>The United States has engaged in ""vaccine nationalism,"" pushing some underdeveloped countries and regions into a desperate situation of having no vaccines to administer.</p><p>Since March 2021, the United States has thrown away at least 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, significantly more than many poor countries have prepared for their whole populations, according to NBC News on Sept. 1, 2021.</p><p>""It's really tragic that we have a situation where vaccines are being wasted while lots of African countries have not had even 5 percent of their populations vaccinated,"" said Sharifah Sekalala, an associate professor of global health law at England's University of Warwick.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also slammed rich countries over their hoarding of vaccines, adding that ""they are just giving us the crumbs from their table. The greed they demonstrated was disappointing.""</p><p>The Biden administration is still pursuing U.S. interests in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the rest of the world, commented an article on the website of the U.S. Foreign Policy magazine.</p><p>II. ENTRENCHED VIOLENT THINKING THREATENS LIVES</p><p>The United States has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security.</p><p>Deterioration of social order has accelerated the proliferation of guns. The United States is the country with the largest number of privately owned guns in the world. The U.S. public have lost confidence in the government's social security governance and felt extremely insecure, which drives many to purchase guns to protect themselves.</p><p>The Small Arms Survey (SAS) researchers estimate that Americans own 393 million of the 857 million civilian guns available, which is around 46 percent of the world's civilian gun cache.</p><p>There are 120 guns for every 100 Americans, according to the SAS. No other nation has more civilian guns than people.</p><p>Everytown for Gun Safety also reported on Dec. 21, 2021 that over 15 million guns were sold through October.</p><p>""Ghost guns,"" which are assembled from parts purchased by individuals online, are even more proliferating.</p><p>According to a report by The New York Times website on Nov. 20, 2021, over the past 18 months, ghost guns had accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes.</p><p>By the beginning of October last year, the San Diego Police Department had recovered almost 400 ghost guns, about doubling the total for all of 2020 with nearly three months to go in the year.</p><p>It also reported that since January 2016, about 25,000 privately made firearms had been confiscated by local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide.</p><p>Gun violence seriously endangers people's lives. The United States has the worst gun violence in the world. According to statistics released on Jan. 5, 2022 by the Gun Violence Archive website, the number of fatalities from shootings in the United States rose from 39,558 in 2019 to 43,643 in 2020, and further to 44,816 in 2021. In 2021, there were 693 mass shootings in the United States, up 10.1 percent from 2020.</p><p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 5, 2021 that children and teens in the United States are 15 times more likely to die from gunfire than their peers in 31 other high-income countries combined, quoting data from the Children's Defense Fund.</p><p>At least 30 shootings occurred on U.S. campuses during the school season from Aug. 1 to Sept. 15, 2021, killing at least five people and injuring 23, the highest number on record.</p><p>A total of 1,229 teens aged 12 to 17 were killed and 3,373 injured in shootings in the United States in 2021. On Nov. 30, 2021, four students were killed in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school by a 15-year-old suspect who used the same gun that his father bought on Black Friday.</p><p>CNN reported on Nov. 26, 2021 that Jason R. Silva, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at William Paterson University, said that the United States is the only developed country where mass shootings have happened every single year for the past 20 years.</p><p>Shooting incidents have caused a large number of casualties and posed a major threat to public safety. According to an April 2021 Pew Research Center survey, 48 percent of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in the country today.</p><p>Police brutality tramples human life. According to data compiled by Mapping Police Violence, at least 1,124 people died in 2021 due to U.S. police violence. The majority of killings occurred during non-violent offenses or when there was no crime at all.</p><p>The USA TODAY website reported on June 21, 2021 that police in the United States fatally shoot about 1,000 people a year. Police have fatally shot more than 6,300 people since 2015, but only 91 officers have been arrested, or just 1 percent of those involved.</p><p>The USA TODAY website reported on July 8, 2021 that a poll showed that just 22 percent of Americans believe that the U.S. police treat all Americans equally.</p><p>Racial and ethnic groups are often subjected to unfair justice. The USA TODAY website reported on July 15, 2021 that a 20-year-old African-American man in Minnesota, Daunte Wright, was shot and killed by police after being pulled over outside Minneapolis for an expired license plate. Wright's death was one of a string of incidents in which African-Americans were pulled over for traffic violations and killed innocently.</p><p>A study of 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina over more than a decade shows that African American drivers are twice as likely as white drivers to be pulled over by police.</p><p>The USA TODAY website reported on May 24, 2021 that within a year of the death of George Floyd, who died after an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes, enforcement killed hundreds of people of ethnic minorities in the United States.</p><p>According to the report, since the year 2000, there have been over 470 murders at the hands of law enforcement in Minnesota. Only one police officer was convicted in the history of Minnesota and that was a minority man that killed a white woman.</p><p>The Christian Science Monitor website reported on Nov. 23, 2021 that the Urban Institute found that homicides with a white perpetrator and a black victim are ten times more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim.</p><p>Human rights violations by prison staff are commonplace. The United States has the highest incarceration rate and the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. An Associated Press investigation has found that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons is a hotbed of graft, corruption and abuse.</p><p>CTV News reported on Nov. 14, 2021 that crimes committed by federal prison staff in the United States are not uncommon. Since 2019, more than 100 U.S. federal prison staff members have been arrested and convicted of sexual abuse, murder and other offenses.</p><p>Prisoners held in U.S. private prisons are at risk of being abused. The UN News reported on Feb. 4, 2021 that in 2019, there were about 116,000 U.S. prisoners held in privately operated facilities, representing about 7 percent of all state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners, quoting data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p><p>On April 20, 2021, nine UN experts, including the UN Human Rights Council Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Older Persons, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Physical and Mental Health, issued a joint statement condemning U.S. human rights violations against Mumia Abu-Jamal, a prisoner of African descent.</p><p>The statement said Abu-Jamal, who has been in prison for 40 years, was a social activist and journalist. The 67-year-old suffers from a number of diseases including chronic heart disease, liver cirrhosis and high blood pressure. In February 2021, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. While receiving treatment for heart failure in late February, he was handcuffed to his hospital bed for four days; and when he was hospitalized again in early April for surgery, his family, lawyers and others were denied access to him.</p><p>The statement calls on the U.S. government to comply with its international human rights obligations, take urgent measures to protect Abu-Jamal's life and dignity, immediately stop the practice of withholding information, and allow outside visits to monitor his human rights situation.</p><p>It also calls on the U.S. government to take all necessary measures to protect the lives of all detainees, especially the elderly and disabled prisoners who are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>The credibility of the U.S. judicial system is in tatters. According to statistics released by the U.S. National Registry of Exoneration on Jan. 11, 2022, 2,933 people have been wrongly convicted in the United States since 1989, with a combined 25,600 years of wrongly imposed prison sentences. However, 14 U.S. states lack legal provisions related to compensation for wrongful convictions.</p><p>The BBC reported on Nov. 23, 2021, that Kevin Strickland, 62, had maintained his innocence since his arrest at the age of 18. He was wrongly convicted of third-degree murder in June 1979, only to be found not guilty in 2021 before being imprisoned for more than 42 years, the longest wrongful imprisonment in Missouri history. But under the state's law, he is unlikely to receive any financial compensation.</p><p>The USA Today website reported on July 8, 2021, that a survey showed that only 17 percent of Americans believe the U.S. criminal justice system treats everyone fairly.</p><p>III. PLAYING WITH FAKE DEMOCRACY TRAMPLES ON POLITICAL RIGHTS</p><p>Political donations bring about transfers of interests after elections, political polarization further intensifies antagonism and division in the U.S. society, and legislation and gerrymander restricting voting eligibility have become tools for parties to suppress the public opinion. The operation of the U.S. political system is moving away from the public will and social demands, the right of the majority of the public to participate in politics is essentially deprived of, and international confidence in the U.S. democratic system continues to decline.</p><p>The American-style democracy has descended to a game of transferring interests. Money politics become increasingly rampant in the United States, which makes politicians more neglectful of people's interests and demands.</p><p>Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has pointed out that there is a positive correlation between Americans' wealth and their influence on policy-making, and for about 70 percent on the income-wealth scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever and are effectively disenfranchised. Ray La Raja, professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, noted in an article for The Atlantic that America's current system is democratic only in form, not in substance, as the nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists, while many presidential-primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views.</p><p>According to The Guardian on Jan. 7, 2021, candidates spent 14 billion U.S. dollars alone on advertising for the 2020 U.S. presidential election cycle. The U.S. Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) reported on April 15, 2021 that Wall Street executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least 2.9 billion U.S. dollars into political initiatives during the 2020 election cycle. The U.S. media outlet Politico said on Nov. 17, 2021 that a secret-money group ""doled out"" 410 million U.S. dollars in 2020 to the Democratic Party, aiding the latter's efforts to win back control of the Senate.</p><p>In the 2020 presidential election, U.S. pharmaceutical companies made huge political donations to both parties, and the Democratic administration, after taking office, invested an enormous sum of money back to the companies involved, with Moderna alone earning profit of nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars. The federal government then funneled interests directly to pharmaceutical companies by purchasing large quantities of COVID-19 vaccines, resulting in massive hoarding and waste of vaccines in the United States. The U.S. government gave pharmaceutical companies a free hand in pricing COVID-19 vaccines, leading to continuous increases in vaccine prices. The Financial Times reported that Pfizer raised the price of its COVID-19 vaccine for the European Union from 15.5 euros to 19.5 euros, and the price of a Moderna jab increased to 25.5 euros from 19 euros. However, the production cost of a Moderna dose is estimated to be less than 3 U.S. dollars.</p><p>Political polarization leads to an increasingly divided U.S. society. The election chaos in the United States has further intensified political polarization and continues to tear the society apart. On the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, prompted by the incitement and manipulation of extreme politicians, tens of thousands of Americans who rejected the 2020 presidential election result flooded to Washington, D.C., and a large number of demonstrators forced their way into the Capitol building and clashed with police, leaving five dead and more than 140 injured. The constitutional process to affirm the presidential election result was interrupted. A Brookings online article in May 2021 indicated that though all 50 states certified the 2020 election results, 77 percent of Republican voters still questioned the legitimacy of the elected president due to allegations of electoral fraud, a phenomenon that happened for the first time in nearly 100 years.</p><p>Changes of government did not reduce or remove the political polarization in the United States. The American people are becoming more incompatible with each other over such issues as pandemic prevention and control, race relations, abortion rights and gun control, while the political struggle between Democrats and Republicans over infrastructure construction, social welfare bills, government debt ceiling and other legislation related to the economy and people's livelihood have become more intense, and the Congress has been nearly dysfunctional. A Republican leader even went so far as to deliver a record 8.5-hour speech in the Congress to block and delay a vote on a Democratic-proposed bill.</p><p>The Pew Research Center reported on Oct. 13, 2021 that the United States was regarded as the most politically polarized country in a survey involving 17 advanced economies, as 90 percent of the American respondents said there are at least strong conflicts between those who support different parties, and about six-in-ten thought their fellow citizens disagree not only over policies, but also over basic facts.</p><p>Confrontations between political parties restrain and harm electors' right to vote. In order to win elections, Republicans and Democrats used legislation and gerrymander as well as other tactics to aggressively prevent voters who do not favor them from casting a ballot. In 2021, 49 states in the United States introduced more than 420 bills that would restrict voting. These bills either reduced the amount of time voters have to request or mail in a ballot, restricted the availability of drop-off locations, imposed stricter signature requirements for mail-in voting, or enacted new and stricter voter-ID requirements, which made mail-in voting and early voting harder and built barriers for the elderly, disabled, minorities and other groups to exercise their voting rights. NBC News reported on March 8, 2021 that the state of Georgia was pushing dozens of restrictive voting bills targeting African American voters. Voting rights experts and civil rights groups have argued that ""the movement adds up to a national assault that would push voters of color out of the electorate.""</p><p>Gerrymander has become a tool to suppress the political influence of minority voters. The Democratic and Republican parties exploit their political clout in each state to increase the chances of winning by redrawing congressional districts, often at the expense of the rights of minorities.</p><p>CNBC reported on Aug. 13, 2021 that the practice of redrawing congressional districts often targets voters of color and the gerrymandering in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania alone gave Republicans 16 to 17 more congressional seats. Daily newspaper the Chicago Tribune reported on Sept. 3, 2021 that Illinois' redistricting aimed to keep Democrats in control of the state legislature for at least a decade. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported on Nov. 30, 2021 that the redrawn congressional districts for Ohio give Republicans an unconstitutional partisan advantage, with which the Republicans can anticipate winning 67 percent to 80 percent of the congressional seats－even though they are only likely to obtain about 55 percent of the vote.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times reported on Dec. 8, 2021 that although Texas has seen a significant increase of the number of people of color, its new redistricting plan intentionally diminished the power of Latino and African American voters. Latino Texans make up nearly 40 percent of the population, but just seven of the 38 congressional districts are predominantly Latino. Texas is home to the largest African American population in the country, but not one of the 38 congressional districts in the state is predominantly black. In a survey of the American public on the fairness of congressional districting, only 16 percent of the surveyed thought that congressional districts would be re-drawn fairly in their states.</p><p>The international community's confidence in U.S. democracy continues to decline. A national poll of America's 18- to 29-year-olds released on Dec. 1, 2021 by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School showed that only 7 percent of the surveyed viewed the United States as a ""healthy democracy,"" and 52 percent believed that the American democracy is either ""in trouble"" or ""failing."" Data released by the Pew Research Center in May 2021 indicated that the American public trust in the government neared a historic low since 1958, as only 2 percent of Americans said they can trust the U.S. government to do what is right ""just about always,"" and only 22 percent said they can trust the government to do what is right ""most of the time.""</p><p>In an opinion published on June 12, 2021, The Washington Post said that in the past few years the world has been horrified by the chaos, dysfunction and insanity of American democracy, which was seen by U.S. allies as a shattered and washed-up has-been. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said what happened on the Capitol Hill was ""disgraceful."" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Capitol riot was ""the result of lies and more lies, of divisiveness and contempt for democracy, of hatred and incitement－even from the very highest level."" A research has showed that just 14 percent of Germans and fewer than 10 percent of citizens in New Zealand saw American democracy as a desirable model for other countries.</p><p>Despite the fact that the U.S. democracy is proved to be a complete failure and its global image is badly damaged, the U.S. government held the so-called ""Leaders' Summit for Democracy"" in a high profile, politicizing democracy and using it as a tool to form cliques and force other countries to take sides, in an attempt to split the world. The so-called ""Leaders' Summit for Democracy"" is in essence a summit that undermines global democracy, and has been widely criticized and condemned by the international community.</p><p>French political scientist Dominique Moisi said that it is always difficult to preach what one does so badly itself. USA Today, The New York Times, and other American media have also commented that American democracy is ""falling apart"" and the United States must first address its own failings, and that critics questioned ""whether the United States could be an effective advocate for democracy amid problems at home.""</p><p>IV. INDULGING IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION EXACERBATES SOCIAL INJUSTICE</p><p>The ""virus"" of deeply-entrenched racism in the United States is spreading along with the novel coronavirus, with anti-Asian hate crimes happening frequently, discrimination against Muslim communities increasing steadily, and racial persecution of indigenous populations still remaining, which has led to an even widening racial economic divide and growing racial inequality.</p><p>Asian Americans face increasingly severe discrimination and violent attacks. As a result of U.S. politicians' manipulation over racial issue, the number of attacks targeting Asian Americans has drastically increased. According to a report published on Nov. 18, 2021 by the national coalition Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander Hate, from March 19, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, a total of 10,370 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to the organization, and a majority of the incidents took place in spaces open to the public like public streets and businesses.</p><p>Statistics released by the New York Police Department on Dec. 8, 2021 showed that anti-Asian hate crimes in the city rose by 361 percent from that of 2020. According to a report of The Washington Post on April 22, 2021, a Pew Research Center survey found that 81 percent of Asian adults said violence against the group was rising. The New York Times commented that ""no vaccine for racism."" It said that Asian New Yorkers live in fear of attacks, and the psychological effects of anti-Asian violence have scarred Asian communities in the United States. U.S. broadcaster NPR reported on Oct. 22, 2021 that one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened because of their race or ethnicity.</p><p>On March 16, 2021, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, a white male, launched gun attacks at three Asian-owned spas in Atlanta, killing eight people. Six of them are Asian women.</p><p>The deadly shooting epitomizes an escalation of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian-Americans in the country in recent years, sparking unprecedented anger and fear. Thousands of Asians and people of other ethnic groups took to the streets in massive ""Stop Asian Hate"" rallies and marches.</p><p>On Jan. 28, 2021, an 84-year-old man from Thailand was deliberately knocked down to the ground and then died in San Francisco.</p><p>On April 23, 2021, Ma Yaopan, a 61-year-old Chinese man, was attacked from behind and fell to the ground on a street in New York. He then was repeatedly kicked in the head, which caused facial fractures. After eight months in a coma, he eventually died in hospital.</p><p>On Nov. 17, 2021, three Chinese high school students were violently assaulted on a subway train on their way home from school in Philadelphia. ""It was clear that they were picked on because they were Asian,"" said a local police officer.</p><p>On April 3, 2021, a report of The New York Times documented more than 110 anti-Asian incidents in the past year with clear evidence of racial hatred. ""Over the last year, in an unrelenting series of episodes with clear racial animus, people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked, spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been vandalized,"" said the report. That was just a tip of the iceberg of racist attacks on Asians in the United States.</p><p>BBC reported on July 22, 2021 that being regarded as a ""permanent alien"" is a painful experience shared by many Asian Americans, and under the combined effect of xenophobia and anti-communism, the U.S. government has been suspicious of Chinese scientists for more than half a century.</p><p>Since the implementation of the so-called ""China Initiative"" in November 2018, Chinese scientists have frequently been subjected to gratuitous harassment, monitoring and crackdown by the U.S. government. Vile and absurd acts of the U.S. law enforcement authorities have been constantly exposed by the media.</p><p>The New York Times on Nov. 29, 2021 reported on its website that about 2,000 academics at institutions including Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University have signed an open letter, expressing concerns that the initiative unduly targets researchers of Chinese descent.</p><p>The Yale Daily News reported on Dec. 9, 2021 that nearly 100 Yale professors have jointly published an open letter condemning the China Initiative, saying that it is invasive and discriminatory, disproportionately targets researchers of Chinese origin, and poses threats to scientific inquiry and academic freedom. They called for an end to the initiative.</p><p>According to an investigation by MIT Technology Review, a majority of cases under the initiative have had charges dismissed or are largely inactive.</p><p>Several Asian-American civil rights groups in the United States said that investigation against Chinese under the initiative would lead to ""discrimination and stigmatization.""</p><p>Xi Xiaoxing, a Chinese scientist victimized by the initiative, said the current situation of scientists of Chinese origin is similar to that of Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, almost like a return to the McCarthy era.</p><p>On July 28, 2021, Foreign Affairs published an article titled Rivalry Without Racism on its website, saying that ""U.S. foreign-policy makers' consistent overexaggeration of China's threat to the United States"" is a vital element of the recent surge in anti-Asian incidents. Demonizing China leads to the demonization of Asians in the country, and ""until policymakers stop using China as a punching bag for all of the United States' woes, Asian Americans will continue to be at risk,"" said the article.</p><p>Discrimination and attacks against Muslims are on the rise. Bloomberg reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that over the past two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, discrimination against Muslim Americans has surged.</p><p>The Associated Press reported on Sept. 9, 2021 that a poll found 53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward Islam.</p><p>In a 2021 report, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it receives more complaints of bullying and Islamophobic rhetoric every year. A report published by the council's California chapter on Oct. 28, 2021 showed that more than half of the students surveyed across California said they do not feel safe at school because they are bullied for their Muslim heritage. That's the highest percentage the California chapter has documented since the survey started in 2013.</p><p>A survey released on Oct. 29, 2021 by the Othering and Belonging Institute in University of California, Berkeley, found that 67.5 percent of the Muslim participants had experienced Islamophobia-related harms and that 93.7 percent of the respondents said they had been impacted by Islamophobia emotionally or physically.</p><p>The aborigines have long suffered cruel racial persecution. The United States has a long and dark history of violating the rights of indigenous people, including Indians, who have experienced bloody massacres, brutal expulsions and cultural genocide.</p><p>An article titled ""The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides"" published on the website of Foreign Policy on Oct. 11, 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, more than 350 indigenous boarding schools were funded by the U.S. government, which aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly separating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities.</p><p>Until the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of indigenous children had been uprooted from their homes and many had been abused to death in those boarding schools where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed.</p><p>The United States is not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people, said the article.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Navajo Nation, the Cherokee Nation, the Sioux Nation and other Native Americans have struggled with disease and poverty, which, however, has all been systematically ignored. The Navajo Nation, which stretches across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, was once among the areas with the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the country.</p><p>The Guardian reported on April 24, 2020 that early data indicated dramatically disproportionate rates of COVID-19 infection and death of Native Americans. Among about 80 percent of U.S. state health departments that have released some racial demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus, almost half of them did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label ""other."" ""We are a small population of people because of genocide,"" said Abigail Echo-Hawk, chief research officer of Seattle Indian Health Board. ""If you eliminate us in the data, we don't exist.""</p><p>Russian news network RT reported on Jan. 8, 2022 that since the 1950s, among more than 1,000 clandestine nuclear tests the U.S. government has conducted, 928 took place on lands of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe, leaving 620,000 tons of radioactive dust. The amount of radioactive dust is nearly 48 times that of the nuclear explosion in Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. According to Ian Zabarte of the Shoshone Nation, more than 1,000 people of the Shoshone Aboriginal tribe have died directly from the nuclear explosion, and many people have consequently suffered from cancer.</p><p>The economic divide between races continues to widen. There has been a long-term and systematic economic inequality between ethnic minority groups and the white population in the United States, which is manifested in various aspects such as employment and entrepreneurship, wages, and financial loans.</p><p>USA Today reported on April 7, 2021 that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48 percent of the Asian community's estimated 615,000 unemployed were without work for six months-plus through the first quarter of 2021. The figure surpassed the portion of long-term unemployed among jobless workers of other ethnic groups.</p><p>Alexandra Suh, executive director of the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance in Los Angeles, said that Asians in the United States have been racialized, steered toward jobs and industries like catering, laundries and domestic work, nursing and personal care, which are devalued, underpaid and impacted hardest during the pandemic.</p><p>On July 30, 2021, USA Today reported on its website that a new Gallup poll showed that 59 percent of Americans do not believe racial minorities have equal job opportunities.</p><p>The Hill reported on its website on Sept. 11, 2021 that 27 percent of minority-owned small businesses remained closed, much higher than White-owned small businesses. White-owned startups are seven times more likely to obtain loans than Black-owned ones during their founding year. Throughout the pandemic, businesses owned by people of color did not receive equitable access to federal aid, being hit harder economically.</p><p>CNN reported on July 15, 2021 that around 17 percent of African American households lack basic financial services compared to 3 percent of white households.</p><p>On Dec. 15, 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported on its website that despite representing 19 percent of the U.S. population, Hispanic families hold just 2 percent of the nation's total wealth. The median net worth of white families is more than five times greater than Hispanic families.</p><p>Structural flaws in its system have led to increasing racial inequality in the United States. On Nov. 22, 2021, UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues Fernand de Varennes said at the end of a 14-day visit to the United States that when it comes to human rights and minorities, the United States is a nation ""where support for slavery led to one of the world's most brutal civil wars, where racial segregation persisted late into the 20th century, and where indigenous peoples' experiences have for centuries been one of dispossession, brutality and even genocide.""</p><p>With a legal system that is structurally set up to advantage and forgive those who are wealthier, while penalizing those who are poorer, particularly minorities, minorities such as African Americans and Latino Americans in particular are crushed into a generational cycle of poverty, de Varennes said.</p><p>V. CREATING A MIGRANT CRISIS AGAINST HUMANITY</p><p>The U.S. government has often interfered in other countries' internal affairs by wielding the club of ""human rights."" However, the policy of separating migrant children from their families has severely endangered the migrants' lives, dignity, freedom and other human rights. The migrant and refugee crisis has even been used as an instrument for American partisan attacks and political strife. Constant government policy changes and police brutality adds to the sufferings of the migrants who have already been subject to extended custody, cruel torture, forced labor and many other inhumane treatments.</p><p>Asylum seekers are subject to police brutality. In 2021, the humanitarian crisis continued to intensify as the southern border of the United States saw an increasing inflow of migrants, and border enforcement officers used increasingly violent means to expel or prevent asylum seekers from entering the country.</p><p>Data released by U.S. Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the United States, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. Media reports say this does not reflect the dire situation on the U.S. southern border and ""the real number of migrant deaths may be greater.""</p><p>The USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021 that from January to November 2021, there have been more than 7,647 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults against asylum seekers.</p><p>In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. U.S. border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging towards the crowds to expel them into the river. The footage of the scene immediately sparked outrage when they were released.</p><p>CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. The New York Times commented that ""there were the outrageous images of agents on horseback herding the migrants like cattle"" and the U.S. government in general always seems to say the right things on racial issues, but too often their deeds come up short when measured against their talk.</p><p>Facing a flood of criticism, the U.S. government soon forcibly deported thousands of asylum seekers back to Haiti, most of whom had not lived there for nearly a decade since the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.</p><p>On Oct. 25, 2021, the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent issued a statement, condemning the systematic and mass deportation of Haitian refugees and migrants by the United States without assessing the individuals' situation was a violation of international law, ""the mass deportations seemingly continue a history of racialized exclusion of Black Haitian migrants and refugees at U.S. ports of entry.""</p><p>Dissatisfied with the U.S. government's inhumane handling of Haitian migrants and refugees, Daniel Footie, the U.S. special envoy for Haiti, resigned in anger after just two months in office.</p><p>Immigrant children face prolonged detention and abuse. ""And while Biden has officially ended Trump's policy of 'family separation,' his use of Title 42 has created family separation 2.0,"" USA Today website reported on Nov. 29, 2021. It forced many minors to separate from their parents.</p><p>""There are more than 5,000 unaccompanied children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody,"" CNN reported on April 23, 2021. Many of them have been staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit set by federal law, it added.</p><p>""A stash of redacted documents released to the human rights group (Human Rights Watch) after six years of legal tussles uncover more than 160 cases of misconduct and abuse by leading government agencies, notably Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol,"" The Guardian reported on Oct. 11, 2021. ""The papers record events between 2016 and 2021 that range from child sexual assault to enforced hunger, threats of rape and brutal detention conditions.""</p><p>Conditions in private detention facilities where migrants are held are poor. Most of the detention facilities in the United States are built and operated by private companies. In order to reduce operating costs and maximize profits, private companies generally build in accordance with the minimum standards contracted with the government, resulting in poor detention facilities and a harsh internal environment. A lack of supervision has led to chaotic management of the detention facilities and repeated violations of human rights, while detainees suffered varying degrees of physical and mental health damage.</p><p>U.S. authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the Mexico border during the 2021 fiscal year that ended in September.</p><p>Among them, up to 80 percent are held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children.</p><p>""Conditions were deteriorating inside the 'emergency intake' shelter erected in the harsh desert of Fort Bliss (Texas),"" reported the El Paso Times on June 25, 2021.</p><p>""There were nearly 5,000 children there, and some 1,500 children are still being held at the troubled site, where conditions in 'jam-packed' tents resembled 'a stockyard,' were 'traumatizing' and risky for the children's health and safety, according to half a dozen current and former workers, volunteers and civil servants, as well as internal emails obtained by the El Paso Times.</p><p>Many immigrants are victims of human trafficking and forced labor in the United States. Tighter U.S. immigration policies, combined with weak supervision at home, have exacerbated human smuggling and labor trafficking targeting immigrants.</p><p>A report by AP on Dec. 10, 2021 said that for years, immigrants who smuggled into the U.S. have been forced to work long hours on farms, living in filthy, overcrowded trailers, lacking food and clean drinking water, and facing threats of violence from regulators. The workers' IDs and travel documents were withheld, which limits their ability to seek help to escape their predicament.</p><p>A human trafficking indictment released on Nov. 22, 2021 on the website of U.S. Department of Justice documents that dozens of workers from Mexico and Central American countries have been smuggled to farms in the southern part of the state of Georgia, where they were illegally imprisoned under inhumane conditions as contract agricultural laborers, becoming victims of U.S. modern-day slavery.</p><p>After being cheated into farms with the promise of an hourly salary of 12 U.S. dollars, they were required to dig onions with their bare hands, paid 20 cents for each bucket harvested, and threatened with guns and violence to keep them in line. At least two of the workers died as a result of workplace conditions and one suffered from multiple sexual assaults.</p><p>The New York Times website reported on Nov. 11, 2021 that hundreds of workers from India were lured to New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles etc. with the promise of fair pay and good hours, but instead they had nearly no time off from work that was grueling and frequently dangerous, moving stones that weighed several tons and facing health risks from exposure to harmful dust and chemicals. The workers were confined to their living quarters and had their passports confiscated, and were also threatened with retaliation, said the report.</p><p>Exclusion of immigrants becomes more and more extreme. The immigration policy, that is wavering, inconsistent and often disregards human rights, is the main cause of border crisis and immigrants' tragedy. The situation reflects that the policy is deeply affected by extreme xenophobia. According to an article published by Washington Post on Aug. 22 last year, with domestic debates in the U.S. over immigration increasingly driven by racialized resentment, anti-immigrant sentiment and entangled with domestic political battles, U.S. policymakers are more inclined to use techniques like force and coercion when resettling refugees. According to another article on Washington Post published on Oct. 20 last year, more than 1.7 million immigrants were detained by the U.S. Border Patrol along the southern border during the 2021 fiscal year, soaring to the highest level since 1986. The U.S. government hopes to deter illegal border crossing through tough law enforcement, which has made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to enter the country, resulting in them being forced to cross more dangerous areas. The situation in turn creates a larger humanitarian crisis.</p><p>VI. ABUSE OF FORCE AND SANCTIONS VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES</p><p>The U.S. has always pursued hegemonism, unilateralism and interventionism. The country frequently uses force, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties. Its abusive use of unilateral sanctions has caused humanitarian crises, challenging justice with hegemony, trampling on righteousness with self-interest, and wantonly violating human rights in other countries. It has become the biggest obstacle and destroyer of the sound development of the international human rights cause.</p><p>The website of USA Today commented on Aug. 26, 2021 that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was a total disaster. Tragedies like the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Vietnam show that Washington has a history of ignoring basic humanitarianism for its own selfish ends.</p><p>In the chaos at Kabul airport, a U.S. C-17 transport plane forcibly took off regardless of the safety of Afghan civilians, with someone crushed to death in wheel well while the plane retracted its landing gear, and others falling to their deaths from the air.</p><p>Even in the last minutes of the frantic evacuation, U.S. army's air strikes caused heavy civilian casualties. However, the U.S. Defense Department publicly said that no U.S. military personnel would be punished for the deaths of civilians in drone strikes.</p><p>The U.S. war on terror has killed millions of people. Since the 21st century, the United States has launched a series of global foreign military operations in the name of anti-terrorism, resulting in nearly one million deaths. The website of USA Today reported on Feb. 25, 2021 that the so-called anti-terrorism war launched by the United States in the past 20 years has claimed the lives of more than 929,000 people, according to the ""costs of war"" study by Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs of Brown University. The 20-year U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have killed 174,000 people, including more than 30,000 civilians, and injured more than 60,000 people. The New York Times reported on Dec. 18,2021 that an investigation found that more than 50,000 U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were reckless and poorly targeted, killing tens of thousands of civilians. The military has been concealing the number of casualties, and the actual number of civilian deaths is much higher than the military's published figures. The most obvious case is the U.S. airstrike on the Syrian hamlet of Tokhar in 2016.The military claimed that about seven to 24 civilians ""intermixed with the fighters"" might have died, but the U.S. military actually attacked private houses and more than 120 innocent civilians were killed.</p><p>The ongoing war and instability have made nearly a third of the Afghan population refugees. A total of 3.5 million Afghans have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly 23 million face extreme hunger, including 3.2 million children under the age of five. When the United States withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central Bank, causing the Afghan economy to be on the brink of collapse and making life worse for the people. According to an assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program which was released November 2021, only 5 percent of Afghans receive enough food on a daily basis. The New York Times reported that U.S. national defense contractors were the real winners in the ""war on terror"" and that the United States' 20 years in Afghanistan ""really built not a country but more than 500 military bases and the personal wealth of those who supplied them."" Only about 12 percent of the reconstruction aid the United States provided from 2020 to 2021 actually went to the Afghan government, with most of the rest going to American companies like Lewis Berger. The Gulf Today website of the United Arab Emirates published an article titled ""How the United States Destroyed Iraq"" on Dec. 19, 2021, saying that inadequate food supply and inflation have left Iraqis chronically hungry. As a result of the damage to power plants and water treatment facilities caused by U.S. bombings, the number of people suffering from diarrhoeal diseases was four times higher than pre-war level. The lack of medicine and medical equipment has left Iraq's health system in crisis, with the poor, children, widows, the elderly and other most vulnerable groups suffering the most.</p><p>Unilateral sanctions affect negatively people of other countries. Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on Human Rights, highlighted the sanctions' devastating impact on all of Venezuela's population, as well as on their enjoyment of human rights. The U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil sector have resulted in Iran's inability to import sufficient medical supplies, affecting the Iranians' right to life and health. The U.S. embargoes against Syria have severely affected the Syrian people's enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights. On June 23, 2021, the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution for the 29th consecutive year to call on the United States to end embargo on Cuba and start dialogue to improve bilateral ties with the country. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the United States continues to impose the embargo and sanctions against Cuba in the face of COVID-19, causing huge losses to the Cuban economy and society, and the Cuban people are suffering from the harm caused by this extremely inhumane act. Economic embargo is a massive, flagrant and unacceptable violation of the human rights of the Cuban people and ""like the virus, the blockade asphyxiates and kills, it must stop,"" he added.</p><p>The Guantanamo Bay prison has been the scene of repeated torture scandals. On Feb. 23, 2021, a group of 16 UN experts said many of the remaining detainees are vulnerable and now elderly individuals whose physical and mental integrity has been compromised by unending deprivation of freedom and related physical and psychological torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, are part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. CBS News reported on Oct. 29, 2021 that the United States still holds 39 people at Guantanamo Bay. Majid Khan, a former detainee there, publicly revealed for the first time the torture he suffered, including being beaten, given forced enemas, sexually assaulted, starved, and deprived of sleep. ""I thought I was going to die,"" he said, ""I would beg them to stop."" He said he was suspended naked from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused repeatedly with ice water to keep him awake for days. He described having his head held under water to the point of near drowning.</p><p>The independent panel of experts on human rights appointed by the UN Human Rights Council issued a statement on Jan. 10, 2022, saying that two decades of practicing arbitrary detention without trial accompanied by torture or ill treatment violates international human rights laws, and is a ""stain on the U.S. government's commitment to the rule of law."" Despite forceful, repeated and unequivocal condemnation of the operation of this horrific detention and prison complex, the United States continues to detain persons many of whom have never been charged with any crime, the experts said. The experts urged the U.S. to close the Guantanamo Bay prison.

My siblings and I fled because we were afraid. We entered the U.S illegally. We crossed the river, and once inside the U.S., we applied for asylum. </p><p>We were among the very few who were granted asylum. In 1988 I graduated from Bowie and studied at UTEP, receiving a bachelor's of science. — Former refugee at a press conference[1] in El Paso, at Annunciation House[2]I once volunteered at Annunciation House[3], in El Paso, during the 1980s. I was chipping away at my graduate degree in English, teaching as a TA at UT-El Paso, as well as working freelance writing gigs with both the morning and evening newspapers, teaching one-on-one conversational English to an engineer in Juarez (who was working for Packard Electric getting paid one-tenth the pay as his fellow Yankees), writing a couple of books, and being active in environmental and social justice issues tied to protesting the militarization of the border and the overuse of the Rio Grande as a toxic slough and drawing down of the Hueco Basin aquifer for golf courses. Heck, in El Paso during this time I even worked for Planned Parenthood helping write a media plan against a mean son-of-a-bitch who called himself a Jew for Christ who set upon the clinic (no abortions done there) mean as cuss religious zealots who tried to block women and families from seeking STD services and such.Ruben Garcia started the House in the late 1970s and by the time I got there, at Casa Anunciación, the dirty wars in Central America were really ramped up against teachers, unionists, activists, politicals on the left, priests, nuns and anyone questioning the right wing policies of US-backed governments and the thug henchmen of those administrations, the death squads in Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador, and the contras in Nicaragua. Part of the fallout created by those US-trained militarists, economists and lawyers who perpetrated that harm against their own people was that many small towns and villages - regular people of the land, la tierra - were being caught in the crossfire. Entire villages were told in the morning by the fascists to pack up and head out of their pueblitos by sundown. Many girls, women and old ladies were raped and murdered. Beheadings of husbands and grandfathers, fetuses cut out of bellies, and torture of anyone who was suspected of going against Death Squad Capitalism were the order of the day. As far as media coverage goes: My baseline was different than that of twenty-somethings today. When I was in my mid-twenties, in El Paso and working along the border, there were much more robust forms of journalism and ground-truthing reporting going on than anyone today in their twenties could image. The baseline was a more open, aggressive Press willing to pull away more of the onion layers to get to the truth. Really, many editors and most of the newspaper journalists had no issue with peering through the looking glass to uncover truth, and their motto was that governments do and will tell lies. Now comparing the number of print newspapers, dailies, and weeklies and monthlies, even magazines and broadsheets, newsletters, and the like that were inking up paper in my time, and then looking at the Press now, going on 38 years of study and my own battles as a writer, anyone young can never really know what has been lost in this impetus of the Press then who were striving for independence, in a good way. It's the old saws of not having their own boots on the ground then, not having an authentic real point of view because they never lived and worked then, what is termed liberally by me as the shifting baseline syndrome. I'm talking about small-town journalism, medium-sized market news, and quirky and unique monthlies. While the so-called liberal media (SCLM) was not liberal at all, what was happening in newsrooms and with editorial boards, for the most part, in the 1970s and Eighties was, compared to today, more nurturing to truth tellers, with a truer sense of why journalism's ethical code points us to looking at as many sides as possible to weigh in on editorial decision-making. Sort of akin to what a lot of people use as a baseline for liberal (sic) versus conservative, comparing today's neoliberal democrats, for instance, to someone like Barbara Jordan, or looking at Crypo-AngloZionist Republicans such as Ted Cruz today to so-deemed Rockefeller Republicans of old. When I was born, 1957, the Republican Party's platform was much more progressive and populist than that of the Pelosi-Schumer Party of the millionaires (or billionaires when looking at proverbial Dem Billionaire Michael Bloomberg). Get a load of this, 62 years ago: Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things, but their number is negligible and'-and the president says-'their number is negligible and they are stupid. —Dwight Eisenhower, Republican President The platform for 1956 under the banner of the Republican Party included fighting for workers, the right to form a union, for health and safety measures at workplaces, for a strengthened eight-hour work, for social welfare programs for individual citizens to be strengthened, and more and more positive programs along the lines of today's milquetoast progressives. Ike was backed by the Republican Party, and it was Eisenhower who fought to keep the tax rate for the very rich fair, which in today's baseline would be considered way too high and communist! For instance, the top income tax bracket in the 1950's was 91%. And, Eisenhower fought tooth and nail to ensure that it remained at that rate. Can you imagine Bernie Sanders or Obama or Clinton backing this? Forget the neocons, the professors of the Chicago School of Predatory and Culture-Destroying (brainwashing) Capitalism even wanting any tax rate other than zero percent (0.00 %) for the rich, for the corporations, who are now persons with full rights of person-hood. How many rich individuals and how many corporations pay no taxes today, and how many have tax shelters ('legit' mafia-style money-laundering outfits) overseas, in Cayman or Panama? We have winks and nods and complete red-faced debates and retorts against the accusation that the rich pay no taxes, or certainly not enough, with bald-faced defenses by tens of millions run-of-the-mill Americans who support their flavor of rich man/rich woman in America. Imagine, rooting for millionaires and billionaires? By welfare recipients or middle-class soccer moms. What does George Lakoff call it, Narrative Frames? For decades this was considered unAmerican to support the rich over the poor! That's one difference I have experienced - when I was a teenager and college puke, most people hated the rich for what they were. Many average working class people looked at rich as sociopaths who were only rich because they exploited the average American citizen. Add to the baseline shift from today versus back then: my bosses at newspapers were not multimillionaires, and many more newspapers by a factor of 5 or 10 in the 1970s and 1980s were independent and competitive, compared to 2019. Back then, the baseline was that many reporters were vying to get the scoop on real news stories. Truth and facts were a given; anything else rose to the level of pink slip offenses. That robust nature of things back then — even though for the most part, as a socialist and Marxist, I never did fit personally into any paradigm in a newsroom — was things that you'd never see printed today in the few small town newspapers left (there are hardly any left across America, anyway) were vigorously printed in many more newspapers back then. From Salon[4]: According to University of North Carolina's research, the country has lost nearly 1,800 local newspapers since 2004, and many more have lost the ability to comprehensively cover their communities. Rural counties with poorer, older populations are most at risk — 500 rural papers have shuttered since 2004. These communities are also less likely to see a digital start-up help fill the void — as funding for both for- and non-profit models are more available in metro areas, and many rural counties across the U.S. still lack broadband internet access, which is critical for delivering online news. More than 200 counties in the U.S. have no local paper, but that's just part of the story, or this new shifted baseline: Local ownership of papers is eroding big time. Get this — nearly one-third of U.S. newspapers and two-thirds of dailies are now owned by 25 companies. GateHouse Media is rapacious, buying up small-town papers. That means the news is controlled by Big Brother Being The Oligarchs, many times edited a thousand miles or more from the towns or counties that are supposedly being covered. Copy-editing and editorial decisions for GateHouse originate in Austin, Texas. It's the number one small and medium newspaper owner in the USA, and its model of 'efficiency' means many fewer reporters and a more insipid and irrelevant TV style content which is also replicated (shared) widely. Murders, celebrities, food, weather (not global warming) pet tricks, celebrity food, celebrity weather, celebrity pet tricks, celebrity murders idiocy of the umpteenth degree. I have a case in point: a massive militarized police presence was in Beaverton, Oregon, last April, resulting in closing the main road east-west, locking down schools and the Salvation Army facility I worked at as a social worker. There were civilian-clothed snipers with high powered rifles w/ higher powered scopes all over; dozens of multi-agency personnel out in public with pistols brandished, and two armored vehicles with gun turrets that rammed the offending ex-vet's big pick-up truck. He had just been evicted from the Salvation Army's homeless veterans transition center for suspect reasons. The entire homeless facility was bombarded with SWAT-outfitted police thugs, and no one was allowed to enter or leave the facility, creating high levels of anxiety with already PTSD-addled veterans and their homeless families. The veteran was shot seven times, after only a few hours of staged hostage negation-like stuff, even though he was alone, pinned in his own pickup truck. The Salvation Army leadership later said it was a coup for them (this bizarre religious organization) - 'Thank goodness we controlled the story and very few media outlets picked it up. We want to protect our brand in Oregon . . . as the number one non-profit.' Now, imagine if there had been one or two beat reporters, like myself in my teens and twenties, vying to find out what really happened and why so much force had been deployed for a suicidal veteran basically isolated in his pick-up who could do no harm to anyone but himself? My baseline would have been news coverage galore, and better yet, follow up coverage. Today, nothing, not even in the Portland, Oregon media market that serves millions of residents. And this is the Salvation Army, funded by the US taxpayer; i.e., VA paying for beds for those veterans to be housed. This is the shifting baseline syndrome, which is a sickness tied to outfits like the Salvation Army using PR flaks and using the fact there are no newspapers in Washington County to cover local news and this disturbing show of military force and what the implications of a military operation in their neighborhood might mean in the future. No less, against a veteran who was getting services from a well-known homeless center. Local news, and then news that has national and international implications, lost. Not covered. In the memory hole! Shifting baseline syndrome means the public gets shafted and the administrators and gatekeepers of information — PR and marketers and development officers - get to lie through their teeth, or in the case of my police-involved shooting incident (even that term is dripping with propagandist flavor), no one knew the ramifications of the Salvation Army's unprofessionalism and lack of trauma informed care leading up to the soldier's eviction and then the suicidal behavior and then the soldier almost killed, and now, recovering in County lock-up jail serving time. And he's still suicidal, untreated. Job well done by the keepers of the information flow. Shifting baseline disease. Read the three parts of my Salvation Army mess here, I[5] II[6] III[7]. In the 1980s, I had published pieces in small towns newspapers, and later in the El Paso Times and El Paso Herald-Post on Central American refugees, on people crossing the border seeking asylum, on groups, both religious and secular, helping undocumented people cross the border and get help once here and to apply for political asylum. Piece published on the front pages of many small town rags I worked for. My baseline then was we still had morning and evening rags, and weeklies, that debated hard the military's presence in towns like Tucson or El Paso. Debated hard the debasement of the environment through the unchecked developers razing the desert. Debated hard the values of community health, welfare, safety and well-being over the wants and desires of small and large companies coming into communities and demanding tax abatements, giveaway land schemes, and more-more-more from the public coffers to do their trickster capitalism to make more-more-more for the owners, CEOs and stockholders. Now Democrats and Republican alike rah-rah cheer trillions in military spending. Job creation and Hollywood America the Greatest masturbation. - I'm going back to Ike: In his final address to the country, in 1961, while still a five-star general, and still a believer in the American way, in American exceptionalism, in America's greatness (both sides of the political isle yammer on and on to show their patriotism), he did at least put into check the US military industrial complex: Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea. Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. —source[8] Now, I have to back up a bit to reset this essay: I continue today — just hitting 62 — to call this myopia and concerted erasure of knowledge and historical context (what Gore Vidal calls the United States of Amnesia) shifting baseline syndrome covering many aspects of my life, the life of America and the implications to the world that the US Empire negatively effects. I explain this concept daily as I go about living and roaming, learning and teaching, struggling and rejoicing. Here, illustratively: The baseline for divers like me, in the Sea of Cortes (called the Aquarium of the World by many then), for the 1970s and '80s: I was diving daily near San Carlos and Guaymas, out near Tiburon Island from the boat my buddy and I paid $500 from a lake fisherman from Phoenix. So, a typical dive - dozens of turtles of three or four species, dozens of moray eels of a dozen species; pinnipeds like sea lions by the hundreds; long beak and short beak dolphins by the dozens; hammerhead sharks by the dozen; over two hundred species of reef fish, crustaceans, and sponges and soft corals; brown pelicans by the hundreds; pelagic fish and groupers and barracuda and amazing surface fish, nudibranchs; and, well, in one hour dive, more than what any overpaid Avatar CGI technical wonk could create, let alone dream of. That's the baseline for an 18-year-old in 1975, me, a wanna be Jacques Cousteau and marine biology college major. Fast forward forty-four years, and the baseline of another Pablo diver, same age, well, now a decimated, overfished, multi-polluted ocean, with hardly a shadow of what I saw on typical dives in the 1970s. The baseline shifted, and today, the syndrome, in the shifting baseline syndrome/disease analogy, would be the arrogance, historical stupidity, and hubris to believe that a healthy and normal reef dive is what it should be as experienced in 2019. The syndrome and disease of shifting baselines it that it is most likely even smart biologists might be working on staving off further decline in an ecosystem based on the present baseline. What you don't see now normalizes one to see what they see now as the correct baseline to go by. Wrong. Now transfer the shifting baseline syndrome/disease to almost every aspect of US society: no, the baseline for police involvement in our lives is not a Gestapo, shoot to kill first force, where we all are in fear, while witnessing pigs murder Latinos and African Americans with impunity. Judge, jury and executioner, no, is not the baseline we should be stuck with or happy with. Baseline sickness now applied to what it means to be a student - my baseline was a university where faculty had freedom to teach, that more were on the tenure track, where students would be experimenting with ideas and learning, without fear of Goldman Sachs thugs hobbling them for life with $100 K debt or censuring like a Phil Knight of Nike fame or Monsanto do regularly to researchers. Yes, the baseline in 1975 when I was coming of age was that we COULD protest in the streets without fear of felonies, without being sprayed upon with tear gas and rubber bullets at every event; where cops were in small numbers, and there were no drones and militarized SWAT teams for peace demonstrations. Baseline was for 1975 one hell of a lot more book readers, more by a power of 10,000 regular thinkers, and more people who had newspapers in their hands and talked about local politics by a power of 1,000,000. Shifting baseline syndrome is now infecting every sector of our lives, where what is acceptable thinking, behavior, standard operating procedures and collective will NOW are so bastardized, retrograded and devolved that the conversation about anything on any tract - food-medicine-science-arts-law-education-international politics-community standards-health-safety-welfare of the environment-ownership-birth and death-cradle to cradle planning — is an effort in alien talk, as if people today are from a completely new set of gravitaional laws. Idiots call this the 'new normal,' another shifting baseline of not only bastardizing language but Orwellizing it. War is Peace, Lies are Truth, Stupidity is Smarts. New normal! Now, back to 'we all are illegal aliens,' where I helped push that bumper sticker in El Paso as a solidarity protest meme, to illustrate that no American First Nations leaders came together to endorse the free passage of all those whites to use their great Turtle Island as a haul-out like a bunch of molting fur seals. Here, my writing, 13 years ago, for Dissident Voice, just below. Talk about no shifting baseline for me, or in the case of this hatred of Mexicans and Central Americans, displayed by more than just Trump and his ilk. Oh, once you hit 50 or 60, the ramifications of this French doozy really sink in: plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose — the more things change the more they stay the same - It hearkens to the proverb, 'Turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo.'What is the Empire's status quo when it comes to people displaced by American Empire structural and military and economic and environmental violence? April 7, 2006:This Land is Their Land, and We Are the Illegal Aliens[9] By Paul. K Haeder, April 7, 2006 We are all illegal aliens.' It's a bumper sticker many of us on the frontlines of the fight against the United States' government's assault on Central Americans plastered on our car bumpers down El Paso way. That was in the 1980s.You know, when Reagan was running amok ordering his captains Ollie North, McFarland, Casper Weinberger, the whole lot of them, to send bombs, CIA-torture manuals and US agents in order to aid terrorist contras and other despotic sorts in killing hundreds of thousands of innocents in civil wars in Salvador and Guatemala and El Salvador. We worked with women and children who had witnessed fathers, uncles and husbands eviscerated by US-backed military monsters. Victims of torture, in Texas illegally. You know, what those brave Smith and Wesson-brandishing, chaise lounge Minutemen of today would call aliens. We worked with people in faith-based communities, mainstream churches, and non-profits throughout El Paso, Juarez and the general area known as La Frontera. Everyone I met working with in this refugee assistance stint had humanitarian blood coursing through their veins. We were proud of our law-breaking work — we gave refuge to terrorized and sometimes half-dead civilians. We were called lawbreakers by the Reaganites and the Minutemen of that time. Communists. Pinko-fags. Those were the good old days of low-tech surveillance and simple FBI lists. But what we did was human and humane, in the tradition of that very universal (with roots in Quakerism) belief in bearing witness and acting upon that which has been judged as unjust and inhumane. Of course, we were up against the laws of this land and coarse politically-driven judges who denied victim after victim permanent or temporary status while seeking asylum in the US. We have so many stories of people sent back who were at best imprisoned, and in the worse cases, mutilated, disappeared, and murdered. Guatemalan and Salvadorans, that is. My readers may not want to hear the narratives and visualize the descriptions of photos of those victims of torture. Ghastly things happened to teachers, nuns, medical workers and farmers, more heinous than what we've heard happened in the cells of Abu Ghraib. We were there to assist, but more importantly to bear witness to our country's terror campaign. Some of us got so riled up that later in our lives — me included — we hoofed it to Central America. Kicked around. Wrote articles for the few newspapers in this country that even cared about poor, misbegotten, displaced people of Latin America. But no matter how hard-nosed we became, or how much we could withstand the photographs of women's sliced backs and beheaded fetuses, we couldn't shake the images of the children of torture at this two-story refugee house, Annunciation House. It was full of scruffy-looking East Coast volunteers who had hooked up with Ruben Garcia, the House's director, through Catholic services organizations. It was their stint with public service, their spiritual duty calling. Part of their degree plans. But most were converted and slammed hard intellectually and spiritually by the violence their charges had suffered under in our name - as US citizens paying taxes. Those PTSD-induced cartoons those children drew sucked the air out of even the hard-ass border patrol guys who used to 'dump' the Central Americans at Ruben's door at all hours of the night. Who can believe it now, that once upon a time official INS and border patrol officers knowingly let their perps go — knew that Ruben and his volunteers could salve emotional and physical wounds of these tortured crossers. Their chance at freedom. Except for the piss-ant judges. And the memories of pregnant aunties being raped, their fetuses cut out alive, speared, and the laughing Reagan-loved military punks in the highlands and jungle. Annunciation House was bulging at 100 people — disheveled lives jammed in. Beans always cooking. Songs. Mattresses and piles of donated clothes. Guitars strumming. Gueros, the white ones, and the Chicanos would help with in-takes — asylum transcripts, translation, dotting all the i's and crossing the t's. Help with getting jobs. Odd jobs in the community. Help with making sure the refugees didn't get caught again. But it was always those by-the-letter-of-the-law jurists helping to confound the torture. More than 70 percent of our brothers and sisters seeking asylum in the US were denied entry by some fat cat, many times cocaine-sniffing immigration judge who usually had a friend in the back pocket of some Bush or buddy of Bush somewhere. Then it was trying to get the denied victims off to Canada without being caught. You remember, the Canada back then which used to open its borders to refugees, [the Canada of shifting baseline syndrome]. The judges and politicians and Minutemen all professed, 'Send them back. Those aliens broke our immigration laws.' But 'we are all illegal aliens' as a rejoinder went much farther than USA's mayhem in Mesoamerica. We worked in solidarity with the housekeepers, bricklayers, agricultural workers and so many other worthy Mexicans who worked their butts off in the US for little pay and much less respect. These were workers who crossed the Rio Grande to find low-paying jobs with American families and businesses — working for mayors, bigwigs, even on government contracts. In Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, elsewhere. With a wink and a smile by the American exploiters. Mojado — wetback. Squatter. Beaner. Illegal alien. These were the more tame epithets. But let's not kid ourselves about the genesis of this new round of empowered Latinos fighting against racist laws put forward by the dispassionate conservatives running the ship of fools in DC. This is not a country of legal immigrants. It's a country based on colonialists, undocumented white people who helped displace native tribes through broken laws and genocide. It's a country based on illegal occupation of native lands and on Mexico's lands, pure and simple. Colonialists protected by Federal laws that deemed free white people as the only ones who had the right to be fully-fledged citizens. Manifest Destiny was a violent racist act to seize lands illegally. Everything this country's current anti-Mexican and pro-Apartheid border war proponents stand upon — all that doctrine and those so-called laws — is based on illegally seizing lands of Native tribes. And worse — laws that 'removed' natives. Laws that starved natives. Laws that approved of eradicating native families, entire tribes. The current massive turnout of students and workers alike in this country's major cities is a testament to these Americans' backbone to fight this new exclusionary law — HR4377[10] — a Washington, DC-inspired racist act that has its roots in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Many Americans do express a certain humanity and dignity for the people many deem aliens, but it's not awe-inspiring that some citizens of Copenhagen, Denmark or Limerick, Ireland, disobey the so-called immigration laws of this country during their initial years as landed immigrants. Let's make no bones about the motives of Jim Sensenbrenne[11]r, the author of this racist House bill: He sees those brown-skinned south-of-the-border lettuce pickers, linen washers, house framers, and their US-born children as, what? 'Alien gang members terrorizing communities.' Anyone spouting that we are a nation of immigrants and laws has a disease, what George Orwell called the illness of double-think. And until those many white Americans stop spewing that this is their land, a land of their laws, and a land made for Christians, the racist Minutemen will ramp up their gun brandishing on the southern and northern borders. And racist politicians will continue to play on the fears of uniformed constituents and try to pass the 21st Century's racist exclusionary laws. I wonder what these modern-day Nazis would say about those children's cartoons — images of bodies floating in rivers. Blood-soaked church walls. Military men with their M-16s trained on men while others are sketched in their rape hunch. Beautiful jungle birds flying in the sky next to US-paid-for helicopter gunships spraying the corn and coffee fields below. Dead mommies cradling dead babies. Yeah, I'm an illegal alien. We all are illegal aliens, under the laws of these creeps in high office. Humanity and caring and simple benedictions for suffering so much, those are alien traits only held by a minority in this country of exclusion, and slavery. Yeah, those creeps on hate-radio and in the newspaper columns and on Capitol Hill, sure, they recognize all of us who see the lies and fight the injustice as aliens. And the children whose post-traumatic cartoons brought tears to men and women, some who had 'fought' in Vietnam. Simple Crayola colorings brought tears to a county sheriff who had survived drug runners shooting up his town and unearthed bodies. Yeah, we are all illegal aliens. Except them.

I am back at a job, and the pay is embarrassing, and the fact that I am in a rural county with rural thinkers and with a service economy tied to beach combing, fishing, crabbing and vacation rentals also contributes to precarity. <br/> You think I am ready to leave to go somewhere else, to some big sophisticated city, some harbinger of high tech and military industrial complex to find more sustainable and lucrative work? Each day, my skill sets, my background, all the ground-truthing and other on the job training, all the travel, all those deep learning moments in my life in several fields, all of that is mush to the masters of academia, the masters of companies that are small and large, getting on the gravy train of city, county, state, national and international money. Tax cheats and welfare queens and kings are those in the complex, the big C for the CRC, Corruption Racket Complex — military-banking-ag-energy-prison-pharma-education-medicine-mining-chemical-AI-surveillence-real estate-insurance-prison-legal-media-entertainment. <br/> Yep, bad that an environmental lawyer was under ankle bracelet house arrest for more than two years and faces six months in jail for contempt as a lawyer who sued the pants off of Chevron for killing and polluting communities south of this border. Sure, the hellfire and brimstone of this rotting empire is addictive, with all these blogs and newsfeeds and whatnot tapping into the lizard part of the collective American brain. <br/><br/>Judge Loretta Preska, an advisor to the conservative Federalist Society, to which Chevron is a major donor, sentenced human rights attorney and Chevron nemesis Steven Donziger to six months in prison Friday for misdemeanor contempt of court after he had already spent 787 days under house arrest in New York. <br/>Preska's caustic outbursts— she said at the sentencing, 'It seems that only the proverbial two-by-four between the eyes will instill in him any respect for the law' — capped a judicial farce worthy of the antics of Vasiliy Vasilievich, the presiding judge at the major show trials of the Great Purges in the Soviet Union, and the Nazi judge Roland Freisler who once shouted at a defendant, 'You really are a lousy piece of trash!' <br/> Original illustration by Mr. Fish <br/> So, note the 'proverbial two-by-four between the eyes' comment from this judicial devil . . . . From a multimillionaire 'judge.' Imagine that! If I told a pig that exact same thing, after stopping me for a dangling mud flap on my minivan, just think what might happen to me. Or if I told that she needed a proverbial two by four between the eyes to a judge during my trial or someone else's? Or, to the boss, uh? Or to the teacher if I was an 11th grader. Or, to the drill sergeant? Or the TSA guy smelling my feet at the airport. <br/> This judge is human scum, and while this is of national and international importance, I have been in courtrooms (local, small and midsized town) where women lost their children, where drug addicted got the book thrown at them, where homeless rough sleepers were fined and incarcerated, where people more sane than this judge were committed to mental ward. This is the truth about systems of oppression, about modern white civilization, a fucked up rule of law lawlessness. This is it in our world. But it happens every day a few ten thousand times. To we the small ass people. <br/> Now, multiple that by a factor a ten thousand — try suing Boeing, or Pfizer or FDA, or Ford, or General Mills, or Bayer, or Trump Towers or Bank of America, or Amazon, or Google, or the manufacturer of the air bag in the minivan or the pretzel maker your kid is choking on. <br/> Now, bring it back to a real perspective. Local, where cities have no money for infrastructure, where medical systems are threadbare at least, or missing altogether. No country for old men, for young people, for the sick, disabled, poor, mentally challenged, psychiatrically impaired. This is a country for no regular people. <br/><br/>Yet, we will hear the media mental midgets yammer on and on about us bumkins, us flyover fucks, deplorables, or deploying any other laundry list of pejoratives or socio-psych mumbo jumbo for their elite brains to find more ways to subjugate the many in the name of profits, and in the words of their deep alter egos — 'The world of elites and beautiful and worthy and good members of society have to deal with these useless breeders, breathers and eaters. Really, all we want is what's best for the masses, for these misbegotten, less than high IQ, and multiple-dysfunctional people who in some cases, well, don't mean to be useless eaters, breeders, breathers, existers. But we can corral them into good deeds, and we can make so much money from their faults, chronic illnesses, their low IQ's, their inbreeding, their constant bad bad bad decisions in life. Their mistakes and pain and dysfunction are our opportunity to make society the way we want it designed, with a few trillion of profits in greenbacks to boot. But we would never say this outright to Anderson Cooper or Oprah or NPR or what not.' <br/> But reality is always local, no matter how much bullshit college sports and pro football teams and idiotic Republican and Democrat lying and spewing interferes with their noggins. For example, the outfit I work with, as a social services guy, doesn't ask our clients — developmental and intellectual disabled adults — if they have had 'the jab,' but rather, they ask: 'If an employer asks you to provide proof of vaccination, will that be a problem?' <br/> That is the reality now — adults barely surviving, after their whole lives have been spent in special ed programs and being evaluated, separated, roomed, housed and institutionalized, and many coming from proverbial messed up families, dysfunction being the functional word — I have to navigate more of the same systems of oppression-poverty inducing-safety net fraying eating at our communities' very souls. The chances of getting part-time work in a field tied to the five F's (food, fur, factory, filth, foliage — restaurants, dog cleaning, warehouses, janitorial, and landscaping) are already slim, as so much is stacked against these folk. Think about the propaganda around 'those with developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to the covid so they need to be vaxxed first' ideology. <br/> Many clients were so scared that they were more or less forced into getting the Pfizer or J &amp;#38; J, both mRNA biomedical experimental treatments. Most live in supported housing, and most of these in group homes, sanctioned by the state, so the vaccine mandates are not just inferred, but demanded. Boosterism (booster x, y, z, omega) will continue to run rampant. More will be sick. Some will die, or course. <br/> The reality is I know people who are losing jobs, and they are not sitting on piles of cash like a lot of professionals you might read about that are opting out of the forced chemical jabs. These people do not have the luxury of taking a stand with unlimited credit card limits, or fully owned homes, or hobby gardens out back with the swimming pool. These are people who read up about this planned pandemic, who take precautions, who listen to experts. Their choice is to not get jabbed. <br/> Imagine, being a teacher, PhD in physics, after 20 years, and you have 130 accrued sick days (paid) and you refuse to do the jab but accept the draconian test and mask. You are still going to be fired, or put on unpaid leave, and those PTO days you have accrued, well, forget about them. <br/> 'LEAKED GRANT PROPOSAL DETAILS HIGH-RISK CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH[12] <br/>The proposal, rejected by U.S. military research agency DARPA, describes the insertion of human-specific cleavage sites into SARS-related bat coronaviruses.' (source[13]) <br/> This is reality for one of my friends. Forget about the death proclamations of the Death Cult of Fauci. This guy is criminal, and he has sold millions a bill of goods. This bill of goods is dangerous, deadly, injurious. <br/> A bill of goods, man, the lies, the continuing criminal enterprises, and then, remade, make overs, etc. Take these middle of the road news sites: Robert Scheer[14] is not my favorite, but this takes the cake, no, as he appears as Mister New York Times and Most About USA is Good Scheer. So, no doubts about this fellow joining up with the CIA, and then now in Holly-Dirt? <br/> This is the very celebrity culture that Chris Hedges[15] rails against. This is a sick little blurb here promoting Scheer's podcast of this criminal — CIA is a criminal outfit of the highest order. <br/> A former CIA officer and Emmy award-winning creator of the hit FX series 'The Americans' about two Soviet agents living secretly in Washington during the Cold War, Weisberg offers a refreshing perspective on the tense relationship between the two countries throughout his work. He joins Robert Scheer on this week's 'Scheer Intelligence' to talk about his latest book, 'Russia Upside Down: An Exit Strategy for the Second Cold War[16],' in which he examines how he, like so many Americans, got Russia wrong. <br/> The author tells Scheer about his childhood growing up in a liberal Jewish household in Chicago, Ill. before studying Soviet politics at Yale University and joining the CIA, eager to do his 'duty as an American' and fight what he considered then to be the 'evil' Soviet empire. Now, after years of writing fiction about the Soviet Union in novels and TV scripts, Weisberg has decided to reflect on the historical events that he briefly played an active role in during his brief time at the CIA as the Soviet Union was collapsing through a more critical, factual lens. Based on both his personal experience as well as detailed research, Weisberg dispels common misconceptions about Russia that he once held to be true in 'Russia Upside Down[17].' <br/> Here we go: More meaningless Hollywood-CIA-millionaire stuff that the average Joe in Tucson or Portland, in Kansas or Utah has zero connection to. But we get he is Jewish (hmm, why this?) a Yale graduate (Yale being a CIA-Imperialist school), and lover of CIA and USA (when he was young — what puke). Fiction writer, and now a book writer and TV series producer, wow, what a radical. This is the upper echelons of America Putridity, and you couple that with his millions thrown at him as a Holly-Dirt thing, and we have the mini-Celebrity fawning. <br/> Scheer Intelligence Is America's View of 'Evil' Russia Merely Projection?[18] <br/> More TV junk! <br/> I was at a hospital two weeks ago, and the nurses must have thought I wasn't awake (I never sleep in a hospital, in jail, or on a plane). They talked about the Samaritan Hospital system they work for introducing a 'no vaccine, no medical service' protocol. They did not sound happy about it. And here we have it yesterday: <br/><br/>Leilani Lutali, foreground, and Jaimee Fougner pose for a photo, Thursday, Oct. 7, 2021 in Colorado Springs, Colo. Lutali recently found out her hospital wouldn't approve her kidney transplant surgery until she got the COVID-19 vaccine. Even though she has stage 5 kidney disease that puts her at risk of dying without a new kidney. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)—source[19] <br/> A hell of a country, and a hell of a 'follow the science' kind of messed up system, no? Idiots of the Biden-Obama variety, like Thom Hartman, are yammering on and on about how these hospitals have a right to refuse un-jabbed folk. This is it for the liberals — you eat junk food, you drink booze, you suck on fags, you drive recklessly, you think this or that anti-Democratic Party thought, then we, the good beautiful, Hillary-Obama-Harris have a right to cut you off, cut you down, chop you off at the knees! <br/> Many people I speak with and communicate with are tired of the pro-pro-pro forced jab perspective we are getting from the leftist Counterpunch, and from St. Clair. <br/> I am referencing 'Roaming Charges,' Counterpunch, 10/8/2921, from the anti-science pro-some-science get-out-of-that-science's way thinking coming from some of the articles posted on the site. Very sad in many ways, so sad that there is not a robust discussion of the vaccination that we see on Dissident Voice, even Mint Press, and especially Off-Guardian and Left Skeptics. Here, bullet points, direct quoting from 'Roaming Charges': <br/> + I'm against any exemptions (our social contract should require either all of us to get it or that the jab be completely voluntary ), but if there's a religious exemption there should beone for philosophy,[20]too. 'Dr. Anthony Fauci says he's worried that people resisting COVID-19 vaccine shots based on religious grounds may be confusing that with a philosophical objection.' <br/> + Merck is selling its high-touted new Covid pill Molnupiravir, whose development was federally financed by NIH and the Department of Defense, back to the U.S. government for40 times[21]what it costs to make. <br/> + These people, if you want to call them that, seem to have taken their 'tactics' from the Westboro ('God Hates Fags') Baptist Church which used to (and I suppose still does) scream their godly obscenities at mourners during the funerals of people who died of AIDS. <br/> + Anti-vaxism is itself a kind of brain-eating virusA Cumberland, Maryland man murdered his brother and sister-in-law in their Ellicott City home last week because his brother, a local pharmacist, hadadministered COVID-19 vaccines[22]. <br/> + Cuba began vaccinating its population 150 days ago. In that time, it has administered192 doses per 100 people[23]. In contrast, the US began its vaccination program 297 days ago and has managed to administer only 119 doses per 100 people. The Covid death rate in Cuba is: 684 per million. The death rate in the US is: 2190 per million[24]. This seems to provide pretty clear evidence that the embargo has been placed on the wrong country for the last 60 years. (end quote) <br/> And therein lies the problem with fake leftists — attacking even doctors and virologists and journalists and educated/educators who have doubts about the entire pandemic and mRNA and coronavirus multiplicity of very pro-pro Capitalist and pro-pro Authoritarian and pro-pro Government Bureaucracy rhetoric. The reality is Cuba is not jabbing its people with mRNA: 'All of Cuba's vaccine candidates—Abdala, Soberana 1, Soberana 2, Soberana Plus, and Mambisa, are subunit protein vaccines, like the Novavax vaccine. Crucially, the vaccines do not require extreme refrigeration, are cheap to produce, and are easy for the country to manufacture at scale. They are made by fermentation in mammalian cells, a process Cuba already uses for monoclonal antibodies.' <br/><br/>Now, we are worried about more of the celebrities, this time, a professor who was sacked — <br/><br/> Academic Fired Following Israel Lobby Smear: David Miller Speaks Out w/ Lowkey[25] <br/>Now, think about any criticism against any university, when you are employed by the institution. I was employed by the University of Texas at El Paso. I was an English Department faculty, part-time, a radical, and I fought like hell for adjuncts, for students, etc. I was part of a group of students as a faculty member who made a human chain to stop the group of overweight sheriff posse dudes dressed up as Conquistadors on horses strutting on campus. That was 1992, the 500th anniversary of that evil contact we call Columbus Day. The El Paso Times ran a front page photo of these undercover cops jumping out of the bushes, and wrangling students, clobbering male and female with forearms to the neck. I was right in the middle, and I had to answer for myself to the Provost and president. <br/> This is what a university, then, in 1992, was encapsulated inside, under a rich white president, a campus that was and still is 80-plus percent Mexican-American, Latinx, now. You can't protest without our permission and our approval of signs! <br/><br/>This was a campus that introduced a free speech zone out of the way of foot traffic. A state sponsored school, with a limited small postage stamp of land near dumpsters where people can gain the public square for protesting. And the campus Nazis demanded permission, permits, and full written details of the 'protest' or 'information gathering.' Now, sure, talk about Covid, about Nuremburg protocol, about mandates, about those who have the jab and those who do not. Talk about NIH and Fauci and the shadowy origins of the SARS-CoV2, or the doctors who have protocols to stop not only Covid patients getting on ventilators, but getting patients out of the hospital and back home in recovery zone. Not allowed. <br/> These articles are verboten on campuses: <br/><br/>And, if I was still on that campus, how quickly would I be sacked for criticizing a campus- that pushes the Hispanic University of the World theme while colonizing Hispanics (mostly Mexican Americans) — for lock-step falling into the fold of the Corruption Racket Complex — military-banking-ag-energy-prison-pharma-education-medicine-mining-chemical-AI-surveillence-real estate-insurance-prison-legal-media-entertainment? This campus is the whoring field of military, aerospace, drone and weapons makers, and even more nefarious. What ugly optics! Four Star Murder Bomber Air Force General all smiles and the PhD's just lapping up the uniform! <br/><br/>So, back into that ground-truthing — try being a radical, a revolutionary, a critic of bureaucracies and corporate mandates and this sort of bullshit on a local level. UTEP is a sell-out, an embarrassment, but so are most all the colleges and universities in this shit hole. (Source[26]) I have gone up against every single college and university I have taught in. EVERY ONE. Can you imagine bringing this into the classroom — anti-war, anti-military, anti-corporation discourse and readings and critical thinking debates? Shit! Then, this? Pfizer Exposed![27] <br/> And while the big house is for us in the 80 percent, the ground-truthing in your neighborhood is littered with the poisons of that Complex, the Continuing Criminal Enterprise called capitalism. <br/> [The aim of the international bankers was] nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. <br/> — Professor Carroll Quigley, Tragedy &amp;#38; Hope, p. 324 (source[28]) <br/> Finally, another point from a friend: 'Fishy Felonious Fraudulent Fauci: Read Whitney Webb's latest.' <br/> During the panel[29], the moderator—Michael Specter oftheNew Yorker—asked the question:'Why don't we blow the system up? Obviously, we just can't turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say 'Hey! everyone in the world should get this new vaccine we haven't given to anyone yet,' butthere must be some way.'Specter then mentioned how vaccine production is antiquated and asked how sufficient 'disruption' could occur to prompt the modernization of the existing vaccination development and approval process. Hamburg responded first, saying that as a society we are behind where we need to be when it comes to moving toward a new, more technological approach and that it is now 'time to act' to make that a reality. <br/> Several minutes later, Anthony Fauci stated that the superior method of vaccine production involves 'not growing the virus at all, but getting sequences, getting the appropriate protein and it sticking in on self-assembling nanoparticles,' essentially referring to mRNA vaccines.Fauci then stated: 'The critical challenge . . . is that in order to make the transition fromgetting out ofthe tried and true egg-growing[method] . . . to something that has to be much better,you have to prove that this works and then you have got to go through all of the critical trials—phase 1, phase 2, phase 3—and show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years. That alone, if it works perfectly, is going to take a decade.'Fauci later statedthatthere is a need to alter the public's perceptionthat the flu is not a serious disease in order to increase urgency andthat it would be 'difficult' to alter that perception along with the existing vaccine development and approval process unless the existing system takes the posture that'I don't care what your perception is,we're going to address the problemin a disruptive way and an iterative way.' <br/> During the panel, Bright statedthat 'we need to move as quickly as possible and urgently as possible to get these technologies that address speed and effectiveness of the vaccine' before discussing how the White House Council of Economic Advisers had just issued a report emphasizing thatprioritizing 'fast' vaccines was paramount. Bright then added that a 'mediocre and fast'vaccine was better than a 'mediocre and slow' vaccine. He then said that we can make 'better vaccines and make them faster' and that urgency and disruption were necessary to produce the targeted and accelerated development of one such vaccine. Later in the panel, Brightsaid the best way to 'disrupt' the vaccine field in favor of 'faster' vaccines would be the emergence of 'an entity of excitement out there that's completely disruptive, that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes.' He latervery directly said thatby 'faster' vaccines he meant mRNA vaccines. <br/> The Bright-led BARDA and the Fauci-led NIAID in just a few months' time became the biggest backers of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, investing billions and co-developing the vaccine with the company, respectively. As will be explained in Part II of this series,the partnership between Moderna and the NIH to co-develop what would soon become Moderna's COVID-19 vaccinewas being forged as early as January 7, 2020, long before the official declaration of the COVID-19 crisis as a pandemic and before a vaccine was proclaimed as necessary by officials and other individuals. Not only did the COVID-19 vaccine quickly become the answer to nearly all Moderna's woes but it also provided the disruptive scenario necessary to alter the public's perceptions of what a vaccine is and eliminate existing safeguards and bureaucracy in vaccine approval. (Watch the 2019 Universal Flu Vaccine eventhere[30].) <br/> As Part II of this series will show, it was an alleged mix of 'serendipity and foresight' from Moderna's Stphane Bancel and the NIH's Barney Graham that propelled Moderna to the front of the 'Warp Speed' race for a COVID-19 vaccine. That partnership, along with the disruptive effect of the COVID-19 crisis, created the very 'Hail Mary' for which Moderna had been desperately waiting since at least 2017 while also turning most of Moderna's executive team into billionaires and multi-millionaires in a matter of months. <br/> However, Moderna's 'Hail Mary' won't last - that is, unless the mass administration of its COVID-19 vaccine becomes an annual affair for millions of people worldwide. Even though real-world data since its administration began challenges the need for as well as the safety and efficacy of its vaccine, Moderna - and its stakeholders - cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through fingers. To do so would mean the end of Moderna's carefully constructed house of cards. <br/><br/>The post Back at Ground-Truthing Again and Again and Again[31] first appeared on Dissident Voice[32]. <br/> [

That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" team have all the latest developments this went late tonight here in Washington and they take it from here. We'll see you tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: All right. We kick things off tonight with a Fox News alert.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Brand-new speculation over whether or not the Senate will call witnesses. Is the tide turning in favor of Republicans? And what about the rumors prominent democratic senators are considering a vote to acquit the president? Senator John Barrasso coming up live.</p><p>Plus, a member of the president's defense team.</p><p>Plus, the former attorney general is here, Jeff Sessions, launched numerous leak investigations during his time in the administration, so what does he think about John Bolton's decision to write a book what's being described as a tell-all? Well, he is live in minutes.</p><p>Also, a bipartisan legislative win tonight for President Trump, the new NAFTA officially signed into law. The president says it's a colossal victory for you, the American worker.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. We begin tonight with White House correspondent, Kevin Corke with the very latest from the impeachment trial.</p><p>Good evening, Kevin. It looks like it's still ongoing at this moment.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, still going on, we'll keep an eye on it for you.</p><p>Now, there is a growing concern this evening, Shannon, amongst Senate Democrats that not only do they lack the votes to force more witnesses on the Senate trial, they actually may have such a threadbare caucus that a number of them, it is feared, could end up voting with Republicans to acquit the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: It wouldn't take much. Just four GOP senators would have to join Democrats to produce the majority needed to call witnesses and extend the impeachment trial of President Trump. But even Democrats acknowledged, chances of that happening are slim to none. And none just started the car.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It's an uphill fight. Is it more likely than not? Probably no. But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.</p><p>CORKE: One Republican Democrats were hoping might defect Colorado senator, Cory Gardner, did know such thing today, writing in a statement that he didn't, ""Believe we need to hear from an 18th witness,"" referring to the 17 individuals called during last year's House impeachment inquiry.</p><p>And it's not just the fact that there are 53 GOP Senators who could quash the Democrats' hope of additional witnesses. You also have moderate Democrats like Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama, and West Virginia's Joe Manchin, whose votes could add an extra layer of protection for the majority.</p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): I'm a proud West Virginia Democrat, but I'm a proud American, and I am not going to make a decision. I want my president to succeed and do well. But I want him to live within the law and then not above the law.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES: As a matter of law. Does it matter if there was a quid pro quo?</p><p>CORKE: While there appears to be little appetite for more witnesses, at least among Republicans, senators from both sides of the aisle were still plenty eager to question House managers and the president's lawyers today. The beginning of two days and 16 hours of queries, and ahead of a crucial vote on witnesses and perhaps even more likely to come Friday.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Shannon, if -- and it is a very big if -- there are a number of Democrats who join Republicans in voting not only not to have more witnesses but ultimately to acquit the president, that would be a big boon for the White House because, ultimately, you may recall, they were pointing to the bipartisan nature of the opposition to the impeachment in the House in the first place as a reason this should never have happened going forward.</p><p>So we'll keep an eye on that as we continue to watch everything else that's happening here and on Capitol Hill throughout the week. Back to you for now.</p><p>BREAM: And these are long days and nights.</p><p>CORKE: Yes, indeed.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Kevin, thank you.</p><p>CORKE: You bet.</p><p>BREAM: Is it a signed momentum is shifting to the GOP on the issue of witnesses? Now that House Democrats are planning a last ditch effort, we're told, to try to force Chief Justice John Roberts to decide the issue? The congressional Democrats looking to force a vote on Friday and saying the chief justice may be forced to get involved.</p><p>Normally, Senate ties are broken by the vice president, but given his potential conflict of interest, that is not the procedure during impeachment trials.</p><p>Now, our own Chad Pergram says that the tie in the Senate amounts to a loss on the issue of whatever they're voting on. So still unclear whether Roberts would actually be forced to break any ties.</p><p>Well, tonight, it sounds like there's at least one GOP senator committed to voting in favor of witnesses. Here's Utah senator, Mitt Romney, what he's saying about one in particular.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): There are things that I'd like to get evidence on that we haven't seen. I mean, John Bolton, for instance. He may be able to tell us precisely when the decision was made not to provide the aid on an immediate basis to Ukraine and what the president's reasoning was at that point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Let's bring in the Senate Republican conference chair, now a Senate juror, Senator John Barrasso. A little inside scoop. Good to see you tonight.</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Thanks for having me.</p><p>BREAM: OK. You brought something very interesting for us. These guys are going to kill me, I don't know if they can get a look at it. But this is actually the card that you fill out when you have a question that you want. You mark whether you wanted to be answered by counsel for the president or the House managers.</p><p>It goes to the chief justice, and then he reads your question. So how has that been going today it's hours now into it?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, I asked question number 83, we're now, I think, on question number 90, closing down for the night. We're going to have another eight hours tomorrow of questioning. Essentially, you're talking about another 90 questions, five minutes to answer each one. And I think by that time, people will have heard enough. They will have learned what they need to know about this case, and the plan is for Friday to vote, and the momentum is moving to say, we've heard enough, let's move to final judgment.</p><p>BREAM: Now, last night at this time, we were talking about a report that Senate majority leader, McConnell, did not have the votes to hold off witnesses.</p><p>Tonight, we are hearing there are who have come forward, Senator Gardner was one that people were speculating about. It sounds like he's not going to go for witnesses. But there are several other in play. And numbers of them, I heard asking questions today, Senators Murkowski and Collins, and others. Where do you think they are in this issue?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, they'll speak for themselves. Yesterday, a number of senators said I want to hear the question, we'll have questions to ask, I want to hear the answers and how it's presented. We've had a long day of that.</p><p>I think one of the most telling questions was the one is, what happens if you open the Pandora's box of witnesses and go into no-man's-land, and it could go on, this trial, for months. And people say look, we've had enough. If you take a look at what the American people are saying, they said, they know the president is not going to be removed. They know that we're voting already in Iowa coming on Monday, and they are concerned about the amount of work that is not being done in this country because we're not allowed to work on anything else during impeachment, according to the constitution.</p><p>So we can't work on lowering the cost of drugs. We can't work on the highway bill. I chair the committee that oversees roads, bridges, tunnels. We can't do that. We can't work to help our veterans as long as this drags on. It is time to end it, and I hope we can do that, Shannon, on Friday.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Let's play something from one of your colleagues from across the aisle, Democrat senator, Sherrod Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): my colleagues need to grow some spine in the next 48 hours and vote for witnesses. It comes back to fear, that they are fearful this president will come into their states and campaign against them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So they say you have a fear that the president will turn on you. Bloomberg writing this under the headline ""After Trump's Acquittal, it Will Only Get Worse Republicans."" They say, ""The acquittal will mark the senators as political made men. It will be there induction into Trump's gangster ethos, using constitutional powers to enable corruption.""</p><p>So if you don't allow witnesses and you acquit him, that's what you are now supposedly guilty of.</p><p>BARRASSO: The people of Wyoming would tell you and people all across America. We're proud of the job that President Trump has done. Seven million new jobs in America since he's taken office. Lower tax rates. Highest rate of workers -- wages are going up. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high. New trade deals. Just today, USMCA signed by President Trump.</p><p>I proudly stand with this record of accomplishment for America. Well, this would never have happened with someone else in the White House.</p><p>BREAM: Let's talk about the three Democrats that are allegedly in play when it comes to actually acquitting the president. We'll put them on the screen, because they've gotten a lot of attention here.</p><p>What are the odds do you actually think -- this is not just a D.C. parlor game, but that one or more of that would actually vote to say we don't think this rises to impeachment? And not impeachment, but removal.</p><p>BARRASSO: This is purely a partisan political process that's going on now. The case is flimsy. The articles of impeachment really don't rise to the level of impeachment. So I would really welcome a bipartisan acquittal of President Trump, and I want to get that done this week, Friday, so we can get back to work next week for the American people.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Fox News poll, should the Senate vote to convict and remove President Trump from office? Taken of January 19th or 20th. So this is -- or 22nd. It's going to be before the Bolton alleged manuscript revelations.</p><p>Fifty percent say yes, 44 percent say no. I mean, have Democrats done a good enough job now convincing the American public he needs to go that if you vote against that, they're going to use that as a campaign against you?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, this is all been about the campaign. Even members of the House have said, if we don't impeach him, he might get reelected again. You've heard those reports. The president's record is very strong. The economy is strong. We have a strong, healthy, growing economy. The country is doing very well.</p><p>So this is an effort, I believe, not just to overturn the 2016 election, by removing the president, they are also trying to undermine the president for 2020.</p><p>BREAM: Well, we did hear the top House manager, Adam Schiff, say that this couldn't be left to the ballot box. So we'll see whether this wraps up Friday or it goes much longer. Thanks for taking a break with us. The questions continue, Senator.</p><p>BARRASSO: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. The impeachment trial now in a Q&amp;A phase, including some tough questions aimed at House manager, Adam Schiff, himself. Chief Congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel takes us through some key moments today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: This is a question for the council for the president.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Trump impeachment trial entering a new phase, written questions from senators submitted to the chief justice.</p><p>PATRICK PHILBIN, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: The proper process wasn't followed here, because it was a partisan and political impeachment that they wanted to get done all-around timing for the election.</p><p>ROBERTS: Does it matter if there was a quid pro quo?</p><p>EMANUEL: But the questions of mixture of political rhetoric and wonky constitutional law didn't break much new ground.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.</p><p>EMANUEL: The Q&amp;A session so far mostly allowed each side to reiterate some of their central themes.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): When you have a witness who was as plainly relevant as John Bolton, who goes to the heart of the most serious and egregious of the president's misconduct, to turn him away to look the other way, I think is deeply at odds with being an impartial juror.</p><p>EMANUEL: Schiff told senators he doesn't know who the whistle-blower is, but a White House attorney suggested the lead impeachment manager would be a relevant witness.</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: If Representative Schiff was called as a witness, would, in fact, then issues of speech and debate clause privilege be litigated?</p><p>Those would be the kind of issues that would be very, very significant.</p><p>EMANUEL: On the other side, impeachment manager, Jerry Nadler, dismissed President Trump's claim of executive privilege.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): That is the subject of article two of the impeachment, because that is a claim of absolute monarchical power.</p><p>EMANUEL: All of this putting the chief justice of the Supreme Court in an unusual role, like the host of a televised quiz show.</p><p>ROBERTS: Did anyone in the White House or outside White House tell anyone in the White House counsel's office that publication of the Bolton book would be politically problematic for the president?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: Tomorrow is expected to be another full afternoon and evening of question and answer session. Less preplanned and scripted, ahead of a critical showdown on Friday over witnesses. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: Mike Emanuel on the hill, thank you.</p><p>So President Trump celebrating another political victory tonight. A new North American trade deal passed in a bipartisan vote, now officially signed. It's an agreement the president is calling cutting edge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everybody said this was a deal that could not be done. Too complicated, too big, couldn't be done. We got it done.</p><p>In many ways, I keep my promises and I'm fighting for the American worker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying today signing was only possible because of Democrats.</p><p>Well, a surprise twist tonight in the sentencing of President Trump's first national security advisor. The Justice Department now saying probation for Michael Flynn would be a reasonable punishment.</p><p>Earlier this month, prosecutors were still arguing for prison time for Flynn.</p><p>Now, just today, Flynn's new legal team filed a scathing motion arguing that he should be able to withdraw his guilty plea altogether. Based on the argument that his previous attorneys provided him ineffective counsel, and ""We're in the grip of intractable conflicts of interest and severely prejudiced him.""</p><p>Well, he didn't leave the administration on the very best of terms, but he didn't feel necessary to go write a book about it. Former U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is on deck to weigh in about the alleged Bolton revelations, next.</p><p>BREAM: Late tonight, former national security advisor, John Bolton's lawyer is speaking out following the revelation that back on the 23rd, the National Security Council notified Bolton's attorney that his book manuscript contains top-secret information and can't be published or publicly disclosed in its current form.</p><p>Former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, warns the book could set a dangerous precedent. He's live in just a minute.</p><p>But first, correspondent Gillian Turner has been working for sources.</p><p>All right. Let's talk about this letter that went to the Bolton team. Is this standard issue? Or some on the left have been saying this is an outright threat from the White House, that's how they're characterizing it.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So as to what I know, Shannon, based on working on the NSC staff a few years ago, plus talking to sources now, who are really familiar with this whole classification review process, the letter from the NSC to Bolton's lawyer informing them that some parts of his book are classified is really very standard stuff.</p><p>They say it looks like all of the other letters the NSC sends to all authors when they determine there's information they're trying to publish that is classified.</p><p>Now, here's the important part of the NSC's letter to Bolton. It says his manuscript, ""Appears to contain significant amount of classified information, some of it classified at the top-secret level.""</p><p>They also go on to say the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.""</p><p>So according to people who know this stuff inside out, this language, this letter, all very standard. So all signs tonight, Shannon, are pointing to - - this is not really in any way a White House threat. It's really a civil service trying to get their jobs done and make sure classified information isn't leaked to the public.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So we know though that some of it was leaked, at least a characterization of the manuscript, not quotes from the manuscript, but do we know how that happened?</p><p>TURNER: So we don't know how it happened yet, but we do know at least who some of the players are who had access to Bolton's manuscript before it leaked. So we know there's Bolton himself, there's his editor, there's his lawyer, Charles Cooper, who sent his book over to the NSC, and then there's a few select members of the NSC staff that were reviewing it.</p><p>Now, the National Security advisor, Robert O'Brien, said today, it's not his people that leaked the manuscript to the New York Times. Take a listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: I don't think the book was leaked from the NSC. I'm pretty confident of that. So I don't know if there's another investigation going on about how the book was leaked.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Now, John Bolton's lawyer insisting that no one on their side leaked it, and they're blaming the NSC, saying someone who was reviewing this manuscript decided it was in the public's interest to know about it before the impeachment vote, and so they leaked it to the New York Times.</p><p>But Bolton's former number two over at the NSC, that's Fred Fleitz, says the leak is Bolton's fault no matter what because he writes this, ""I take Bolton and his staff at their word that they didn't leak the manuscript to the New York Times, but I believe they are still responsible for the leak, since Bolton's explosive book was sent over to the leak-prone National Security Council for a review in December 2019.""</p><p>So, Shannon, Fleitz is really saying there that Bolton shouldn't have sent this to them in the first place. I don't know what the alternative is, but he's saying that was a bad judgment call.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Well, this is definitely going to hit the charts near the top, because everybody's going to want to know, but we'll wait to see whether that date of March 17th actually happens.</p><p>TURNER: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Gillian, thank you very much.</p><p>TURNER: You bet.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, defending President Trump tonight, calling out former National Security advisor, John Bolton, for disloyalty, saying this book could set a damaging precedent.</p><p>Former A.G. joins us now. Jeff Sessions is also running for a Senate seat, which he has held before in Alabama. Senator, good to have you with us.</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS (R), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE FOR ALABAMA: Thank you. Good to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So I want to read something you said back on 2017, when you were the attorney general, you said, ""I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country.""</p><p>At that time, you had three times as many leak investigations going as the previous administration, the Obama administration.</p><p>But I'm just wondering, how the president goes on and conduct things like - - conducts things like foreign policy, national security. When from the beginning, the very beginning of his administration, there have been continued leaks.</p><p>SESSIONS: Well, there have been continued leaks, some of that was just sort of political leaks, but even those are wrong. Even though they may not be criminal.</p><p>So I think this is a very serious matter. I felt strongly that we ought to have a discipline within the Department of Justice and every other agency and the department in the government.</p><p>Most of the leaks, or many of them, the previous administration that had leaked secret information. So look, when I left the Department of Justice, people descended on me to write books, to be long interviews, you can tell your side of the story. You can push back.</p><p>But I believe that when you serve an administration, a president, you want him to succeed. You want to help him be successful. And if he feels at any point that someone else can do the job better, that's perfectly right for him to change those positions, and you shouldn't be in a fight with him.</p><p>It's unprofessional. It undermines the ability of the government to function effectively, and even if this information in Mr. Bolton's book, and I know John well, I don't think he -- I think he's a patriot. But I just got to say, any smart intelligence operative, even if it doesn't have top-secret information in it, can divine policies, tendencies, ideas of the United States government, and could help them in their activities.</p><p>BREAM: You know one of the debates going on in the Senate now is the most heated one is over whether or not he should be called to testify. He said, if the Senate subpoenas him, he will.</p><p>The Washington Examiner in a headline in a piece -- an opinion piece, the headline, ""Let John Bolton testify,"" says this. ""In Bolton, there is a willing witness who has direct knowledge of a story that has been the subject of public debate for months, and that involves the serious question of removing a president from office. The Senate should let him be heard.""</p><p>Now, he could show up there, the president could invoke executive privilege claims on any number of things. Do you think the Senate, if they're going to have a full and fair trial, need to hear from Bolton?</p><p>SESSIONS: Look, I think the case is insubstantial. I believe it's nowhere close, based on, if you assume the information that's out there is accurate, and I would assume that Mr. Bolton would do nothing more, as argued, than bolster that case, the fact, the facts don't support impeachment.</p><p>I think that Dershowitz arguments, the Ken Starr legal arguments are sound invalid. So I don't think the Senate needs to hear additional witnesses. They've brought forth the case. They've had 18 of them. The House didn't subpoena these issues, they didn't force the issue. And so I think that the Senate may well conclude witnesses aren't needed.</p><p>BREAM: OK. I want to play something from the top House manager, Adam Schiff, today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: But under no circumstances, do you go outside of your own legitimate law enforcement process to ask a foreign power to investigate your rival, whether you think there's cause or you don't think there's cause? And you certainly don't invite that foreign power to try to influence an election to your benefit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Congressman Elise Stefanik, whose a member of the president's defense team, says this. ""What a stunning turn of events today to hear Adam Schiff declare from the well of the united states Senate that it is impeachable for a sitting president to allow the Department of Justice to investigate a political rival's campaign."" She ends it, ""2016, Crossfire Hurricane.""</p><p>Any thoughts that you have on how this whole thing got started? Senator?</p><p>SESSIONS: I missed you on that.</p><p>BREAM: Just do you have any thoughts on how this whole thing started? Because you heard what Schiff said there about not using these investigations against potential political rivals.</p><p>SESSIONS: Yes.</p><p>BREAM: And the GOP says, hey, Crossfire Hurricane. Have you heard of it?</p><p>SESSIONS: Look, the way I see it is the president was concerned about everything he's ever done has been looked at with a fine-tooth comb, and so he's wondering why the son gets hired at this fabulous prize while Vice President Biden is running the Ukrainian issue.</p><p>The vice president demands that the prosecutor who is investigating the son be fired, he was fired, and then the new prosecutor dropped the case, the investigation.</p><p>So I don't think it's impeachable for him to say, goodness, this is horrible. I think that was the word he used on the phone call.</p><p>I just -- this is can't be impeachable, really. It's an interest of the United States has and our own integrity and also the money we give into the Ukraine. We want to be sure it's wisely spent and not thrown away on relatives of the vice president.</p><p>BREAM: Well, the arguments continue on the Senate floor, and another day of questions geared up for tomorrow.</p><p>Senator, good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>SESSIONS: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Brand-new developments on the coronavirus outbreak, as the calls for a travel ban involving the U.S. are growing tonight. What action the government is now preparing to take, next.</p><p>BREAM: Breaking tonight, President Trump announcing the formation of a Coronavirus Task Force, it's going to be led by HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Chief Breaking News Correspondent Trace Gallagher is tracking this case tonight from the West Coast Newsroom. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon, in an op-ed on FoxNews.com, Kansas City GOP Congressman Roger Marshall, who is a doctor says he's getting more concerned about the coronavirus, especially now that it might be hitting Middle America. Marshall is referring to a six potential case which is unconfirmed in his home state of Kansas.</p><p>Quoting here, ""The U.S. must continue to closely monitor and guard our ports of entry, citizens and travelers returning from abroad."" And on that note of flight carrying 195 Americans fleeing the outbreak in Wuhan landed at March Air Reserve Base, east of Los Angeles. All passengers have cleared to screenings with no signs of sickness.</p><p>They'll now be monitored for three days at March Airbase then be allowed to go home where local officials will check them during the 14-day incubation period. Though some passengers are choosing to stay at the base for the full 14 days.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump tweeted this, quoting: ""Just received a briefing on the coronavirus in China from all of our great agencies who are also working closely with China. We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments. We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7."" And U.S. companies in China are also responding.</p><p>Facebook and Apple have limited the number of hours their employees in China are allowed to work. And Google is temporarily closing its offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Google is also telling employees not based in China to leave China. This comes as the World Health Organization says the coronavirus spread outside of China is of ""great concern."" Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. MICHAEL RYAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HEALTH EMERGENCIES: The whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action and be ready for, for any cases that come either from the original epicenter or from, from other epicenters that become established.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGER: And WHO officials are now reconvening an emergency meeting to decide whether coronavirus has become a global health emergency. There are now more than 7700 cases in China, 170 have died. There are five confirmed cases in the U.S., Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Trace, thank you for the updates. So, amid growing concerns tonight, the White House reportedly considering a plan to suspend all direct flights to and from Mainland China. Joining us now, Fox News Contributor Lesley Marshall and Host of ""THE NEXT REVOLUTION"" right here on Fox News, Steve Hilton. Welcome to both of you.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, I want to -- this is a quote from an ex-FDA chief about this. He worries that China could be underestimating Coronaviruses, Coronavirus cases by 10s of thousands. Quote, ""I think we're dramatically under estimating cases in China by tens of thousands. I think the Chinese haven't been fully sharing. Steve what's your take?</p><p>HILTON: Well, I think that tends to be true in these cases, where the symptoms are often flu-like symptoms that in the first instance that people tend not to go to the doctor with anyway, so that that could also be true here in America. But I think the point, I think we should all remember, is that actually -- well, there's two things I think we should focus on.</p><p>First of all, the response here seems to be exactly the right kind of level. In other words, very serious. And I think the President is right there. We do have great agencies; we do have great expertise. There is a kind of playbook for how to deal with this. Unfortunately, you can't be sure yet, whether that's going to work because they're all unpredictable, and probably be weeks until we really know whether this is going to be contained like SARS was the last big one, or whether actually it's going to be something much more frightening, but we also need to think about the cause.</p><p>All of these viruses that cause so much devastation both human and financial around the world over the last few decades, they've all come from China. They've all been caused by their practices, in terms of how they handle animals and so on. They all originate there. And that is a big question we should be focusing on too.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, because there's been talking about the animal to human transmission and now more and more these human-to-human transmission cases. Just to give some stats there want to put this up so people can have a reference. The corona and flu virus comparisons this year. This year on the coronavirus, 170 deaths in China. 7,711 cases that we know about in China.</p><p>Now, flu this season at 200 deaths in the U.S. alone, more than 15 million cases. Leslie, just to give us a little bit of perspective there. You know, it's hard to know in these early days exactly what the truth is, how far it's going to spread and how you can stop it.</p><p>MARSHALL: So, there's so many things here and I agree with everything Steve said so far. Look, there was something that I retweeted today, which is be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus. We have a lot of people in the United States who don't get flu shots.</p><p>And my husband who's not huge into vaccines says you got to get the flu shot, but it goes even further. When we look at China, it's filthy. And when we talk about filthy, when we have filthy air or filthy water, when we don't respect the environment and keep it clean, these things feed into this.</p><p>In addition to that, we feed it that with what we feed ourselves, in our bodies. My husband and I have spoken about this, you guys know he's a physician. And he said, look, when we're when we're treating our animals and eating animals that are treated with antibiotics, or with hormones, we're messing up our immune systems.</p><p>Our immune systems should be strong enough to fight these viruses, but between our environment and what we're eating, and how we're processing our food, and we don't know where it's coming from, or what's happening to it, and how it gets here, and this is a big problem, and this is why they'll come up with vaccines, and then there's a new strain of flu or a new strain of a virus that can't be contained and that's right now while doctors worldwide, World Health Organization are struggling to find a vaccine for this.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and Senator Tom Cotton saying this: ""It appears that this coronavirus has a long incubation period and asymptomatic persons may be able to transmit the virus. Given these dangerous circumstances, a targeted travel ban is warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control."" What do you think Steve?</p><p>HILTON: Yes, I agree with that. I just want to say how strongly I also agree with everything Leslie just said -- broadening it out to our whole approach to food. I really agree with that. It's a big issue. And I think we should talk about it more, not just at these times of crisis. I think the senator is right. I think there's, you know, you can't be too cautious here. I think the point is, you got to try and clamp down on the spread of something like this in these early days when you've still got a chance of trying to limit it. And so drastic action, like stopping travel, I think is definitely warranted right at this moment over the next few weeks.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and there are cases around Europe as well here in the U.S. and beyond. So, we'll continue to monitor it. Thank you both for coming to talk about something relatively apolitical tonight. Leslie and Steve, good to see you both.</p><p>MARSHALL: Good to see you, Shannon. Thank you.</p><p>HILTON: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic House Manager leading impeachment says, he's not met or had any contact with the whistleblower. President Trump's defense team member Congressman Mike Johnson will respond to that next. But first, the ""WESTERN ROUNDUP.""</p><p>U.S. Border Patrol uncovering what's believed to be the longest smuggling tunnel ever, stretching from Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego. The tunnel extending more than 4000 feet. Field a sophisticated cross border drug smuggling operation featuring a rail cart system and forced air ventilation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CALLERY, SPECIAL AGENT, DEA: The tunnel discovery is another drastic reminder of how serious the drug problem is, and how the cartels will take risk and expend endless amounts of money to get deadly drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine into the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: An apartment building in Los Angeles bursting into flames prompting more than 100 firefighters to help people trying to escape. They've been rescued a man hanging on the side of the building. Helicopters lifting people from the rooftop, rooftop as well. The fire injured eight people including a 3-month-old baby. The case is under investigation.</p><p>A California Democrat wants to raise the age that suspects are automatically tried as adults to 20. Under current law, it's generally 18 though in some cases, suspects as young as 16 can be charged as adults. The lawmaker claims at science backs or idea that people really aren't fully formed mentally until their mid-20s. Plus, they can't buy alcohol and tobacco until they reach 21.</p><p>And tonight, Vanessa Bryant breaking her silence for the first time on the death of her husband, Basketball Legend Kobe Bryant and their teenage daughter. Bryant says her family is completely devastated, but she's so thankful for the outpouring of support from millions of people. Vanessa Bryant is also working to help the other families who were affected in the deadly California helicopter crash announcing the Mamba on Three Fund to help them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: I don't know who the whistleblower is. I haven't met them or communicated with them in any way. The community -- the committee staff did not write the complaint or coach the whistleblower what to put in the complaint.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Key line of questioning by Republican senators for the House Democrats lead impeachment manager: Did Congressman Adam Schiff coordinate with the whistleblower whose complaint set this whole thing in motion in any way? Well, Schiff denies contact but the Washington Post gave him four Pinocchios for claiming that his committee had not spoken to the whistleblower. So, let's bring in Republican Congressman Mike Johnson from Louisiana, Member of the President's Impeachment Defense Team. Good to have you back with us tonight.</p><p>REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Glad to be here.</p><p>BREAM: When Chairman Schiff made that statement today, how did that go over with your team?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I was with the impeachment defense team and the workroom right outside the Senate chambers, it's the Vice President's office we converted to a battle station and when he said that, we were all watching on a big screen and there was a collective sigh in that room. He doesn't have any credibility on that issue. He's changed the story several times along the way. And it's quite clear to anyone who looks at that, that at least the staff helped the whistleblower draft that complaint, if not Schiff himself.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, Senator Rick Scott, a number of the senators put out questions that we're going to submit today. He has this one, he says: Why has the Senate been denied access to the transcripts of Inspector General Michael Atkinson's testimony before the House Permanent Select on Intelligence relating to the whistleblower and the original complaint?"" We're just starting to hear more and more about this.</p><p>He says, every minute -- member of the Senate holds the requisite security clearance, they need to see that and they can't get their hands on it. But there, I know, Republicans are limited, even those who have seen it and are part of that committee about what they can say publicly. But it's being characterized as something that will not be good for Schiff with respect to the genesis of this whole thing and the whistleblower. Are we ever going to see that?</p><p>JOHNSON: That's certainly what I believe. And, and I tell you, I have the same problem that the members of the Senate do, because even though I'm the ranking member on the Constitution sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee, which is the committee that has jurisdiction over impeachment, I haven't been able to see that yet either, because that was one of the documents they collected in the super-secret hearings in the basement engineered by Adam Schiff.</p><p>We have a real problem with that, and that's why the defense team has been explaining to the Senate that there's a large number. Two-thirds of the Republicans in the House Representatives who are supposed to vote on impeachment, have never seen any of that information and that one is among the most important documents.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, Law Professor Lawrence Tribe who clearly is not a fan of this president. Some tweets today, he says Alan Dershowitz just argued that a president who believes only he can fix it, who thinks his reelection is vital to the nation can't be impeached for abusing his power to corrupt the next election in his favor, because by definition, he's doing what he thinks is best for the country says: ""Accepting this argument would put us on a short path toward dictatorship benevolent or otherwise, it's incompatible with government of by and for the people. It's government, by ego mania.""</p><p>JOHNSON: No. What, what Professor Dershowitz was trying to explain is the very problem with this amorphous abuse of power Article of Impeachment. The reason that we've never allowed that, we haven't had an impeachment solely on that basis before is because it is so open to subjective definition.</p><p>And if you go down that road, you open a Pandora's box and every president from now on is going to have to be looking over their shoulder to wonder when that trigger is going to be pulled. The bar is now set so low, abusive power can be defined any number of ways.</p><p>And that's the reason the founders warned us against this. They didn't want a single party impeachment. And they didn't want it to be for anything that so loose and harder to find like that.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Chairman Adam Schiff, also had this to say about this argument that to impeach someone is to overturn an election of somebody who was rightfully elected. Here's his response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: The argument? Well, if you impeach a president, you are overturning the results of the last election, and you're tearing up the balance in the next election. OK, if that were the case, there would be no impeachment clause in the Constitution. Because by definition, if you're repeating a president, that President is in office has won an election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Does he have a point?</p><p>JOHNSON: It's silly! The impeachment clause, article two section four, every civic student, everybody at home can read this for themselves, Google it and see the language is very clear. You need treason, bribery or a high crime or misdemeanor. The problem that Schiff has, and the reason he's going to these crazy arguments is they haven't alleged any of that, they haven't alleged crime at all.</p><p>And certainly nothing that's an impeachable offense. And I think our defense team has done an exceptional job laying that out, explaining it very carefully. I think they've answered every conceivable question that the senators could have. And I think that we're heading towards an acquittal that may happen as early as Friday.</p><p>BREAM: OK about that. The next step obviously is going to be the vote for witnesses after another day of questions tomorrow. There's been so much speculation about the GOP, whether they would be able -- Mitch McConnell be able to hold together his gang on that vote. Last night, we were told it wasn't looking good. Tonight, we're told for GOP it's looking good. What's your sense at this hour?</p><p>JOHNSON: We believe that it is looking good. I think that common sense will prevail. I think they know that if we go down that road, there's no in to it. It's a, it's a serious problem for the whole country. It could drag on for months. They'll have all sorts of internal legal battles about the scope of executive privilege and who can testify and under what circumstances. And I don't think the country can, can, can handle that. I think the, the ramifications of it are too great for everyone and it puts us on a bad place.</p><p>BREAM: There are some polls showing impeachment fatigue -- well, scandal fatigue. I think people losing track of what's going on. But it's important work for the Senate. So, we'll continue to watch. Congressman, thank you for coming in.</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, 2020 hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, unveiling a plan including criminal penalties for people who spread what she's calling fake news, details next.</p><p>BREAM: Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiling a new plan tonight pushing for civil and criminal penalties for knowingly spreading false information online with regard to voting. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich is live in Iowa with details. Good evening, Jacqui.</p><p>JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Yes, Senator Elizabeth Warren's got some ground to make up five days out from the Iowa caucuses. An Iowa poll out today has her lagging in fourth place behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg but the poll also asked caucus goers to name a second choice and combined with initial preferences.</p><p>Warren's in second, only Biden ahead, and nearly half the voters said they could switch support on caucus night. Warren is hoping her new plan to fight online disinformation will help win them over reminding people of Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election promoting fake news and saying it disproportionately affected black voters. Warren, off the campaign trail for the impeachment trial tweeted: ""Disinformation and online foreign interference erode our democracy and Donald Trump has invited both.</p><p>Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 election must be fully prepared to take this on, and I've got a plan to do it."" Her three-part proposal includes criminal and civil penalties for online voter suppression efforts, pledges to restore cyber security oversight at the National Security Council and calls on social media companies and other campaigns to crack down on deception. Iowa caucus goers say online disinformation is a problem but regulating the Internet has its own obstacles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HYDE, IOWA VOTER: I actually -- during the last election because it got so vitriol that I took myself off every one of my social platforms.</p><p>LARRY PETERSON, IOWA VOTER: False information is probably the biggest evil in our political system right now. And how you root that out? I don't know I think there's going to be some kind of regulation with the Facebook as like a public utility, but I don't know exactly how to do that with the First Amendment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEINRICH: Warren's plan comes after promises last week to investigate the Trump administration and remove Trump appointees if she's elected. But when it comes to ferreting out fake news, she's not the only candidate who's taken on the online world. This summer, Biden said his campaign won't use bots to attack his opponents or spread disinformation. And earlier this month, he said online companies shouldn't be protected from lawsuits over their users' posts. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Jacqui Heinrich live and Iowa. We'll see you there in a few days. Thank you.</p><p>All right. In August, during the shooting at an El Paso Walmart were 22 people were killed, a man stepped up to save a baby carrying them outside the store to emergency responders. So, according to the El Paso Times, he then ran back in to try to help the wounded but no one knew who he was. They'd been searching for him.</p><p>The mystery man has finally been identified as Lazaro Ponce, who was homeless at the time staying at a camp with his wife near the Walmart. The FBI tracked him down in Memphis. He's a day laborer who has been struggling with homelessness. But Lazaro Ponce, you were being hailed by many people, as tonight's ""MIDNIGHT HERO.""</p><p>Most watched, most trusted, most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">FOXNWS-2020012901cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5Y3G-1BP1-DXH2-62XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2022-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""7717""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=""29"" month=""01"" year=""2020""><dateText>January 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""typeofdoc""><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""95""><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""organization""><classificationItem score=""55""><className>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""95""><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""95""><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Political</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Leaks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Witnesses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wuhan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>WHO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Virus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health Emergency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Adam Schiff</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trial</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Quid Pro Quo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>False Information</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Online</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iowa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Caucus</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem score=""50""><className>Criminal Law &amp;

JOE HAGAN traces his winding path and asks if O'Rourke could become America's first punk president</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=""true"">It's nine P.M. on a Thursday night and Beto O'Rourke is trying to manage a couple of life-altering and possibly world-historical political events while also driving his family home from a Mexican restaurant. Donald Trump will touch down in O'Rourke's hometown of El Paso in four days to hold a rally and whip up excitement for a wall along the border with Mexico. O'Rourke's iPhone is pinging with texts asking what he plans to do about it-and also whether he's going to run for president of the United States of America.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Henry, age eight, weighs in from the back of the Toyota Tundra.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">""Dad, if you run for president, I'm going to cry all day,"" he says.</p><p>""Just the one day?"" asks O'Rourke, hopefully.</p><p>""Every day,"" says Henry.</p><p>Daughter Molly, freckle-faced and clever, astutely observes, ""The White House is going to be all wet."" Earlier that day, the 10-year-old declared cheerily, ""I want to live in the White House!"" O'Rourke's eldest, 12-year-old Ulysses, named for the hero of the Homeric classic that Beto O'Rourke has said he cherishes, delivers the final word: ""I only want you to run if you're gonna win.""</p><p>For a potential presidential candidate, Trump's visit is a gift, but one that could easily be bobbled or squandered. O'Rourke is trying to organize a counter-rally, but he is meeting stiff resistance from local activists whose big idea is to stage a protest outside Trump's rally. ""They're insisting on their event. They just want us to come in and support,"" he tells me. O'Rourke thinks a protest is exactly wrong and would play right into Trump's hands. ""I gotta think, What does his team want?"" he says of Trump. ""What are they expecting us to do? Some calculation went into this. So is that what they're looking for?""</p><p>Characteristically, O'Rourke wants a more optimistic approach, one that doesn't let the president define the terms. And so he'll spend the next 24 hours carefully steering allies to his idea of staging an upbeat ""March for Truth,"" which would just happen to star El Paso's best counter-argument to Donald Trump: himself.</p><p>And it will all work out-if he can just keep his eyes on the road. ""Motherfuckers!"" he says after darting into a busy intersection while ferrying the brood home from school that day. Then he catches himself: ""Sorry, kids.""</p><p>Beto O'Rourke's Mission-style home in the El Paso neighborhood of Sunset Heights is the site of a famous 1915 meeting between Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa and U.S. general Hugh Scott. While renovating it, O'Rourke had a wrought-iron fence around the property removed, save for a few feet of it around a pistachio tree. In late February, he came home to find Republican protesters live-streaming video and asking why he still had a fence, mimicking Trump's remark that politicians like walls when they're around their own homes. ""I said, 'Come up with me and I will take you to our front door,' "" he recalls. "" 'This is just decorative fencing.' ""</p><p>""Why do you have walls in your house?"" they retorted. ""Why do you have a door?""</p><p>Behind the door, in the O'Rourke living room, a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf contains a section for rock memoirs (Bob Dylan's <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Chronicles,</emphasis> a favorite) and a stack of LPs (the Clash, Nina Simone) but also a sizable collection of presidential biographies, including Robert Caro's work on Lyndon B. Johnson. Arranged in historical order, the biographies suggest there's been some reflection on the gravity of the presidency. But there's also some political poetry to it, a sense that O'Rourke might be destined for this shelf. He has an aura. Most places he goes in El Paso, he's dogged by cries of ""Beto! Beto!"" Oprah Winfrey, who helped anoint Barack Obama in 2008, practically begged him to run at an event in New York City at the beginning of February.</p><p>Settling into an armchair in his living room, he tries to make sense of his rise. ""I honestly don't know how much of it was me,"" he says. ""But there is something abnormal, super-normal, or I don't know what the hell to call it, that we both experience when we're out on the campaign trail.""</p><p>O'Rourke and his wife, Amy, an educator nine years his junior, both describe the moment they first witnessed the power of O'Rourke's gift. It was in Houston, the third stop on O'Rourke's two-year Senate campaign against Ted Cruz. ""Every seat was taken, every wall, every space in the room was filled with probably a thousand people,"" recalls Amy O'Rourke. ""You could feel the floor moving almost. It was not totally clear that Beto was what everybody was looking for, but just like that people were so ready for something. So that was totally shocking. I mean, like, took-my-breath-away shocking.""</p><p>For O'Rourke, what followed was a near-mystical experience. ""I don't ever prepare a speech,"" he says. ""I don't write out what I'm going to say. I remember driving to that, I was, like, 'What do I say? Maybe I'll just introduce myself. I'll take questions.' I got in there, and I don't know if it's a speech or not, but it felt amazing. Because every word was pulled out of me. Like, by some greater force, which was just the people there. Everything that I said, I was, like, watching myself, being like, How am I saying this stuff? Where is this coming from?</p><p>""There's something that happens to me,"" he says, ""or that I get to be a part of in those rooms, that is not like normal life. I don't know if that has ever happened to me before. I don't know if that would happen again.""</p><p>At 46, O'Rourke is only a couple of years younger than former rival Ted Cruz. But part of the excitement, and the content of his potential candidacy, is generational. Whereas Obama is from the tail end of the baby boom, Beto O'Rourke is quintessentially Generation X, weaned on <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Star Wars</emphasis> and punk rock and priding himself on authenticity over showmanship and a healthy skepticism of the mainstream. He came of age in a world of crumbling taboos over personal revelation, which has clearly peaked with Donald Trump, whose relentless Twitter habit has basically set the table for O'Rourke's open-book style. Whether onstage or on Facebook Live or in person, O'Rourke has a preternatural ease. That openness is part of what he loves about campaigning. ""I think that's the beauty of elections: You can't hide from who you are,"" he says. ""The more honestly and directly you communicate to people why you're doing this, the way in which you want to serve them, I just think that the better, more informed decision that they can make.""</p><p>If the message is honesty, the medium is, patently, social media. O'Rourke speaks admiringly of Bronx-born congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom he shares some overlapping political convictions but also a talent for the sort of viral disclosures and vignettes, delivered on Twitter or Instagram, that are disrupting national politics. ""She does not seem to me to be afraid of making a mistake, or not saying it perfectly,"" he says, ""and in the process says the most important-I think some of the most important-things anyone can be talking about right now, and she's freed herself from fear.""</p><p>A candidate of honesty and basic decency, à la Jimmy Carter, is in high demand among a lot of Democrats looking for optimal results in 2020, as is that sense of generational shift that powered Democratic campaigns dating back to John F. Kennedy (whose <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Profiles in Courage</emphasis> is in O'Rourke's library). But O'Rourke's radical openness can also look like naïveté, as with his Instagrammed teeth-cleaning, which was quickly clipped, isolated from its context, and made to look ridiculous. Skeptics question whether O'Rourke's political transcendentalism can sustain the meat grinder of a national election. In a Democratic primary, he will not have the bogeyman of a Trump or a Cruz from which to draw voter energy. He is decidedly not the street fighter many Democrats crave. And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Ted Cruz in last year's Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss.</p><p>O'Rourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability-being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color, a Kamala Harris or a Cory Booker. ""The government at all levels is overly represented by white men,"" he says. ""That's part of the problem, and I'm a white man. So if I were to run, I think it's just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. If I were to run, if I were to win, that my administration looks like this country. It's the only way I know to meet that challenge.</p><p>""But I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think that's a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.""</p><p>O'Rourke is careful to pay homage to progressive icons, crediting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with advancing the national conversation on health care and consumer protections, but sells himself as something slightly different: a youthful uniter, willing to listen and learn from the most recalcitrant right-wing voters and work with Republicans. ""If I bring something to this,"" he says, ""I think it is my ability to listen to people, to help bring people together to do something that is thought to be impossible.</p><p>""My sense is, following some success that I had in Congress, and working with Republicans to actually get things signed into law, including both President Obama and President Trump's administrations, that I may have an ability to work with people who think differently than I do, come to a different conclusion that I've come to on a given issue, and yet find enough common ground to do something better than what we have right now.""</p><p>A few days before Trump arrives, while meeting with students at the University of Texas at El Paso, O'Rourke compares the battle against Trump to ""every epic movie that you've ever seen, from <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Star Wars</emphasis> to <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Lord of the Rings.</emphasis> This is the moment where we're going to win or lose everything."" O'Rourke likes to think in such mythic terms. As he quipped on the campaign trail, he named his son Ulysses because ""I didn't have the balls to call him Odysseus."" But in a private meeting with Barack Obama last November, the former president had asked Beto O'Rourke to consider if he had a clear path to the White House. Could he deliver Texas? Michigan? Pennsylvania? Wisconsin?</p><p>""I don't have a team counting delegates,"" O'Rourke says, again invoking a politics not readily accessible by reason. ""Almost no one thought there was a path in Texas, and I just knew it. I just felt it. I knew it was there, and I knew that with enough work and enough creativity and enough amazing people, if I'm able to meet them and bring them in, then we can do it.</p><p>""That's how I feel about this,"" he says. ""It's probably not the most professional thing you've ever heard about this, but I just feel it.""</p><p>After dueling rallies in El Paso last February-O'Rourke's ""March for Truth"" versus Trump's ""Finish the Wall""-Trump was quick to declare his crowd sizes larger and deem O'Rourke an unworthy failure. But Trump's choice of El Paso for a rally had already created a story line, giving new relevance to O'Rourke and his ideas. His vision of the border-and for America, too-is rooted in the El Paso he grew up in. Before 9/11, the Texas border with Mexico was essentially open. In 1986, his father, Pat O'Rourke, an El Paso politician, told Bill Moyers on CBS: ""When I was six and seven years old, I didn't know I wasn't a Mexican. When I was a kid, I'd get on the streetcar and go to Juárez and go to the <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">cine,</emphasis> the movie, over there. That's my community. These people are my friends, they're my neighbors.""</p><p>Nowadays, Beto O'Rourke seems to have embraced his father's local globalism. But he spent much of his youth trying to escape the influence and legacy of Pat O'Rourke, before returning home to embrace his heritage and redeem his father's political failures. When I first met O'Rourke, he showed me a framed snapshot of his father standing atop a mesa, a denim-wearing southwesterner who looked a bit like Jimmy Buffett, bald with blond locks and a wild-man grin. An avid outdoorsman and runner, Pat O'Rourke ran a series of small border businesses, or <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">maquilas,</emphasis> that drew on the cheap labor in Juárez. They all failed. What consumed him was politics. O'Rourke became county commissioner in 1978 and, after building a new jail in the 1980s, won a race for county judge (in Texas, a management job rather than a courtroom role). He had married into relative wealth, to Melissa Williams, whose family owned the high-end furniture store in town, Charlotte's. The O'Rourkes were among the first in El Paso to install a swimming pool.</p><p>Pat O'Rourke was a garrulous carouser and a bit of a showboat, a fixture at the Cincinnati Bar &amp; Grill, where local pooh-bahs gathered to debate and drink. (Beto O'Rourke would later use the same restaurant as his informal think tank when he first ran for office.) He came under scrutiny for using government funds to outfit his office with furniture from his wife's store, and in 1983 he became embroiled in a controversy over a powdery substance-possibly cocaine or heroin-discovered in a condom found in his Toyota Land Cruiser. A sheriff's deputy destroyed the evidence before it could be analyzed, the incident was investigated by the D.A.'s office, and the ensuing uproar, known thereafter as ""Rubbergate,"" became front-page news. The controversy tarnished his reputation, but it didn't dampen his enthusiasm. He became an avid supporter of the Reverend Jesse Jackson during both his 1984 and 1988 runs for president and once held a reception for Jackson at the O'Rourke home. (Young Beto posed for a picture with Jackson, which he still displays in his home.)</p><p>Pat O'Rourke was popular with everyone but his son, with whom he clashed from an early age. ""My dad was very critical and had very high expectations, without a lot of the details filled in,"" says O'Rourke. ""It was 'I expect you to achieve greatness in grades, in athletics, in whatever you do.'"" (Beto O'Rourke has two younger sisters, Charlotte and Erin.) When he failed math one semester, ""my dad essentially stopped talking to me,"" he says. ""He made it clear that I embarrassed him. That was just the most profoundly painful thing I had experienced up to that point.""</p><p>O'Rourke's mother tried softening the tension, but Beto felt like an appendage to his father's public persona. His dad once bought a tandem bicycle and entered them in races without asking him. ""I hated it, because it involved a lot of yelling at me, like, 'Quit leaning to the right, goddammit!' "" he recalls. ""And then just harrowing, just racing through an intersection and he's got the brakes and the steering and all I can do is just pedal my balls off and hope that we don't die.""</p><p>O'Rourke escaped into early computer chat rooms and made two close friends, Arlo Klahr and Mike Stevens. They drew comic books, read underground fanzines, wrote poetry, skateboarded, and, inspired by the Clash, took up guitar and went to local punk-rock shows. They became devotees of the Washington, D.C., record label Dischord, co-founded by Ian MacKaye, a punk firebrand who influenced a generation of disaffected suburban youth. ""I have so much reverence for him and he means so much to me in my life,"" O'Rourke says of MacKaye. ""He really did represent this super-ethical way, not just of being in a band, or running a label, or putting on shows, but of just living."" (The punk ethos, Ian MacKaye tells me, is for ""people who can't figure out how they're supposed to fit into society. And I think in many ways they're the <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">right</emphasis> people."")</p><p>Beto O'Rourke was desperate to escape El Paso. ""I wanted out,"" he says. ""I wanted out of the house. I wanted away from him and his shadow.""</p><p>His father tried directing him to the New Mexico Military Institute, but O'Rourke instead applied to a prep school in Virginia called Woodberry Forest, on advice from his grandfather through marriage, Fred Korth, a former secretary of the navy in the Kennedy administration. As soon as he arrived, O'Rourke felt profoundly alienated from the preppy Southern boys and instead made friends with music-heads and international students from Turkey and Korea. ""We were the weirdo table,"" he said. ""We were the rejects who just did not fit in culturally, money, social status.""</p><p>He listened to college radio, produced a research report on the U.S. overthrow of the Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán government in Guatemala, and helped found an environmental club called the Terra Interest Society. He ran track and field but also deepened his devotion to punk. On his yearbook page, he quoted the Dischord band Rites of Spring: ""I found a hidden wheel and it rolls to reveal that / I'm the angry son, I'm the angry son.""</p><p>O'Rourke says he didn't have his first sip of alcohol until he was 19 while at Columbia University-a school he had never heard of until an older student, Beau Higgins, mentioned he was going. In the East, he called himself Robert instead of Beto. He grew his hair long and majored in film before switching to English. Neither idea pleased his father. ""He was like, 'You could read books on your own time,'"" recounts O'Rourke. ""'You can't learn how to be an accountant or you can't learn how to be a doctor or an astrophysicist on your own. Use Columbia for that.'""</p><p>One day a gym teacher saw O'Rourke on the rowing machine and persuaded him to row crew. The sport fed an unmet desire in O'Rourke for discipline and purity. He became a ""monk,"" he says, moving into a solitary dorm room, getting up at six A.M. to train every day, and drinking protein shakes to gain weight. ""I would just start throwing up and just forcing as many calories in, and then rowing in the morning and lifting weights in the afternoon every day,"" he says. ""I really liked that. I really liked seeing myself get better or seeing the boat get better, learning a skill and a discipline I had never really understood or knew existed. Being good at something.""</p><p>He remembered feeling ecstatic when he beat Harvard. ""You win the other boat's shirts and so I brought that shirt home, gave it to my dad,"" he says.</p><p>His single-minded devotion to crew-and to the purifying energy of punk rock-foreshadowed his future political self. In the summer of 1991, however, when O'Rourke's father signed him up for an internship with West Texas congressman Ron Coleman, O'Rourke had no interest and did it only to please his father. He used the time in D.C. to see Fugazi, the band fronted by his hero Ian MacKaye. He and his El Paso friends Arlo Klahr and Mike Stevens formed Foss, the Icelandic word for waterfall, and after recording their first album, <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The El Paso Pussycats,</emphasis> organized a month-long tour, conscripting El Paso drummer Cedric Bixler-Zavala (later a member of a successful indie group, At the Drive-In) and driving across the U.S. and Canada in a station wagon. It was a grand adventure, but also a lesson in scrappy survival. O'Rourke was unusually resourceful: Frustrated by a series of shows that didn't materialize, he called up a popular rock venue in San Francisco and altered his voice, pretending to be a founder of Sub Pop, a famous indie rock label. He urged them to book Foss as the opening act, claiming the band was about to be signed to a record deal. They got on the bill but were kicked off the stage after two songs.</p><p>""There is something <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">abnormal, super-normal,</emphasis> that we both experience when we're out on the campaign trail.""</p><p>Former girlfriends describe O'Rourke as curious, wry, bookish but adventurous. He usually carried a novel in his pocket, whether <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Captain Corelli's Mandolin</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Sun Also Rises.</emphasis> Maggie Asfahani, an El Paso native who dated O'Rourke while he was at prep school and college, said he was somewhat difficult to know. ""That's kind of the mystique of Beto, is that he seems to be accessible,"" she says, ""but there's just this layer of protection. I don't think it's because he's hiding anything. I think it's because he's keeping a part of it to himself.""</p><p>After he graduated in 1995, O'Rourke and his friends moved to Albuquerque and rented a house formerly occupied by a Swedish ski team. They all shaved their heads and declared this their ""Revolution Summer,"" an homage to the D.C. punk scene of 1984. The idea was to live on part-time jobs and make art. They formed a band called the Swedes, donning motorcycle helmets and waving the Swedish flag onstage. ""I didn't want to make money, didn't want to be in business,"" O'Rourke says. ""My dad was so disappointed. He took out [college] loans, he knew that I took out loans. I was like, 'You know, I wanna make art. I wanna write. I wanna make music. I wanna create things.'""</p><p>The collective fizzled out, however, and O'Rourke has said he became ""the most depressed I've ever been in my life."" After briefly returning to El Paso-during which time he was arrested for ""attempted forcible entry"" at the University of Texas in El Paso after tripping a campus alarm one night-O'Rourke went back to New York and started nannying for a wealthy family on the Upper West Side. In 1996, he and a group of friends from both Columbia and El Paso moved into a decrepit loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, across from a housing project. O'Rourke worked as an art mover for Hedley's Humpers and for his uncle on a startup Internet-service provider, called El.Net, building the first Web sites for PEN American Center and the Committee to Protect Journalists. In Brooklyn, he and his friends threw parties, bashed out punk songs, and drank endless cases of Budweiser; on the roof was a trampoline and a perfect view of the Manhattan skyline.</p><p>O'Rourke objects to a <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">New York Times</emphasis> story published in February that he believes painted him as aimless and depressed in New York. He describes the time as one of joyous indirection in which he surrounded himself with ""some amazing artists and thinkers."" He read Joseph Campbell's <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Hero's Journey,</emphasis> discovered Bob Dylan, deepened his devotion to <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Odyssey,</emphasis> and went through bursts of enthusiasm for bands like Big Star and Guided by Voices. In the parlance of the times, he was a slacker. ""Generation X is scrappier and less formulaic,"" observes David Guinn, a Williamsburg housemate who's now a painter in Philadelphia. ""Not with the manifest destiny or the heroism of the baby-boomers who believed they were going to change the world. There's a real humbleness to the whole generation-and to Beto.""</p><p>""I was waking up in time to go to work, because I had stayed up so late, playing music, having fun, dancing, just being alive,"" O'Rourke says. ""And I don't feel guilty or bad about it, because I'm so glad I did that. It was just such a wonderful time. And I'm so grateful that I had it. But it was not conducive to a career or a discipline or a profession.""</p><p>In a phone call one night, he idly mentioned to his mother he was thinking of returning to El Paso temporarily. She was overjoyed. ""And she took it as 'This is a great chance to get you home now,'"" says O'Rourke.</p><p>He was 25.</p><p>Back in El Paso, his father, Pat O'Rourke, was losing his third consecutive campaign for public office, this time for county judge. Friends were still mystified by his switch to the Republican Party, a self-defeating move in a Democratic town. ""It was just really kind of heartbreaking, because the entire time you knew he was going to lose,"" says O'Rourke. The month after O'Rourke returned, he was arrested for drunk driving, an incident that would become a flash point in his campaign against Ted Cruz, and will likely become one again in a presidential race.</p><p>The police report describes O'Rourke driving at high speed and sideswiping a truck going in the same direction, then jumping the median into the oncoming lane at about two in the morning. According to a police witness, he tried to drive away from the scene of the accident. O'Rourke maintains that this isn't true. I asked O'Rourke to describe the events of that night. He was at home listening to music that evening, he says, when his dad called and asked to meet for a drink at the Cincinnati Bar &amp; Grill. The O'Rourkes drank a couple of Jameson whiskeys and afterward O'Rourke called up a college student in Las Cruces that he had dated once: ""And I said, 'Hey, I know this is really late, or late notice, but any chance you're free tonight?' and she was, but she says, 'I don't have a ride.' So I said, 'I'm happy to come pick you up.'""</p><p>He drove an hour to Las Cruces and then an hour back to El Paso to drink with an old high-school friend. O'Rourke was taking his date, named Michelle, back to Las Cruces when the accident happened. He failed a sobriety test and was handcuffed. In his telling, he was pathetic but nonetheless chivalrous: When police left his friend in a gas-station parking lot, a handcuffed O'Rourke asked them to take cash out of his jeans so she could get home. His father posted bail. ""I think I walked home from county jail-that [my dad] had helped build-I just got home and you just feel like a total piece of shit, and you kind of are,"" he says.</p><p>His license was suspended, and he had to take a bus to his job working at his mom's furniture store. O'Rourke continued playing music-briefly playing in the Sheeps, the YouTube-notorious punk band who wore sheep masks and long underwear onstage-but he also came into tighter focus. At the apex of the dot-com boom, he launched his own Web-design company, Stanton Street Technology Group, with two friends from New York who had followed him to El Paso. To satisfy his creative itch, he also launched an online news magazine focused on El Paso. His father used the site to publish a diary about a cross-country trip on his recumbent bicycle in 2000.</p><p>One night in July 2001 the two had what Beto O'Rourke says was ""the best conversation we ever had,"" ranging over family, politics, personal history. ""We just ate leftovers and drank a bottle of wine in the backyard,"" he recalls. The next morning, his father was cycling along a quiet route outside El Paso when he was struck by a car and thrown 70 feet to his death. ""I was at work and my mom called me and I just knew,"" he says. ""Because her voice was shaken and said, 'Something's happened with your dad. You should come to the store.'""</p><p>Two months later, terrorists struck the World Trade Center, and in the ensuing national alarm the border between El Paso and Juárez, which his father had crossed freely his entire life, was closed and permanently altered. O'Rourke's father had always dreamed of turning El Paso into ""the Hong Kong of the border,"" a nexus for trade and culture. It was a vision that O'Rourke and friends his age in El Paso were starting to talk about in 2001. That year, O'Rourke decided to launch an alternative weekly newspaper, citing his father as the inspiration. <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Stanton Street</emphasis> died after 15 issues, but it gave him a view into local politics, and Beto O'Rourke began to dream bigger after attending a workshop in Austin organized by Howard Dean. In 2004, he started considering his own run for office. His very first idea was to run for the seat his father had tried and failed to regain-county judge. Instead, O'Rourke was persuaded to run for city council.</p><p>While plotting his campaign, O'Rourke met Amy Sanders, the 23-year-old daughter of wealthy real-estate magnate Bill Sanders. Amy Sanders had grown up in Santa Fe and studied psychology at Williams College in Massachusetts, after which she spent a year teaching kindergarten in Guatemala City. She returned to El Paso, where her family had previously moved, to bide her time while she applied to grad school but then met O'Rourke through her aunt. They went on a date to Juárez and drank at some of the famous watering holes. ""He was giving me reasons 1 through 10 of why I needed to stay in El Paso,"" Amy O'Rourke recalls. ""And I quickly learned that he just is an ultimate El Paso salesman.""</p><p>O'Rourke knew about her father because his mother had once dated him in the 1960s-a double date with Pat O'Rourke, whom she met that same night and eventually married. An entrepreneurial wunderkind as a teenager, Bill Sanders left El Paso in the late 1960s for Chicago and made millions as the ""Godfather of the REITS"" (real-estate-investment trusts) and then moved to Santa Fe to build and sell another company. In 2001, O'Rourke heard Sanders give a talk about forming a new business organization called the Paso del Norte, which focused on downtown El Paso. The group ""totally captured my imagination,"" recalls O'Rourke. He was invited to join the group but didn't, perhaps because he was allied with a mentor, Mayor Ray Caballero, who was suspicious of the largely white and Republican business class. David Crowder, a veteran reporter in El Paso, says Bill Sanders ""was sort of a great white father coming into town, with all this money and ideas for the big-boxing of El Paso.""</p><p>In 2005, O'Rourke won his race for city council, advocating for tax abatements to spur development. He married Amy a few months later at his father-in-law's ranch in Santa Fe. Overnight, O'Rourke became the bright, optimistic new face of the El Paso renaissance, and he supported a real-estate-redevelopment plan that Sanders and his allies had dreamed up, envisioning a gentrified downtown that could attract more people like Beto O'Rourke. The development plans were met with passionate opposition because Sanders wanted to use eminent domain to clear out an impoverished barrio and build a Walmart or a Target. O'Rourke, fluent in Spanish like his father, went door-to-door trying to convince residents the city would build affordable housing elsewhere. A local historian and activist, David Romo, accused O'Rourke and his allies of destroying buildings of historic significance to Chicanos and driving immigrants from what he deemed the ""Ellis Island"" of the border (a phrase that O'Rourke would later use to defend El Paso against Trump's wall idea). They pointed out that his father-in-law stood to profit from the plans-and indeed, Sanders had formed the Borderplex Realty Trust for just that purpose. The city opened an ethics investigation, and though O'Rourke was cleared of wrongdoing, he recused himself in the public debate and from voting on it.</p><p>""You can probably tell <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">that I want to run.</emphasis> I do. I think I'd be good at it.""</p><p>In the end, the plans collapsed because the economy cratered in 2008 and capital dried up. But the controversy stuck to O'Rourke, his original sin. O'Rourke says perhaps his biggest mistake was making an enemy of David Romo, who has become the source for a wave of negative stories in the national press, including <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The New York Times</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Wall Street Journal.</emphasis> ""I didn't bring David any closer to my point of view, you know, permanently alienated him,"" he says, ""and it was also stupid because I wasn't listening to him.""</p><p>In 2011, O'Rourke teamed up with a fellow council member, Susie Byrd, to publish a political tract titled ""Dealing Drugs and Death,"" arguing for drug legalization to curtail the cartel wars that had de-stabilized the border. The tract was nobody's idea of a great political move-drug legalization was still on the fringes of mainstream politics in 2011-but it set the stage for a run for Congress against the eight-term incumbent, Silvestre Reyes, a former border-patrol guard who supported the War on Drugs and made his name advocating for border fencing. The odds against beating an incumbent were long, but O'Rourke and his new campaign manager, David Wysong, a local health-care executive who had never run a congressional campaign, tabulated the voter turnout they would need to win-which for O'Rourke translated to numbers of doors he needed to knock on. ""How many doors? How many people behind each door?"" Wysong recalls.</p><p>This was the first look at Beto O'Rourke the endurance-athlete campaigner, tirelessly knocking on roughly 16,000 doors. O'Rourke was not without vulnerabilities. Endorsed by both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, Reyes attacked O'Rourke by underlining his alliance with his father-in-law, launching a video ad called ""Billionaires for Beto."" Hoping to retain his positive image, O'Rourke was loath to counterattack Reyes, but an outside super PAC, underwritten by Bill Sanders and other business leaders, did it for him, strafing Reyes with $240,000 in TV ads that painted the congressman as corrupt and thereby indirectly lumped him in with several prominent El Paso politicians who had gone to prison for corruption.</p><p>The ads worked. O'Rourke won by drawing a large number of white Republican voters to his cause, which deepened suspicion from left-leaning Chicano activists. ""Race begins to play a role in there somehow,"" recalls Bob Moore, a former <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">El Paso Times</emphasis> editor. ""So when people talk about Beto's Republican connection, there's a 'there' there.""</p><p>One of O'Rourke's campaign promises was to limit the number of terms he served. Term limits were an issue O'Rourke believed in, but it weakened his hand as a freshman in Congress, where long-term ambition translates to seats on powerful committees. Whereas Reyes had been a leading member of the Armed Services Committee, O'Rourke was initially downgraded to Veterans Affairs. He would come to dislike Washington. O'Rourke tried defining himself as an independent voice in Congress, willing to buck party orthodoxy. He co-sponsored a bill with John Cornyn, Republican senator from Texas, to increase border security at ports of entry, and he didn't always vote alongside liberal Democrats. <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Guardian,</emphasis> citing analyses on O'Rourke's voting record, concluded that he'd voted with Republicans 167 times over six years, and roughly a third of the time in the last two years alone.</p><p>David Wysong calls the story a ""hit piece"" from the Bernie Sanders camp. O'Rourke says it was hard to get legislation passed in a G.O.P.-controlled House, but he's proud of bills he helped pass benefiting veterans at Fort Bliss in El Paso, his constituents, and sponsoring legislation to legalize marijuana and to expunge arrest records for people convicted of marijuana possession.</p><p>O'Rourke voted to let President Obama negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P., which Bernie Sanders attacked as damaging to the working class. O'Rourke now says he would have voted ""no"" on the ultimate agreement. But in 2015, he traveled with Obama on a trip to Asia to help build support for the deal. It was his first time on Air Force One. ""You could make calls from your seat,"" wrote O'Rourke in a Medium post about his trip. ""I called Amy and my mom and a good family friend.""</p><p>In Vietnam, O'Rourke witnessed hundreds of thousands of people lining the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for Obama's motorcade, the biggest crowds that had ever greeted the then president. Ben Rhodes, a former White House speechwriter who was also on the trip, wagers that it made a big impression on O'Rourke. Rhodes recalls how Barack Obama once told him that his first foreign trips had opened his mind to the possibilities of the presidency. ""I do believe that could put a spark into somebody,"" Rhodes says. ""You're a backbench House member, waiting your turn for questions at hearings, and suddenly you're looking at a hundred thousand people in Vietnam-you're like, Huh, maybe there's a more impactful thing for me to do.""</p><p>When I mention this to O'Rourke, he seems slightly put off, remarking that White House staffers would hardly have remembered him. He recalls thinking of Ben Rhodes, ""He probably thinks I'm an intern.""</p><p>O'Rourke drew a distinct lesson from Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in 2016. He recalled Bernie Sanders joining Clinton for a meeting with congressional Democrats in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, when Sanders was still withholding his delegates from Clinton and infuriating party elders. ""He said it's not enough to remind America how bad Donald Trump is, it's just not going to do it,"" O'Rourke recalls. ""You've got to give people something to be for, it cannot be who we are against.</p><p>""I think he was so prescient,"" he continues. ""That moment sticks out to me so much, because it was so dramatic. He was so hated really-it's not too strong of a word-when he was in there, and he said the most important thing that I'd heard during that entire campaign.""</p><p>When he decided to run for Senate in Texas against Ted Cruz, O'Rourke planned a purist campaign much like Sanders's-no PAC money, no corporate donations, no pollsters, no negative ads, only a revival-tent optimism focused on an unabashedly left-wing message. He even hired two forward-thinking field strategists from the Sanders campaign. O'Rourke drew inspiration from punk rock, everything stripped of artifice. ""I haven't seen a candidate who has just shared what's on their mind and spoken as honestly and directly, without interference from consultants and pollsters, as we're doing right now,"" he told documentary filmmaker Steve Mims early in the campaign.</p><p>""It may be a brilliant strategy,"" O'Rourke said. ""It may be an incredibly stupid strategy.""</p><p>Promising to visit every county in Texas, he ran his campaign as a marathon of live-streamed political performance art-road-tripping with a Republican congressman with an iPhone on his dashboard for 36 hours; air-drumming to the Who's ""Baba O'Reilly"" while waiting for burgers at a drive-through the night he debated Ted Cruz at Southern Methodist University. O'Rourke came off as free of political calculation, as if his charisma were a mere side effect of Beto just being Beto.</p><p>The tipping point was when O'Rourke gave an extemporaneous monologue defending black N.F.L. players who took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality. Now This News packaged it into a viral video, and it rocketed O'Rourke to the national stage. CNN broadcast one of his town-hall meetings and O'Rourke's crowds ballooned. Donor contributions poured in, peaking at $80 million, the most for any Senate campaign in U.S. history. The expanding press pack became more aggressive ""to the point where they were knocking the kids and I out of the way to get to Beto,"" recalls Amy O'Rourke.</p><p>""They were cresting a wave that I'm sure was difficult to stay on,"" says Emmett Beliveau, a former White House operations staffer whom O'Rourke hired to organize an Austin rally co-starring Beto supporter Willie Nelson. Beliveau, who produced Obama's Election Night rally in Chicago in 2008, was astounded to discover that O'Rourke's campaign apparatus was mainly just O'Rourke and his cell phone. ""I kept waiting to get the call from the advance guy and it never came,"" he says. ""That person literally didn't exist.""</p><p>By this time, the idea of O'Rourke as a possible presidential contender was already in the air. Beliveau held a fund-raiser for O'Rourke in Chicago, introducing him to former Obama staffers and raising $75,000 for his campaign. Earlier that year, David Wysong had managed to quash a press story saying O'Rourke might run for president if he beat Ted Cruz.</p><p>Cruz, of course, wasn't empty-handed. By this time, O'Rourke had sold Stanton Street and his mother, Melissa, had transferred partial ownership of a shopping center to him before shuttering the furniture store. (O'Rourke is said to have a net worth of $9 million.) The closure of Charlotte's came after an unusual event: In 2010, O'Rourke's mother's business was indicted for tax fraud, accused of restructuring more than $1 million in cash sales to avoid taxes. The store was forced to pay a $250,000 fine. O'Rourke would blame an accounting error and his mother never admitted guilt. Friends said it was a simple matter of wealthy Mexican customers paying in cash. But the details were hazy because the indictment was sealed. The Ted Cruz campaign would refer to his mother's store as ""Charlotte's Web"" and suggest to reporters that a $640,000 cash sale from a single Mexican customer was related to drug cartels.</p><p>On Election Night, O'Rourke and his wife were certain they were going to beat Cruz, even if polls showed otherwise. One man had flown home from Seattle to vote before polls closed. How could they lose? Recalls Amy O'Rourke, ""So many of the stories that we had heard, especially in the weeks leading up to the election, you're like, How can you not win when there is that level of just dedication and passion from so many people that we had met?""</p><p>On Election Day, Beto and Amy O'Rourke were leaving their house for a packed El Paso stadium when the race was called for Ted Cruz with only 25 percent of precincts reporting. ""I couldn't process how that was possible,"" says Amy.</p><p>She managed to maintain her composure until after it was over. The next day, she finally broke down: ""I couldn't stop crying.""</p><p>The first time I meet Beto O'Rourke, he's lounging on the front veranda of his house on a Sunday afternoon, barefoot in blue jeans and T-shirt, talking on his cell phone. O'Rourke had stopped speaking to the press-he was still kicking himself for giving a damaging interview to <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">The Washington Post,</emphasis> which quoted his prescription for immigration as ""I don't know""-but he nonetheless waved over a prying reporter and invited me inside to meet his wife and children. His son Henry had a fever, and Amy had fallen asleep on the couch while <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Dora the Explorer</emphasis> flickered on the TV. There was a Stan Getz LP on the turntable and a plate of homemade scones in the kitchen.</p><p>O'Rourke experienced a post-election depression like the one he had when he beat Reyes in 2012. He had lost weight, his joints ached, and a stress fracture in his foot curtailed his running regimen. He exercised on his rowing machine and went on his somewhat infamous road trip to interact with regular Americans, trying to work his way through a self-described ""funk"" over his loss. Amy bristled at a CNN essay that chastised him for taking an ""excellent adventure"" while leaving his wife and kids at home. (""I was a little insulted because it implied that I couldn't support our family."") His stream-of-consciousness posts, which Amy edited, were mocked on Twitter, an outlet that O'Rourke criticizes as ""mean."" ""No human, least of all me, is strong enough to completely withstand the impact that has on you, and it can't be healthy,"" he says.</p><p>The week O'Rourke lost, Barack Obama called him and congratulated him: ""He just said, 'Hey, you ran a great race. If you are interested, I'd love to sit down and talk with you.' "" During their meeting, at Obama's office in Washington the next week, it was O'Rourke who brought up the idea of running for president. ""I raised it with him-'Some people who I really respect have asked me to think about running for president,' "" O'Rourke recalls. ""He asked about: What will this do to my family? Is this the right thing for the country? Do I see a path to win? Do I see something that I uniquely can provide, for what the country needs right now?""</p><p>By the time I met O'Rourke again in February, he had nearly found his answer. Concerns about his family had abated, despite Henry's protestations. ""I'm not as concerned about our ability to make it as a family as I might have been three months ago,"" says O'Rourke. The week before he was to appear onstage with Oprah Winfrey in New York, he had what he describes as a breakthrough conversation with his wife. He stayed up until three A.M. to plot his future: ""I was excited to think it through,"" he recalls, ""and 'Well, if we ran, what if we did it like this?' or 'We could do this.' "" He got up three hours later and went running.</p><p>When O'Rourke blurted out to Oprah that he'd make a decision on whether to run or not ""before the end of this month,"" the answer surprised even him. ""I did not intend to say that,"" he tells me. On the flight home from New York, O'Rourke learned that Trump was coming to El Paso. Amy was reading <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Becoming,</emphasis> by Michelle Obama, absorbing the former First Lady's account of her trials living through a toxic presidential race with her husband. By the time the O'Rourkes touched down at El Paso International Airport, Amy's stomach was in knots. ""She was kind of pissed at me when we got home,"" recalls O'Rourke. ""Almost like 'You fucker.' ""</p><p>She knew he was running.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke will have to define himself against a crowded field of Democratic candidates, but he doesn't feel the need to draw blood to define himself. ""I just don't get turned on by being against,"" he says. ""I really get excited to be for. That's what moves me. It's important to defeat Trump, but that's not exciting to me. What's exciting to me is for the United States to lead the world, in making sure that the generations that follow us can live here.</p><p>""What's exciting to me is figuring out something that has eluded us for so long: How do we make sure every single person can see a doctor in this country?"" he adds. ""That's really exciting to me.""</p><p>Pressed on his national-policy positions, O'Rourke says he wants to shore up the Affordable Care Act and make Medicare part of the health-care marketplace, and eventually make ""health care for all"" a reality. He would also make climate change a top priority. ""Keeping the planet from warming one-half degree Celsius, for me, is the most important for humanity,"" he says. He supports Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal in spirit, if not every letter. ""The goal of converting to 100 percent renewable energy within a decade, I love,"" he says. ""It's ambitious. It captures your imagination.""</p><p>As if to rebut the inevitable accusations that he's a socialist, he proclaims himself a proud capitalist-among the few Democratic candidates, he points out, who have been small-business owners. ""The ingenuity and innovation that you only find in America and in capitalist systems, the ability to harness the power of the market,"" he says, ""it's hard to argue against pricing carbon and allowing the market to respond to that.""</p><p>He also believes in a version of Ocasio-Cortez's call for a higher top marginal tax rate, though he doesn't volunteer the 70 percent number, and he makes a different sort of argument. ""If you're trying to mobilize this country to meet an existential threat, as we did against the Nazis in World War II, then you're going to have to ask everyone to sacrifice,"" he says. ""If you don't see a shared interest or shared opportunity to advance, then we'll no longer see ourselves in this together and this country will truly break apart. This level of gross income inequality cannot persist, and if there's a better way to get there, I'm open to it. But it's definitely going to involve higher marginal rates on the very wealthiest in this country.""</p><p>His biggest strength, of course, is his unique credibility as a voice on immigration. O'Rourke wants to end the War on Drugs, raise the cap on work visas, find a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and create a system with the Mexican government that would track who was in the country. ""In my opinion, that includes citizenship for Dreamers, a legal path to citizenship for their parents, and the ability to get right with the law, and work legally, and pay taxes, and pursue a path to citizenship for millions of others who've been working the toughest jobs here.""</p><p>For some, O'Rourke can still seem politically indistinct, even slippery, but that may be part of his strategy. When asked if he's a progressive, a question that will surely dog him in the weeks to come, O'Rourke hedges with the aplomb of Barack Obama circa 2008: ""I leave that to other people. I'm not into the labels. My sense in traveling Texas for the past two years, my sense is that people really aren't into them either.""</p><p>Positions on issues matter, of course, but they aren't everything. Indeed, in the Trump era it may well be that harnessing intense voter passion is more important when facing a bombastic cult of personality who draws on Fox News rage-ratings. Beto O'Rourke is selling the idea that he can unite the country by playing nice with the kind of people he met in rural Texas on his Senate campaign: middle Americans who had barely met a Democrat, let alone considered voting for one. But O'Rourke also sells a kind of cult of personality of his own, offering himself as the David to Trump's Goliath, a folk hero for our time. He acknowledges that what has made Trump successful is also what has made him successful-an outsider who ""bent the media to his campaign,"" as he puts it.</p><p>But unlike Trump, O'Rourke can appear almost too innocent to be a politician-too decent, too wholesome, the very reason he became popular also the same reason he could be crucified on the national stage. I tell O'Rourke that perhaps he's simply too normal to be president. ""Whether you meant it or not, I take that as a compliment,"" he says.</p><p>It's 10:30 P.M. and Amy is now curled up on a chair next to Beto, scrolling through e-mails. The kids are asleep. I ask O'Rourke if he could see himself among the presidential biographies on his shelf-Washington, Lincoln, Kennedy. ""I haven't really thought about that,"" he says. ""I think, ego-wise, we're going to be O.K. if we don't run. Where we won't be O.K. is, if we don't run and come to the conclusion later on, if we had run, man, this wouldn't have happened. Things would have been a lot better. Or-""</p><p>""You didn't do everything you could,"" Amy says, completing his sentence.</p><p>""We didn't do everything that we could,"" he says.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke seems, in this moment, like a cliff diver trying to psych himself into the jump. And after playing coy all afternoon about whether he'll run, he finally can't deny the pull of his own gifts. ""You can probably tell that I want to run,"" he finally confides, smiling. ""I do. I think I'd be good at it.""</p><p>""This is the fight of our lives,"" he continues, ""not the fight-of-my-political-life kind of crap. But, like, this is the fight of our lives as Americans, and as humans, I'd argue.""</p><p>The more he talks, the more he likes the sound of what he's saying. ""I want to be in it,"" he says, now leaning forward. ""Man, I'm just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.""</p><p>A month later, Beto O'Rourke announces his run for the White House.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">VNFAIR-07338899_VF_0419_19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">VNFAIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5VWW-WCV1-DYWV-J00H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">266942</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""8374""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vanity Fair</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""33408""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""201""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""LOGOS""/><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0733-8899</issn><volume>Vol. 61</volume><issueNumber>No. 5</issueNumber><publicationDate day=""01"" month=""04"" year=""2019""><dateText>April 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""subject""><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""77""><classCode>ST0009U6N</classCode><className>POP &amp; ROCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""77""><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""76""><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""person""><classificationItem score=""92""><classCode>PE000DAKN</classCode><className>BETO O'ROURKE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""89""><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""country""><classificationItem score=""93""><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>"

Policymakers voted unanimously to approve the latest super-sized hike. <br/>The widely expected move puts the key benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 3.75% to 4%, the highest since before the 2008 financial crisis, from near-zero in March. It marks the sixth consecutive rate increase this year and puts interest rates in firmly restrictive territory. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Grim Predictions of a One Per Cent Rate Hike: ANZ and Westpac's Chilling Forecast of How High Mortgage Payments Will Go Next Year — After the Reserve Bank Lifted Interest Rates Again[91] <br/>A borrower with an average $600,000 mortgage would owe an extra $372 in monthly repayments should predictions ANZ and Westpac's Reserve Bank predictions come true. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Poland: Inflation Reaches a New High in October[92] <br/>Poland's annual inflation reached 17.9 percent in October, according to Statistics Poland (GUS). Compared to September, prices of goods and services increased by 1.8 percent. <br/>Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 21.9 percent on a year-over-year basis; prices of energy rose by 41.7 percent and fuel for private transportation increased by 19.5 percent. <br/>Regarding month to month increases, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 2.7 percent, energy rose by 2 percent, and fuel for private transport decreased by 4.1 percent, reported GUS. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>White House Deletes Absurd Tweet After CNN, Twitter Slap With Fact Checks[93] <br/>The Biden Administration's latest attempt to rebrand terrible economic news as good news was so blatant that even CNN's fact-checker Daniel Dale called them out. <br/>In a Tuesday tweet, the White House claimed that 'Seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden's leadership.' <br/>Seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden's leadership. <br/>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 1, 2022 <br/>Except, that's only because it's tied to inflation — which has skyrocketed. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>'You Murderous Hypocrites': Outrage Ensues After the Atlantic Suggests 'Amnesty' For Pandemic Authoritarians[94] <br/>The Atlantic has come under fire for suggesting that all the terrible pandemic-era decisions over lockdowns, school closures, masking, and punishing an entire class of people who questioned the efficacy and wisdom of taking a rushed, experimental vaccine — for a virus with a 99% survival rate in most, should all be water under the bridge. <br/>'We need to forgive one another for what we did and said when we were in the dark about COVID,' writes Brown Professor Emily Oster — a huge lockdown proponent, who now pleads from mercy from the once-shunned. <br/>'Let's acknowledge that we made complicated choices in the face of deep uncertainty, and then try to work together to build back and move forward,' she continues. <br/>Except, they weren't 'in the dark' about Covid. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>2 Arrested After Santa Fe Woman Fatally Stabbed With a Sword[95] <br/>SANTA FE — A woman and her boyfriend have been arrested in connection with a death in Santa Fe in which the victim was stabbed with a three-foot metal sword, according to authorities. <br/>Police said 19-year-old Kiara McCulley and 25-year-old Isaac Apodaca were taken into custody Saturday and both remain jailed on open counts of murder. <br/>It was unclear Tuesday if either suspect has a lawyer yet who can speak on their behalf. <br/>According to a criminal complaint, McCulley is accused of fatally stabbing 19-year-old Grace Jennings and also may have tried to decapitate her after allegedly being encouraged to do so by Apodaca. <br/>Police said they found text messages between Apodaca and McCully allegedly conspiring to kill Jennings. <br/>McCully said she has multiple personality disorder and doesn't remember fatally stabbing the victim, according to authorities. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin Loses Bid to Toss One of the 'Rust' Shooting Lawsuits Against Him[96] <br/>Alec Baldwin has lost his bid to toss one of the lawsuits filed against him over his deadly shooting of 'Rust' cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, as he awaits a decision on whether he'll face criminal charges. <br/>The 64-year-old actor sought to get dismissed from the suit filed by script supervisor Mamie Mitchell, who accuses Baldwin of 'recklessly' firing the gun that killed Hutchins, 42, as she was standing next to her. <br/>However, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Whitaker ruled that Mitchell can press on with her claims of assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence against the actor. <br/>Mitchell can also pursue punitive damages against Baldwin and his finance company, El Dorado Pictures, the Los Angeles Times noted. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Apple's iPhone14 Registers Rollercoaster Ride as Serious Traffic Accident[97] <br/>In the US, the number of faulty automated emergency calls is currently increasing. The trigger is the function of current mobile phones, which is intended to call the police in the event of serious car accidents if drivers can no longer do this themselves. <br/>The emergency call center near an amusement park in Ohio alone has received six such emergency calls since the iPhone14 went on sale, even though the owner was actually taking a ride on a roller coaster. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Biden Denounces 'Extreme MAGA Republicans', Trump 'Abuse of Power' In Fiery Speech[98] <br/>In a bellicose speech on Wednesday, President Joe Biden warned Americans that 'democracy is on the ballot' ahead of the November midterm elections, attempting to present the electoral contest as a choice between a Trump-led autocracy and a Democratic-led republic. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Blue Check Twitter Pans Elon Musk's Fee for Verified Accounts: 'Not Paying a Gazillionaire $8 a Month'[99] <br/>Blue check media figures railed against Elon Musk's announcement about implementing a new charge for verified Twitter accounts. <br/>Musk has already made big waves since becoming the owner of Twitter and Tuesday was no different as he rolled out a plan taking aim at accounts with the iconic blue checkmark. <br/>'Twitter's current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bulls — —. Power to the people! Blue for $8/month,' Musk began a thread. 'Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity. You will also get: — Priority in replies, mentions &amp; search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam — Ability to post long video &amp; audio — Half as many ads. And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Breaking: CNN to End Jake Tapper's Primetime Show[100] <br/>Jake Tapper's stint as a CNN primetime host is coming to an end, with the network confirming that he will be returning to his late afternoon slot following the midterms. <br/>The longtime media personality had been temporarily bumped up to the 9 pm slot in September, however there was speculation that the move would be permanent. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Breaking: White House Declares GOP Are 'Not Going to Accept' Election Results[101] <br/>The White House press secretary on Wednesday declared that it is the belief of the President that Republicans are 'not going to accept the results of these elections.' At stake on the Tuesday midterm ballot is the balance of power in both branches of Congress. <br/>The GOP has been making gains in polls against their Democrat rivals, with contentious elections in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona, as well as in states where Democrats had reason to believe they had the results in the bag, such as Oregon, New York, and Washington. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Breaking: Ted Cruz Calls on Elon Musk to Let Jordan Peterson Back on Twitter[102] <br/>Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz has called on Twitter's new owner and CEO Elon Musk to reinstate Dr. Jordan Peterson to the platform. <br/>The Texas Republican posted to Twitter Tuesday night, 'It is TIME for Elon Musk to let Jordan Peterson back on Twitter.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>California Professor Erupts on 'Christian', 'White Men' on PBS: They Will Cause a 'Civil War'[103] <br/>Author and University of California San Diego Professor Barbara F. Walter warned that 'Christian,' 'White men' are primed to start a civil war in America. <br/>Walter, the author of a book titled, 'How Civil Wars Start,' made her claims on PBS's 'Amanpour and Company' Tuesday evening. <br/>She cited observations of over 200 civil wars to decode that these 'Christian' White males are the powder keg from which conflict will explode, because they were once 'dominant and are in decline.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>CDC Boss Tests Positive for COVID Again: Rochelle Walensky is Diagnosed With Virus Just Days After Being Given the All-Clear[104] <br/>Dr Rochelle Walensky is once again positive with Covid after testing negative for it at some point over the nine days since she first caught the virus. She was treated with Paxlovid. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Elon Musk's Twitter Sees Mass Exodus of Top Executives[105] <br/>In less than a week after the closing of Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, much of the social media platform's leadership team has either been fired or resigned. <br/>A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed to FOX Business last week that Musk fired Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and Head of Legal, Policy and Trust Vijaya Gadde. General counsel Sean Edgett also confirmed on Twitter that he is no longer with the company after several outlets reported he was included in the firings. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Elon Musk to Fire Half of Twitter on Friday[106] <br/>Taking a page out of Thanos' playbook (or is that Zorg), in two days Elon Musk will finally do what he has repeatedly warned he would do: unleash mass layoffs at the company he just acquired. <br/>According to Bloomberg, the world's richest man will eliminate 3,700 jobs at Twitter — roughly half of the company's entire workforce — in a bid to drive down costs following his $44 billion acquisition; Musk will inform affected staffers Friday, said the Bloomberg sources. Oh, and all those masked snowflakes who previously raged against the previous management's 'draconian' demand to come back to the office, you're out of luck too: Musk intends to reverse the company's existing work-from-anywhere policy asking what few employees remain to report to offices. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Elon Musk Consults With ADL and Other Pressure Groups on Combatting 'Hate' And Preserving 'Election Integrity'[107] <br/>Less than a week after taking the reigns at Twitter, self-described 'free speech absolutist' Elon Musk talked with multiple representatives from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other groups that have pushed for increased online censorship to discuss 'how Twitter will continue to combat hate &amp; harassment &amp; enforce its election integrity policies.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Federal Judge Curtails Arizona Drop Box Monitoring, Limiting Armed Watchers, Ending Videos of Voters[108] <br/>A federal judge in Arizona has rules that election ballot dropbox monitors can no longer take photos or videos of voters, post information online about them or make 'false statements' about early voting in the state. <br/>The monitoring is being led by the voting-integrity group Clean Elections USA. <br/>Ahead of the decision Tuesday by Judge Michael Liburdi, of the U.S . District Court for the District of Arizona, the group agreed to stop openly carrying weapons or wearing body armor within 250 feet of ballot boxes and to stop interacting with voters within 75 feet. <br/>Liburdi, a Trump appointee, initially allowed the group to monitor drop boxes, in a parallel case. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>George Soros Spends Big in Last-Minute Attempt to Rescue Far-Left Texas District Attorneys[109] <br/>FIRST ON FOX: Liberal billionaire George Soros dropped massive last-minute cash into Texas to help save two far-left district attorney candidates he previously helped propel into office, according to campaign finance records reviewed by Fox News Digital. <br/>Soros pushed $1 million directly from his name and added $150,000 from his federal Democracy PAC II into the Texas Justice &amp; Public Safety PAC in mid-October, filings submitted this week to the Texas Ethics Commission show. Soros is the sole funder of the Texas-based PAC, which is led by Whitney Tymas, his longtime operator of such committees that pop up in various states supporting progressive prosecutor candidates. <br/>The money has since gone toward purchasing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of television and digital advertisements, direct mail and polling services supporting Bexar County DA Joe Gonzalez and Dallas County DA John Creuzot in the days following the cash infusion, the records show. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Hillary Clinton: Pelosi Attack Part of 'Racism, Misogyny, Antisemitism' Embraced by Conservatives[110] <br/>MSNBC's perpetual race baiter Joy Reid hosted Hillary Clinton Tuesday, who immediately suggested that the mysterious attack on Paul Pelosi, which was seemingly carried out by a whacked out left wing hippy, is part of the violent racism enabled by conservatives or something. <br/>'I wonder if you can just tell me how the attack on Paul Pelosi struck you?' Reid asked Clinton, adding 'And what did it tell you about the state of the right in this country and the hate toward a powerful woman?' <br/>Talk about framing the question. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>House GOP Demands Elon Musk Hand Over Info on Hunter Biden Laptop Censorship[111] <br/>Republican ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer, is calling on new Twitter owner Elon Musk to cooperate with the congressional request for the social media company to provide records related to the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story. According to Comer, who represents Kentucky's first district, former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal ignored the request back in April. <br/>Comer, who leads the minority party in the investigative committee, wrote a letter to Musk on Friday, right after he officially became the new owner. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>In Extraordinary Move, Federal Judge Moves to Fast Track Ruling on Biden Student Debt Forgiveness[112] <br/>A federal judge in Texas took the extraordinary step Wednesday of declaring he's ready to decide the legality of President Joe Biden's executive order canceling hundreds of billions of dollars of student loan debt, bypassing a current request for a preliminary injunction and the customary trial. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>'It Can Ruin Your Career': Glenn Greenwald Explains Why Journalists Are Terrified to Question Paul Pelosi Narrative[113] <br/>Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald said Sunday that there was a very simple reason that members of his chosen profession seemed unwilling to question the narrative surrounding the alleged attack on Paul Pelosi — namely the possibility that asking questions could put their careers at risk. <br/>Greenwald laid out his theory in a Twitter thread, saying that it didn't even matter whether or not the prevailing narrative — that the person who was arrested at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) was a far-right conspiracy theorist and election denier — was true. The point, he said, was that it couldn't be questioned. <br/>'It's very possible that the instantly formed media narrative — Paul Pelosi's attacker was a MAGA fanatic who broke in to murder Nancy — will be proven true. But right now there are so many glaring doubts and holes in that story that it just takes common sense to question this,' Greenwald began <br/>[90] <br/><br/>'It Was Chaos': Protest Over High School Dress Code Change Sparks Large Fight[114] <br/>SHARON HILL, Pa. — The school board in the Southeast Delco School District held an emergency meeting Wednesday night after a peaceful protest over a change in the dress code at Academy Park High School in Sharon Hill turns into a brawl. <br/>The fights broke out Tuesday morning both inside and outside the 1,300-student school. At least ten students were arrested and will likely be charged with aggravated assault and related charges. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Jim Jordan Demands Biden's AG Turn Over Documents on Project Veritas, Mar-a-Lago Raid[115] <br/>On Wednesday, Representative Jim Jordan sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding that the Department of Justice respond to their requests for documents and information regarding several issues including the 'Department's targeting of journalists with Project Veritas' as well as the raid at former President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence this summer. <br/>Jordan said that the House Committee on the Judiciary, of which Jordan is a Ranking Member, is 'conducting oversight of the Department of Justice's operations and actions concerning various matters.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Kansas Woman Who Helmed Female ISIS Battalion Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison[116] <br/>Allison Fluke-Ekren, a 42-year-old woman who grew up on a farm in Overbrook, Kansas, was sentenced to two decades in prison on Tuesday for leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female ISIS battalion in Raqqa, Syria. <br/>Fluke-Ekren's own children asked the judge to hand down the maximum sentence, 20 years, during victim impact statements at the hearing. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Musk Mocks AOC, Others Angry Over Price for Twitter Blue Check[117] <br/>Elon Musk on Wednesday shot back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., after she ridiculed his plan to charge $8 a month for Twitter users to receive a verified blue check mark. <br/>'Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that 'free speech' is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday, after Musk announced the overhaul. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>North Korea Sending Artillery to Russia for War in Ukraine, White House Says[118] <br/>The suspected shipments through third countries in the Middle East and North Africa come as Kyiv advances on the battlefield <br/>WASHINGTON—North Korea is covertly supplying Russia's war in Ukraine with a significant number of artillery shells through indirect routes that include shipments through third countries in the Middle East and North Africa, the Biden administration said Wednesday. <br/>White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that while the U.S. has had indications for some time that Russia had requested artillery shells from North Korea, the administration now has information that shipments have begun. <br/>The shipments, though sizable, aren't expected to change the course of Ukraine's effort to defend its territory against Russia's invasion, Mr. Kirby said. <br/>'We're not talking dozens here. It's a significant number of artillery shells,' Mr. Kirby told reporters. 'We're still monitoring this to determine if the shipments have been actually received.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Paul Pelosi Attack: Capitol Police Begin 'Internal Security Review' After Officers Missed Break-in[119] <br/>The U.S. Capitol Police have begun an 'internal security review' after officers in its Command Center missed live video surveillance outside the Pelosi's San Francisco residence when David DePape allegedly broke into the house and attacked Paul Pelosi. <br/>Sources told Fox News that the officers were watching a live-feed of many cameras which include surveillance of the Capitol complex, as well as several points away from the Capitol such as the Pelosi's San Francisco residence. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Pressure Groups Target Top Twitter Advertisers, Encouraging Them to Put Pressure on Elon Musk to Censor[120] <br/>Responding to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, 40 pressure and media groups have sent a letter to major advertisers on the social network, pressuring them to force Musk to adhere to their content moderation demands or boycott Twitter. <br/>'We, the undersigned organizations, call on you to notify Musk and publicly commit that you will cease all advertising on Twitter globally if he follows through on his plans to undermine brand safety and community standards including gutting content moderation,' the letter reads. 'This means that Musk must not roll back the basic moderation practices Twitter already has on the books now and must commit to actually enforcing those rules.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Senator Dick Durbin Says Free Speech Doesn't Protect 'Misinformation' That Downplays Political Violence[121] <br/>'Free speech does not include spreading misinformation to downplay political violence,' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who also is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted — referencing an alleged 'uptick in hate speech' since Elon Musk took Twitter private. <br/>'Misinformation' is protected by the First Amendment. <br/>The uptick that Senator Durbin is referencing was a bot campaign that Twitter suggests was used to troll the platform and the media as soon as Musk took control of the company. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Suspect in Shooting of 2 Newark Police Officers in Custody[122] <br/>NEWARK, N.J. — Two police officers were shot Tuesday in Newark. <br/>Both officers were rushed to University Hospital, where they are in stable condition. <br/>Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Kendall Howard, of East Orange. <br/>He was taken into custody late Wednesday morning. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Suspect in Double Homicide Released From Seattle Jail 2 Days Prior to Killings, Had 69 Priors[123] <br/>Seattle Police have arrested John Marcel Williams, a prolific offender, for the Sunday afternoon double homicide of a 53-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman inside an apartment building for the homeless. <br/>The victims were identified as Maryanne Wooden and Howard Hicks and were stabbed around 160 times in total when they were murdered in a 'transitional Supportive Housing project' in the Georgetown neighborhood. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>The Hill Publishes Op-Ed Suggesting Biden Might be Removed by the 25th Amendment[124] <br/>The Hill published an op-ed questioning whether President Joe Biden will be removed from office under the 25th Amendment, which can be invoked when a president is considered unable to carry out his duties as commander-in-chief. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>The Midterm Election Rigging is Underway[125] <br/>by Daniel Greenfield <br/>Election Day results, like clean streets and easily available products in supermarkets, have become artifacts of a recent glorious past. Don't count on finding eggs and milk at the market or finding out who won the election on Election Day. The 2022 midterms, like the 2020 elections, are a work in progress that will, one day, when the right ballots are found, elect somebody. <br/>Acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman, the leftist election rigging activist appointed by Gov. Tom Wolf, warned that it will take days to determine who won. At a 'virtual press conference', the virtual election boss, who hasn't actually been confirmed by the legislature, warned that it would take 'several days worth of work' to determine who won what. And who didn't. <br/>Chapman, a veteran of The Advancement Project, funded by Soros and the Ford Foundation, which worked against voter ID rules to stop voter fraud, and Let America Vote, a leftist group to eliminate election security regulations, urged voters to 'feel confident in our election system and in the final results.' Nothing creates confidence in an election system like a radical partisan activist being put in charge of it and then warning that the FBI will target any critics <br/>[1][90] <br/><br/>Trinity College Removed American Flags From Students' Window But Allowed Pride Flags to Remain for Days Later[126] <br/>Trinity College in Connecticut forcibly removed two variations of the American flag from a dormitory window last week despite allowing other flags, like the pride flag, to remain for days after the incident. <br/>Roommates Finn McCole and Lucas Turco spoke to Fox News Digital about the incident, which was caught on video and first reported by Libs of TikTok. McCole said the flags were put up on Wednesday night and by the next day the college administration came to take down the flags. <br/>On Thursday, several university employees showed up outside their dorm room to take down the two flags, one of which was the American flag with the Gadsden 'Don't Tread on Me' graphic superimposed on it and the other was a 'Thin Line' flag — a black and white American flag with blue, green and red stripes, representing police, military and federal agents, and firefighters, respectively. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Video: Rand Paul Accuses Dems of Using Pelosi Attack for Political Gain[127] <br/>Appearing on Fox News Tuesday night, Senator Rand Paul accused Democrats of politicising the mysterious attack on Paul Pelosi in order to 'misdirect' voters away from the state of the country ahead of the midterms. <br/>'I think we should have some compassion for Paul Pelosi and not make anything about politics,' Paul noted, adding 'But I see today and yesterday, all the left wing is doing, all the Democrats are doing, are trying to make this about politics.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Canadian Doctors Encouraged to Tell Patients About Medically Assisted Death[128] <br/>Guidance documents given to Canada's providers of medically assisted death say that doctors must bring up medical assistance in dying (MAID) as an option when it's 'medically relevant' and if the person is likely eligible, as part of a doctor's duty to provide informed consent. <br/>The National Post reports that most jurisdictions in the world with legalized MAID prevent doctors from raising the practice with patients. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Moe Introduces Saskatchewan Autonomy Act, Following Alberta[129] <br/>Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe introduced The Saskatchewan First Act on Tuesday, the goal of which is to assert their provincial autonomy over matters assigned to the provinces in the 1867 Constitution Act. <br/>The Act, also known as Bill 88, comes after Alberta Premier Danielle Smith won the United Conservative Party leadership in part on her campaigning for an Alberta Sovereignty Act. However, Bill 88 does not go as far as the new UCP leader's legislation. <br/>Moe's legislation attempts to draw a clear line between provincial and federal jurisdiction, informed by the Constitution Act's provisions outlining provincial and federal powers, particularly when it comes to the province's natural resources, forestry industry, energy generation and production, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and fertilizer use. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Preston Manning to Chair Citizen-Led Inquiry Into Pandemic[130] <br/>An independent group of Canadians chaired by former Reform Party leader Preston Manning has launched what's being called the National Citizens Inquiry (NCI) to investigate federal and provincial responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. <br/>The NCI will be conducted through a federally incorporated not-for-profit and will include subject matter experts across the scientific, medical, legal and social spectrums. <br/>'The magnitude of these interventions demands a comprehensive, transparent, and objective inquiry into the appropriateness and efficacy of the measures imposed,' said Manning. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Recap Day 15 of Emergencies Act Hearings[131] <br/>Room erupts during Pat King's testimony <br/>On Day 15 of the Emergencies Act hearings, more Freedom Convoy representatives took the stand including Convoy lawyer Keith Wilson, representative Tom Marazzo and live-streamer Patrick King. <br/>The proceedings were temporarily halted during King's testimony after a heated exchange between him and Ottawa lawyer Paul Champ who was questioning him. <br/>It started when Champ asked King if the Convoy had caused downtown Ottawa to become a 'dangerous situation.' <br/>'Not at all. I met the most loving, most caring people,' said King. 'Everywhere you went you were getting hugs, you were getting handshakes. Nobody was violent.' <br/>Champ then asked King why he needed to have security with him during the Convoy. King responded that he had people threatening his life. <br/>'People were dropping marbles from high-rises,' said King. 'They were throwing eggs, and the citizens of Ottawa were threatening to run us over.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Cost of Energy Hampering Austria's Only Salt Producer[132] <br/>Salinen AG, based in Ebensee, is Austria's only salt producer. Because of the massive price increases in energy, production has been cut back by 20 percent. <br/>Just as Germans can no longer bank on clean water with standards lowered to compensate for a lack of energy in sewage treatment, Austria's only salt producer is facing problems. CEO Peter Untersperger called for an end to the suicide sanctions against Russia. <br/>The salt works already charge 12 percent more for salt, but actually they should raise the price by a good 30 percent so that they do not get in trouble with the increased costs. Because the stocks of gas are gradually decreasing and they have to buy more at the massively increased market price. <br/>Production will therefore initially be reduced by 20 percent by the end of the year. CEO Peter Untersperger is especially tough on politicians. He demanded that Germany open Nord Stream 2 so that enough gas could flow to Europe and market prices could drop again. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Czech Commentator Trashes Hungary for Blocking Higher Corporate Taxes, Claims France is More Aligned With Czech Interests[133] <br/>In another sign that the Visegrad Four alliance has undergone a major ideological break, one of Czechia's top news portals, iDNES.cz, has run a piece slamming Hungary's opposition to a higher corporate tax rate in the European Union. The author, Helena Truchla, claims it is another example of how countries like France and the Netherlands are closer allies of Czechia than Hungary. <br/>'Giant companies should pay fair taxes, the states of the European Union agree. Czechia would also receive more money in the state budget, but the agreement is being blocked by our alleged ally, Hungary. The data shows that this is not unique: In the EU, we more often agree with countries other than Hungary and Poland,' she writes. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Denmark Election: Centre-Left Bloc Comes Out on Top[134] <br/>Denmark's centre-left has secured the most votes in a general election widely seen as a confidence vote in the country's leader. <br/>Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's 'red bloc' of parties has secured the required 90 seats to form a government. <br/>Her Social Democrats party unexpectedly gained two seats and secured its best result in two decades. <br/>But she wants to form a broader coalition and has handed in the government's resignation to the queen. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Extinction Rebellion Fanatics Interrupt Dutch Orchestra Playing Verdi's Requiem to Prattle on About the Climate Crisis and Compare the Planet to the 'Sinking Titanic'[135] <br/>Extinction Rebellion activists interrupted a concert in The Netherlands on Wednesday evening, comparing the government's response to the climate crisis to the orchestra that played as The Titanic sank in 1912. <br/>A protester stood up in The Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam during a performance of Verdi's Requiem before saying: 'We are in the middle of a climate crisis and we are like the orchestra on the Titanic that keeps playing quietly while the ship is already sinking.' <br/>Three activists interrupted the performance at around 8.30pm local time to call on the Dutch Government to 'do everything possible' to reach carbon neutrality by 2025, as an audience member shouted at the chair-standing activist to sit down. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Gen Z 'Less Tolerant' Than Previous Generations, UK Study Finds[136] <br/>A new study from the UK has found that Generation Z are less tolerant than their elders, with nearly half of respondents saying that some people deserve to be 'canceled.' <br/>Researchers studying the rise of 'young illiberal progressives' conducted the study on young people aged 13-24 as well as on people over 25, The Times reports. <br/>The study, conducted by Channel 4, stated that a quarter of Gen Z respondents have 'very little tolerance' for people they 'disagree with.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Halloween Riots Break Out Across Europe as 86 Arrested in France Alone[137] <br/>Riots broke out in several cities in Scotland, Germany, Austria and several cities and towns in France where 86 people were arrested and nearly 90 cars were set on fire. <br/>In the Scottish city of Dundee, riots took place when gangs of young people blocked roads and threw fireworks, forcing drivers to turn away in the Kirkton area, with the rioting lasting several hours. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Hungary's Orban is Playing to Win, Says French Author[138] <br/>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is showing other European nations that there are alternatives to losing their sovereignty and bending the knee to Brussels, writes French author Thibaud Gibelin in his book 'Orban is playing to win.' <br/>'In just a few years, Viktor Orban has become the face of Central Europe for the French public. My essay is entitled 'The revival of Central Europe.' Understanding the Hungarian prime minister means recognizing the main trends represented by Fidesz in Hungary, which are gaining ground in neighboring countries and which would have remained out of the spotlight without (Orban as) a spokesman,' Gibelin said during an interview with Hungarian news portal Index regarding the key conclusions of his book. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Italy: Meloni Polling at Nearly 30 Per Cent After Forming New Government[139] <br/>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI) are polling at nearly 30 per cent nationally after Meloni formed the new government, becoming the country's first female Prime Minister. <br/>The new poll, released by the firm SWG, puts Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI) at 29.1 per cent, continuing a trend of increased popularity since her party won 26 per cent of the vote in September's national election. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Italy's Government Passes New Law Against Illegal Raves, But Left Claims Law Threatens Freedom[140] <br/>One of the first things Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government did was to amend the penal code to crack down on the growing problem of illegal rave parties across the country. The left opposition, however, is now attacking the government claiming that the measure is a furtive way to curtail freedoms. <br/>The amendment, which came into effect just as police were dismantling a rave party in Modena, raises the maximum penalty for unauthorized occupation of public spaces or buildings by over 50 people with three to six years in prison. <br/>Using the new law, police forces declared the Modena rave party, held in a hangar, unauthorized. Authorities identified more than 1,300 people and 300 vehicles, seized technical equipment worth €150,000, and are prosecuting 14 organizers of the illegal rave. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Luxembourg Suspends Night Bus Service to France Due to Violence[141] <br/>Transportation authorities in Luxembourg have decided to suspend services of some buses that cross into France during the night amid a surge of violence and vandalism, according to reports. <br/>Two routes that originate in Luxembourg will no longer operate in northern France after 6:30 p.m., L'essential reports. <br/>Luxembourg's Ministry of Mobility made the move after a series of incidents affecting the RGTR 703 and 732 lines, both of which pass through the French commune of Mont-Saint-Martin, which lies in the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Netherlands: Protestors in Girl With a Pearl Earring Vandalism Convicted; Sentenced to 2 Months in Jail[142] <br/>This article was updated with the court's verdict. <br/>Two of the three suspects involved in a climate protest that targeted an iconic painting at the Mauritshuis in The Hague were sentenced to two months in prison, one of which may be conditionally suspended. Wouter M. was convicted for his role in the protest, in which he glued his head to the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Pieter G. who filmed the incident, was also convicted. <br/>It was previously announced that the painting, which was covered in glass, was not damaged. However, the frame and paneling around the frame were damaged. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>PayPal's Ideological Deplatforming Spurs Proposed UK Amendment to Stop Financial Companies Policing Speech[143] <br/>The recent politically-tinted PayPal trouble in the UK does not seem to have died the same ignoble — and (un)deserved in nature, anonymous — 'death' as so many cases over the recent years have — when Big Tech and their subsidiaries/minions have been called to task, as essentially the agents to stifle whatever speech went against the Big Narrative. <br/>The 'no reaction' to accounts getting blocked for legitimate political reasons would have been happening due to, quite simply put, politics. <br/>So is it okay to cancel a person's PayPal account — on account of their political stance — in a democracy? <br/>As far as UK legislators, it now looks like this 'conundrum' seems to be getting close to a solution. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Some Weapons Destined for Ukraine Ending Up With Finnish Criminals[144] <br/>Organized crime is on the rise in Finland, and there's a high demand for weapons. Criminal networks have already established weapon smuggling routes between Finland and Poland. <br/>Europol, the European police cooperation organization, is reported to have warned in the summer that armed criminal groups could soon start smuggling weapons from Ukraine to EU member states. <br/>According to Christer Ahlgren, superintendent of the Organized Crime Intelligence Unit of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (Keskusrikospoliisi, KRP), Europol's prediction has already become a reality in Finland. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>UK: Female Police Officer, 40, Filmed Herself Performing Sex Act While on Duty in Her Station and Sent Video to Her Partner, Misconduct Panel Hears[145] <br/>Former police officer Clare Ogden has been carpeted for recording a raunchy video of herself in a police station for her partner. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>UK: Public Safety Campaign Tells Londoners to Travel With a Friend and Cover Up Expensive Watches After Rise in High-Value Theft[146] <br/>Londoners are being warned to travel in numbers, to cover up expensive watches, and to hand over valuables if they are confronted following a rise in high-value thefts in the U.K. capital. <br/>Watch Collecting, a global auction platform devoted to prestige and luxury watches, has taken it upon themselves to launch a public safety campaign in affluent districts in West London, launching digital billboards advising wearers of luxury timepieces to keep them concealed and not to wear them unless necessary. <br/>The advice is offered in the form of a 'watch' acronym, calling on people to 'wear it with care, avoid unnecessary risk, travel with a friend, cover it up,' and 'hand it over if threatened.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>UK: Rishi Sunak Caves in: Flying to COP27 Climate Talks After All[147] <br/>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a spectacular reverse Wednesday and announced he will now fly to Egypt for the globalist COP 27 climate talks. <br/>The hastily arranged trip comes after he previously said he was just too busy running the country, confronting inflation, addressing crime rates, trying to deal with cross-border illegal immigration and a 'broken' asylum seeker programme to spare the time to participate. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>WEF Publishes Post on Digital 'Battery Passport, ' Described as 'A Digital ID for Batteries'[148] <br/>The World Economic Forum (WEF) has taken up yet another climate change and 'clean green energy' cause: car batteries footprint, and what to do about it. <br/>One thing the Davos-based group seems to be pushing are the activities of an organization called the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) — and its freshly published Greenhouse Gas Rulebook. <br/>A piece on the group's site manages to work a type of digital ID into the whole story, as a component in monitoring the impact car batteries have on the environment, with the rulebook designed to calculate and track 'greenhouse gas' footprint linked to lithium-ion batteries, whether used in vehicles or elsewhere. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Ukraine War: Moscow Rejoins Grain Deal; Russian Missile Strikes Continue; And UK Sanctions[149] <br/>Here are the latest news developments from Russia's war in Ukraine. <br/>1. Russia renews UN grain deal after four days in abrupt U-turn <br/>Russia has performed an abrupt U-turn and again agreed to allow the safe shipment of millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. <br/>Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu told his Turkish counterpart on Wednesday that Moscow has agreed to return to the Turkish and UN-brokered deal. <br/>In a statement, the ministry later confirmed that Ukraine had pledged not to use a designated Black Sea corridor to attack Russian forces. <br/>'The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,' the ministry statement said. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>US Slams Russia's 'Ridiculous' Claims With 'No Factual Basis' That British PM Liz Truss Sent a Text to Antony Blinken Saying 'It's Done' After the Nord Stream Pipeline Explosion[150] <br/>Russia has accused Britain and the U.S. of conspiring to blow up the Nord Stream gas pipes, claiming Liz Truss texted Antony Blinken after the explosion saying 'it's done.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>China Says Its Digital Currency Will Offer 'Controllable Anonymity'[151] <br/>The push around the world to introduce digital versions of cash — Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — is most often promoted as a way to allow more people to gain access to financial services, but also as a convenience. <br/>Opponents of these schemes, however, say there is nothing particularly 'convenient' in having more potential for surveillance and tracking woven into yet another key area of life. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>China Denies Existence of Secret Police Stations in the Netherlands[152] <br/>China denied that offices which were set up in the Netherlands are actually secret police stations. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said from Beijing on Wednesday that these are centers that help Chinese citizens renew documents. <br/>The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague is investigating what kind of activities are actually carried out from the Chinese offices. Minister Wopke Hoekstra said that the existence of Chinese police stations in the Netherlands was 'unacceptable,' and announced on Tuesday that the centers must close immediately. He also noted that it has already been shown that consular activities took place at the locations without permission from the Netherlands, which is not allowed. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>South Korea May Build Nuclear Plant for Poland[153] <br/>Polish and South Korean officials have signed initial agreements to develop a nuclear power plant in Poland. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Video: CNBC's Jim Cramer Goes on Bizarre Pro-China COVID Lockdown, Vaccine Propaganda Rant[154] <br/>Financial analyst Jim Cramer appeared to confuse the hell out of his CNBC co-hosts Tuesday by going on a bizarre rant about Chinese COVID lockdown and vaccine propaganda being a good thing. <br/>The context for the strange outburst is that news of China potentially easing COVID restrictions and re-opening has seen improvements in the stock market. <br/>China's change in direction after months of brutal lockdowns is reportedly to be headed up by the nation's chief propagandist. <br/>And that's where Cramer came in to sell the 'good side' of propaganda, noting that we only think of propaganda being bad because of 'regimes we didn't really appreciate.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Extraordinary Moment Daniel Andrews' Closest Ally Refuses to Answer a Simple Question About ISIS Brides FIVE Times[155] <br/>Three weeks out from the Victorian state election, Daniel Andrews' closest ally has repeatedly refused to say if Victoria will take back Isis brides and their families from camps in Syria. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Family Sleeping in a Tent at Taronga Zoo When Five 'Dangerous' Lions Escaped Their Enclosure Relive the Terrifying Moment a Frantic Keeper Screamed at Them: 'Hurry Up!

The blockades began Sunday after polls closed in Brazil. <br/>Although smaller than in previous days, the protests are still likely disrupting fuel distribution, industrial activity, food deliveries to supermarkets and shipments of grains to ports. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>After Migrant Rape Wave in Austria, Twitter Suspends Conservative Politician Who Criticizes Police and Mass Migration[160] <br/>The capital of Austria has been hit with a wave of shocking rape cases involving migrant men, but a conservative politician in Vienna now faces a Twitter suspension simply for criticizing the police response to the crisis, <br/>A post by Dominik Nepp, the chairman of the Vienna branch of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP), allegedly violated the rules on hate speech, according to Twitter. Nepp wrote in his post that there have been a number of attacks in Vienna involving 'girls who were raped by asylum seekers.' He criticized the police, writing that they merely boasted 'they had responded to a crime involving a drunk who had fallen asleep' by waking him up. Twitter slapped the post with a suspension and warned that 'repeated violations will lead to a permanent suspension of the account.' <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Albanian Channel Migrant Crackdown Under Threat After Nation's PM Edi Rama Accuses Suella Braverman of 'Discrimination' As UK Ministers Try to Negotiate 'Fast Track' Return Deal[161] <br/>Plans to negotiate a 'fast track' deal to remove Albanian Channel migrants 'within days' of their arrival were dealt a blow today after the country's Prime Minister accused Suella Braverman of 'discriminating' against his citizens. <br/>In a series of strongly worded tweets, Edi Rama called for 'mutual respect' as he attacked 'insane' and 'easy rhetoric'. <br/>The under-fire Home Secretary has frequently singled out Albanian asylum seekers after their numbers crossing the Channel in small boats spiralled. She has also been considering negotiating a 'bespoke route' with the nation to get failed Albanian asylum seekers removed from the UK quicker. <br/>[90] <br/><br/>Border Battle!

Even saying he'll invite the media inside.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Plus. And there they are. Team USA extending its record of Women's World Cup titles and their exceptional play is adding more fuel to the debate over equal pay.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and around the world. I'm Paula Newton. And this is CNN newsroom.</p><p>The standoff between Iran and the U.S. keeps escalating. This after Tehran announced Sunday it's enriching uranium past levels allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal. Now, it says it could breach even more of the agreement in about two months. The move looks aimed to be trying to get European countries help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.</p><p>Now, the showdown started after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from that nuclear deal. He had this warning on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Iran better be careful. Because you enrich for one reason, and I won't tell you what that reason is, but it's no good. They better be careful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: CNN's Fred Pleitgen now is tracking this story. He joins us now live from Moscow. And you've spent many times -- you've been many times to Iran and spoken recent weeks with the Iranian leadership. Kind of give us some insight into what's behind this most recent decision.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, I think you put it absolutely correctly, Paula. The Iranians are trying to put pressure on the European countries because essentially what they're saying is with the nuclear agreement that is, of course, still in place, they're saying that they have been abiding by the nuclear agreement, putting extreme curbs on their nuclear program, their civilian nuclear program.</p><p>At the same time, they've gotten nothing in return, they say, except for additional sanctions making their economic situation worse. Now the Iranians are demanding of the Europeans to try to find some way to get around those sanctions.</p><p>Of course, what the Europeans have been saying there is that there is a system in the work, and in fact, that is already at least partially operational that's supposed to allow deals between Europe and Iran at least on a humanitarian basis, on a barter basis, essentially.</p><p>And the Europeans are saying that that is taking longer than planned to get going but they are saying that it is something that's in the works that is moving forward. The Iranians are saying that for their taste it is all moving way too slow and they haven't been satisfied also with the series of recent talks that have been going on with the Europeans to try and find some sort of way forward to allow the Iranians to have some remedy for their economic woes.</p><p>Now, the move that they've made now, Paula, is indeed a significant one. What they've done in the past or in the past couple of weeks is they say they've exceeded the amount of low enriched uranium that they are allowed to stockpile.</p><p>Basically, they made the same quality of low enriched uranium, but just made more of it than they were supposed to have under the nuclear agreement. They say that's something that they are allowed to do under the nuclear agreement as part of a remedy mechanism that's in that nuclear agreement if they feel that other countries are not living up to the deal.</p><p>But what they're doing now is they're changing the quality of the low enriched uranium that they're making. Before that, their level that they were -- their ceiling level, if you will, of the quality of uranium was 3.67 percent. Now the Iranians are saying they're going to exceed that.</p><p>The talk is around 5 percent enrichment, which is of course a higher enriched uranium. But one thing that we have to put into perspective, is that it takes uranium enriched to about 90 percent to actually make a nuclear weapon.</p><p>So, the Iranians still very much away from that, a very far away from that. They continue to say obviously they don't want nuclear weapons. They say they want this for their civilian nuclear program but they are now going to make low enriched uranium as they see fit and as they need, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, clearly a tactic though on their part, and clearly, they feel that this is the hand that they have to play, and yet, I have to ask you strategically, are they likely to get to the goal that they want? I mean, look, you and I have discussed it before, right, Fred? Right? Europe, Germany, Britain, France, they know that they need to do something for Iran in order for them to continue to adhere to this 2015 deal.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Yes.</p><p>NEWTON: What could possibly change with these next moves from Iran?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, I think it's going to be very difficult. And I think what the Europeans have been saying is they've been urging the Iranians to abide by their commitments, to have more patients. And the Iranians are quite frankly, saying that their patience is running out.</p><p>[03:04:59] And, of course, all of this has an international, an international aspect to it, which is, of course, very important with the Europeans wanting to keep the deal.</p><p>The Iranians knowing that the Europeans want to keep the deal because, of course, they did a lot of negotiating for it and they see it as an important security agreement for themselves as well.</p><p>But of course, the Iranians also have domestic political concerns as well where this nuclear agreement is becoming more and more unpopular. And especially the hardline forces which are very powerful in Iran are saying, look, why are we continuing to abide by this deal putting curbs on our nuclear program when in return all we're getting is additional sanctions and those sanctions are becoming tougher?</p><p>So, for the Iranians this is something that has several dimensions. Is there way out of it? It's very difficult for the European nations to make that happen. Because one of the things that I think President Trump put very bluntly, he said anybody who is going to do business with the Iranians is not going to be doing business with the United States.</p><p>So, on that level very difficult for the Europeans to be able to get around that. Obviously, they're longstanding allies of the United States so it's difficult for them, but they say it's something they want to continue to try to do and see whether or not they can come to some sort of agreement with the Iranians, but right now, it seems like it's going to be very difficult to achieve that, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, significant here of course as you pointed out to us before, is the kind of suffering that Iranians are going on under up these sanctions and the fact that the sanctions are biting and they're also very well-enforced these days.</p><p>Our Fred Pleitgen following all of this from Moscow. I appreciate it.</p><p>Now President Trump says he's not going to bother talking about the British ambassador to the United States who had some -- we're going to call them less than flattering things to say about him.</p><p>In a series of leaked memos back to London the ambassador wrote, President Donald Trump radiates insecurity and his administration is, quote, ""dysfunctional, clumsy and inept."" President Trump responded briefly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The ambassador has not served the U.K. well. I can tell you that. We're not -- we're not big fans of that man.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, our Anna Stewart has more details from London.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: These memos have the potential to cause serious diplomatic damage to the U.K.'s special relationship with the United States. Scathing attacks both on the president and on the White House.</p><p>In one memo the ambassador writes, ""We really don't believe that this administration is going to become substantially more normal, less dysfunctional, less unpredictable, less faction driven, less diplomatically clumsy and inept.""</p><p>Other memos delve into specific policy issues, calling the administration's policy on Iran incoherent. Saying alleged links between the president and Russia could see the presidency crashing and burning.</p><p>But then also warning the British government not to underestimate the president's ability to shrug off controversy and scandal. Writing that he could, quote, ""Emerge from the flames battered but in fact, like Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of the Terminator.""</p><p>The U.K.'s foreign office hasn't been able to deny the veracity of the memos. They issued a statement defending the need for candid, honest assessments from their ambassadors, but they have launched a formal investigation into how these sensitive memos were leaked.</p><p>NEWTON: That was our Anna Stewart reporting.</p><p>We want to turn now to the southern U.S. border where hundreds of migrants are being held in detention centers. There has been a growing number of reports of dangerous overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. Despite that, President Trump says the latest report in the New York Times isn't true.</p><p>Natasha Chen has more.</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The New York Times and El Paso Times worked together to interview about a dozen border patrol agents who described conditions inside. They said it was a severely crowded with the spread of disease like chicken pox and scabies. The stench of the children's clothing so strong that they went home with that stench on their own clothing.</p><p>Now we talked to Texas State Representative Mary Gonzalez who represents the Clint area where that facility is. She says patrol -- border patrol agents told her they'd been raising the alarm before to their superiors with not much being done. She said at one point there were even 700 kids packed into this space with only two showers and a microwave. The conditions she says have now improved.</p><p>But President Trump reacted to this New York Times story, saying this was a hoax, but he did say he wanted the press to go inside and take a look, which so far we have not been able to do with cameras.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And in all cases, if you look, people that came from unbelievable poverty, that had no water, they had no anything where they came from, those are people that are very happy with what's going on because relatively speaking they're in much better shape right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: That was Natasha Chen reporting. And now Natasha Lindstaedt joins us from Colchester, England. She's a professor of government at the University of Essex.</p><p>Now, you know, we heard from the president saying that a lot of those reports are untrue, and yet these images that we're getting out of these detention centers have been incredibly alarming to Americans no matter whether if they're Democratic or Republican.</p><p>[03:10:06] I think in terms of trying to get to some sort of solution, where do we go from here when the Democrats and, of course, the president seems so divided on the issue?</p><p>NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Well, I think the first step would be to provide more funding at these facilities at the border because as the reports have said, you have just inhumane conditions that people are forced to live in.</p><p>With an accusation that women were forced to drink out of toilets, that there is just not proper sanitation, that people don't have access to showers, to laundry facility, to food, to adequate health care, it's just shocking, and I think people have been shocked by the photos of everybody sort of just crammed into tiny cells that are meant for 12 people. You have almost 100 people.</p><p>These are just such shocking conditions that I think everybody is on board with the idea that they need to provide more funding for this. But, you know, the Democrats and the Republicans are so divided on this because they just completely disagree with how to deal with the immigration crisis at hand.</p><p>The Democrats have been very critical of Trump for not investing enough in the asylum system, judges, lawyers, for not investing enough in the border facilities themselves and instead focusing on some sort of wall or deterrent policy.</p><p>For in 2017 he stopped a program where Central American children could apply from home and then, of course, for implementing this family separation policy to begin with. That's what led to this crisis that you've seen these families being separated but also refusing to really acknowledge that there is a problem with these border facilities. NEWTON: And yet I think, again, Americans are looking at these images, we were just showing some of them, they're shocked and they want some kind of a solution. How do you think that will end up shaping the 2020 campaign?</p><p>LINDSTAEDT: That's really hard to say. Because I think the Republican Party still thinks immigration is a huge problem, though actually the number apprehended is far lower than it was in the '80s, '90s and early 2000s.</p><p>It was around 1.6. million people and in 2019 there was around 400,000 people. So, they still think that immigration is a big issue where the Democrats welcome immigration and think they just need to reform the system a bit to enhance it and then also provide more foreign aid to some of these desperately impoverished countries in Central America to deal with the violence, to deal with the poverty to stem this type of immigration to some extent.</p><p>So, they're very divided on this particular policy. We noted in the Democratic debates that took place immigration was an issue, people were talking about it, and people were pointing out the fact that the U.S. as a really big Democratic country has some responsibilities to take moral high ground on this and to showcase to the world that they're able to deal with immigration in a humane manner.</p><p>That's something the Democrats will talk about. But ultimately, I don't think it's going to be the biggest issue for the Democrats. They're going to be talking about healthcare and the economy and the Republicans under Trump are going to be talking about the need for a wall.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it will be interesting, certainly, as many Americans said are appalled by those images and no matter how they feel about immigration don't want to see that happening.</p><p>We also then highlighted the issue of this British ambassador to the United States. Some very colorful cables there. I mean, I contend and I've had people disagree with me that the leaks weren't all that substantive. They might have been salacious. But I was hoping for something a little bit more substantial.</p><p>I want to ask you what's behind these leaks, why now, and in general, who and what were they trying to influence?</p><p>LINDSTAEDT: That's another really good question. It's not really that clear to me if they were trying to influence whoever is going to be the next prime minister to just be aware of, you know, the way Trump operates and some of the, you know, repercussions of the fact that he really is a political novice.</p><p>There have been accusations not just from the British but actually from within his own administration that he is considered to be incompetent and just not very well-informed and not interested in governing.</p><p>And these leaks also came out sort of as a warning. You need to be prepared. You need to be able to deal with this. Allegedly his own Secretary of State Rex Tillerson thought that he was completely incompetent.</p><p>So, it seems to be some kind of communication to whoever is going to be taking over next, but ironically, if it is Boris Johnson that becomes the prime minister, he seems to have a pretty good relationship with Trump and he doesn't seem to think that he is incompetent.</p><p>So possibly the ambassador was just trying to communicate to whoever might take over. I don't think anything in there is that shocking based on what had already been revealed within Trump's own administration.</p><p>NEWTON: Right. That is a very good point. Certainly, though, some colorful language and analogies. Natasha, thanks so much for joining us. I really appreciate it.</p><p>[03:15:01] LINDSTAEDT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>NEWTON: Now Greek voters have spoken and a new prime minister will take office in just a few hours from now, but will it bring the kind of change the Greeks are craving?</p><p>Plus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Goal.

The drumbeat grows ever louder for equal pay.</p><p>NEWTON: U.S. Women's soccer team have made history once again. They are now World Cup champions for a record fourth time. Now they beat the Netherlands two-nil on Sunday to extend that record for most World Cup titles. Now team co-captain Megan Rapinoe was named the tournament's best player. No surprise there. She was also quick to, of course, praise her teammates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGAN RAPINOE, TEAM CO-CAPTAIN, U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM: We've done exactly what we've set out to do. We've done exactly what we want to do. We say what we feel. All of us, really.

I don't think we have really anything to say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: The World Cup victory comes as the women's team is, in fact, suing the U.S. Soccer Federation for gender discrimination. They say they deserve to be paid as much as the men who have yet to win a single World Cup title.</p><p>Now on Sunday, President Trump told reporters he needs to learn more about the pay disparity in soccer before weighing in on the debate, but he did congratulate the women on the big win.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I want to congratulate the women's soccer team on winning the World Cup. That's an incredible achievement. It was a very exciting game. I got to see a little bit of it. And they're great players and it's a great honor to have them capture it for the United States. Fourth time. That's a tremendous thing. So, congratulations to the team on the World Cup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now the women's team will be honored to a traditional ticker tape parade in New York City on Wednesday. But of course, many fans, yes, they are already celebrating that latest championship.</p><p>Our Polo Sandoval is in New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Even if you weren't watching the game, all you had to do if you were in Brooklyn was listen for the massive cheers that were echoing from this massive archway that's directly under the iconic Manhattan Bridge.</p><p>The crowd obviously has thinned out but the energy certainly remains, including from Ali Berkowitz (Ph) and Stephen Santa (Ph), two New Jersey resident who travelled all the way here to participate in this massive moment.</p><p>Ali, I'll start with you. You told me that you played soccer as a little girl. So, this was, this is adding significance for you. Tell me about the way, about today's victory.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was awesome. We were expecting it, I got to be honest with that, but nothing beats this moment. It's so much fun.</p><p>SANDOVAL: We were talking a little bit about what the other team brought to the table. We also didn't want to jinx it, though. I feel like that didn't happen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. No, I totally didn't want to jinx it. That keeper, I mean, she killed it. (Inaudible) really awesome too. So, it was great seeing the skill on the other team.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Stephen, for you, what was that moment like when you were sharing this space with a massive crowd when they carried it all the way to victory for a fourth time? What did you feel?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, it's always awesome. We love watching it like in our living room with our dog just like yelling. But it's a totally different energy here. There's like hundreds of people here that are just yelling and screaming for the USA. And it's always a good time.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Was there ever a moment you were biting down on your nails afraid that this moment wouldn't come.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were a couple of times.

Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Greece's brand-new prime minister will be sworn into office in just a few hours from now. Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the center-right new Democracy Party swept to victory in Sunday's snap election. Now he overtook sitting Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras whose tenure in office of course has been rocky. Now Tsipras conceded defeat while Mitsotakis vowed to ensure Greece would be heard by ear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, GREEK PRIME MINISTER-ELECT (through translator): I want a strong Greece with self-confidence that will claim in Europe what it deserves, not be a beggar or a poor relative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Journalist Elinda Labropoulou is in Athens. Just let us let us know what kind of sentiment was behind this vote. Because you could clearly tell that Greece wanted a change and that they had had enough of that government.</p><p>ELINDA LABROPOULOU, JOURNALIST: Well, absolutely they did because it was a government that led them through very turbulent times. And what Greeks showed through this vote is what they want more than anything else is stability. So, what they did is they went from a radical leftist government that had promised full-on confrontation with the European Union in order to ease Greece's bailout terms to a new government that's promising a much milder path.</p><p>What the new prime minister is saying is that, OK, we have to go ahead with the necessary reforms. We have to show the European creditors that we can deliver and then we're going to go back to them and we're going to ask for a new deal for Greece, a deal that will give Greece more fiscal space in order to reignite the economy and basically by showing this good progress report, he believes that it will be possible for Greece to achieve this.</p><p>And this right now seems to most Greeks like a better recipe, having tried and seen the government that failed to go ahead and promote the change that it said it would bring. They now want a more secure route to try to deal with the country's financial problems.</p><p>[03:25:05] NEWTON: And I have to ask you. There is different leadership in Europe now as well. How do you think Europe will receive this new government?</p><p>LABROPOULOU: Well, this is a more known quantity to them. This is a government -- this is a party that has been in government before. It has dominated Greek politics for many decades. It's also a pro-market government, a more liberal government. It's much closer to the European mainstream agenda. The markets are already responding very positively to the change and we expect that European leaders will as well.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it will be interesting to see how those negotiations with Europe go in the future weeks and months. Elinda, thanks so much for covering the story for us. I appreciate it.</p><p>Now, at least three people were gored in the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

I'm Paula Newton and we're going to update you now on our top stories this hour.</p><p>(SPORTS)</p><p>Greece has a new Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the center right New Democracy party will be sworn into office in the coming hours, easily beat sitting Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. In his victory speech, Mitsotakis promise to make sure that Greece's voice will be heard in Europe.</p><p>Riot police carrying batons and shields charged into a crowd of protesters in Hong Kong late Sunday night. Now, the clash came hours after a mass rally in a tourist area that was aimed at reaching mainland Chinese tourists. It's the latest in a series of protests against a bill that would allow extradition to China.</p><p>Now, we want to recap you on our top story this hour. The U.S. and Iran are again trading warnings and ultimatums. This after Iran announced Sunday it is enriching uranium past levels allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal. It said it could scale back even more of its commitments after 60 days. Now, that is if other signatories don't find a way to try and protect Iran from us sanctions. President Trump had this reaction from New Jersey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Iran better be careful because you enrich for one reason and I won't tell you what that reason is, but it's no good they better be careful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>We're joined in London by Sanam Vakil. She's a senior research fellow at the Chatham House Middle East and North Africa Programme. Thanks so much for joining us. We were just getting that wrap up from Fred in terms of what this means. Again, it seems very much to me that what they want is action from Europe at this point. That's what Iran wants.</p><p>And by extension, they believe this could also influence the U.S. Why? Why do they believe that this move in particular might actually work?</p><p>SANAM VAKIL, CHATHAM HOUSE SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW: Well, the Iranians see that any sort of breach in the JCPOA as the best vehicle for mobilizing European leaders who want to preserve the deal, who believe that the deal is of value after over a decade of negotiations. And so by pressing in this area, they know that they're going to get a response.</p><p>And exactly, this is what has happened with President Macron offering a diplomatic card to try and balance between Washington's pressure and Tehran's pressure.</p><p>NEWTON: And strategically, you'd have to look at the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, in saying look, he's playing the hand. He's playing as if he has a strong hand. It's a hand he quite simply does not have, because at the end, he cannot predict how the United States will react to this.</p><p>I mean, at this point in terms of them escalating these issues every 60 days, do you believe that that will have further effect and we'll continue to see those escalations?</p><p>VAKIL: Well, the escalation is calibrated, because they're very concerned that in this sort of phase of unpredictable reactions, not just from the U.S. but also from the Europeans. They don't want to see snapback sanctions coming back. They don't necessarily want to see Europe and Washington coordinating and working together against Iran.</p><p>So they're trying to be quite measured in upping the ante. But it is a bit of a dangerous game going forward, because they've also backed themselves into a corner with these 60-day deadlines. But at the same time, they don't have any other alternative, because they're not getting sanctions relief. They know that the United States is not backing down, even though President Trump wants to come to the negotiating table.</p><p>And this is the best pathway, from Iran's perspective, to get back to the negotiating table through pressure and more pressure and more pressure.</p><p>NEWTON: Help us step back a little bit here, though. I mean, it's always the issue of how you contain Iran and some might argue deal or no deal. Given that the deal was in place for more than three years that its mission accomplished on Iran, because they have been contained. You might take the opposite argument of that right now.</p><p>VAKIL: Well, the deal was working and it did address the nuclear issues. So, of course, the President has created a crisis where there wasn't one, but there were other areas that were not included in the deal specifically focusing on regional tensions and Iran's support of non-state actors beyond its borders. That is ultimately the driver of regional tensions and tensions with the United States because it's Saudi Arabia, Israel, United Arab Emirates, that have been pressuring the Trump administration to do something about Iran's behavior in the region.</p><p>[03:35:22] NEWTON: Yes.</p><p>VAKIL: So ultimately we need a bigger deal that addresses regional tensions.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. But a bigger deal that I bet you're going to tell me is going to be much harder to get, no matter what the Europeans try to bring to the table.</p><p>VAKIL: Absolutely. The deal of the century is this deal, because it would require not just European engagement but American engagement, and the buy-in from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who thus far have been very obstructionist in any sort of engagement with Iran.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and an Iranian leadership that already feels as if they really got the short end of this deal and that they weren't putting up with whatever the conditions were. I have to ask you and as I asked Fred, as the world looks on here, do you think there is a risk, though, for a lot of those regional tensions to blow up at the moment, for lack of a better term?</p><p>And many people point to, at best, we could be looking at a spike in oil prices. But obviously, at worst, we'd be looking at violence in the region again.</p><p>VAKIL: I think there is a risk and that's why it's such a dangerous moment, because both sides are backed into a corner and so anything can emerge. We have seen moderate responses from President Trump. We have seen the Iranian leadership repeatedly say that they're not going to be direct and want military engagement in any meaningful way.</p><p>But it's all of the other actors in the region that are also involved including non-state actors that can be invoked and provoked. And so this is why diplomacy and European-led diplomacy is so important right now. The onus is on Europe to try and bridge the gap between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. They might be reluctant brokers there. But nonetheless, they seem to be coming to the table there. And we'll, of course, wait to see the developments in the coming days and weeks. Thanks so much for joining us. I really appreciate it.</p><p>VAKIL: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Now, as we're just talking about, this is far from the first standoff between Iran and the U.S. but tensions are at their highest levels in years.

Swollen past its banks, the river just broke a record set in '93 of 104 days above flood stage at St. Louis. I'm walking along the levy that protects the town from those rising flood waters. But as you can see, on the other side, the water is hard to tame, as the flood waters have found their way underneath the levy and are seeping into the town.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEAVNER: River is going down now, but you never really know whether it's going to go all the way down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAM(voice-over): After the record-breaking flooding in the Midwest this year, other communities are looking to Valmeyer as a template. Researchers are studying its progress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICHOLAS PINTER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS: A third of U.S. communities will face increased risk of flooding by the middle of the century. Worldwide the numbers are really big. On the order of 100 million people, it's estimated are going to be displaced by rising sea levels alone by the end of the century.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAM(voice-over): Is climate change affecting Valmeyer? There's no consensus here. They just knew they needed to change to survive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAM: You still feel better at night sleeping knowing you're not down here?</p><p>KNOBLOCH: I don't have to look over my shoulder and wonder if the river is sneaking up on me, that's for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAM(voice-over): Stephanie Elam, CNN Valmeyer, Illinois.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: And I'm reminded of all that, the southeastern U.S., of course, could face its first Tropical Storm threat from the Atlantic hurricane season already that time of the year, right, Ivan?</p><p>IVAN CABRERA, METEOROLOGIST: Already. Yes. Good to see you, Paula. And here's the thing, we've already had the A storm before the season even began, that was Andrea now. We could have Barry on our hands here by late week, so let's talk about the potential threat here. I think we're certainly going to get a heavy rain out of it if nothing else, but according to a couple of our computer models here, the European GFS as well the American model showing that.</p><p>All right. How do we get tropical systems? We'll get them obviously over the Atlantic in the Gulf. But also along frontal boundaries, this time of year that happens. The jet stream goes up to the north of France, don't have enough drive to push south and so they stall out across the southeastern U.S. typically. And you can get these lows that do develop.</p><p>This one will like to go to the Gulf and as it does so, National Hurricane Center has a 60% chance of it developing. It's just too early to tell you if that's going to happen and where it's going to go. Case in point, this is a European, the last model run, I was seeing this thing going up to Louisiana now it looks like it's going to make a run for Texas. So that may not happen either.</p><p>The point is keep checking back with us, because this forecast is going to continue to change until we actually get this low in the Gulf and then we'll be able to tell you. What we can tell you is the heavy rain that's going to be impacting Florida and the rest of the southeast with heavy amounts of rain.</p><p>By the way, these are the breeding grounds for July tropical systems. And again you can get them right along a frontal boundaries and in the Gulf Coast and they typically moved to the north and west. There's the list. Andrea, look at that, May 20 to 21st. The hurricane season starts June 1 it goes through November 30 and we've already had Andre.</p><p>By the way that's happened a lot. The reason in the last few years we've got an out of season storm, but if the new one here develops that would be Barry on the list. And we are in just the early part of the season. Remember the season peaks late to mid September and so we have a ways to go before we can tell you what kind of season it's going to be. The forecast is because of a week El Nino probably average, but it only takes one, we always say that. We had Michael last year which was devastating for the folks in Florida. NEWTON: And always, obviously, remembering the late season ones can really be absolutely terrible. Ivan, thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Now, you too can enter the Upside Down, the popular Netflix show. Stranger Things is back. We'll take a look at how the stream giant is cashing in on 1980s nostalgia.</p><p>[03:53:49] NEWTON: So the third season of Netflix's hit TV show Stranger Things is streaming right now and Netflix has gone all out in promoting it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, stick with me. Clare Sebastian is going to explain. They are making deals with dozens of brands to get the nostalgia baked in to viewers' minds. As promised, Clare Sebastian takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT(voice-over): Start with a cherry and some pecans, add whipped cream, caramel and finally a scoop of chocolate ice cream. The result? A sweet marketing opportunity.</p><p>Baskin-Robbins' Upside-Down Sundae is named after the creepy parallel universe in the Netflix hit series Stranger Things.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Upside-Down Sundae. Stranger Things are happening at Baskin-Robbins.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN(voice-over): It's one of a new line of treats the ice cream store is rolling out to cash in on the show's third season, which features a fictional ice cream parlor called Scoops Ahoy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ahoy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ahoy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN(voice-over): Season three sees the teenagers from Hawkins, Indiana take their fight against evil to the quintessential '80s hang out, the shopping mall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you think? We're just going to sit in my basement all day, play games for the rest of your lives?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:55:00] SEBASTIAN(voice-over): The real setting, though, has been happening off camera. Netflix says they're partnering with about 75 brands for the Stranger Things launch. An all-out international marketing blitz featuring everything from Nike to Burger King to the Chicago Cubs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER SHANKMAN, BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONSULTANT: Every network, every website, everyone is looking for those two hours that you have between the time you get home, put the kid to bed, finish dinner and watch something. So anything that Netflix can do to grow that brand recognition and make you remember, ""Hey, I should finish the season of Stranger Things,"" is a benefit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you love the TV show Stranger Things, then boy, have we got a LEGO set for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN(voice-over): Many of the brand tie-ins play on the 1980s nostalgia the show is known for.</p><p>Netflix even convinced Coke to re-release New Coke, a product which flopped back in 1985 after Stranger Things decided to incorporate it into its plot. Netflix says no money changed hands on the Coke deal or on many of the show's other branding deals. Instead, Netflix is allowing companies to use the Stranger Things brand in return for a commitment to spend marketing dollars and dish up buzz for the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHANKMAN: They don't necessarily care so much about revenue from these deals. They do care about brand awareness and they do care about acknowledgment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Now, it's one thing to incorporate brands seamlessly into a show's narrative to give a sense of authenticity and nostalgia. That was actually part of the vision for Stranger Things from the start. Now, of course, the risk is that all of this ends up going too far and the marketing starts to overwhelm the show itself. Clare Sebastian, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: I think Clare explained that quite well, don't you? Thanks for joining us. I'm Paula Newton. EARLY START is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">CNNTRN-2019070820CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5WHP-VD91-JB20-G3GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""7379""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=""08"" month=""07"" year=""2019""><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""typeofdoc""><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""91""><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""91""><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Meanwhile, the city of Cincinnati cut off its intake of water from the Ohio River as the toxic plume from East Palestine came closer to the city. Also meanwhile, Ohio Senator Michael Rulli warned citizens in the area not to drink the water, saying that it was not safe. </p><p><br/>In other news, the Turkish government has all but ended the search for survivors of last week's earthquake, as the death toll in the disaster rose over 46,000. <br/>To see the headlines and the articles, click 'Continue reading' below. <br/>Thanks to Dean, DV, LP, McN, MM, Reader from Chicago, Roger, SS, and all the other tipsters who sent these in. <br/>Notice to tipsters: Please don't submit extensive excerpts from articles that have been posted behind a subscription firewall, or are otherwise under copyright protection. <br/>Caveat: Articles in the news feed are posted 'as is'.

Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician to Trump and Barack Obama is questioning President Joe Biden's recent health report. Biden had a physical last week that claimed he is healthy and fit to serve. <br/>White House physician Kevin O'Connor said: 'President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.' <br/>But Jackson is not convinced. He went on Fox News and said: 'The majority of Americans can see that Biden's mental health is in total decline, yet there is no transparency from the White House on what's going on, if anything, to address this issue and his inability to do his job. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Biden Gets First Primary Challenger as Marianne Williamson's Set to Launch Campaign This Weekend[83] <br/>Former 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Marianne Williamson is expected to launch a primary challenge against President Joe Biden this weekend. <br/>The news is a significant blow for Biden as he would have hoped to run unchallenged in 2024. <br/>Historically, when incumbent presidents face primary challenges, they tend to lose in the general election. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Cincinnati Cuts Off Drinking Water From Ohio River Due to East Palestine Derailment Contamination[84] <br/>The Ohio River's water intake for the city of Cincinnati will close ahead of incoming pollutants from the East Palestine train derailment in a move that the local water utility service says is 'out of an abundance of caution.' <br/>According to Greater Cincinnati Water Works (GCWW), a service provided by the city, Cincinnati's drinking water intake in the river will be closed sometime before the contamination is expected to reach that area of the river by early Sunday morning, a local ABC affiliate reported. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Dem Lawmakers Push Ban on Gas-Powered Lawn Mowers, Chainsaws to Curb 'Climate Pollution'[85] <br/>Two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers are proposing a pair of bills that would significantly impact the state's backyards and neighborhood ice rinks in an effort to combat climate change. <br/>State Reps. Jerry Newton and Heather Edelson, members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, introduced legislation on Monday that would block the sale of common landscaping appliances like lawnmowers and chainsaws as well ice-resurfacing machines such as Zambonis, requiring that only electric battery versions be sold in the state starting Jan. 1, 2025. <br/>The ban on lawn and garden equipment would include any machine that uses 'a spark ignition engine rated at or below 19 kilowatts or 25 gross horsepower.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>DeSantis Book: How the Florida Blueprint Can Work for the Whole US[86] <br/>In November 2022, Gov. Ron DeSantis made history in Florida: winning by nearly 1.5 million votes in a state known for its 'razor thin' election margins. <br/>His platform was equally historic and, contrary to what is going on in other parts of the United States, focused on freedom. By enacting policies to keep progressive politics and woke ideology out of the classroom, taking back Disney's self-governance and tax breaks, and keeping his state open during the pandemic, the Yale-educated former Naval officer has gained national attention and hundreds of thousands of new residents to Florida. <br/>In this exclusive excerpt from his new book, 'The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Survival,' DeSantis explains how he's preserving liberties in Florida — and just might save the US. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>DeSantis: People Don't Want 'Agenda Being Shoved Down Their Throats'[87] <br/>DUNEDIN, Florida — Ron DeSantis is chasing the ghosts of his past — as a way to tell the story of his future. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>EPA Issues 'Shelter in Place' Warning Amid Florida Industrial Plant Fire[88] <br/>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a 'shelter in place' warning as emergency services battle a major fire at a Florida industrial energy plant. <br/>The warning was issued Friday as the blaze continues to burn at a renewable energy plant in Doral. <br/>Parks and schools have been ordered closed in the area after the EPA declared the air quality 'unhealthy.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Exclusive — Ohio Sen.

Parrillo, 57, allegedly held the woman captive in Burlington County, New Jersey and choked her multiple times and threatened to murder her family if she left him. <br/>Parrillo may have engaged in similarly abhorrent 'predatory conduct; in other states and has been known to go by multiple aliases, according to the state Attorney General's office. <br/>The suspect is currently being held in jail as charges pend. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>New York Homeless Men Attacked Residents, Including a Baby and an Elderly Woman, Throughout 2022[94] <br/>Homeless men have been repeatedly accused of attacking New Yorkers over the past 12 months, with alleged victims including an infant and an elderly woman and some cases resulting in murder charges. <br/>In one instance, a homeless man was accused of fatally pushing a woman in front of an oncoming subway train. Another faces allegations that he slashed a man's neck, killing him. Prosecutors say a third raped a woman while she was jogging in the West Village. One woman said a homeless man killed her dog and, in a second encounter, maced her. <br/>'This is becoming a daily story,' a Manhattan police officer told The New York Post in September. 'A homeless person wandering the streets attacks innocent people. Only the neighborhood names change.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Now is a Good Time to Stop Using Insecure SMS 2-Factor Authentication for Twitter (And Everything Else)[95] <br/>When SMS (Short Message Service) text messaging was invented, it wasn't designed to be used as a security method. However, that didn't stop developers from using it as one, with platforms sending users security codes to access their most important accounts. <br/>While the practice of using SMS 2-factor authentication is slowly being phased out, the news of Twitter starting to only make the feature available to those who subscribe to Twitter Blue has brought the vulnerable technology back into the public conversation. <br/>Twitter users who 'secure' their accounts using text message codes will lose the ability to do so after March 19 unless they subscribe to Twitter Blue. Twitter is likely making the change because the company is trying to cut costs and it actually costs the company money to send text messages and the feature is insecure anyway. <br/>However, the more secure option of using an authenticator app will still be available to all users, meaning that the change should result in many more users switching away from the insecure feature of SMS 2-factor authentication. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Over 500,000 People Left California in Two Years: Report[96] <br/>Over 500,000 Californians left the state in the two years after the pandemic began due to rising housing costs and crowded, crime-filled cities, according to a report. <br/>Between April 2020 and July 2022 the number of those leaving California surpassed the number of people moving in by more than 700,000, The Los Angeles Times reported. <br/>According to The Times, unaffordable housing, long commute times, crowds, crime and pollution in urban areas —which have also been plagued by homelessness — were primary reasons people left. <br/>The rise in remote employment, which allows people to not have to live near big cities for work, was also a factor in the population change, the newspaper reported. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Pastors Say ChatGPT Has No Soul After Trying to Use it to Write Sermons[97] <br/>Pastors have been testing out ChatGPT as a tool to write their sermons, sussing out if the chatbot, which is capable of responding to prompts and queries with comprehensive data and in a conversational manner, can emulate the qualities necessary to impart theological meaning. <br/>According to the New York Post, Managing Editor of the Christian website Mockingbird and New Testament scholar Todd Brewer asked ChatGPT to write a Christmas sermon in December and asked it to be 'based upon Luke's birth narrative, with quotations from Karl Barth, Martin Luther, Irenaeus of Lyon, and Barack Obama' and the result was 'better than several Christmas sermons I've heard over the years.' <br/>Brewer later added that the service did lack 'any human warmth' and 'the preaching of Artificial Intelligence can't convincingly sympathize with the human plight.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Pennsylvania Social Workers Must Now Ask if Babies 'Identify' as 'Nonbinary'[98] <br/>A new rule in Pennsylvania means that the state's social workers are now required to ask whether children, including newborn babies, 'identify' as 'nonbinary.' <br/>When social workers are assigned to a new case, the new requirement states that they must first establish whether the child or infant 'identifies' as male, female, or 'nonbinary.' <br/>A government form, that social workers in Pennsylvania are now required to complete, was obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Pfizer Removes Half of Patients From Its Lyme Disease Vaccine Trial After Finding Violation of 'Good Clinical Practice'[99] <br/>Around 3,500 patients will be pulled from the Phase III study due to violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) rules, which refer to ethical and scientific standards for clinical trials. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Police: Bystander Shot 16-Year-Old Accused of Fatally Shooting Teen at El Paso Mall[100] <br/>EL PASO, Texas (KFOX) — An El Paso man with a license-to-carry shot and injured a 16-year-old boy shortly after the teen used a stolen gun to kill a 17-year-old boy inside the Cielo Vista Mall Wednesday, El Paso police confirmed Friday. <br/>The victim, Angeles Zaragoza, was part of one group involved in a confrontation with another group near the food court area on the second level. <br/>Police said the confrontation began around 5:05 p.m. — when they began to receive 911 calls — and escalated into a physical fight. <br/>As the groups fought, the 16-year-old boy from El Paso County pulled out a gun, shot Zaragoza and seriously wounded a 17-year-old boy who was part of the first group, according to police. <br/>Police said a 20-year-old man, who was part of the group the accused shooter belonged to, was also shot and injured. <br/>The 16-year-old boy began to run and reportedly pointed the gun toward the direction of bystanders and 32-year-old Emanuel Duran. <br/>Police said Duran, who is licensed to carry, pulled out his handgun and shot the teen at least two times because he felt 'threatened.' <br/>Video from inside the mall showed people running as gunshots rang out. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Chip Roy Make Bipartisan Push for Congress Stock Trade Ban[101] <br/>Congressional reformers feel 'disgust' for colleagues who parlay privileged information into stock-market gains — and are making a bipartisan push to force hearings on a bill that would ban House and Senate members from making trades while in office. <br/>'One day Chip Roy and I were talking on the House floor and we were both expressing our disgust,' Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, told NewsNation Friday, speaking of GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. <br/>'And we said, you know, this ought to not be legal.' <br/>Spanberger cited multiple instances of elected officials who profited from their positions by making stock trades after receiving privileged information. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Sheriff: Gunman Kills 6, Including Ex-Wife, In Mississippi[102] <br/>ARKABUTLA, Miss. (AP) — A lone gunman killed six people including his ex-wife and stepfather Friday at multiple locations in a tiny rural community in northern Mississippi, the sheriff said, leaving investigators searching for clues to what motivated the rampage. <br/>Armed with a shotgun and two handguns, 52-year-old Richard Dale Crum opened fire at about 11 a.m. and killed a man in the driver's seat of a pickup truck parked outside a convenience store in Arkabutla, near the Tennessee state line, Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance said. <br/>Deputies were working the crime scene when a second 911 call alerted authorities to another shooting a few miles away. After arriving at a home, they found a woman, whom the sheriff identified as Crum's ex-wife, shot dead and her current husband wounded. <br/>Lance said deputies caught up with Crum outside his own home and arrested him. Behind the residence they found two handymen slain by gunfire — one in the road, another in an SUV. Inside a neighboring home, they discovered the bodies of Crum's stepfather and his stepfather's sister. <br/>'Everybody has crime, and from time to time we have violent crime, but certainly nothing of this magnitude,' Lance said in an interview. He added: 'Without being able to say what triggered this, that's the scary part.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Taibbi: US Senator Wanted ZeroHedge Banned From Twitter[103] <br/>Since Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022, he has continued to keep his promise of transparency with regard to the company's past behavior <br/>Thanks to the revelations in the so-called 'Twitter Files', we have seen clear evidence that the FBI and other three-letter agencies worked directly with various social media entities to suppress perfectly 'lawful speech' for purely political reasons. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Trump to Visit Ohio Train Derailment Site Amid Cleanup Efforts[104] <br/>President Donald Trump has announced that he is visiting the site of the recent train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. <br/>Trump is traveling to the small town that is battling the damage caused by the derailing of a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals. <br/>According to Fox News, Trump will tour the damage next week and meet with those involved in the cleanup efforts. <br/>'A source familiar confirms to Fox News that former President Trump will visit East Palestine, OH, on Wednesday to tour the damage of the Norfolk Southern derailment and cleanup efforts,' Fox News's Garrett Tenney tweeted. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Twitter Says it Will Charge Users to Verify Accounts Via Text Message[105] <br/>Twitter on Friday evening said that it will soon implement a policy in which users will have to subscribe to the company's new 'Blue' service in order to verify their accounts via text message. <br/>Twitter has historically allowed users to securely verify their accounts by receiving a text message with a verification code. This form of security, known as 'two-factor authentication' or 2FA, is regarded as reliably safe for protecting sensitive data from hackers. <br/>Yet in a tweet on Friday night, Twitter Support said that 'effective March 20, 2023, only Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to use text messages as their two-factor authentication method.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>University of Texas Sued for First Amendment Retaliation Against Faculty for Criticizing DEI[106] <br/>A finance professor who sued Texas A&amp;M University for race— and gender-based criteria in hiring and salary is now going after his own institution for alleged First Amendment retaliation based on his criticism of its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. <br/>Richard Lowery's new lawsuit claims the University of Texas threatened sanctions to silence his repeated criticism of its 'hijacking' of the Liberty Institute, a campus free-market think tank, and his calls for Republican lawmakers to intervene in UT's DEI efforts, including ideological 'filtering criteria' in hiring. <br/>The right-leaning National Association of Scholars also called out UT's DEI efforts last month in a report on the Austin flagship as a whole and an op-ed about the medical school specifically. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Violence Near NYC Schools Surges With Shootings, Stabbings[107] <br/>Violence is exploding in and around city schools, with shootings, stabbings — and killings — on the rise. <br/>Three students have been slain so far in the 2022-23 school year, and at least 18 have been either stabbed or shot as gang beefs and ever-younger gun-toting kids take advantage of the state's juvenile justice reforms, experts said. <br/>In the previous school year, one child was killed and eight were shot or stabbed, according to reports. <br/>Dissmissal can mean death for New York City schoolkids, with most of the stabbings and shootings unfolding after the afternoon bell rings. <br/>'We've really seen sort of this cavalcade of chaos that has been raining down on us because of bad laws and young people who are disconnected from responsible behavior,' said Staten Island District Attorney Michael McMahon. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Viral 24/7 Kentucky Prayer 'Revival' Begins Second Week[108] <br/>A routine prayer service at a small Christian college in Kentucky has blossomed into a nonstop revival, garnering millions of viewers on social media as it begins its second week. <br/>Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, held a morning chapel service in Hughes Auditorium on February 8, after which a couple dozen students hung around instead of going home.

Barry Cooper)[113] <br/>In early 2020, a newly-landed virus took the country by storm — causing mass panic and a complete shutdown of society. Three years later, and Canadians are still feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. 'Canada's Covid: The Story of a Pandemic Moral Panic' co-author Barry Cooper joined True North's Andrew Lawton to discuss the events which inspired the newly expanded book. Also, what can Canadians learn from the past three years, and how can we avoid making similar mistakes again? <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Committee Urges Govt to Extend Assisted Suicide to 'Mature Minors'[114] <br/>A Canadian parliamentary committee has recommended the government expand its assisted suicide policies to allow 'mature minors' to seek medical assistance to end their lives. <br/>The parliamentary committee put out a report with 23 recommendations for the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among them a call to allow 'mature minors' to seek Medical Assistance in Dying, known as MAiD in Canada. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Commission Says Justin Trudeau's Government Was 'Justified' In Freezing Protesters' Bank Accounts[115] <br/>The Public Order Emergency Commission (POEC) inquiry into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoking the Emergencies Act to stop the Freedom Convoy protests concluded that invoking the law was 'unnecessary,' but 'justified' the Prime Minister's actions nonetheless. <br/>Reading the POEC inquiry report, Commissioner Paul Rouleau said invoking the Emergencies Act was a 'significant event.' He noted that dozens of experts, protest organizers, witnesses, cabinet ministers, and even Trudeau himself testified during the inquiry. Cabinet privilege was lifted to disclose 28,000 documents, 9,000 of them entering into evidence. <br/>Rouleau said that the protests happened because of people's 'loss of faith in government' and the 'economic hardships' caused by the government's COVID-19 response. <br/>The report states that invoking the Emergencies Act was 'appropriate' and 'effective' since the federal government had 'reasonable grounds' to take 'special temporary measures' because of 'threats to national security.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Trudeau Responds to Leaked CSIS Files Saying Beijing Interfered in 2021 Election to Support a Liberal Minority[116] <br/>Authored by Andrew Chen via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours) <br/>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has responded to a news report about leaked Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) documents detailing how China used a strategy to interfere in the 2021 federal election in order to return the Liberals to office. <br/>The Feb. 17 Globe and Mail article cited top-secret CSIS documents covering the period before and after the September 2021 election campaign which resulted in a minority Liberal government. That result was one of the goals of the interference, while Beijing also sought the defeat of Conservative MPs it deemed critical of the regime, the Globe reported. <br/>Beijing's desire for a second Liberal minority in Parliament was to ensure that Trudeau's power would be kept curtailed, according to the CSIS documents. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>After Brutal Antifa Attack on Innocent Civilians in Budapest, Hungary Says it Will Not Extradite Suspects to Germany[117] <br/>Hungarian authorities will not extradite German citizens who belong to a far-left Antifa group back to Germany after they attacked a man in his 40s in Budapest last Friday. <br/>European Union member states can only extradite criminals to another member state on the basis of an arrest warrant, but in this case, Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet wrote that so far there is no information that Germany has requested any such warrant. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Andrew Tate Threatens $300M Lawsuit Against Rape, Trafficking Accuser[118] <br/>Controversial influencer Andrew Tate, who is being held with his brother in Romania, has threatened legal action against at least one woman who accused him of rape and human trafficking. <br/>A US law firm representing Tate and his brother Tristan sent a 'cease and desist' letter to the unnamed woman's American lawyer in December, the BBC reported Saturday. <br/>The letter included a threat to sue the woman and her family for $300 million if she didn't take back her accusations. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Finland: Populist Finns Party Most Popular With Young First-Time Voters[119] <br/>A poll released this week has revealed that the most popular party among young people getting ready to vote for the first time in Finland's forthcoming national elections this spring is the populist Finns Party. <br/>The poll, which was released this week, states that 28 per cent of the upcoming new voters support the populist Finns Party, far ahead of the Social Democratic Party headed by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, which received just 13 per cent of the vote. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Italy: Gang Used Drug Addicts to Sell Fake Vaccination Certificates[120] <br/>One drug addict received at least three doses of the Covid 'vaccine' in less than a month. The gang is accused of, among other things, robbery, kidnapping and manufacturing illegal weapons. <br/>The massive restrictions on fundamental rights during the manufactured pandemic have led citizens to look for ways to still work and participate in social life without having to take the shots. Vaccination certificates were coveted, which meant, for example, that criminal gangs expanded their business and offered jab certificates. <br/>One such example emerged from an investigation by the public prosecutor's office in Catania, Sicily, into the Carabinieri's investigation into a gang of alleged kidnappers. Carabinieri military officers executed a court order for preliminary investigations against 17 suspects. According to TGCOM24, five people were detained and four were placed under house arrest. <br/>Jabs for drugs <br/>As it turns out, the gang sold 'real' vaccination cards. Drug addicts, equipped with false papers, had themselves vaccinated several times for a few euros or drugs in order to obtain the 'Green Pass' for those who were not vaccinated. As reported by Il Messaggero, one of the drug addicts was found to have received three doses of the vaccine in less than a month, posing a further serious risk to his own health. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Pope Francis Shoots Down Resignation Rumors, Papacy is 'For Life'[121] <br/>ROME, Italy — Pope Francis has sought to squelch rumors of a possible papal resignation, insisting that he does not have this on his 'agenda.' <br/>Pope Benedict XVI 'had the courage to do it because he did not feel up to continuing due to his health,' the pontiff told members of the Jesuit order in a Q&amp;A session published Thursday, but this 'does not at all mean that resigning popes should become, let's say, a 'fashion,' a normal thing.' <br/>[81] <br/><br/>'Sudanese Hackers' Target Swedish Rail Over Qur'an Burnings[122] <br/>A group of hackers linked to Sudan took credit for denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the websites of Swedish rail companies in revenge for burnings of the Islamic Qur'an. <br/>Several rail operators in Sweden reported problems with other websites on Thursday morning including Inlandsbanan and Norrtg, claiming that access to their websites was not available periodically. <br/>[81] <br/><br/>Sweden Joins NATO's Space Alliance[123] <br/>Even though Sweden is currently stopped from joining the defense alliance NATO after Turkey's obstruction, Sweden has nevertheless continued to tie itself politically and militarily to NATO. Sweden has now joined the space defense alliance APSS, which is run by NATO — a sign that NATO sees Sweden's entry into the alliance as a given. <br/>It was on Wednesday, during NATO's ongoing defense ministers' meeting in Brussels, where Sweden, despite not being an official member, had nevertheless been granted access to the organisation.

I was a primary author of Heritage's recent e-booklet, The Essential Second Amendment, and run the organization's Defensive Gun Use Database. I have testified numerous on firearms policy at both the state and federal level, including on several occasions before this Committee. Most recently, these testimonies have covered an array of proposed gun control measures, recent nationwide spikes in violent crime, keeping the nation's children safe from gun violence, and the economic toll of gun violence. n2</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Today, I have been asked--along with my fellow panelists--to discuss how Congress can protect public safety after the Supreme Court's opinion this past summer in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. The very title of the hearing implies that, as a result of the Bruen opinion and subsequent Second Amendment litigation, the public safety is endangered.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">What an absurd premise.</p><p>To be clear, this mild insinuation that Bruen endangers public safety is quite tame compared to the hysterical theatrics employed by some media outlets and public figures. At various points after the opinion's release, pundits and policymakers have alleged, among other things, that Bruen:</p><p>* is a radical gun ruling that will lead to more violence; n3</p><p>* will have significant and dangerous consequences for New Yorkers, including law enforcement officers; n4</p><p>* is reckless, reprehensible, and shows an extreme vision for life in the United States; n5</p><p>* asserts that nearly any attempts at gun regulation are invalid; n6</p><p>* will literally get women killed. n7</p><p>The good news is that Bruen does none of these things.</p><p>In fact, in its most immediate impact, Bruen is likely to increase public safety by striking down laws that for far too long effectively prohibited ordinary, peaceable citizens from carrying firearms in public to defend themselves against violent victimizations. Defensive gun uses have a significant protective impact against violent crime--a protective impact which will now finally be fully extended to millions of residents in the seven states whose public carry frameworks formerly rendered most of them defenseless victims.</p><p>Yes, it is likely that when the dust of the post-Bruen legal fallout settles, several modern gun control laws will be struck down as unconstitutional (most of which should have been struck down under a fair application of Heller and McDonald). But these laws overwhelmingly failed to offer significant public safety benefits in the first place, and precisely for the reasons they will likely be struck down--in practice, they most commonly target peaceable Americans while doing very little to ensure that violent criminals are effectively deterred or prevented from committing violent acts.</p><p>At the same time, Bruen leaves ample room for the enforcement of a variety of public safety measures that are far more effective than the ""just do something"" laws it threatens. This is abundantly clear in those cases where courts have thus far struck down gun control statutes post-Bruen. In each those cases, the court points out constitutionally permissible measures (like pretrial detainment) that could have been but were not, in fact, used against the defendant, who then went on to simply ignore the stricken law.</p><p>I. Understanding Bruen: How Did We Get There and What Does It Actually Say?</p><p>Bruen was, in many ways, a much-needed correction to lower courts' widespread refusal to treat District of Columbia v. Heller n8 and McDonald v. City of Chicago n9 with any semblance of respect. In those landmark cases, the Supreme Court struck down bans on the possession of operable handguns inside the home. Taken together, Heller and McDonald affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is, indeed, individual in nature and centered on the natural right of self-defense. n10 The Second Amendment does not protect a second-class right, but one that is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and applicable against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. n11</p><p>At the very least, law-abiding, peaceable adult citizens have a right to own arms that are of a type commonly possessed by such citizens for lawful purposes. n12</p><p>Notably, the Court declined in both cases to explicitly adopt or apply a ""tiers of scrutiny"" framework, but deemed means-end interest balancing tests to be inappropriate and focused its analysis on the Amendment's text, history, and tradition. n13 It emphasized that nothing in either opinion should be understood as ""casting doubt"" on ""certain longstanding"" and ""presumptively lawful"" restrictions. n14 These included prohibitions on firearm possession by felons or the mentally ill, laws restricting the carrying of firearms in ""sensitive places"" like schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of firearms. n15</p><p>And then, for the next decade, the Court declined every opportunity to put flesh onto this bare bones Second Amendment framework. In the interim, lower courts developed a two-step approach that, in effect, led courts at the second step to use intermediate scrutiny to engage in the very type of means-end interest balancing the Supreme Court deemed inappropriate. Under this test, Heller and McDonald were effectively rendered toothless, and many lower courts never found a gun control law they could not uphold under the second step. n16 *</p><p>New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen n17 was the Supreme Court's first major attempt to clarify (and vindicate) Heller and McDonald, and address at least some of the questions those cases left unanswered--namely, what is the scope of the right to bear arms outside of the home and what, exactly, is the framework courts should use when analyzing Second Amendment challenges. New York generally prohibited civilians from possessing a firearm outside of their homes without an unrestricted concealed carry permit, which allows a person to ""have and carry"" a concealed handgun in public. Applicants for this license needed to prove to the state that they had ""proper cause"" for being armed in public, meaning they had a ""special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community."" In practice, this proper-cause requirement worked to ensure that ordinary, law-abiding New Yorkers did not have a right to armed selfdefense outside the home. Lower courts had upheld the constitutionality of the proper-cause standard both in New York and six other states with similar frameworks, uniformly justifying the requirement under some form of heightened scrutiny.</p><p>In Bruen, the Supreme Court struck down New York's ""proper cause"" requirement, holding that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense. n18 Just as importantly, the Court outright rejected the two-step test developed by lower courts in the wake of Heller and McDonald, finding in particular that the second step is ""inconsistent with Heller's historical approach and its rejection of means-end scrutiny."" n19 Instead, it adopted the following standard for Second Amendment cases:</p><p>When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.' n20</p><p>The Court explained that while courts are required to reason through historical analogy, this is ""neither a regulatory straightjacket nor a regulatory blank check."" n21 Courts should neither uphold every modern law that remotely resembles a historical analogue nor require the government to produce a historical twin or ""dead ringer"" for a modern law. According to the Court, Heller and McDonald pointed toward at least two central metrics for a historical analogical inquiry: ""whether modern and historical regulations impose a comparable burden on the right of armed self-defense and whether that burden is comparably justified."" n22</p><p>In short, New York's proper cause requirement did not fit within the confines of those ""reasonable, well-defined restrictions"" that historically delineated the outer limits of the right of peaceable, law-abiding adult citizens to bear commonly used arms in public for self-defense. While there is a longstanding tradition of limiting the intent for which one could carry arms in public, the manner by which one could carry arms in public, or the exceptional circumstances or sensitive places in which one could not carry arms, there was simply no historical analogue limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens who demonstrate a special need for self-defense. n23</p><p>Importantly, the Court explicitly stated that nothing in its holding ""should be interpreted to suggest the unconstitutionality"" of the shall-issue frameworks already employed by a majority of states and which do not require an applicant to prove an atypical need for self-defense. n24 At the same time, it did not ""rule out constitutional challenges to shall-issue frameworks"" whose bureaucratic burdens may nonetheless work to deny ordinary citizens their right to public carry. n25</p><p>II. Bruen's Most Direct Impact--Striking Down ""Proper Cause"" Carry Statutes--</p><p>Promotes Both Public Safety and a Fairer, More Equitable Criminal Justice System The most immediate and direct impact of Bruen is that it struck down ""proper-cause"" requirements in seven states, effectively forcing those states to become ""shall issue"" for purposes of concealed carry permits. While some have decried the prospect of a more concealed carry permit holders carrying guns in public places, insinuating that this will exacerbate violent crime problems, this is inconsistent with the evidence. Rather, because of Bruen, millions more peaceable Americans will have the option of lawfully defending themselves and others with a firearm in public, something that promotes the public safety. Moreover, because states may no longer arbitrarily prohibit public carry for ordinary Americans, fewer peaceable citizens are likely to find themselves branded ""violent weapons offenders"" for having the audacity to defend themselves in public without a government license they could never hope to obtain.</p><p>A. Peaceable Citizens Benefit from the Right to Armed Self-Defense, Both at Home and in Public Spaces</p><p>In general, lawful gun owners are not the driving force behind criminal gun violence. n26 It is universally true that most gun crimes are committed by a very small subset of serial offenders who are already prohibited from legally possessing firearms. n27 While some lawful gun owners will inevitably use their firearms in furtherance of criminal activity in any given year, the overwhelming majority will not. n28 This is particularly true of concealed carry permit holders, who are as a group one of the most law-abiding populations in the nation. Analyses of available state-level data routinely shows that they are, in fact, significantly less likely to be convicted of firearms-related violations than are police officers, who under federal law are exempt from most state-level gun laws (including those regulating public carry), including while they are off-duty. n29 This is not to suggest that law enforcement officers are prone to committing weapons offense--quite the opposite, it highlights just how little the public has to fear from an increase in concealed carry permit holders.</p><p>Given this reality, it is little wonder that the most methodologically sound studies on the issue routinely find that more permissive public carry schemes do not lead to more violent crime. n30 To the extent that any studies do show a relationship between public carry frameworks and violent crime, there still exists no logical causal mechanism to explain how more permissive public carry laws would conceivably cause that violent crime. The only crimes that could logically be the result of permissive public carry laws are those (1) carried out with firearms (2) in public places (3) by a person lawfully carrying that firearm under the permissive framework (4) who would not otherwise have been highly motivated to commit the same crime regardless of whether state laws prohibited him or her from carrying in public. Most crimes (in fact, the vast majority of crimes) do not fit within those parameters. And, again, concealed carry permit holders are overwhelmingly law-abiding and rarely commit any crimes, much less gun crimes in public spaces that were facilitated by their carry permits in the sense that permit holder committed a crime of opportunity during the normal course of his or her otherwise lawful public carry. Moreover, to the extent that permit holders sometimes do commit these types of crimes, it is equally true that they are sometimes stopped by other armed citizens whose ability to defend themselves and others is owed directly to the more permissive public carry framework. n31</p><p>Indeed, gun violence rates plummeted between the early 1990s and late 2010s, even as the national momentum shifted dramatically toward more permissive public carry schemes. n32 Not a single state that voluntarily moved to a more permissive framework has chosen to return to its more restrictive laws. Since most individuals who own guns or carry them in public do so out of concern for their own safety, it is far more likely (and the available evidence certainly suggests) that any causal mechanism works the opposite way--increases in violent crime tend to cause states to move toward less restrictive frameworks so that law-abiding citizens may better defend themselves in public, and not the other way around.</p><p>Just as advocates of stricter public carry laws often overstate concealed carry permit holders' contribution to violent crime, they often seriously downplay (or completely ignore) the protective impact of lawful gun ownership. According to a 2013 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost every major study on defensive gun uses has concluded that Americans use their firearms defensively somewhere between 500,000 and several million times every year. n33 In 2021, the most comprehensive survey of gun owners and gun use ever conducted reinforced these earlier studies, estimating an average of just over 1.6 million annual defensive gun uses. n34 Importantly, this latest analysis reveals that, unlike criminal gun uses, defensive gun uses are quite common amongst lawful gun owners, with approximately one-third of all gun owners reporting having used a firearm to defend themselves or their property. n35 Moreover, while many of these defensive gun uses occur in or around the gun owner's home, 14 percent (or approximately 224,000) occurred either in public or in a third-party residence. n36 The number of defensive gun uses outside of the home has likely been kept artificially low by overly restrictive public carry schemes like the one struck down in Bruen, precisely because these laws all but ensured that tens of millions of ordinary, law-abiding adults would never have the option of lawful armed selfdefense in public spaces.</p><p>Not only are armed civilians better able to resist criminal activity when it occurs, but according to criminals themselves, knowing that potential victims might be armed effectively deters many crimes from happening in the first place. According to one survey of imprisoned felons, roughly one-third reported being ""scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an armed victim,"" while 40 percent admitted that they had refrained from attempting to commit a crime out of fear that the victim was armed. n37 Well over half of the surveyed felons acknowledged that they would not attack a victim they knew was armed, and almost three-quarters agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses where people are at home is that they fear being shot."" n38 Importantly, the study also found that felons from states with the greatest relative number of privately owned firearms registered the highest levels of concern about confronting an armed victim. n39</p><p>This is consistent with the conclusions of a study that analyzed the effect of a Memphis newspaper listing all Tennessee residents with a handgun carry permit in a publicly accessible database, locating them within their five-digit zip code. The database received more than a million views in 2009. n40 The study's authors concluded that, in the months following a newspaper article that dramatically increased online traffic to the database, zip codes with higher densities of carry permit holders experienced a 20 percent relative decrease in burglaries compared to zip codes with lower densities of carry permit holders. n41</p><p>International data, too, seems to indicate that criminals generally consider the likelihood of armed resistance and adapt their behavior accordingly. According to one study, only about 13 percent of burglaries in the United States take place when the occupants are home, a rate far lower than in many other developed countries like Canada, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. n42 Because these ""hot burglaries"" are far more likely to result in an assault against a victim than are burglaries of unoccupied homes, it is relatively easy to predict--as several researchers have--that the lower percentage of hot burglaries in the United States results in over half a million fewer assaults every year than would otherwise occur if the percentage of hot burglaries was on par with these other countries, saving the nation billions of dollars in avoided crime costs and an untold number of lives. n43 While these studies looked specifically at burglaries, which by definition do not occur in public, it should be presumed that the same protective effects of gun ownership extend (at least to some extent) to the public sphere based on the same logic--most criminals seek to avoid armed resistance and in many cases will be deterred from attacking victims in a public place if those victims are likely to be armed.</p><p>Additionally, armed civilians play a significant but underacknowledged role in stopping active shooters, including those bent on committing acts of mass public violence. Between 2014 and 2021, armed citizens successfully stopped 51 percent of active shooters who carried out attacks in public places that allowed civilians to lawfully carry their own firearms for self-defense. n44 In none of those incidents did the armed citizen injure innocent bystanders. n45</p><p>Finally, armed self-defense--including armed self-defense in public--is often a vital but overlooked part of ensuring the safety of victims of intimate partner domestic violence. As explained below, too often, perpetrators of intimate partner domestic violence are simply told by a court not to contact or harm their victims, but are otherwise not detained. Far too often, they are not even prosecuted for their crimes until after they violate restraining orders. According to my analysis of the Heritage Foundation's Defensive Gun Use Database, between January 1, 2021 and March 10, 2022, we recorded 208 media-verified instances in which victims of intimate partner were protected from an abuser solely because they or a third-party was lawfully armed with a gun. In total, these armed citizens protected an estimated 395 potential victims, including 65 minor children and three unborn children. In 24 cases, the victim had a restraining order against the abuser, which was ignored. In 15 additional cases, it was clear that the assailant had a significant history of domestic violence, and in three cases, the victim was in the process of obtaining or renewing a protective order.</p><p>Our database is limited, and almost certainly undercounts by several orders of magnitude the actual number of times armed civilians successfully defend domestic violence victims from further abuse. First, our database relies solely on publicly accessible, online media reports that provide enough information to conclude that a particular DGU occurred during an incident of domestic violence involving partners. Often, media reports on DGUs fail to provide enough information for us to make reasonable determinations about the specific context in which the DGU occurred, or about whether the defensive gun user acted in an entirely lawful manner.</p><p>There is also good reason to believe that most defensive gun uses (in any context) are either not reported to police or are not considered ""newsworthy"" enough by local reports to garner a newspaper article. n46 Notably, our list almost exclusively involves situations where a gun was not just fired defensively, but where the assailant was injured or killed. It is impossible to know how many women are protected each year during defensive gun uses that are less likely to be reported in a public media source--like, for example, scenarios where the assailant is warded off by a warning shot or by the victim's mere presentation of a firearm.</p><p>At the very least, these verified defensive gun uses underscore the importance of the Second Amendment in protecting victims of domestic violence from their abusers. Far too often, civilian gun possession is framed as contrary to the interests of domestic violence victims. While it is certainly true that armed domestic abusers present a serious threat to their victims, it is also true that armed civilians routinely present a serious threat to would-be abusers.</p><p>Additionally, despite common suggestions by some prominent gun control advocates that armed domestic violence victims routinely have their firearms taken and used against them by their abusers, this is not supported by the available evidence. Such tragedies have, of course, occurred. But they are exceedingly rare, especially when compared to the number of successful defensive gun uses. Between our records of cases excluded from the Heritage database for being unsuccessful and the records available from the Gun Violence Archive--which flags instances of domestic violence involving guns stolen from their owners--we have been able to find only five cases since January 1, 2021, that even remotely fall into this category. In only one of these cases did an abuser overpower his armed victim, take her gun, and immediately use it against her to cause death or serious bodily injury. n47 In a second case, the abuser confronted the victim while she was not armed, demanded that she hand over the gun he knew she possessed for protection against him, and then used the gun to fatally shoot her nearly two weeks later. n48 In three other cases, a victim's gun was taken but the abuser either did not attempt to use the gun against the victim or did not successfully use the gun against the victim. n49</p><p>B. Overly Restrictive Public Carry Laws Have Devastating Criminal Justice Consequences</p><p>Not only does Bruen better enable peaceable citizens to defend themselves and others in public, it strikes down some of the worst aspects of discretionary, restrictive public carry frameworks that too often resulted in the government perversely creating ""violent weapons offenders"" out of otherwise law-abiding, upstanding citizens. As a coalition Black defense attorneys highlighted in an amicus brief in support of the petitioners in Bruen, New York's licensing requirements effectively criminalized the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular for poor and non-white Americans. n50 It was almost impossible for them to obtain a license to carry because licensing officials almost always determined that they lacked proper cause or sufficiently good moral character. And yet, because many still nonetheless truly felt a need to protect themselves with firearms in public despite government assessments to the contrary, or because they simply could not afford the often-prohibitive fees the government requires, thousands of New Yorkers were prosecuted every year as felons for possessing guns without licenses. n51 Nearly all of them were ethnic minorities. n52 In many cases, this is the only crime they were ever alleged to have committed. Now, at the very least, there is some method for ordinary peaceable New Yorkers to exercise their fundamental rights in a non-criminal manner.</p><p>Unfortunately, even shall-issue states sometimes make it too difficult for ordinary, law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry firearms in public, resulting in the same criminal justice problems. A recent study from Loyola University on arrests for illegal gun possession in Cook County helps to demonstrate the punitive effect of Illinois' burdensome process for obtaining a concealed carry permit. n53 A significant percentage of individuals arrested for illegal firearm possession are not otherwise prohibited from possessing guns and are not accused of using their gun in a violent manner or in furtherance of a crime. Their sole offense was a failure to obtain a concealed carry permit, something that under Illinois law they--as non-prohibited persons--could in theory obtain. The question is why individuals who want to carry in public and would actually qualify for the permit to do so nonetheless fail to obtain one. The answer seems to be, in large part, that obtaining a carry permit in Illinois will cost hundreds of dollars, require a working knowledge of the legal process, and impose serious time and logistical burdens.</p><p>III. The Post-Bruen Legal Fallout Is Widely Mischaracterized and Its Potential Public</p><p>Safety Consequences Grossly Exaggerated</p><p>With respect to the post-Bruen legal fallout, this hearing is probably at least six months premature. The most significant post-Bruen challenges are still working their way through the lower courts, and will likely take several more months (if not years) to fully resolve. That said, it is almost certain that Bruen will ultimately threaten certain types of modern gun control laws. The current extent of the post-Bruen legal fallout can be generally categorized into two groups: (1) cases dealing with public carry frameworks (most of which are in formerly ""proper cause"" states), and (2) cases in which more modern 20th century laws have been challenged. In each of these cases, the holdings and practical effects have been widely mischaracterized by gun control advocates and liberal academics, and the potential public safety consequences grossly exaggerated.</p><p>A. Successful Challenges to Post-Bruen Public Carry Frameworks in Formerly ""Proper Cause"" States</p><p>After Bruen, some formerly proper-cause states responded by merely suspending that requirement and leaving in place other time, place, and manner restrictions, which generally brought their public carry permit frameworks in line with the more restrictive and burdensome shall-issue jurisdictions. Others, however, seemingly went out of their way to take out their frustrations over the Bruen decision on law-abiding concealed carry applicants. New York and New Jersey are two prime examples. They immediately implemented extensive changes to their public carry laws that were obvious attempts to circumvent and undermine key aspects of Bruen.</p><p>Since these states could not use its discretion to determine whether an applicant had a ""proper cause"" to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights in public, they pivoted to insisting that applicants must still prove they are of sufficiently good ""moral character."" Licensing officers still reserve all the discretion in the world to determine whether an applicant meets that standard (a standard that, of course, is not based on objective measures of character such as criminal history or evidence of dangerousness). Applicants in New York, specifically, have to provide lists of all current and past social media accounts, the names and contact information of family members and cohabitants, at least four character references, and basically any other information a licensing officer decided might be relevant.</p><p>While the Court in Bruen said that New York could not deem the entirety of the public arena a ""sensitive place,"" both it and New Jersey did their darnedest to deem off limits as many public places as possible. Among other things, these states created a default presumption that a permit holder may not carry a firearm on to any third-party private property (including businesses open to the public) without explicit permission from the third-party--a presumption that all but ensures permit holders will not be allowed to bear arms in almost any area outside of their homes.</p><p>To the extent that some courts have enjoined parts of these post-Bruen public carry frameworks, it is because they largely fall far outside of the norms of the shall-issue frameworks identified in Bruen as presumptively constitutional. And, notably, most of New York's post-Bruen restrictions are still in place after the Second Circuit issued stays with respect to almost all aspects of the temporary restraining orders. n54 Oral argument is scheduled for March 20. It is likely that these more extreme aspects of New York's new framework will ultimately be struck down as inconsistent with Bruen, though likely by virtue of a ""grant, vacate, and remand"" order from the Supreme Court and not the Second Circuit, which, like the Ninth Circuit, is notorious for having never found a gun control measure that it could not find perfectly compatible with the Second Amendment. n55</p><p>This will not, however, create serious public safety concerns. Again, concealed carry permit holders are overwhelmingly law-abiding and are not the driving force behind gun crimes. These were not restrictions on public carry that New York, New Jersey, or others deemed necessary for maintaining public safety until after Bruen. That is because these brand-new restrictions are not about public safety in the first place. They are nothing more than cynical efforts to ensure that the concealed carry process is so convoluted, burdensome, and restrictive that many residents will simply decline to waste time and money obtaining a permit that does not actually seem to allow them carry anywhere outside of their homes. They are the very types of Kafkaesque bureaucratic burdens with abusive ends that the Bruen majority maintained would open a shall-issue regime to constitutional challenge. n56 * If and when these provisions are finally struck down, and New York and others are made to fall in line with other shall-issue states, the only effect on public safety will be an increased opportunity for peaceable citizens to defend themselves in public.</p><p>There has been, to my knowledge, only one successful post-Bruen challenge to public carry laws that pre-dated Bruen. In August of 2022, in Firearms Policy Coalition v. McCraw, n57 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined a Texas statute prohibiting law-abiding 18-to-20-year-old from obtaining a license to carry a handgun outside of the home for self-defense. n58 The court determined that law-abiding 18-to-20-year-olds are part of ""the people"" mentioned in the Second Amendment, and that the wholesale prohibition on their bearing handguns in public was not consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, as required by Bruen. n59 The court started its analysis by noting that the Second Amendment does not mention any sort of age restriction, and that ""when the Framers meant to impose age restrictions, they did so expressly."" n60 Heller made clear that ""the people"" is a term of art referring ""all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset,"" and in Bruen it was undisputed that ""ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens"" are part of the ""people"" whom the Second Amendment protects. n61 Moreover, while the Second Amendment protects an individual right regardless of whether he or she is actively engaged in militia service, ""logic demands...that the Second Amendment's protections extend at least to those who constitute the militia.. ,[I]t must protect at least the pool of individuals from whom the militia would be drawn."" n62 This was generally understood at the Founding to include able-bodied 18-to-20-year-olds. n63</p><p>Texas' scheme did not, like historical analogues, distinguish between methods of carrying a firearm in public (such as openly versus concealed), prohibit carrying only in certain ""sensitive places,"" involve the carrying of ""dangerous and unusual"" arms, or deal with gun ownership by felons or the mentally ill. While laws restricting certain rights of individuals under the age of 21 were enacted in some jurisdictions during the latter half of the 19th century, the court recalled that Bruen ""should not be understood to endorse freewheeling reliance on historical practice"" from that period ""to establish the original meaning of the Bill of Rights."" n64 Rather than appeal, Texas settled the case and changed its concealed carry permitting scheme to allow applications from law-abiding residents aged 18 or older. n65</p><p>Notably, at least one federal circuit has already disagreed withMcCraw's reasoning, though in a case dealing with the slightly different (but very much related) issue of laws prohibiting gun sales to young adults. n66 However, should the reasoning in McCraw ultimately win the day (an outcome that is perfectly reasonable under a fair application of Bruen), the sky will still not fall. As with restrictive public carry laws implemented by formerly ""proper cause"" states after Bruen, there are few negative public safety implications for allowing law-abiding 18-to-20-year-olds to obtain permits to carry firearms in public for self-defense on the same basis as other law-abiding adults.</p><p>B. Successful Challenges to Non-Public Carry Gun Laws Based on Bruen Framework</p><p>There have also been a handful of successful post-Bruen challenges to gun laws unrelated to public carry. While these cases are still working their way through litigation and additional appeals, they do provide meaningful insight into how Bruen may operate to strike down certain types of gun control laws. Importantly, they also provide valuable insight into the types of laws that lower courts generally agree Bruen leaves untouched.</p><p>United States v. Quiroz n67</p><p>One month after McCraw, in September of 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed an indictment under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(n), which prohibits those under felony indictment from ""receiving"" (but not possessing) firearms or ammunition. The court reasoned that the federal statute does not ""align with the Nation's historical tradition,"" as required by Bruen. n68 In this case, the defendant was under felony indictment in Texas state court for both burglary and for jumping bail with respect to that burglary charge. While under indictment, he attempted to buy a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer, during which transaction he denied being under felony indictment when filling out his required ATF Form 4473. Because of a delayed background check, the defendant was able to acquire the firearm before the denial came back to the dealer. Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was informed of the illegal firearm acquisition. The defendant's firearm was seized, and he was charged and ultimately convicted of violating [Sec.] 922(n), as well as 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(a)(6), which prohibits a person from making false statements during the purchase a firearm.</p><p>In holding [Sec.] 922(n) unconstitutional, the court reasoned that the Second Amendment's plain text presumptively protects the ""receipt"" of a firearm just as much as the ""keeping"" and ""bearing"" of a firearm, as the right to possess an object necessarily encompasses the right to ""receive"" it into one's possession. n69 Far from being ""relatively similar"" to historical regulations, [Sec.] 922(n)'s history does not begin until the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 and did not apply to state-level indictments for non-violent crimes until 1968. n70 Moreover, the court noted that the statute warranted additional skepticism because of historical misappropriation of similar laws to ""pretextually and unlawfully disarm unfavored groups"" without the benefit of due process or legal tribunals. n71</p><p>United States v. Price n72</p><p>In October of 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted a defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 922(k) and 924(a)(1)(B), effectively finding that those statutes were unconstitutional under the Bruen test. n73 Here, law enforcement officers arrested the defendant during a traffic stop in which they searched his vehicle and found a pistol with an obliterated serial number. The defendant had previously been convicted in another state of involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery, both felonies, and was indicted by a grand jury for both being a felon in possession of firearm and for possessing the unlawfully altered gun. n74</p><p>The court upheld the indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm, noting that the Supreme Court repeatedly issued assurances in Heller, McDonald, and Bruen that its opinions ""did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as 'prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons.'"" n75 The Bruen majority in particular was careful to state that the Second Amendment protects ""the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms for self-defense."" n76 Even if Bruen did intend for lower courts to re-examine felon-in-possession laws, such laws ""fit comfortably within the nation's longstanding tradition of disarming unvirtuous or dangerous citizens."" n77</p><p>At the same time, the court could not find such historical evidence for criminalizing the mere possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. n78 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 922(k) and 924(a)(1)(B) are not commercial regulations on the sale of arms, but rather criminal prohibition on any person's possession of an unserialized firearm, regardless of that firearm's condition at the time of the commercial sale. n79 Moreover, it was not until 1934 that Congress first required serial numbers on firearms, and even then, it was only for a small subset of firearms covered under the National Firearms Act. It was not until 1968 that the federal government first broadly required serial numbers on all firearms manufactured or imported in the United States. n80 By 1938, Congress had prohibited the sale, transfer, or receipt of guns with obliterated serial numbers, but did not criminalize possession of such a firearm until 1990. n81 The court therefore dismissed the defendant's indictment for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, finding that the relevant statutes were unconstitutional under Bruen.</p><p>At least one other federal district court has reached an opposite conclusion. n82</p><p>United States v. Harrison n83</p><p>In early February of 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed an indictment under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(g)(3), which prohibits unlawful users of controlled substances from possessing firearms, because the government failed to prove that this prohibition was consistent with ""the historical traditions that define the outer limits of the right to keep and bear arms."" n84 The defendant in this case was arrested during a traffic stop in which officers discovered a loaded handgun in his vehicle, as well as various marijuana and THC-infused substances. n85 At the time of his arrest, the defendant was on bond awaiting trial in Texas for aggravated assault, stemming from an altercation in which he and another man were alleged to have shot into a crowd at a college party, seriously wounding one victim. n86 Importantly, it was not clear to the court from pre-trial records that the defendant had been prohibited from possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. n87</p><p>In the court's view, the historical statutes cited by the government only restricted the public carry of firearms by individuals who were actively intoxicated. n88 They did not, however, impose a broad prohibition on all gun possession in all circumstances for those who use intoxicating substances but are currently sober. n89 In short, the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulations ""was tethered to the principle that the Constitution permitted the dispossession of persons who demonstrated that they would present a danger to the public if armed."" n90 Where felon-inpossession laws deprive a person of the right to keep and bear arms after a criminal conviction requiring an individualized, adversarial proceeding that complies with the requirements of due process, [Sec.] 922(g)(3)'s deprivations occur without any pre-deprivation due process, at all. n91 The court was clear to note, however, that Bruen does not prohibit the government from playing a role in protecting the public from dangerous people who possess firearms. If the state of Texas thought that the defendant was a danger to the public based on his alleged involvement in a previous shooting, it could have demonstrated to a judge during an individualized proceeding that he should be kept in pre-trial detention, which ""would be a highly effective means of protecting the public from a gun-toting [defendant]."" n92</p><p>A Tenth Circuit panel has already heard oral argument for this case, but it has not yet issued a decision.</p><p>United States v. Rahimi n93</p><p>Most recently, gun control advocates have decried a Fifth Circuit panel decision where the court vacated a conviction under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(g)(8), which prohibits gun possession for individuals under certain types of domestic violence restraining orders, finding that the statute ""fails to pass constitutional muster"" under Bruen. n94 In this case, the defendant had various criminal charges pending against him in Texas state court for, among other things, using a firearm while physically assaulting his girlfriend in December 2019, and committing aggravated assault against a different woman in November 2020. n95 He was not, apparently, held on pre-trial detainment. However, as a result of the December 2019 allegation, he was subject to a civil protection order prohibiting him from ""committing family violence,"" coming within 200 yards of his ex-girlfriend, or possessing a firearm. Nevertheless, he was accused of participating in five additional shootings within the two-month span between December 2020 and January 2021. During his arrest, officers found him in possession of two firearms, so on top of all of his other various state criminal charges, he was charged in federal court with violating [Sec.] 922(g)(8).</p><p>The Fifth Circuit, in holding [Sec.] 922(g)(8) unconstitutional, noted that while the defendant was subject to a civil restraining order and accused of committing a number of serious criminal offenses, he was not a convicted felon, mentally ill, or otherwise within a category historically understood as excluding someone from ""the people"" for purposes of the Second Amendment. The only historical laws remotely resembling modern arms prohibitions based on civil protection orders were surety laws, which did not completely deprived a person of the right to keep and bear arms, but only prohibited him from publicly carrying arms if he failed to ""post surety."" Through Bruen's lens, then, [Sec.] 922(g)(8)'s ban is an ""outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted."" n96</p><p>Importantly, as with the district court in Harrison, the Fifth Circuit panel was quick to point out that while the government could not disarm the defendant through a civil restraining order, it was not left without options. Judge Ho's concurrence in particular made clear that:</p><p>Those who commit violence, including domestic violence, shouldn't just be disarmed--they should be detained, prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated. And that's exactly why we have a criminal justice system--to punish criminals and disable them from engaging in further crimes. n97</p><p>Whereas civil protection orders can be ""misused as a tactical device in divorce proceedings"" and arise in situations where judges may feel pressured (or even incentivized) to grant them, criminal proceedings require much more robust standards of due process. n98 During criminal proceedings, the government can detain and disarm defendants before trial and as part of the sentence. The court cast no doubt on the government's ability to continuing prohibiting gun possession for convicted felons. It can also pursue charges against (and therefore detain and disarm) those who threaten criminal violence. n99</p><p>Themes From These Cases:</p><p>Gun control advocates have painted these cases as devastating for public safety, a refrain that continues gaining traction due in no small part to the involvement of unsympathetic defendants and the general public's limited and unnuanced understanding of criminal law. One media outlet went so far as to assert that the Rahimi opinion literally gives ""violent domestic abusers"" a ""license to kill,"" as though the judges had unilaterally declared murder to be legal before handing the defendant a machine gun and saying, ""Have at it."" n100 The reality is that in every single case outlined above, the government was left with a variety of options for detaining and disarming the allegedly dangerous person. Assuming none of these cases is overturned during further appeal, in none of them is the defendant likely to be lawfully able to possess arms at any time in the near future or ever. And in none of them is the ultimate result that society must throw up its hands, decriminalize murder, and give guns to violent offenders. Any suggestion to the contrary is preposterous.</p><p>In Quiroz, the government can seek to have the defendant detained while pursuing the original criminal charges for burglary--pre-trial detention may be particularly warranted given that he is also accused of bail jumping. It can seek to have a court impose a prohibition on possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. If the defendant is convicted of either of his two felony charges, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms as a condition of his sentence or in perpetuity as a convicted felon.</p><p>In Price, the government may still prohibit the former violent felon from possessing firearms and can pursue additional criminal charges for violating that prohibition. In the meantime, the government can seek to have him held in pre-trial detention or incarcerated as part of his sentence.</p><p>In Harrison, the government may continue pursuing criminal charges against the defendant for allegedly shooting innocent partygoers. The government can seek to have him held on pre-trial detention or prohibited from possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. If he is convicted, the government may protect the general public by incarcerating him, prohibiting him from possessing weapons as a condition of his probation or parole, and prohibiting him as a violent felon from possessing firearms after his sentence is completed. If he is acquitted, the government can prohibit him (and anyone else) from possessing firearms in public while actively intoxicated, and can arrest and criminally charge him for doing so.</p><p>In Rahimi, the defendant is likely going to spend many years in state prison for shooting at multiple innocent victims and committing multiple serious domestic violence offenses. n101 Should he be released, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms, either as a condition of his parole or because of his conviction for a violent felony.</p><p>In short, anyone who insists that these cases greatly affect the government's ability to detain and disarm violent offenders either has not read them, does not understand how these laws work, or is a liar with a flair for the dramatic.</p><p>IV. Properly Understood, Bruen Leaves Ample Room for Legitimate and Effective Public Safety Solutions</p><p>As the actual holdings from the above cases indicate, to the extent that Bruen threatens certain gun control laws, they are generally laws that have never been effective at protecting the public. At the same time, Bruen clearly leaves ample room for many constitutionally legitimate options when it comes to public safety. The even better news is that these public safety solutions are actually far more effective than any of the gun control laws likely threatened by Bruen.</p><p>A. The Gun Control Laws Realistically Threatened by Bruen are Generally Ineffective at Protecting Innocent Victims</p><p>The cases outlined above largely speak for themselves about the ineffectiveness of the laws they struck down. Many of the overly restrictive post-Bruen public carry frameworks were not deemed ""necessary"" for the public safety until after Bruen. They apply to a segment of society (concealed carry permit holders) that are overwhelmingly not responsible for gun crimes. As a practical matter, they do nothing to deter criminals who were already motivated to carry without a permit and use firearms to harm innocent parties, and who routinely did so while violating more restrictive public carry laws. Civil protection orders, as well, are rarely effective against the most motivated (and therefore the most dangerous) offenders, who routinely violate those conditions with impunity. At the same time, they can be weaponized against innocent parties, including as a way for domestic violence offenders to further their abuse.</p><p>Meanwhile, laws that strip law-abiding young adults of their fundamental rights do not distinguish between the vast majority of adults who are peaceable and law-abiding, and those who by their actions have proven themselves to be individualized risks of criminal violence. As with other laws outlined above, motivated criminal offenders are likely to simply ignore the prohibition, as they already routinely do. Meanwhile, while it is true that adults between the ages of 18 and 20 are responsible for a disproportionate amount of violent crime, it is equally true that they are disproportionately likely to be victimized by violent crime--and therefore disproportionately likely to need to rely on their right to armed self-defense.</p><p>While an exhaustive review of all potentially threatened laws in unnecessary, two other major prohibitions are worth analyzing--bans on so-called ""assault weapons,"" and bans on so-called ""large-capacity magazines.""</p><p>Bans on So-Called ""Assault Weapons ""</p><p>In Heller, the Court reasoned that the Second Amendment's protections are not limited only to those arms in existence at the time of ratification, but ""extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms."" n102 While ""dangerous and unusual"" arms may fall outside of the Amendment's scope, it certainly covers small arms (in that instance, handguns) that are ""typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,"" like self-defense. n103</p><p>There is no standard definition of ""assault weapon,"" but the phrase generally refers to a semiautomatic rifle with a detachable magazine and one or more of a handful of common cosmetic features, such as a pistol grip, forward grip, barrel shroud, collapsing or folding stock, or threaded barrel. n104 Despite purposeful attempts by gun control advocates to conflate these guns in the public mind with machine guns and select-fire assault rifles, semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips and barrel shrouds are functionally identical to all other semi-automatic rifles.</p><p>Semi-automatic rifles--with or without the cosmetic features decried by gun control advocates as being ""military-style""--are the exact type of bearable small arms whose civilian possession is protected by the Second Amendment. n105 Even as early as 1994, well before Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, the Supreme Court referred to these rifles as weapons that ""traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful possessions."" n106 This is even more true today, when tens of millions of these rifles are currently in the hand of peaceable, law-abiding citizens who will never use them to harm themselves or others. n107</p><p>If bans on so-called ""assault weapons"" are struck down under in post-Bruen litigation (as they should be), public safety will not be meaningfully impacted. To begin with, these bans have never been clearly associated with measurable increases in public safety. There exists no plausible causal mechanism explaining how such a ban could lead to fewer gun crimes given how rarely rifles of any kind are actually used to commit crimes and how easily ""non-assault weapon"" versions of the same firearm could be used just as effectively by criminals in the vast majority of cases. n108 During the past decade, rifles of any kind were known to be used in only 3 percent to 4 percent of homicides, without any clarity on how many of those rifles were ""assault weapons"" compared to other types of ""non-assault"" rifles. n109 The average American is, in fact, several times more likely to be stabbed to death than he or she is to be shot to death with a rifle of any kind. n110</p><p>Similarly, handguns are by far the weapon of choice in non-fatal firearm crimes. n111 Even if enforcement were immediate and total, such that no criminal could ever again access a pistol-gripped semi-automatic rifle, most crimes (in fact, virtually all crimes) could just as easily and effectively be carried out with a ban-compliant firearm of the same caliber. It is little wonder, then, the official government report on the 1994 federal assault weapons ban--which expired in 2004-- determined that ""[s]hould it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. [Assault weapons] were rarely used in gun crimes even before the ban."" n112</p><p>Indeed, the primary concern raised by advocates of assault weapons bans is related to the least common type of firearm violence--mass public shootings, which account for a fraction of a percent of all gun homicides every year, although they certainly garner a lot of attention for understandable reasons. n113 Gun control advocates, politicians, and the media routinely characterize semi-automatic rifles, specifically the AR-15, as the ""weapon of choice"" for mass public shooters. This is far from an accurate depiction of the facts. Of 82 mass public shootings that occurred between 2012 and 2022, 38 involved shooters who used handguns alone while only 17 involved shooters who used rifles alone. n114 Even if this analysis includes the 19 mass public shootings in which the perpetrator possessed a combination of firearms including a rifle, most mass public shootings still would not involve the use of a rifle. n115</p><p>To the extent that semi-automatic rifles are utilized by mass shooters, it is because they are popular among all Americans, the vast majority of whom will never use them for any unlawful purpose, much less a mass shooting. Moreover, some of the deadliest mass public shootings in United States history have been carried out with nothing more than handguns. This includes the worst school shooting in U.S. history at Virginia Tech in 2006, where the shooter was able to fire 174 rounds in roughly 11 minutes, killing 30 people and wounding 17 others with nothing more than common, relatively low-caliber handguns. n116 Similarly, in 1991, a shooter at a Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 19 with two handguns. n117</p><p>The reality is that, even if all would-be mass public shooters were successfully diverted to the use of ""non-assault weapons,"" it would likely have no meaningful impact on their ability to kill large numbers of unarmed civilians. n118 With only a few arguable exceptions, such as the 2018 Las Vegas shooting, the type of firearm was not a major factor in the ability of mass shooters to cause significant casualties, particularly compared to other important factors such as the time the shooter remained unconfronted by a meaningful response. n119 This is because both ""assault weapons"" and ""non-assault weapons"" are functionally the exact same firearms and expel the exact same caliber of bullets with the exact same muzzle velocity, impacting the victim's body in the exact same manner.</p><p>At the same time, the millions of Americans who own these firearms do so for the same reasons that police departments across the country now routinely issue them to their peace officers, who are, by definition, not authorized to wage offensive warfare or ""kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time."" n120 In short, they are incredibly useful tools against criminal threats that commonly arise in a civilian context. Civilians can and do use them to great effect in defense of themselves and others. n121</p><p>Magazine Capacity Limitations</p><p>Again, even before Bruen the Court had made clear that the Second Amendment's protections are not limited to the technology that existed in 1792. n122 Multi-shot firearms were well-known to the Founding generation, and the trend in firearm manufacturing toward increased ammunition capacity was already well underway by the time the Second Amendment was ratified. n123 Rifles with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition first achieved mass-market success in the late 1860s, while handguns with such magazines first became popular in the 1930s. n124 By the 1960s and 1970s, advancements in magazine technology had made magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds the factory standard for many of the most popular firearms on the civilian market, with millions of such firearms being sold. n125 As one might guess from the longstanding popularity of 10+ round magazines by civilians, attempts to limit magazine capacity for civilians are a modern phenomenon. Far from being rooted in some historical tradition of regulation, the first laws even remotely resembling modern bans on large-capacity magazines did not arise until the 1930s--and two of the three were repealed within decades. n126 Even today, magazine capacity limits exist in only a minority of states, most of which did not impose those limitations until the 21st century. n127 It is therefore incredibly difficult to see how any court could uphold such modern bans while remaining faithful to Heller and Bruen.</p><p>As with bans on semi-automatic firearms deemed ""assault weapons,"" the public safety implications are minimal should post-Bruen litigation result in bans on ""large-capacity magazines"" being struck down as unconstitutional. Most gun crimes are not targeted shooting attempts, but rather robberies and aggravated assaults in which the perpetrator brandishes--but does not fire--the gun. n128 Even with respect to the minority of gun crimes in which perpetrators fire their weapon, it is not at all clear that magazine capacity limits offer meaningful benefits. Only a small percentage of homicides involve two or more victims, which are the types of crimes most likely to require an offender to fire more than 10 rounds. n129 Unsurprisingly, an official analysis of the 1994 federal law prohibiting their sale concluded that there was ""no evidence of reductions in multiple-victim gun homicides or multiple-gunshot wound victimizations"" as a result of the prohibition. n130 This is hardly surprising, given that the ""banned.. .magazines were used in only a modest fraction of gun crimes before the law."" n131 Moreover, later analyses have determined that the proportion of all multiple-victim homicides actually increased slightly during the first half of the federal ban, before stabilizing around 2000 and remaining consistently around 4.5 percent until 2008, when the most recent report was apparently published. n132</p><p>It is little wonder, then, that proponents of magazine capacity limitations have increasingly turned away from arguments that these laws will lower crime rates, generally, and instead focus on their alleged impact on the least common type of gun violence--mass public shootings. n133 One of the most popular arguments raised in favor of limiting magazine capacity for civilians is that mass public shooters may use standard capacity magazines to inflict higher numbers of casualties, namely by decreasing the number of times they need to reload. Again, even assuming widespread compliance and effective enforcement, limiting magazine capacity is unlikely to meaningfully lower casualty rates in mass public shootings. First, mass public shooters can (and routinely do) work around these limitations by bringing several firearms and extra loaded magazines, easily replacing expended magazines within seconds. n134 Moreover, an analysis of data from mass public shootings shows that most perpetrators do not actually use magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds, and that regardless, mass public shooters typically do not fire at a fast enough rate for casualty counts to be attributed to magazine capacity. n135 This conclusion is supported by the findings of various panels analyzing the effect of magazine capacity for individual mass shootings, as well as by the reality that high casualty counts have occurred during shootings where only ""limited-capacity"" magazines were used. n136</p><p>It is not just that these laws have little practical effect on criminal actions--at the same time, they undermine the practical ability of peaceable citizens to defend themselves in those scenarios where the need for armed self-defense is most acute, such as when they are outnumbered, outgunned, or otherwise placed at a tactical disadvantage. n137 These scenarios of tactical disadvantage are almost certainly more common for peaceable citizens than for criminals, who have the upper hand in planning and executing their crimes. Unlike law-abiding citizens, who must reactively defend themselves whenever and under whatever circumstances they are victimized, criminals can (and often do) wait for (or even create) the most advantageous circumstances. For example, a significant percentage of homicides, robberies, and other violent crimes involve multiple offenders. n138 Multiple-offender homicides, in particular, are becoming increasingly common, with roughly one out of every five homicides in 2008 involving multiple offenders. n139</p><p>Indeed, gun control advocates arguably concede this point on the potential importance of being able to fire more than 10 rounds without reloading when they support magazine capacity laws that universally exempt law enforcement officers, including in their off-duty capacities and with their personal firearms. Law enforcement officers in the United States are peace officers acting in a civilian context, and generally speaking respond to the same criminal threats first faced by the peaceable citizens who called them for assistance in the first place. The circumstances under which they may use deadly force largely parallel the laws of self-defense for civilians. While off-duty, their powers of arrest and investigation are, in many cases, based solely on the rights of citizens' arrest possessed by all other members of society. And while most civilian defensive gun uses do not involve any rounds being fired, much less more than ten rounds being fired, the same is true of police-involved shootings. n140 To whatever extent, then, that standard capacity magazines are useful for law enforcement officers, they are equally useful for civilians who face those same threats.</p><p>B. Bruen Does Not Realistically Threaten a Variety of Far More Effective Public Safety Measures</p><p>Just because Bruen is likely to threaten several laws that were ineffective at protecting the public in the first place does not mean that the opinion leaves the government without other valid and effective tools. Bruen, and the post-Bruen cases outlined above, were abundantly clear about the plethora of constitutionally legitimate measures at the government's disposal.</p><p>With respect to public carry, the Bruen majority made clear that certain regulations have ample historical support. These include limitations on the intent for which a person can carry firearms in public, on the manner by which one carries firearms in public, and on the ""exceptional circumstances"" under which a person may not carry firearms in public. n141 Moreover, while the government may not declare wide swaths of the public sphere off limits under the guise that it all constitutes a ""sensitive place,"" the Court looked favorably on a ""sensitive places"" doctrine properly limited to areas like legislative assemblies, polling places, courthouses, and their modern analogues. n142 Neither the Supreme Court nor any post-Bruen lower court has questioned the constitutional validity of shall-issue frameworks that require applicants to receive training before carrying public. n143</p><p>Under Bruen, it is almost unquestionable that the government may prohibit gun possession for those convicted of violent criminal offenses, who threaten to commit violent acts against other, or who are mentally ill and dangerous to themselves or others. The government can also protect the public by holding those charged with criminal offenses in pre-trial detention or imposing gun prohibitions as a condition of pre-trial release. It can choose to pursue incarceration for violent offenders instead of probation or parole. Or, in the alternative, it can impose gun prohibitions as a condition of diversionary programs, deferred sentencing agreements, or probation or parole.</p><p>The catch, however, is that this means state and local prosecutors have to actually pursue criminal charges against violent offenders or file petitions for civil commitment proceedings. It means that they have to seek pre-trial detention against people who they believe are dangerous. It means that federal prosecutors have to step in and pursue federal charges and federal detention when local rogue prosecutors are willing to let violent criminals terrorize communities.</p><p>This last point in particular raises an important question to which this Committee should seek answers--what, exactly, is this Justice Department actually doing to pursue charges in [Sec.] 922(g) felon-in-possession cases? The last time I testified before this body, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams sat next to me and told you:</p><p>An overall lack of accountability for violent offenders is contributing to the rise in gun violence. In some of our major cities, district attorneys are not prosecuting serial firearm offenders, [and] judges continue to release violent offenders on low or no bond. To address these challenges Congress must provide resources to the U.S. Attorney's offices to support additional federal prosecution, as appropriate. n144</p><p>The Justice Department has done a lot since then. For example, via agency fiat, it turned tens of thousands of peaceable AR-pistol owners into felons if they did not register their guns and pay the government $200. It has certainly made a big stink about shutting down every gun store it can the first time they see a clerical error. And sure, the Justice Department says on a nice little memo that it is really extra super serious about prosecuting gun crimes--but are they targeting the small subset of repeat offenders who are overwhelmingly responsible for terrorizing innocent people? Is there any actual evidence that they are ramping up efforts to step in and prosecute violent offenders for felon-in-possession, particularly in the cities most plagued by local rogue prosecutors refusing to add gun enhancements? Because thus far, I can find none. n145</p><p>The reality is that these available methods under Bruen are far more effective at protecting the public than the laws Bruen threatens. This point is perhaps nowhere as obvious as in United States v. Rahimi, the case so many gun control advocates have decried as literally ""going to get women killed."" Any sane, sober, and prudent observer would have looked at the underlying facts of that defendant's initial domestic violence charges and realized that he presented a serious risk of violence and should not have been released from pre-trial detention. Instead of ensuring that any of his victims were protected from further injury, the government chose to rely on a civil protection order--a piece of paper saying ""please refrain from owning guns."" And, predictably, this violent individual simply ignored that piece of paper on his way to ignoring a number of other laws about not shooting at people, endangering the lives of nearly a dozen more innocent victims.</p><p>True, Bruen does not allow Rahimi to be charged for having a gun while under a protection order, because it does not allow the government to disarm via such actions in the first place. But Bruen certainly would have authorized the government to seek to have Rahimi detained while facing charges for violently assaulting two women. It would also have authorized the government to seek to have a court disarm Rahimi as a condition of his pre-trial release (a condition he likely would have ignored just as flippantly as he did the restraining order). Regardless of Bruen, Rahimi is likely going to spend a good number of his remaining years in state prison for committing violent crimes. And, under Bruen, if and when Rahimi is released from prison, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms as a convicted violent felon.</p><p>Bruen is not ""going to get women killed.""</p><p>It will force the government to actually utilize the more effective tools it already has at its disposal to protect women, and all other members of the public, from violent individuals.</p><p>And just as importantly, it will allow more innocent victims to better protect themselves from any violent offenders the government refuses to pursue or prosecute.</p><p>Media-Verified Cases of Successful Defensive Gun Use Against Intimate Partner Violence, January 1, 2021, to March 10, 2023 n146</p><p>Date.........Location.........Secondary Context........................Protective Order?...............Min.

Meanwhile, concealed carry permit holders wishing to carry in another state are reliant on state-level reciprocity agreements or must apply for a non-residents' permit in the state in which they wish to carry. Often, the most gun-restrictive states either do not recognize the permits of the vast majority of other states, and in many cases effectively do not authorize non-residents to obtain permits. In any case, concealed carry permit holders who cross state lines are subject to a complex and complicated web of restrictions that can change even between individual counties and cities.

Of note, the victim was shot shortly after leaving her place of work and while walking to a bus stop to take public transportation home. Id. While the victim had a concealed carry permit, it is possible that her company's weapons policy forbade her from carrying while at work. If this is the case, she likely would not have be able to carry to or from work, either, as she would not have a place to safely store her firearm during work hours.

The factor that most obviously impacted the casualty count in this shooting was not the shooter's use of a pistol-gripped rifle, but his use of a bump stock device, which significantly increased his rate of fire. There is at least a facially plausible argument that the shooter's use of foregrips and pistol grips enabled him to better hit his targets from a distance of almost 500 yards than if his firearms did not have such features. However, there are several problems with this argument. First, the shooter does not appear to have been pinpointing specific victims, but rather attempting to fire as many rounds as possible at the general mass of concertgoers. Given that his target was comprised of thousands of potential victims packed tightly together in a large, open space, any potential slight decrease in accuracy rendered by the use of a ""featureless"" rifle would likely have resulted not in fewer casualties, but merely a different set of casualties. Second, while it is still unclear which of the shooter's dozens of firearms were actually used that night, many of them were attached with bipods--common devices for hunting and marksmanship that allow the shooter to rest the front end of the firearm in a stable and elevated position. The use of these devices--which are not features of ""assault weapons""--would have provided far more stability from the shooter's ""sniper's nest"" vantage point than would a foregrip or pistol grip. Moreover, from such a position, there are a variety of methods the shooter could have used with a featureless rifle to stabilize the firearm even without a bipod or foregrip, such as resting the forestock on a bag or chairback.</p><p>n120 English, 2021 National Firearms Survey, supra note 34, at 33-34.</p><p>n121 Data from the 2021 National Firearms Survey suggests that rifles are used in roughly 13 percent of defensive gun uses, though it is unclear how many of these rifles are semi-automatic ""assault weapons"" compared to other types of rifles. Id. at 10-16. Media-verified defensive gun uses often do not include specific information on the type of weapon used, much less clearly distinguish between various types of rifles. However, it is abundantly clear that civilians, just like law enforcement officers, can and do rely on these weapons for self-defense.

See Follman, supra note 113. Even if magazine capacity laws are taken to the most extreme and entirely prohibit the use of detachable magazines, mass public shooters or other criminals could still quickly reload a fixed magazine by using pre-loaded stripper or en bloc clips. Or, as was the case in the 2022 mass public shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, ""compliant"" non-detachable low-capacity magazines can easily and quickly be illegally modified by would-be mass shooters with access to the internet and a screwdriver.

The worst school shooting in U.S. history--at Virginia Tech in 2009--was carried out by an individual using two handguns and 19 extra magazines with capacities of 10 and 15 rounds. Id.

And the adaptation the authors have in mind isn't just the usual Darwinian metaphor - managers must 'become business revolutionaries, even disruptors' in order to avoid being squeezed out of the scene altogether. In filling out the particulars of this claim[1] the authors of the new report make four more specific points: one, asset management is a buyers' market and will become more so, in large part because 'institutional investors have the tools to differentiate alpha and beta,' and they want to pay for the former not the latter. </p><p>They also say that asset managers have been filling gaps in the financial system that emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis - they'll need to capitalize on and expand these once-niche markets. Thirdly, while they make the common point that traditional active managers feel a squeeze between passive management on the one hand and alternatives on the other, they go further in that direction than other analysts have, saying that the way to react to this squeeze is not to try to beat back the competing forces but to join them, to turn a management firm into a 'multi-asset solutions firm.' But perhaps the most surprising of the four points is the contention that asset management has been a refuge of digital technology 'laggards,' and that this will change in the near future, as 'technology giants enter the sector, flexing their data analytics and distribution muscle. The race is on.' Laggards? One might be excused for thinking on the contrary that this field has been a technology pace setter in recent years, with blockchains, Big Data, algorithmic execution, etc. Although, yes, PwC sees that some firms, especially heavily quantitative alternative investment firms, have been as these authors put it 'leveraging technology in specific areas of their business,' it also contends that 'the first truly technology-enabled firm' has yet to emerge. Ceasing to Be Laggards As such firms do emerge, some of the job descriptions to which we're accustomed will disappear. For example, 'investment analyst.' Research teams with lots of human investment analysts working together - that is over - replaced by 'exponential advances in computing power, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and big data.' ETF managers are among the most innovative firms in the space, the least laggardly, and they will likely 'lead the way' as the revolution comes. This report says that investment analysis 'is a task inherently suited to computers,' it can be done with lots of data and correlation-seeking power, both of which are what the digital revolution has been all about. The back and middle offices will be automated or outsourced. 'Global utilities' will emerge to be the recipient of the outsourcing of know-your-client, transfer agency, trade processing, and tax reporting functions. Of course, carbon-based people are going to have to guide the firms into this new world of streamlined front offices with silicon-based analysts. 'To hire the best people,' the report says in a sidebar, 'diversity in all its forms will matter more than ever - from gender, generation, ethnicity, sexuality and disability to people with a broader range of skills, experience, and industry backgrounds.' PwC's research indicates that 'firms still have a long way to go in making diversity a reality and realizing the benefits.' Filling the Financing Gaps As noted above, one of the themes of the report is the emergence of certain financing gaps since the GFC, which have become profitable niches or more-than-niches for alpha generators. When the authors get around to fleshing this point out, they disclose that what they have in mind includes syndicated lending activities for large infrastructure projects. 'We anticipate soaring growth in real assets - mainly infrastructure and to a lesser extent real estate.' PwC anticipates a 27.5% per annum growth rate in infrastructure through 2020, slowing to 15% in the five years after that. People in Latin America, Asia, and Africa are migrating to cities, creating an urgent need for infrastructure there: waste, power, and transportation. Infrastructure is shifting 'from pure-play, low-risk' to deal sourcing, evaluation, and asset management. In real estate, asset managers in the years to come will 'make greater use of ways to gain exposure such as REITS' and will expand in non-traditional areas such as rental, multi-generational, and affordable housing.Be Sociable, Share!<url normalizedValue=""http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=http://www.allaboutalpha.com/blog/2017/11/30/pwc-charge-asset-managers-are-digital-tech-laggards/...le=AllAboutAlpha.com%20%7C%20Hedge%20funds,%20portable%20alpha,%20130/30%20and%20alpha-centric%20investing"">http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=http://www.allaboutalpha.com/blog/2017/11/30/pwc-charge-asset-managers-are-digital-tech-laggards/...le=AllAboutAlpha.com%20%7C%20Hedge%20funds,%20portable%20alpha,%20130/30%20and%20alpha-centric%20investing</url> [ 1]:            <url normalizedValue=""http://sewkis.typepad.com/files/awm-revolution-full-report-final.pdf"">http://sewkis.typepad.com/files/awm-revolution-full-report-final.pdf</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">NEWSTX-ALLA100252151208736826025176500063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">ALLA-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5R30-5GV1-JCMN-Y1P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""843""/><timeReceived>12:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>AllAboutAlpha.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=""01"" month=""12"" year=""2017""><dateText>December 1, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""58""><classCode>CC00028V0</classCode><className>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""58""><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""58""><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp; BOOKKEEPING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>big data</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Featured Post</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hedge Fund Industry Trends</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>The A.I.

Parr-Sanchez is the current president of NEA-New Mexico, the National Education Association's affiliate in the Land of Enchantment, and ""this"" of course is the profound trauma of schooling amidst COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">All public schools in her state and nearly all nationwide are closed for the rest of the academic year due to the pandemic, and teachers and school support staff are approaching the final weeks of a remote learning stopgap effort.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Parr-Sanchez's comment reflects a national conversation that is slowly pivoting away from crisis schooling to how to reopen schools in the new school year. ""For most children, the school year ended in March,"" economist Susan Dynarski wrote in the New York Times. ""The sooner we face it, the faster we can fix it.""</p><p>But New Mexico's education system was broken to begin with, Parr-Sanchez told me.</p><p>""Our current governor [Michelle Lujan Grisham] is showing impressive leadership, but our previous governor of eight years drove education into the ground,"" she said, referring to former Governor Susana Martinez, whose administration's response to the economic downturn during the Great Recession was to slash education spending, expand privately operated charter schools to compete for funding, and impose a punitive regime of evaluating teachers and schools based on high-stakes standardized testing.</p><p>Some of the heavy-handed evaluation systems Martinez championed have been repealed by Governor Lujan Grisham, but New Mexico still funds its schools less than it did in 2008.</p><p>Much of what Martinez imposed on New Mexico were pillars of education policy that started with No Child Left Behind legislation passed during the George W. Bush presidential administration and extended under the Barack Obama presidency.</p><p>""I loved being a teacher in the 1990s,"" Parr-Sanchez recalled, ""but since No Child Left Behind [which became law in 2002], all the joy was taken out of teaching. The test-and-punish program got us nowhere, and for the past 10 years, teachers have felt like they've been under assault.""</p><p>Despite these onerous policies, Parr-Sanchez saw the emergence of a different, more promising school model in her state.</p><p>""When I first learned of the community schools model, it hit me like a lightning bolt,"" she told me. ""I loved it because it focused on [the academic and non-academic needs of children], and the focus was on learning and a culturally relevant curriculum, not just test scores. The movement for community schools brought the joy of teaching back for me.""</p><p>Now, she is convinced the community schools model is the most promising way forward for schools as they reopen to the new realities of recovering from the fallout of COVID-19.</p><p>""In our state's response to the pandemic, we've had to be very sensitive to issues of poverty, and the state has challenged districts to reach all children, including special education students and homeless students,"" she explained. In this kind of emergency situation, she believes community schools have an advantage because ""the model enables you to look at the whole child."" (A whole child approach considers more than just students' academic outcomes to include attention to students' health, mental, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions that often have more impact on students' abilities to learn.)</p><p>""What happens during the school day is not enough to improve the trajectory of children until you deal with what is really going on in children's lives. Are they hungry? Are they homeless? The testing agenda took us away from addressing this. Community schools can bring us back.""</p><p>An Alternative to Testing and Privatization</p><p>In her praise for community schools, what Parr-Sanchez is referring to is an education approach that has taken hold in a number of school districts, from Albuquerque, to Florida, to New York City.</p><p>Some 5,000 community schools already exist nationwide, according to a 2018 count taken by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy shop in Washington, D.C. In New Mexico, a June 2019 memo to the state legislature from the state department of education listed 29 community schools, and others have taken up that approach since.</p><p>Community schools look different from state to state, and even different from school to school, but at the heart of the model is an emphasis on meeting the multiple needs of not only students but also the community. The basic idea is that schools should serve as hubs in the community and partner with local organizations that serve the many needs of families and students. Schools are the delivery source because that's where children and families are. Also, the school's curriculum should reflect the local culture and interests of the community, and the governance should be shared among the various stakeholders the school actually serves.</p><p>The movement has flown mostly under the radar, except in the most diligent education policy circles, but the idea was in the education platforms of leading 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>In its blueprint for reopening schools, the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest national teachers union, states, ""If experts deem it safe, summer may be a way to start planning a community school model."" And a review of school reopening plans conducted by NPR noted that since public schools have become the nation's default food distribution centers in an emergency, the community schools model may offer a viable strategy to add housing, mental health, health care, or other services ""on top of that.""</p><p>To many, the idea of saddling schools with even more responsibilities beyond academics seems an overreach, especially when schools, when they reopen, will be sorely challenged to create safe spaces for children and deliver even basic instruction in core academic subjects.</p><p>Parr-Sanchez disagrees. ""The current crisis is exposing the inequality not only in schools but in our society and making people more aware of the conditions of children,"" she told me. Community schools are designed to address that very issue, she maintained.</p><p>Indeed, the indisputable lessons the pandemic has taught the nation is that local schools are, like it or not, the nation's safety net for children and families, and that vast inequities in public education and society at large are blocking children's access to learningwhether it's being able to get internet service or having a home where children can do schoolwork.</p><p>We also learned that teacher-student relationships are at the center of the education process, and when those break down, learning breaks down too.</p><p>Because the community schools model emphasizes local needs and combining multiple services for students, Parr-Sanchez and others believe the model will get more attention as schools reopen. She credits the community school movement not only with changing her ""personal trajectory"" but also the trajectory of education in the state, and she believes it could change the trajectory in the nation as well. There is some evidence she may be right.</p><p>New Mexico's Troubled Schools</p><p>Education policy experts expect schools to struggle with addressing learning loss and social-emotional trauma caused by the coronavirus.</p><p>Experts warn that children returning to schools when they reopen will have multiple health and psychological needs, and families who have experienced unemployment and the effects of the economic downturn will be hard-pressed to provide the basic supports students need to be able to engage in school work. Further, school leaders are expecting severe budget cuts, and some are already firing and furloughing staff to prepare.</p><p>Yet in gauging whether a community schools model is a realistic reform effort to take on during such difficult times, it's hard to believe states will be as disadvantaged as New Mexico already was before the disease struck.</p><p>""We have super needy kids,"" Parr-Sanchez told me. ""In some of our poorest counties, particularly in the northwest region, as many as 40 percent of children have food insecurity, homes often have no running water, and many roads are unpaved. These counties are also hotspots of the coronavirus.""</p><p>In 2017, the state was tied with Louisiana for the second-highest poverty rate in the nation, 19.7 percent, according to World Population Review. Personal finance site WalletHub ranked New Mexico as the worst state in America to raise a family, based on a range of factors, including education and childcare, where the state ranked last, and socioeconomics, where it ranked 48.</p><p>In its most recent annual state-to-state comparison of overall child well-being, the Annie E. Casey Foundation rated New Mexico at the very bottom. The highly respected analysis was especially brutal in ranking New Mexico 50 in education due to the state's poor fourth-grade reading test scores (with only 25 percent of students rating ""proficient"") and high percentage of high school students who do not graduate within four years (29 percent).</p><p>The state also ranked bottom or near bottom on a number of other factors including health care, economic conditions, and household and community circumstances. New Mexico, along with Mississippi, has the most children living in high-poverty areas24 percent.</p><p>All these adverse conditions correlate to big problems for children's education attainment unless the government can come up with significant amounts of school funding to address complications caused by poverty and its related trauma. Yet New Mexico's school funding is both too little and poorly allocated.</p><p>In an April 2019 analysis of state-level school funding in the 2015-2016 school year, written by Bruce Baker, Mark Weber and Matthew Di Carlo for the Albert Shanker Institute, New Mexico ranked above average, 13, for its ""fiscal effort,"" a measure of the state's school spending as a percentage of the state's gross domestic product. But part of that above-average ranking is due to the fact the state's GDP severely lags most other states, ranking 38 according to Wikipedia. The state struggles in other funding measures, according to the analysis, ranking 44 for how it funds its highest-poverty districts, and it is in the bottom third for its ""progressivity""a measure of state and local revenue in higher-poverty districts compared to the lowest-poverty districts.</p><p>All of these factors have crippled academic achievement in New Mexico. The state's eighth-grade students' scores on the National Assessment of Education Progress, a periodic exam often referred to as the Nation's Report Card, have not seen any progress in their reading scores since 2002. In the most recent round of exams in 2019, reading scores declined modestly from where they were in 2002. Eighth-grade math scores on the exams seemed to be on an overall trend of slight improvement in the first decade of this century, but they have been generally dropping steadily since 2011.</p><p>But if the community schools model has proven to be a practical option in such tough circumstances as there are in New Mexico, it is certainly a viable option for schools facing adversity when they reopen in the new school year.</p><p>A Community School Takes on COVID-19</p><p>Parr-Sanchez first heard of the community schools model in 2013 when she was teaching at Picacho Middle School in Las Cruces. Her students were ""100 percent disadvantaged,"" she told me, and the model made immediate sense to her.</p><p>Median household income in the district is almost $5,000 less than that of the state, 42 percent of children live in single-parent families, more than a quarter of households lack broadband internet, and over 18 percent of public school parents are unemployed (even before the virus hit).</p><p>By 2016, a partnership that included the local teachers' union, which Parr-Sanchez represented, leaders of community and youth-focused nonprofit organizations, and representatives of the business sector had spearheaded a successful effort to get the district's first community schools program located at Lynn Middle School in 2017.</p><p>Progress happened quickly, according to a report by New Mexico in Depth. The article quoted Principal Toni Hull who said that by 2018, absentee rates at Lynn Community Middle School had dropped substantially, a new disciplinary code emphasizing conflict resolution instead of suspensions cut discipline incidents in half, and the school district's grade on the state report card rose from an F to a D.</p><p>By 2019, Lynn Community Middle School was providing, through its community schools initiative, a wide range of services to students and families, including an on-campus dental clinic, mental health services, a food bank, summer programs, horticulture classes, service learning projects, money management and nutritional education, a garden and cooking club, and a family center, which provides ""clothing, hygiene items, access to technology, [and] a healthy snack bar,"" according to Las Cruces Sun News.</p><p>Drawing from the success at Lynn, Las Cruces city officials and the school district worked together to expand the community schools program districtwide, according to local television station KTSM, starting with three more schools.</p><p>Among those schools was Doa Ana Elementary, which officially kicked off its community schools program in February 2020. Then the pandemic hit.</p><p>Doa Ana, a rural village about 10 miles outside of Las Cruces, already faced formidable educational challenges, Doa Ana Elementary principal Cherie Love explained to me in an email. Family food insecurity is widespread, the community lacks affordable housing, and the local economy is stagnant. ""Reliable transportation and money for gas is also a challenge for our families,"" Love said.</p><p>Prior to the opening of its community schools program, Doa Ana was already providing free breakfast, lunch, and a healthy snack to 100 percent of its students and a free dinner and snack to about 120 students enrolled in its extended learning (afterschool) programs. But the community school's effort enabled Doa Ana to respond rapidly once the disease broke out, Love said.</p><p>First, because Doa Ana had adopted the community schools model, it had in place the personnel to meet the multiple needs of a traumatized community.</p><p>""Our community schools coordinator worked our help desk to provide information to parents and channel their questions to the appropriate departments and people,"" Love told me. ""We provided mental health support to students and their families through our school counselor and our school special education psychologist.""</p><p>Through its community schools program, the school had already provided training for families on how to use an iPad or laptop computer. ""Many of the families who attended these classes have reported that they are now using this iPad to support their child's learning,"" Love said.</p><p>Also, because it followed the community schools model, Doa Ana had in place the partners it needed to bolster support for students and families. Among those partners is New Mexico State University, which provided school supply packs to more than 200 elementary students.</p><p>Another partner, local nonprofit NgageNew Mexico, provided parents a webinar in Spanish and English on ""Creating Effective Home Learning Environments.""</p><p>""In our village, families do not have access to a hospital, urgent care facility, library, and other services that families have when they live in a city,"" Maria Zuniga told me. Zuniga is the community schools coordinator at Doa Ana, a key staff person in facilitating all the communications among the school, district administration, partner organizations, and families. ""But now that we are a community school, we can work together to help our families have the same opportunities that families have in the city.""</p><p>""Doa Ana has an advantage because we have the resources of a community school and a community schools coordinator,"" third-grade teacher Henry Jasso told me. ""If our students, staff, or members of our local community need something, I know I can go to Mrs. Zuniga, and she will use her connections to get the help to answer questions and meet needs.

Elijah Cummings. Rick Scott dodged the question in an interview on Meet The Press[1], and Marco Rubio posted a Bible verse from the Gospel of Luke. Neither man called out the blabbering flamethrower in the White House.</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rick-scott-mtp.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rick-scott-mtp.jpg</url> Rick Scott gets a little twisted on Meet the Press. Early in the interview Sunday morning with host Chuck Todd, Scott said, 'Look, I think we've got to do everything we can to bring this country back together ' To which Todd replied, 'Why doesn't the president think that?' I'm not sure that's the right question to ask. Trump is not going to change.            <url normalizedValue=""http://www.flapartners.com/But"">http://www.flapartners.com/But</url> denigrating Cummings for his aggressive questioning[2] of acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan over conditions where migrant children are being held should have earned a rebuke from multiple high-profile Republican members of Congress. It would have had an impact. Surely, you remember the exchange. Cummings: 'You feel like you're doing a great job, right?' McAleenan: 'We're doing our level best in a very challenging situation.' Cummings: (voice rising to a shout) 'What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on, man. What's that about?'            <url normalizedValue=""http://www.americanaadvisors.com/Trump"">http://www.americanaadvisors.com/Trump</url>, as is his way, tried to change the narrative by attacking Cummings, tweeting that he is a 'brutal bully.' Scott tap-danced around the questions about Trump's tweetstorm with this exchange. Scott: 'Well, Chuck, let's look at what he said, all right, and why he did it. Congressman Cummings sat there and attacked our Border Patrol agents, all right? This is, this reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from Vietnam.' Todd: 'But that justifies a racial resentment tweet in response? Is that presidential leadership?' Scott: 'Well, look, I, I, look, I didn't do the tweets, Chuck. I can't talk about why he did what he did.' Scott stammered around long enough until he found a way to blame Cummings and Democrats. A basic sense of decency was not part of the equation. 'Rick Scott says he wasn't told about Russian election hacking in 2016[3]' via CBS Miami   Scott said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that the Department of Homeland Security never contacted him in 2016 about the infiltration. The Republican says he learned about most of the details this year. Current Gov. Ron DeSantis said in May that the hackers didn't manipulate any data and the election results weren't compromised. Scott made his comments when asked about a Senate report that said all states were targeted to varying degrees by Russian hackers. Scott said he hasn't yet read the report, though he was briefed on it. 'Scott compares border agents to Vietnam vets while defending Donald Trump tweets[4]' via Christina Cabrera of Talking Points Memo   Todd asked Scott if the tweets were good politics for the Republican Party. The Florida Senator pivoted to what prompted Trump to post the tweets: a House Oversight Committee hearing with acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, during which Cummings angrily confronted McAleenan over the filthy conditions under which Border Patrol agents are keeping migrant children. 'Let's look at what [Trump] said and why he did it,' Scott responded. 'This reminds me of what happened to soldiers coming back from Vietnam.' 'That justifies a racial resentment tweet in response?' Todd asked. 'Is that presidential leadership?' Scott stuttered for a few seconds before saying, 'Well look, I didn't do the tweets, Chuck.'   SITUATIONAL AWARENESS    @RepCummings: Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.  @Kriseman: Does Baltimore have challenges? All big cities have challenges. But it is certainly a better place to be than the America the President wants us to live in. Urban cities aren't perfect, but they are welcoming, diverse, vibrant serve as engines of innovation. They make us great.  @AsteadWesley: Incredible how the president openly sees a struggling American city as someone else's responsibility  @LeonydusJohnson: So, you can say that where we are as Americans is garbage, that America is racist, that half of the country are bigoted and deplorable Nazis, that we run concentration camps, that POTUS is a traitor, can even burn the flag But don't you dare talk about those rats in Baltimore  @BenShapiro: Trump's pajamas rage-tweeting is bad for the country. But pointing out that Baltimore is one of the worst-run cities in America, rife with crime and plagued by poor living conditions, isn't racist. It's evident to anyone with two eyes and a functioning prefrontal cortex.  @ChrisMurphyCT: I'm unfollowing the President of the United States today on Twitter, because his feed is the most hate-filled, racist, and demeaning of the 200+ I follow, and it regularly ruins my day to read it. So I'm just going to stop. I can't believe I just typed that.  @WesleyLowry: look, if you're a 25-year New York Times political columnist who pals around with the Speaker of the House you are, in fact, a 'decadent aristocrat.' If you don't have the self-awareness to know that, then I'm not sure what to tell you  @Conarck: Been in Miami for two hours and already feel ready to go on the record that those little motorized scooters are a very bad fit for this city  @RadioRicko: Just out of the Colorado mountains. Was enjoying roads in New Mexico without thousand-foot cliffs when some clown tried to pull into my lane before he finished passing. Barely avoided a high-speed collision. Of course, the clown car had Florida tags.

TOP STORY   'Judge sides with local governments on gun law[5]' via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida   A Leon County circuit judge struck down a state law that threatened tough penalties if city and county officials approve gun regulations. Florida since 1987 has barred cities and counties from passing regulations that are stricter than state firearms laws. But in 2011, lawmakers went further by approving a series of penalties that local governments and officials could face if they violated the prohibition. Local governments challenged the 2011 law after last year's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson, in a 15-page ruling, found the law unconstitutional on a series of grounds.   DATELINE: TALLY   'Officials send a $2,700 bill for public records about their May trip to Israel[6]' via Michael Moline of The Florida Phoenix   The state wants the Florida Phoenix to pay more than $2,700 before it turns over public records relating to a trip that Gov. DeSantis and nearly 100 people   including the state's elected Cabinet   took May 25-31 to Israel. An Enterprise Florida spokeswoman says that's the cost in staff time spent processing 16,288 pages of emails and attachments where DeSantis administration staffers mentioned the search terms 'Jerusalem' and 'mission' leading up to the trip. State officials have yet to release the full cost of sending the state officials overseas, where they met with a variety of Israeli officials, political donors, and held a Florida Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DeSantis-Israel.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DeSantis-Israel.jpg</url> Records are showing that Israel trip was a pretty pricey affair. Image via Twitter;; 'Ron DeSantis appoints new circuit, county judges[7]' via Florida Politics   DeSantis announced the appointments of Craig DeThomasis to the 8th Circuit Court, Jason Nimeth to the Lake County Court, Heather Doyle to the Manatee County Court, and Lori Ann Winstead to the Polk County Court. DeThomasis has been a partner at DeThomasis and Buchanan for 29 years. Nimeth is an Assistant State Attorney for the 5th Circuit State Attorney's Office. Doyle is the Chief Assistant State Attorney for the 12th Circuit State Attorney's Office. Winstead is an Assistant State Attorney for the 13th Circuit State Attorney's Office. Assignment editors   DeSantis will deliver remarks at the Space Coast Consortium Apprenticeship Signing Ceremony, 8:30 a.m., OneWeb Satellites Factory, 8301 NewSpace Drive, Merritt Island. 'Fees a sore subject as telehealth moves forward[8]' via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida   The Florida panel that regulates medical doctors will begin putting in place rules next week that is designed to make the state's new telehealth law a reality. But physicians who serve on the Florida Board of Medicine will have no say over one of the most contentious parts of the law: registration costs for out-of-state doctors who can use telehealth to begin caring for Florida residents. Lawmakers this spring passed a bill (HB 23) that creates a regulatory framework for telehealth, including authorizing the state to register doctors and collect fees. But a constitutional amendment required the Legislature to include the new fees in a separate piece of legislation (HB 7067). DeSantis, however, vetoed HB 7067. Assignment editors   Lawmakers will join Largo Police Chief Jeff Undestad at a news conference to discuss the Jordan Belliveau case   on what would have been Jordan's third birthday   and efforts to protect children from abuse in Florida's child welfare system, 10 a.m., Largo Police Department, 201 Highland Ave. Largo.            <url normalizedValue=""https://www.fahp.net/program-highlights"">https://www.fahp.net/program-highlights</url>   STATEWIDE   'Hurricane claims are to be paid in 90 days. Nine months after Michael, 21,000 pending[9].' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times   That's about 15 percent of all claims from the historic Category 5 storm, Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner David Altmaier told DeSantis and the Cabinet. Altmaier said afterward that the figure is 'discouraging.' By law, insurance companies are supposed to pay claims within 90 days of being filed, if the claims are not contested. After the meeting, Altmaier's office sent insurance companies another warning that they need to pay their claims on time. They sent another warning in December when 42,000 claims were still open. 'Insurers should redouble efforts to resolve all open claims, using whatever resources are necessary, to provide policyholders with the tools to rebuild their lives and property,' Thursday's letter states. 'Expert's complaint against Florida guardian Rebecca Fierle was ignored for years before scandal erupted[10]' via Monivette Cordeiro of the Orlando Sentinel   71-year-old Connie Rae Tibbetts tried to convince a mental health counselor that she could still take care of herself. 'I miss walking,' Tibbetts told Marci Elliott on May 6, 2016. 'I'm a person. I have a life.' Elliott was a member of Orange County's Guardianship Examining Committee, a group who determines whether someone is incapacitated, meaning they can't care for themselves or their property. Based on her evaluation and statements from Tibbetts' estranged children, Elliott determined Tibbetts needed to be under constant supervision, which cleared the way for Rebecca Fierle to become her court-appointed guardian. It was a decision Elliott would later regret   so much so that she resigned from the guardianship committee seven months after examining Tibbetts.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rebecca-Fierle-woman-accused-of-causing-death-resigns-as-professional-guardian-in-Florida.png"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rebecca-Fierle-woman-accused-of-causing-death-resigns-as-professional-guardian-in-Florida.png</url> Years of complaints about former professional guardian Rebecca Fierleas were ignored.

'Unequal treatment: Children's mental health dollars vary across state[11]' via Janine Zeitlin and Frank Gluck of the Fort Myers News-Press   The mental health care a child receives depends on their insurance, where they live, and if their parents can afford to pay out-of-pocket for more credentialed professionals and programs not covered by insurance. Roughly half of Florida children with depression, anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not receive treatment, according to research featured in JAMA Pediatrics in April. Affordability is one likely factor, said the study author. Medicaid covers most children without private insurance. State-managed funding supports non-traditional services or all services if a child does not have Medicaid or another way to pay for it. These ways of paying are flawed and mount barriers to care, especially in rural and poor communities. 5.6 billion opioid pills flooded the state, and rogue South Florida doctors helped get them on the streets[12]' via Aric Chokey and Skyler Swisher of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   While the data shows most pills went to chain pharmacies like Publix and Walgreens, individual doctors and physicians also ordered millions of doses to their offices. Pill mills found fertile ground in Florida, where doctors were once allowed to prescribe and dispense the opioids in the same place. Shady operators recruited unscrupulous doctors through places like Craigslist to pump out prescriptions. Some clinics raked in $50,000 a day passing out pills. During one raid, law enforcement found $4 million stashed in cardboard boxes in an attic. South Florida became the go-to place for out-of-state addicts and dealers, who road-tripped down interstates 75 and 95 in search of cash-only deals through pain clinics. 'Dave Aronberg applauds Florida ethics board for sanctions against 'sham' write-in candidates[13]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   The Florida Commission on Ethics has issued a new round of sanctions against so-called 'sham' write-in candidates for filing inaccurate financial forms. Palm Beach County State Attorney Aronberg and Constitution Revision Commission member Sherry Plymale filed the ethics complaints. The filings were a means of sanctioning candidates that Aronberg and Plymale argue had been recruited to shut out voters from what would otherwise be an open primary process. The commission issued $500 fines against William Kruse, a former candidate for Nassau County Commission, and Barbara Hulse Brooke, a former candidate for Walton County Commission. A $250 fine was levied against Jared Reddick, who ran for the Marion County Commission. 'Broward clerk of courts takes dispute over funding to Florida Supreme Court[14]' via Miami Herald   The Broward County clerk of courts wants Florida Supreme Court justices to take up a dispute about whether the state has unconstitutionally underfunded the clerk's office. Attorneys for Clerk Brenda Forman filed a notice this week that is a first step in asking the Supreme Court to decide the issue, according to documents posted Friday on the court's website An appeals court said the case focused on portions of filing fees that clerks are required to send to the state, with the Legislature then diverting part of the money to other purposes. 'Death row inmate seeks stay of execution[15]' via the News Service of Florida   With an execution scheduled Aug. 22, attorneys for Death Row inmate Gary Ray Bowles asked the Florida Supreme Court to grant a stay of execution and to order a hearing about whether Bowles is intellectually disabled. DeSantis last month signed a death warrant for Bowles, who was convicted of committing three murders, including a Jacksonville murder that sent him to Death Row. Bowles' attorneys are trying to establish that he is intellectually disabled and that, as a result, it would be unconstitutional to execute him. A Duval County circuit judge this month rejected the arguments, finding that they are 'time-barred' because the claims about intellectual disability were not filed earlier in Bowles' appeals.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bowles.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bowles.jpg</url> Gary Ray Bowles   also known as The I-95 Killer   is seeking a stay of execution.

MATTERS   'Supreme Court says Trump can proceed with plan to spend military funds for border wall construction[17]' via Robert Barnes of The Washington Post   A split Supreme Court said that the Trump administration could proceed with its plan to use $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds to build part of the president's wall project along the southern border. The court's conservatives set aside a lower-court ruling for the Sierra Club and a coalition of border communities that said reallocating Defense Department money would violate federal law. The unsigned ruling came in response to an emergency filing from the administration during the court's summer recess. The majority said the government 'made a sufficient showing at this stage' that private groups may not be the proper plaintiffs to challenge the transfer of money.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-border-wall.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-border-wall.jpg</url> One way or another, Donald Trump is going to get his wall. 'Senate intelligence report adds to confusion over Russian elections hacking in Florida[18]' via David Smiley and Alex Daugherty of the Miami Herald   The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a 67-page report that appears to include new information about efforts by Russian hackers to probe and target elections networks in Florida   including the FBI's suspicions in 2018 that four-county elections systems had been hacked rather than two. The report, which mentions that hackers may have carried out cyber reconnaissance missions across all 50 states, details attempts by the Russian intelligence GRU syndicate to probe elections systems in Illinois and 20 other unnamed states. It specifically discusses those efforts in Illinois and an unnamed 'State 2,' where details about meetings and cybersecurity efforts appear to mostly jibe with what's previously been disclosed about the election system hacking attempts in Florida.

HHS could ask Florida Medicaid for $436M refund   An inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services could soon ask Florida to refund the federal government $436 million in Medicaid funds improperly paid to the country's largest public hospital, according to a report by Rachana Pradhan of POLITICO. The independent auditor's report could be politically awkward for Florida Republicans closely allied with Trump. Florida officials warn the state and Jackson Memorial Hospital, which treats thousands of poor patients each year, could be devastated if the state is forced to pay back the money. Auditors found that Florida incorrectly claimed costs for certain care for undocumented immigrants and prisoners who received outpatient care, and the hospital omitted or underreported Medicare and Medicaid payments.

And it came just two weeks after Trump called out four minority congresswomen with a racist go-back-to-your-country taunt. The assault on Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, prompted immediate condemnations from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young and several other top Democrats. The outburst also undercut efforts by many Republicans over the past two weeks to defend Trump.

'FEC letter to Miami Beach candidate raises questions about 2018 campaign finances[27]' via Martin Vassolo of the Miami Herald   Until the last few months, Kristen Rosen Gonzalez had her political sights focused on just one job, her old Miami Beach commission seat. That changed in April   not long after she got a letter from the Federal Election Commission questioning how she had handled donations during a 2018 congressional race, she lost in the Democratic primary to Donna Shalala. The federal letter asked her to account for $43,550 that was supposed to be set aside for the general election that Rosen Gonzalez never reached.

'Margaret Good angling to repeat a well-timed bid[28]' via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune   House District 72 was held by Republicans for years, and Trump carried it by more than four percentage points. But the timing last year could not have been better for Good's underdog campaign. The seat became open because of former GOP Rep. Alex Miller's resignation, forcing a Feb 12 special election. That meant the District 72 race was the only one on the ballot in Florida and across much of the nation at a time when Democrats were eager to make a statement and build momentum to push back against Trump in the 2018 midterm. Now Good is running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, and she won't be the only race on the Florida ballot, not even close. But when it comes to competing for attention, her timing   once again may be pretty good.

The rainforests of southern Venezuela are rich in a precious metal coveted by bankers, jewelers and consumer-electronics firms around the world. As a result, the country's gold production is rising dramatically   and smuggling shipments of the metal, often through neighboring Colombia, into one of the world's largest markets for gold: Miami. Now, law enforcement agencies in both Colombia and the United States are working to uncover Venezuelan smuggling networks, according to sources with knowledge of the investigations.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maduro.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maduro.jpg</url> Paging Marco Rubio: Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro is being propped up by gold, much of it coming from Miami.

'Tax windfall from new construction enables county to meet sheriff's budget desires[33]' via Dave Berman of FLORIDA TODAY   When Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey began suggesting earlier this year that he needed a boost to his budget, a concern was that his request had the potential to lead to a tax hike. But an unexpected property tax windfall generated from new construction has enabled Brevard County Manager Frank Abbate to give the sheriff what he wanted while keeping property tax rates in check for the coming budget year.

Cost of living in Keys goes up as home size goes down[36]' via Gwen Filosa and David Goodhue of the Miami Herald   Living in the Florida Keys either means giving up space or getting squeezed out of town. Housing costs have soared for years. But Hurricane Irma in September 2017 has hit Monroe County even harder, reducing rentals in the Middle and Lower Keys. To stay in the Keys, more people have had to go small. Rents in Key West, which was spared the agony of Irma, simply rose to meet the demand and grew as they have since 2011, when a studio or room generally went for $850 a month. The same room or studio now rents for $1,300 to $1,600. In Key West and along the entire island chain, residents are learning to make do.

The Orlando metro area has only 13 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households, according to a recent report from the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

The mass migration crisis instigated by the Biden administration's misguided immigration policies has caused incalculable harm to American communities. The mass catch and release policies have led to the release of more than three million illegal migrants, damaged the integrity of our immigration system, and exposed Americans to new national security and public safety threats. So far, Biden's policies have cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the short term for shelter and support the illegal migrants. It is likely to cost hundreds of billions more over the long term, whether to support a population that is unlikely to ever be fully self-sufficient, or to deal with processing and repatriating the large numbers who are unlikely to ever qualify for a legal status. The expansion of illicit border-crossing opportunities has led to the abuse and exploitation of migrants on a mass scale, and also enriched the transnational criminal organizations, especially the Mexican cartels, to the point where these organizations represent a threat to civil society and the rule of law throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Biden Policies Set Off Flood of Illegal Migrants, Overwhelming Federal Agencies, Border Communities, and NGOs. When President Biden took office, he inherited the most secure land borders in U.S. history, with expanded and improved barriers, updated technology, and more personnel, all of which was backed up by policies that deterred migrants from crossing illegally and discouraged illegal aliens from remaining. As smuggling organizations and migrants became aware of the new policies, and as the processing and transportation networks were established within the country, the southern border was transformed into a chaotic, dangerous, and seemingly lawless frontier. It remains so today, except in the parts of Texas that have been secured by state authorities.</p><p>From the first day of his presidency, Joe Biden and his appointees began dismantling a laundry list of policies that had succeeded in controlling the years-long wave of illegal migrants hoping to take advantage of our dysfunctional asylum system and court rulings that require minors and those arriving with minors to be released into the country. He ended construction of the border wall system; terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols that sent tens of thousands of alleged asylum seekers to wait in Mexico; cancelled agreements with transit nations to offer safe haven to migrants and enforce their borders; relaxed application of Title 42 pandemic controls so that minors and families could enter; began awarding immigration parole to tens of thousands of illegal crossers, in defiance of the intent of Congress; extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to citizens of more nations and more recent arrivals; established strict limitations on interior enforcement to suppress deportations of all but the most egregious criminals; and launched plans for a new asylum system designed to expedite the legalization of illegal border crossers.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the number of illegal border crossers has exploded, in response to what the migrants call Biden's ""invitacion."" It was well understood around the globe that a large share of migrants who crossed the border illegally, especially those from certain countries, minors, and those bringing minors, would be apprehended by the Border Patrol, and would soon be released and transported to their destination in the United States, despite low expectations that they will comply with immigration proceedings or ever qualify to remain legally.</p><p>According to the latest CBP data, the Border Patrol apprehended 176,294 illegal migrants in January 2024, which was more than the prior January, but significantly less than the number caught in December 2023 (302,034), which had been the highest number ever apprehended in one month. So far this fiscal year (since October 1, 2023), 961,716 illegal migrants have been apprehended. By far the largest number were caught in Tucson Sector, with 50,583 apprehended so far, which is more than double the number apprehended in the next two busiest sectors (San Diego and Laredo). (See <url normalizedValue=""https://www.kxan.com/border-report/illegal-border-crossings-hit-new-january-record-sources-say/"">https://www.kxan.com/border-report/illegal-border-crossings-hit-new-january-record-sources-say/</url>.)</p><p>While apprehensions are a good metric for assessing the number of migrants who have attempted to enter illegally, the more important statistic is the number of migrants who were released into the country. According to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, more than 85 percent of these illegal migrants have been allowed to enter country - in defiance of federal laws stating that, with few exceptions, they should be held in custody for expedited due process and removal (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources"">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources</url>).</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has estimated that at least 3.3 million illegal aliens have been released into the country since President Biden took office. Only about 10,000 of those released have completed their immigration proceedings and been removed. (<url normalizedValue=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf"">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf</url>.)</p><p>Catch and Release Policies Impose Enormous Fiscal Costs. The cost to taxpayers of providing services to the illegal migrants President Biden has waved into the country has already run into the tens of billions of dollars, and promises to balloon even higher the longer the migrants remain the in country.</p><p>The short-term costs include expenditures for the migrants to be processed and transported to their destinations, and then for shelter, health care, schooling, criminal justice costs, and more. The federal government has spent several billion dollars in contracts and grants awarded by CBP, ICE, FEMA, and HHS. Many of these were outlined in a comprehensive report prepared by the House Committee on Homeland Security (<url normalizedValue=""https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase4Report.pdf"">https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase4Report.pdf</url>).</p><p>One indicator of the enormous cost at the federal level in the short term is the amount of money provided in the supplemental spending bill recently considered in the Senate. In addition to funding for the federal agencies dealing with the migrants, the bill included provisions for about $7 billion to be awarded to NGOs and state and local governments in grants and contracts to provide an array of services for the illegal migrants (about $7 billion to be awarded to NGOs and state and local governments in grants and contracts to provide an array of services for the illegal migrants (about $7 billion to be awarded to NGOs and state and local governments in grants and contracts to provide an array of services for the illegal migrants (</p><p>More taxpayer money is being spent at the state and local level:</p><p>* New York City has spent $12 billion to house more than 173,000 newly-arrived migrants since 2022. This is about six percent of the city's entire budget (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/nyc-faces-12-billion-price-tag-to-handle-migrant-crisis"">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/nyc-faces-12-billion-price-tag-to-handle-migrant-crisis</url>). One shelter, on Randall's Island, costs New York City taxpayer $20 million a month, or $10,000 per migrant (<url normalizedValue=""https://nypost.com"">https://nypost.com</url> 2023/08/13 randalls-island-mi...). State taxpayers will help with these costs; Governor Kathy Hochul's 2024 budget will include $2.4 billion to help the city, which is an increase of $500 million the state provided last year. (Migrant Costs Help Push New York State's Budget to $233 ...).</p><p>* California has awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to non-profits to house, feed and transport the new illegal migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2023/12/immigration-california-street-releases/"">https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2023/12/immigration-california-street-releases/</url>). In addition, the state legislature has voted to expand the state Medicaid program eligibility to cover all residents, regardless of immigration status.</p><p>* Massachusetts officials say the cost of their emergency shelter system for the homeless has run up to about $1 billion annually, and about half of the families are newly-arrived migrants. The legislature has approved only $250 million extra for this purpose this year, forcing the governor to tap a variety of one-time funding mechanisms, such as escrow funds and leftovers in certain accounts. In addition, school districts spent nearly $3 million in the 2022-23 school year to accommodate new migrant schoolchildren.

In addition, the state has spent more than $86 million to transport released migrants to other states to relieve pressure on its social services programs.

According to the report, each year Florida child welfare authorities take into custody about 400 of these unaccompanied minors who have run away from their sponsors. (Florida Grand Jury: Biden Putting Alien Children in Harm's Way (cis.org)).</p><p>* In Illinois, the city of Chicago has spent more than $156 million on shelter and other services to migrants since mid-2022. Nearly 14,000 migrants are staying in homeless shelters, and more than 500 others are living in police stations and O'Hare International Airport.

According to one account, the city has spent more than $42 million in the last year on housing and food, and the public schools have absorbed more than 3,000 new students, creating a budget shortfall of $17.5 million. In addition, a city hospital has provided at least $10 million of unreimbursed medical care to migrants. (Denver Is Furious That the Senate Can't Fix the Border - WSJ).</p><p>* Arizona governor Katie Hobbs sent the Biden administration a bill for over $500 million seeking reimbursement from the federal government for costs associated with the unsecure border. In addition, the state has allocated $2 million for a state and local border security law enforcement hub.

One hospital near the border in Yuma has calculated that it had provided $26 million in uncompensated medical care in 2022.

The immediate cost of providing shelter and services to the migrants released by the Biden administration is indeed staggering but, based on past experience, the long-term costs of supporting this population are likely to be even much greater if they remain in the United States.</p><p>While proponents of more immigration frequently assert that illegal immigrants are a net fiscal benefit to the United States, in fact there is ample evidence that illegal immigration is a net fiscal drain, because illegal immigrants on balance use more in government services than they pay in taxes. Illegal immigrants generally have high rates of workforce participation, but because they are on average significantly less educated than most U.S. workers, their incomes are much lower, they pay less in taxes, and they use more welfare programs on average than most U.S. workers (The Cost of Illegal Immigration to Taxpayers (cis.org)).</p><p>Our research has found that 59 percent of illegal immigrant households use welfare programs, compared with 52 percent of legal immigrant households, and 39 percent of native-born American citizen households. We estimate that the cost of these welfare payouts to illegal immigrant households is roughly $42 billion a year. At the local level, the largest single cost of illegal immigration is for public education. We estimate the cost of educating the children of illegal immigrants, most of whom are U.S.-born, to be about $69 billion per year.</p><p>My colleagues have looked at the net fiscal impact of individual illegal immigrants, not counting their U.S.-born children, and found that each illegal immigrant creates a lifetime net fiscal drain of $68,000 on average (taxes paid minus benefits received). If each of the 3.3 million illegal migrants released by the Biden administration were to remain in the United States, then the total long-term fiscal cost of the Biden catch and release policies would be $224.4 billion.</p><p>Besides traditional welfare programs, illegal aliens are able to access other types of benefits in certain states, including driver's licenses, in-state tuition and other subsidies for education and training, transportation vouchers, tax credits, disaster assistance, and more. Those who have been issued work permits under Biden catch and release programs will receive a Social Security Number (SSN) and usually can obtain a driver's license, which enables them to conceal their lack of legal immigration status. We estimate that about two million illegal aliens had been issued SSNs as of May 2021, and certainly hundreds of thousands more have obtained them since that time.</p><p>Some illegal aliens can take advantage of provisions in the U.S. tax code, such as child tax credits, or file tax returns claiming refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit. These tax returns may be filed by illegal aliens with a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). My colleagues have estimated that illegal aliens have collected between $3.8 and $4.5 billion using these programs over the years (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Report/Estimating-Illegal-Immigrant-Receipt-Cash-Payments-EITC-and-ACTC"">https://cis.org/Report/Estimating-Illegal-Immigrant-Receipt-Cash-Payments-EITC-and-ACTC</url>).</p><p>In addition, millions of illegal aliens obtain stolen or purchased identities of American citizens, and use those identities to fraudulently obtain driver's licenses, employment, welfare benefits, credit cards, mortgages, bank loans, and more. (See <url normalizedValue=""https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2022/06/29/willful_blindness_feds_ignore_massive_illegal_alien_id_theft_plaguing_americans_as_us_coffers_fill_839815.html"">https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2022/06/29/willful_blindness_feds_ignore_massive_illegal_alien_id_theft_plaguing_americans_as_us_coffers_fill_839815.html</url>). In one case in Massachusetts, 22 illegal aliens were charged with using stolen U.S. citizen identities to obtain about $250,000 in government benefits (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/25-charged-federal-document-and-benefit-fraud-sweep"">https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/25-charged-federal-document-and-benefit-fraud-sweep</url>). Besides stealing the identities of Americans, document fraud rings also sell SSNs that have not yet been issued. Then, years later, when the number is eventually issued to a child, the identity is already compromised (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Mortensen/Rewarding-Illegal-Alien-Identity-Thieves-Sacrificing-Innocent-American-Children"">https://cis.org/Mortensen/Rewarding-Illegal-Alien-Identity-Thieves-Sacrificing-Innocent-American-Children</url>). Stolen identities also are frequently used by illegal alien criminals, particularly drug traffickers, to conceal their true identity and lack of immigration status, and to obtain a driver's license that enables them to fly under the radar of law enforcement agencies (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Has-Imposter-Stolen-Your-Identity"">https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Has-Imposter-Stolen-Your-Identity</url>).</p><p>Catch and Release Policies Undermine Public Safety. Besides the tangible fiscal costs, the Biden catch and release policies at the border also have created new public safety problems, with a human cost that is incalculable. Proponents of mass immigration often claim (without evidence) that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than Americans, and therefore concerns about crimes committed by illegal immigrants are exaggerated, misplaced, or motivated by racial animus. These assertions are unproven, usually based on faulty interpretations of crime or Census data, and defy common sense and experience. They are profoundly demeaning to the victims of crimes committed by released illegal migrants who by law should have been detained and removed to their home country after apprehension. These are victimizations that are directly attributable to the Biden border catch and release policies.</p><p>For example, in January ICE officers in Boston arrested Pierre Lucard Emile, an illegal alien from Haiti, who had been arrested months before by local police on charges of rape and indecent assault and battery on a developmentally disabled person. (Under the state sanctuary decree, the local authorities released the man even though ICE had issued a detainer.) Emile had crossed the border illegally near Brownsville, Texas in December, 2022, and under Biden policies was released with a notice to appear for immigration proceedings. Less than a year later, he was arrested for the rape. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-boston-arrests-haitian-citizen-charged-rape-indecent-assault"">https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-boston-arrests-haitian-citizen-charged-rape-indecent-assault</url>).</p><p>Millions have seen the video of a shocking attack on police officers in Times Square by a group of migrants in New York City, most of whom have thus far escaped authorities (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-square-attack-yet-arrested"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-square-attack-yet-arrested</url>). In another disturbing case, New York City authorities recently arrested eight members of a ring of Venezuelan illegal migrants who were living in the city's shelters, and who are accused of stealing scooters to cruise through city streets and snatch phones and handbags, sometimes violently. The phones were then hacked to gain access to financial information, and the victim's back accounts were drained. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-masterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-masterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas</url>).</p><p>Reportedly, the suspects are associated with the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Gang members and hundreds of other criminals are believed to have escaped through tunnels from a Venezuela prison last year, and dozens have been arrested after illegally crossing our southern border. There is no way to know how many may have been caught and released, because immigration agents have no way to access records in Venezuela, and no diplomatic or law enforcement relationships to assist in the vetting of these migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agent-others-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/"">https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agent-others-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/</url>).</p><p>Migrants arriving at the border now receive only the most cursory screening before they are released into the country, which includes a fingerprint check of U.S. security, criminal justice, and immigration databases, a brief interview, and little other screening. Border officials generally cannot access criminal records in other countries, or do extensive background checks. Even worse, since the number of illegal crossings has reached crisis levels, border officials have sometimes been too overwhelmed to read and act on the results of security checks that indicate that an alien they have apprehended might be a threat. In at least three cases that we know of, a Lebanese-born Venezuelan citizen, a Colombian, and a Pakistani, border patrol agents released men who were watchlisted as known or suspected terrorists (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-Venezuela-Despite-FBI-Recommendation"">https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-Venezuela-Despite-FBI-Recommendation</url>, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG-23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf"">https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG-23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf</url>, EXCLUSIVE: Pakistani Illegal Immigrant On Terror Watchlist Given Free Day Of Release In US | The Daily Caller).</p><p>Cartels Are Thriving and Expanding Into the United States. Thanks to unprecedented opportunities to move people and drugs across our border, the Mexican cartels and other transnational criminal organizations are reaping unprecedented profits, to the tune of $30 million a day, or nearly $1 Billion a month, according to a House Budget Committee report. They use the funds to acquire more sophisticated weapons and technology to solidify control over their territories in Mexico and beyond. More worrisome for the long term, however, is the way the cartels are using this cash cow to underwrite an expansion of their operations within the United States. This expansion presents profound implications for public safety that will persist for years into the future.</p><p>According to Border Patrol testimony to Congress, the smuggling fee is currently about $8,000 for passage to America. Many migrants make only a down payment up front of about $500, and agree to work off the rest when they get to their destination. The remainder is typically paid through debt bondage accomplished by wage garnishment, fees for housing and food, and other forms of exploitation and outright threats and extortion. Long-haul migrants from other continents pay more, sometimes up to $50,000. It is Biden's catch and release policy that entices these migrants to put themselves into the hands of a criminal organization, risking their own safety to journey here, and then being subject to exploitation, abuse and trafficking for labor and other purposes.</p><p>The cartels are not humanitarian actors seeking to help asylum seekers; nor are they young, impetuous gang-bangers. They behave like terrorists, and they have a plan, for which they hire well-trained and well-armed violent thugs to carry out. The porous border and catch and release policies have made it easy to move their operatives into this country as well.</p><p>While many American observers believe downplay the threat from the cartels, believing that narco-bosses are too afraid of U.S. law enforcement agencies to try to use extremely violent tactics here, that theory is naive, and has been discredited by events. Among the acts of violence attributed to the cartels was an incident in January 2023 described by authorities as an ""early morning massacre,"" where six people, including a recently bailed-out Surenos member, but also a baby and his teenage mother, were executed in a quiet residential street in Goshen, Calif. Reportedly, the surviving family members afterwards refused all offers of help from local authorities [California sheriff rips border crisis as details emerge on massacre of 6 (nypost.com)].</p><p>In 2022 federal authorities alone made more than 300 arrests for Mexican cartel-related crimes, according to one analysis [Map: Tracking drug cartel arrests across the United States (newsnationnow.com)]. The cartels are sophisticated businesses, and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Noticing the trend in some jurisdictions away from imposing stiff consequences for shoplifting and burglary, some cartels have branched out into the $70 billion organized retail theft industry, creating squads of operatives to steal goods on a major scale, even roping in recent illegal migrants as a way to pay off their smuggling debt, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators [HSI, ACAMS take aim at organized retail crime | ICE].</p><p>The Sinaloa and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) cartels have capitalized on the legalization of marijuana in some states, opening tens of thousands of illegal weed, or ""blood cannabis"" grows in northern California, Oregon and other states, where they undercut lawful growers and use trafficked labor, managed violently. ['Narco slaves': Migrant workers face abuse on Oregon's cartel-run, illegal pot farms - ABC News and Cartel-backed pot grows linked to California, Oregon human trafficking (usatoday.com)]. Local sheriffs lament that they are woefully out-manned and out-gunned, and can't keep up with the body count. ""We're a very short amount of time away from having heads in the square like they do down in Mexico,"" said Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall in December 2021.</p><p>According to a federal law enforcement memo leaked to the Daily Caller [EXCLUSIVE: Illegal Chinese Marijuana Grow Operations Are Taking Over Blue State, Leaked Memo Says | The Daily Caller], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal ], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal ], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal ], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal ], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal</p><p>This business model requires creating a ""safe"" environment in which to operate. The cartels often create their safe space through violence, extortion, and even corruption of public officials. In Texas, large swaths of two counties have been literally taken over with what may be the largest settlement of illegal migrants in the country (Texas Massacre Happened in America's Largest Illegal Immigrant ""Colonia"" -- and Major U.S. Media Won't Say So (cis.org)), in Liberty County, a two-hour drive east of Austin, the state capital. The Gulf and Sinaloa cartels originally established enclaves in this area for stash houses for smuggled drugs and aliens. Now, with the help of unscrupulous real estate developers, political patrons, and the open border policies, this area is a massive and nearly unpoliced-able haven for the cartels, their employees, and their trafficked clients that has driven out most long-time American residents and spawned crime and violence on a third world scale.</p><p>Implementing Catch and Release Has Undermined Our Legal Immigration System. The Biden catch and release policies are best understood as an end run around the current immigration law. Biden and his top officials believe that many more immigrants should be admitted and, for the most part, those who make it here, even illegally, should be allowed to stay. It's clear that these changes would not be approved by Congress, so he has used executive action to accomplish them - either by ignoring provisions in the law that he disagrees with, such as the requirement to detain those caught crossing the border illegally and to detain and remove certain criminal aliens, by exploiting loopholes in the law, such as the parole authority, or by crafting new interpretations of the law, such as the criteria for asylum. These policies have been continued for three long years, clearly demonstrating an intentional abuse of authority, not incompetence, that has done great damage to our immigration system.</p><p>Most importantly, the widespread understanding that nearly all who make it into the United States will be promptly released if encountered by border agents and allowed to settle in the destination of their choice, receive shelter and support from government contractors, state and local governments, and NGOs, have the opportunity to apply for a work permit or work illegally, and face little threat of being sent home even if they skip out on immigration hearings is an irresistible incentive to enlist a criminal smuggling organization to try to come illegally, despite all that is known about the risks of the journey. These loose policies actually guarantee that illegal immigration will continue on a huge scale, and continue to stress our communities.</p><p>Catch and release of illegal migrants on the massive scale that we have seen under Biden policies has overwhelmed every part of our immigration system. Both the Border Patrol and legal ports of entry are inundated every day in nearly every sector, including the northern border, which has seen triple-digit increases in illegal entries. Releasing illegal migrants instead of promptly removing them has swamped ICE's dockets and the already-dysfunctional immigration courts. As of the end of FY2023, there were 6.2 million cases on ICE's non-detained docket, of whom more than 617,000 have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.

Meanwhile, fees are rising due in large part to the burden on the agency of processing hundreds of thousands of asylum and deferred action applications at no charge, and similar numbers of work permits.</p><p>This situation is not sustainable. Americans and legal immigrants are losing faith in our immigration system, and increasingly viewing immigration as a burden more than a benefit to our nation. Congress will have to act to restore its authority over immigration and restore the integrity of the system. The first step has to be clarifying that illegal immigration must not be ignored or facilitated, and that illegal migrants - whether single adults, families or unaccompanied minors -- will not be rewarded with the ability to reside indefinitely in the United States. This requires more barriers on the land border, turning back or detaining and removing most illegal crossers and visa overstayers, using accelerated forms of due process, raising the bar for asylum claims, cracking down on illegal hiring, denying welfare benefits and transmission of remittances for illegal aliens, enlisting the support of state and local authorities in immigration enforcement, and penalizing sanctuary policies. In the short term, Congress should use its spending authorities to cut off funding of programs that support the Biden catch and release policies, especially funds for transportation, shelter and services for new arrivals, and stipulate more funding for enforcement of immigration law.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=""http://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20240215/116859/HHRG-118-GO06-Wstate-VaughanJ-20240215.pdf"">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20240215/116859/HHRG-118-GO06-Wstate-VaughanJ-20240215.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">CODUPB-COSHC215415N9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">CO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:6BBP-2RR1-JCCP-0116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""5029""/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=""15"" month=""02"" year=""2024""><dateText>February 15, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, involving a hearing on Feb. 15, 2024, entitled ""The Consequences of Catch and Release at the Border"":</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">* * *</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Grothman and Mr. Garcia, for the opportunity to testify today. The mass migration crisis instigated by the Biden administration's misguided immigration policies has caused incalculable harm to American communities. The mass catch and release policies have led to the release of more than three million illegal migrants, damaged the integrity of our immigration system, and exposed Americans to new national security and public safety threats. So far, Biden's policies have cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the short term for shelter and support the illegal migrants. It is likely to cost hundreds of billions more over the long term, whether to support a population that is unlikely to ever be fully self-sufficient, or to deal with processing and repatriating the large numbers who are unlikely to ever qualify for a legal status. The expansion of illicit border-crossing opportunities has led to the abuse and exploitation of migrants on a mass scale, and also enriched the transnational criminal organizations, especially the Mexican cartels, to the point where these organizations represent a threat to civil society and the rule of law throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Biden Policies Set Off Flood of Illegal Migrants, Overwhelming Federal Agencies, Border Communities, and NGOs. When President Biden took office, he inherited the most secure land borders in U.S. history, with expanded and improved barriers, updated technology, and more personnel, all of which was backed up by policies that deterred migrants from crossing illegally and discouraged illegal aliens from remaining. As smuggling organizations and migrants became aware of the new policies, and as the processing and transportation networks were established within the country, the southern border was transformed into a chaotic, dangerous, and seemingly lawless frontier. It remains so today, except in the parts of Texas that have been secured by state authorities.</p><p>From the first day of his presidency, Joe Biden and his appointees began dismantling a laundry list of policies that had succeeded in controlling the years-long wave of illegal migrants hoping to take advantage of our dysfunctional asylum system and court rulings that require minors and those arriving with minors to be released into the country. He ended construction of the border wall system; terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols that sent tens of thousands of alleged asylum seekers to wait in Mexico; cancelled agreements with transit nations to offer safe haven to migrants and enforce their borders; relaxed application of Title 42 pandemic controls so that minors and families could enter; began awarding immigration parole to tens of thousands of illegal crossers, in defiance of the intent of Congress; extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to citizens of more nations and more recent arrivals; established strict limitations on interior enforcement to suppress deportations of all but the most egregious criminals; and launched plans for a new asylum system designed to expedite the legalization of illegal border crossers.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the number of illegal border crossers has exploded, in response to what the migrants call Biden's ""invitacion."" It was well understood around the globe that a large share of migrants who crossed the border illegally, especially those from certain countries, minors, and those bringing minors, would be apprehended by the Border Patrol, and would soon be released and transported to their destination in the United States, despite low expectations that they will comply with immigration proceedings or ever qualify to remain legally.</p><p>According to the latest CBP data, the Border Patrol apprehended 176,294 illegal migrants in January 2024, which was more than the prior January, but significantly less than the number caught in December 2023 (302,034), which had been the highest number ever apprehended in one month. So far this fiscal year (since October 1, 2023), 961,716 illegal migrants have been apprehended. By far the largest number were caught in Tucson Sector, with 50,583 apprehended so far, which is more than double the number apprehended in the next two busiest sectors (San Diego and Laredo). (See <url normalizedValue=""https://www.kxan.com/border-report/illegal-border-crossings-hit-new-january-record-sources-say/"">https://www.kxan.com/border-report/illegal-border-crossings-hit-new-january-record-sources-say/</url>.) While apprehensions are a good metric for assessing the number of migrants who have attempted to enter illegally, the more important statistic is the number of migrants who were released into the country. According to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, more than 85 percent of these illegal migrants have been allowed to enter country - in defiance of federal laws stating that, with few exceptions, they should be held in custody for expedited due process and removal (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources"">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrants-released-into-us-sources</url>).</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has estimated that at least 3.3 million illegal aliens have been released into the country since President Biden took office. Only about 10,000 of those released have completed their immigration proceedings and been removed. (<url normalizedValue=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf"">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf</url>.) Catch and Release Policies Impose Enormous Fiscal Costs. The cost to taxpayers of providing services to the illegal migrants President Biden has waved into the country has already run into the tens of billions of dollars, and promises to balloon even higher the longer the migrants remain the in country.</p><p>The short-term costs include expenditures for the migrants to be processed and transported to their destinations, and then for shelter, health care, schooling, criminal justice costs, and more. The federal government has spent several billion dollars in contracts and grants awarded by CBP, ICE, FEMA, and HHS. Many of these were outlined in a comprehensive report prepared by the House Committee on Homeland Security (<url normalizedValue=""https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase4Report.pdf"">https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase4Report.pdf</url>).</p><p>One indicator of the enormous cost at the federal level in the short term is the amount of money provided in the supplemental spending bill recently considered in the Senate. In addition to funding for the federal agencies dealing with the migrants, the bill included provisions for about $7 billion to be awarded to NGOs and state and local governments in grants and contracts to provide an array of services for the illegal migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Vaughan/Border-Bill-Dead-Its-Spending-Provisions-May-Resurface"">https://cis.org/Vaughan/Border-Bill-Dead-Its-Spending-Provisions-May-Resurface</url>).</p><p>More taxpayer money is being spent at the state and local level:</p><p>* New York City has spent $12 billion to house more than 173,000 newly-arrived migrants since 2022. This is about six percent of the city's entire budget (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/nyc-faces-12-billion-price-tag-to-handle-migrant-crisis"">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/nyc-faces-12-billion-price-tag-to-handle-migrant-crisis</url>). One shelter, on Randall's Island, costs New York City taxpayer $20 million a month, or $10,000 per migrant (<url normalizedValue=""https://nypost.com"">https://nypost.com</url> ' 2023/08/13 ' randalls-island-mi...). State taxpayers will help with these costs; Governor Kathy Hochul's 2024 budget will include $2.4 billion to help the city, which is an increase of $500 million the state provided last year. (Migrant Costs Help Push New York State's Budget to $233 ...).</p><p>* California has awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to non-profits to house, feed and transport the new illegal migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2023/12/immigration-california-street-releases/"">https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2023/12/immigration-california-street-releases/</url>). In addition, the state legislature has voted to expand the state Medicaid program eligibility to cover all residents, regardless of immigration status.</p><p>* Massachusetts officials say the cost of their emergency shelter system for the homeless has run up to about $1 billion annually, and about half of the families are newly-arrived migrants. The legislature has approved only $250 million extra for this purpose this year, forcing the governor to tap a variety of one-time funding mechanisms, such as escrow funds and leftovers in certain accounts. In addition, school districts spent nearly $3 million in the 2022-23 school year to accommodate new migrant schoolchildren. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-2-year-emergency-shelter-tab-may-approach-2b/3223799/"">https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-2-year-emergency-shelter-tab-may-approach-2b/3223799/</url>).</p><p>* Texas has spent about $10 billion on Operation Lone Star in an effort to stem the tide of illegal migration, drug trafficking, and other criminal activity along its share of the border since the Biden policies have been in place. In addition, the state has spent more than $86 million to transport released migrants to other states to relieve pressure on its social services programs.

According to the report, each year Florida child welfare authorities take into custody about 400 of these unaccompanied minors who have run away from their sponsors. (Florida Grand Jury: Biden Putting Alien Children in Harm's Way (cis.org)).</p><p>* In Illinois, the city of Chicago has spent more than $156 million on shelter and other services to migrants since mid-2022. Nearly 14,000 migrants are staying in homeless shelters, and more than 500 others are living in police stations and O'Hare International Airport.

According to one account, the city has spent more than $42 million in the last year on housing and food, and the public schools have absorbed more than 3,000 new students, creating a budget shortfall of $17.5 million. In addition, a city hospital has provided at least $10 million of unreimbursed medical care to migrants. (Denver Is Furious That the Senate Can't Fix the Border - WSJ).</p><p>* Arizona governor Katie Hobbs sent the Biden administration a bill for over $500 million seeking reimbursement from the federal government for costs associated with the unsecure border. In addition, the state has allocated $2 million for a state and local border security law enforcement hub.

One hospital near the border in Yuma has calculated that it had provided $26 million in uncompensated medical care in 2022.

The immediate cost of providing shelter and services to the migrants released by the Biden administration is indeed staggering but, based on past experience, the long-term costs of supporting this population are likely to be even much greater if they remain in the United States.</p><p>While proponents of more immigration frequently assert that illegal immigrants are a net fiscal benefit to the United States, in fact there is ample evidence that illegal immigration is a net fiscal drain, because illegal immigrants on balance use more in government services than they pay in taxes. Illegal immigrants generally have high rates of workforce participation, but because they are on average significantly less educated than most U.S. workers, their incomes are much lower, they pay less in taxes, and they use more welfare programs on average than most U.S. workers (The Cost of Illegal Immigration to Taxpayers (cis.org)).</p><p>Our research has found that 59 percent of illegal immigrant households use welfare programs, compared with 52 percent of legal immigrant households, and 39 percent of native-born American citizen households. We estimate that the cost of these welfare payouts to illegal immigrant households is roughly $42 billion a year. At the local level, the largest single cost of illegal immigration is for public education. We estimate the cost of educating the children of illegal immigrants, most of whom are U.S.-born, to be about $69 billion per year.</p><p>My colleagues have looked at the net fiscal impact of individual illegal immigrants, not counting their U.S.-born children, and found that each illegal immigrant creates a lifetime net fiscal drain of $68,000 on average (taxes paid minus benefits received). If each of the 3.3 million illegal migrants released by the Biden administration were to remain in the United States, then the total long-term fiscal cost of the Biden catch and release policies would be $224.4 billion.</p><p>Besides traditional welfare programs, illegal aliens are able to access other types of benefits in certain states, including driver's licenses, in-state tuition and other subsidies for education and training, transportation vouchers, tax credits, disaster assistance, and more. Those who have been issued work permits under Biden catch and release programs will receive a Social Security Number (SSN) and usually can obtain a driver's license, which enables them to conceal their lack of legal immigration status. We estimate that about two million illegal aliens had been issued SSNs as of May 2021, and certainly hundreds of thousands more have obtained them since that time.</p><p>Some illegal aliens can take advantage of provisions in the U.S. tax code, such as child tax credits, or file tax returns claiming refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit. These tax returns may be filed by illegal aliens with a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). My colleagues have estimated that illegal aliens have collected between $3.8 and $4.5 billion using these programs over the years (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Report/Estimating-Illegal-Immigrant-Receipt-Cash-Payments-EITC-and-ACTC"">https://cis.org/Report/Estimating-Illegal-Immigrant-Receipt-Cash-Payments-EITC-and-ACTC</url>).</p><p>In addition, millions of illegal aliens obtain stolen or purchased identities of American citizens, and use those identities to fraudulently obtain driver's licenses, employment, welfare benefits, credit cards, mortgages, bank loans, and more. (See <url normalizedValue=""https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2022/06/29/willful_blindness_feds_ignore_massive_illegal_alien_id_theft_plaguing_americans_as_us_coffers_fill_839815.html"">https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2022/06/29/willful_blindness_feds_ignore_massive_illegal_alien_id_theft_plaguing_americans_as_us_coffers_fill_839815.html</url>). In one case in Massachusetts, 22 illegal aliens were charged with using stolen U.S. citizen identities to obtain about $250,000 in government benefits (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/25-charged-federal-document-and-benefit-fraud-sweep"">https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/25-charged-federal-document-and-benefit-fraud-sweep</url>). Besides stealing the identities of Americans, document fraud rings also sell SSNs that have not yet been issued. Then, years later, when the number is eventually issued to a child, the identity is already compromised (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Mortensen/Rewarding-Illegal-Alien-Identity-Thieves-Sacrificing-Innocent-American-Children"">https://cis.org/Mortensen/Rewarding-Illegal-Alien-Identity-Thieves-Sacrificing-Innocent-American-Children</url>). Stolen identities also are frequently used by illegal alien criminals, particularly drug traffickers, to conceal their true identity and lack of immigration status, and to obtain a driver's license that enables them to fly under the radar of law enforcement agencies (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Has-Imposter-Stolen-Your-Identity"">https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Has-Imposter-Stolen-Your-Identity</url>).</p><p>Catch and Release Policies Undermine Public Safety. Besides the tangible fiscal costs, the Biden catch and release policies at the border also have created new public safety problems, with a human cost that is incalculable. Proponents of mass immigration often claim (without evidence) that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than Americans, and therefore concerns about crimes committed by illegal immigrants are exaggerated, misplaced, or motivated by racial animus. These assertions are unproven, usually based on faulty interpretations of crime or Census data, and defy common sense and experience. They are profoundly demeaning to the victims of crimes committed by released illegal migrants who by law should have been detained and removed to their home country after apprehension. These are victimizations that are directly attributable to the Biden border catch and release policies.</p><p>For example, in January ICE officers in Boston arrested Pierre Lucard Emile, an illegal alien from Haiti, who had been arrested months before by local police on charges of rape and indecent assault and battery on a developmentally disabled person. (Under the state sanctuary decree, the local authorities released the man even though ICE had issued a detainer.) Emile had crossed the border illegally near Brownsville, Texas in December, 2022, and under Biden policies was released with a notice to appear for immigration proceedings. Less than a year later, he was arrested for the rape. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-boston-arrests-haitian-citizen-charged-rape-indecent-assault"">https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-boston-arrests-haitian-citizen-charged-rape-indecent-assault</url>).</p><p>Millions have seen the video of a shocking attack on police officers in Times Square by a group of migrants in New York City, most of whom have thus far escaped authorities (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-square-attack-yet-arrested"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-square-attack-yet-arrested</url>). In another disturbing case, New York City authorities recently arrested eight members of a ring of Venezuelan illegal migrants who were living in the city's shelters, and who are accused of stealing scooters to cruise through city streets and snatch phones and handbags, sometimes violently. The phones were then hacked to gain access to financial information, and the victim's back accounts were drained. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-masterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-masterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas</url>).</p><p>Reportedly, the suspects are associated with the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Gang members and hundreds of other criminals are believed to have escaped through tunnels from a Venezuela prison last year, and dozens have been arrested after illegally crossing our southern border. There is no way to know how many may have been caught and released, because immigration agents have no way to access records in Venezuela, and no diplomatic or law enforcement relationships to assist in the vetting of these migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agent-others-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/"">https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agent-others-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/</url>).</p><p>Migrants arriving at the border now receive only the most cursory screening before they are released into the country, which includes a fingerprint check of U.S. security, criminal justice, and immigration databases, a brief interview, and little other screening. Border officials generally cannot access criminal records in other countries, or do extensive background checks. Even worse, since the number of illegal crossings has reached crisis levels, border officials have sometimes been too overwhelmed to read and act on the results of security checks that indicate that an alien they have apprehended might be a threat. In at least three cases that we know of, a Lebanese-born Venezuelan citizen, a Colombian, and a Pakistani, border patrol agents released men who were watchlisted as known or suspected terrorists (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-Venezuela-Despite-FBI-Recommendation"">https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-Venezuela-Despite-FBI-Recommendation</url>, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG-23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf"">https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG-23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf</url>, EXCLUSIVE: Pakistani Illegal Immigrant On Terror Watchlist Given Free Day Of Release In US | The Daily Caller).</p><p>Cartels Are Thriving and Expanding Into the United States. Thanks to unprecedented opportunities to move people and drugs across our border, the Mexican cartels and other transnational criminal organizations are reaping unprecedented profits, to the tune of $30 million a day, or nearly $1 Billion a month, according to a House Budget Committee report. They use the funds to acquire more sophisticated weapons and technology to solidify control over their territories in Mexico and beyond. More worrisome for the long term, however, is the way the cartels are using this cash cow to underwrite an expansion of their operations within the United States. This expansion presents profound implications for public safety that will persist for years into the future.</p><p>According to Border Patrol testimony to Congress, the smuggling fee is currently about $8,000 for passage to America. Many migrants make only a down payment up front of about $500, and agree to work off the rest when they get to their destination. The remainder is typically paid through debt bondage accomplished by wage garnishment, fees for housing and food, and other forms of exploitation and outright threats and extortion. Long-haul migrants from other continents pay more, sometimes up to $50,000. It is Biden's catch and release policy that entices these migrants to put themselves into the hands of a criminal organization, risking their own safety to journey here, and then being subject to exploitation, abuse and trafficking for labor and other purposes.</p><p>The cartels are not humanitarian actors seeking to help asylum seekers; nor are they young, impetuous gang-bangers. They behave like terrorists, and they have a plan, for which they hire well-trained and well-armed violent thugs to carry out. The porous border and catch and release policies have made it easy to move their operatives into this country as well.</p><p>While many American observers believe downplay the threat from the cartels, believing that narco-bosses are too afraid of U.S. law enforcement agencies to try to use extremely violent tactics here, that theory is naive, and has been discredited by events. Among the acts of violence attributed to the cartels was an incident in January 2023 described by authorities as an ""early morning massacre,"" where six people, including a recently bailed-out Surenos member, but also a baby and his teenage mother, were executed in a quiet residential street in Goshen, Calif. Reportedly, the surviving family members afterwards refused all offers of help from local authorities [California sheriff rips border crisis as details emerge on massacre of 6 (nypost.com)].</p><p>In 2022 federal authorities alone made more than 300 arrests for Mexican cartel-related crimes, according to one analysis [Map: Tracking drug cartel arrests across the United States (newsnationnow.com)]. The cartels are sophisticated businesses, and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Noticing the trend in some jurisdictions away from imposing stiff consequences for shoplifting and burglary, some cartels have branched out into the $70 billion organized retail theft industry, creating squads of operatives to steal goods on a major scale, even roping in recent illegal migrants as a way to pay off their smuggling debt, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators [HSI, ACAMS take aim at organized retail crime | ICE].</p><p>The Sinaloa and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) cartels have capitalized on the legalization of marijuana in some states, opening tens of thousands of illegal weed, or ""blood cannabis"" grows in northern California, Oregon and other states, where they undercut lawful growers and use trafficked labor, managed violently. ['Narco slaves': Migrant workers face abuse on Oregon's cartel-run, illegal pot farms - ABC News and Cartel-backed pot grows linked to California, Oregon human trafficking (usatoday.com)]. Local sheriffs lament that they are woefully out-manned and out-gunned, and can't keep up with the body count. ""We're a very short amount of time away from having heads in the square like they do down in Mexico,"" said Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall in December 2021.</p><p>According to a federal law enforcement memo leaked to the Daily Caller [EXCLUSIVE: Illegal Chinese Marijuana Grow Operations Are Taking Over Blue State, Leaked Memo Says |</p><p>The Daily Caller], Chinese transnational crime groups have established about 750 illegal marijuana grow operations in rural areas in the states of Maine and Washington, often in collaboration with Mexican cartels. Chinese foreign nationals purchased and operated the grow houses with financing obtained from a handful of mortgage companies. Reporters from The Maine Wire [Triad Weed: How Chinese Marijuana Grows Took Over Rural Maine - The Maine Wire] tracked down more than 100 of the unlicensed operations, located in unassuming houses with boarded-up windows and outfitted with commercial grade electrical systems, and a few low-profile workers lurking around, all very conspicuous to the neighbors. One such operation was located across the street from a daycare, where the children and workers, along with the other neighbors, were regularly subjected to the unmistakable fumes polluting the air. Federal authorities believe that the operations generate profits of more than $4.37 billion per year, much of which likely goes back to China.</p><p>This business model requires creating a ""safe"" environment in which to operate. The cartels often create their safe space through violence, extortion, and even corruption of public officials. In Texas, large swaths of two counties have been literally taken over with what may be the largest settlement of illegal migrants in the country (Texas Massacre Happened in America's Largest Illegal Immigrant ""Colonia"" -- and Major U.S. Media Won't Say So (cis.org)), in Liberty County, a two-hour drive east of Austin, the state capital. The Gulf and Sinaloa cartels originally established enclaves in this area for stash houses for smuggled drugs and aliens. Now, with the help of unscrupulous real estate developers, political patrons, and the open border policies, this area is a massive and nearly unpoliced-able haven for the cartels, their employees, and their trafficked clients that has driven out most long-time American residents and spawned crime and violence on a third world scale.</p><p>Implementing Catch and Release Has Undermined Our Legal Immigration System. The Biden catch and release policies are best understood as an end run around the current immigration law. Biden and his top officials believe that many more immigrants should be admitted and, for the most part, those who make it here, even illegally, should be allowed to stay. It's clear that these changes would not be approved by Congress, so he has used executive action to accomplish them - either by ignoring provisions in the law that he disagrees with, such as the requirement to detain those caught crossing the border illegally and to detain and remove certain criminal aliens, by exploiting loopholes in the law, such as the parole authority, or by crafting new interpretations of the law, such as the criteria for asylum. These policies have been continued for three long years, clearly demonstrating an intentional abuse of authority, not incompetence, that has done great damage to our immigration system.</p><p>Most importantly, the widespread understanding that nearly all who make it into the United States will be promptly released if encountered by border agents and allowed to settle in the destination of their choice, receive shelter and support from government contractors, state and local governments, and NGOs, have the opportunity to apply for a work permit or work illegally, and face little threat of being sent home even if they skip out on immigration hearings is an irresistible incentive to enlist a criminal smuggling organization to try to come illegally, despite all that is known about the risks of the journey. These loose policies actually guarantee that illegal immigration will continue on a huge scale, and continue to stress our communities.</p><p>Catch and release of illegal migrants on the massive scale that we have seen under Biden policies has overwhelmed every part of our immigration system. Both the Border Patrol and legal ports of entry are inundated every day in nearly every sector, including the northern border, which has seen triple-digit increases in illegal entries. Releasing illegal migrants instead of promptly removing them has swamped ICE's dockets and the already-dysfunctional immigration courts. As of the end of FY2023, there were 6.2 million cases on ICE's non-detained docket, of whom more than 617,000 have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. (<url normalizedValue=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf"">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worsening-magnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf</url>).</p><p>USCIS, which adjudicates legal immigration applications, including family, employment and asylum applications, continues to struggle with backlogs, especially family-based applications such as Americans trying to sponsor a spouse for a green card. Meanwhile, fees are rising due in large part to the burden on the agency of processing hundreds of thousands of asylum and deferred action applications at no charge, and similar numbers of work permits.</p><p>This situation is not sustainable. Americans and legal immigrants are losing faith in our immigration system, and increasingly viewing immigration as a burden more than a benefit to our nation. Congress will have to act to restore its authority over immigration and restore the integrity of the system. The first step has to be clarifying that illegal immigration must not be ignored or facilitated, and that illegal migrants - whether single adults, families or unaccompanied minors -- will not be rewarded with the ability to reside indefinitely in the United States. This requires more barriers on the land border, turning back or detaining and removing most illegal crossers and visa overstayers, using accelerated forms of due process, raising the bar for asylum claims, cracking down on illegal hiring, denying welfare benefits and transmission of remittances for illegal aliens, enlisting the support of state and local authorities in immigration enforcement, and penalizing sanctuary policies. In the short term, Congress should use its spending authorities to cut off funding of programs that support the Biden catch and release policies, especially funds for transportation, shelter and services for new arrivals, and stipulate more funding for enforcement of immigration law.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=""https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vaughan-Written-Statement.pdf"">https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vaughan-Written-Statement.pdf</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8492495 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">TNS-PR8492495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:6BBW-7BW1-JC11-13WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2024-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""5166""/><timeReceived>7:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""201""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""LOGOS""/><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=""17"" month=""02"" year=""2024""><dateText>February 17, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, from a hearing dated May 8, 2024, entitled ""Dream Deferred: The Urgent Need to Protect Immigrant Youth"":</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Thank you, Senator Graham and Senator Durbin, for the opportunity to participate in this hearing. The border crisis resulting from the deliberate dismantling of effective immigration controls by the Biden administration is still festering, and should be one of the most urgent action items on the agenda of Congress. Last month, nearly 180,000 people were encountered after crossing the border illegally, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), of whom reportedly about 85 percent would be released into the country. Another 45,000 ""gotaways"" likely evaded apprehension after crossing illegally. Another 44,000 inadmissible aliens were allowed to enter in March under the administration's unlawful parole programs, including via the CBP-1 appointment system. Also in March, six of the illegal border crossers who were apprehended were hits on the terror watch list.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, lawmakers are trying to cobble together a plan to pay for the expected $915 million price tag for the emergency shelter system needed to house the influx of thousands of illegal migrants who have been flocking to the state after release at the border, on top of its native homeless population (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2024/04/22/massachusetts-migrants-shelter-costs"">https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2024/04/22/massachusetts-migrants-shelter-costs</url>) .</p><p>Across the country in Montana, leaders of tribal communities have defied death threats from Mexican drug cartels to appear in the media and before Congress to plead for help in addressing the devastating influx of cartel drug and human trafficking operations in Indian Country that has been facilitated by the Biden open border policies (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/apr/11/death-threat-mexican-cartel-forcedwitness-to-canc/"">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/apr/11/death-threat-mexican-cartel-forcedwitness-to-canc/</url>) .</p><p>Throughout the country, law enforcement agencies and journalists are uncovering a wave of disturbing incidents of child labor trafficking and other abuse involving thousands of unaccompanied minors smuggled into this country and released to largely un-vetted non-parental sponsors in Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Michigan, Florida, and numerous other locations (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrantchild-workers-exploitation.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrantchild-workers-exploitation.html</url>) .</p><p>In conjunction with the mass catch and release policies at the border, the Biden administration has dismantled interior immigration enforcement to the point where even criminal illegal aliens face little threat of deportation, and remain here free to prey on new victims. ICE is now arresting, detaining and removing less than half of the criminal aliens that it targeted prior to 2021 (2024-04-16-How-the-Biden-Administration's-Lax-Immigration-Enforcement-AllowsDangerous-Criminal-Aliens-to-Run-Free-in-American-C.pdf (house.gov)).</p><p>The deterioration of border security and interior immigration enforcement is truly an urgent matter that is at the top of the minds of public safety officials, state lawmakers and municipal leaders, and especially voters. While there are a number of ways that immigration laws could be improved, the reality is that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in its current form is sufficient to put an end to the crisis - if only it were enforced and fully applied. Until that occurs, and until the integrity of our legal immigration system is restored and once again serving our national interest, it is unlikely that Americans will support proposals for amnesties or new immigration programs.</p><p>Biden Policies Set Off Flood of Illegal Migrants, Overwhelming Federal Agencies, Border Communities, and NGOs.</p><p>The Biden administration is choosing not to enforce the laws, choosing to wave in and process thousands of inadmissible aliens every day instead of patrolling and preventing illegal entry, choosing to process benefits for these illegal migrants instead of for citizens and legal immigrants, choosing to release unaccompanied alien children to unvetted sponsors, choosing to flood the immigration courts with long-shot asylum cases, choosing to leave detention beds empty rather than allow ICE to pursue cases of aliens who are arrested, choosing to abandon worksite enforcement that would deter employers from hiring unauthorized workers instead of U.S. workers and, most recently, choosing to allow unlawfully present aliens to receive taxpayer subsidized health insurance.</p><p>When President Biden took office, he inherited the most secure land borders in U.S. history, with expanded and improved barriers, updated technology, and more personnel, all of which was backed up by policies that deterred migrants from crossing illegally and discouraged illegal aliens from remaining. As smuggling organizations and migrants became aware of the new policies, and as the processing and transportation networks were established within the country, the southern border was transformed into a chaotic, dangerous, and seemingly lawless frontier. It remains so today, except in the parts of Texas that have been secured by state authorities.</p><p>From the first day of his presidency, Joe Biden and his appointees began dismantling a laundry list of policies that had succeeded in controlling the years-long wave of illegal migrants hoping to take advantage of our dysfunctional asylum system and court rulings that require minors and those arriving with minors to be released into the country. He ended construction of the border wall system; terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols that sent tens of thousands of alleged asylum seekers to wait in Mexico; cancelled agreements with transit nations to offer safe haven to migrants and enforce their borders; relaxed application of Title 42 pandemic controls so that minors and families could enter; began awarding immigration parole to tens of thousands of illegal crossers, in defiance of the intent of Congress; extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to citizens of more nations and more recent arrivals; established strict limitations on interior enforcement to suppress deportations of all but the most egregious criminals; and launched plans for a new asylum system designed to expedite the legalization of illegal border crossers.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the number of illegal border crossers has exploded, in response to what the migrants call Biden's ""invitacion."" It was well understood around the globe that a large share of migrants who crossed the border illegally, especially those from certain countries, minors, and those bringing minors, would be apprehended by the Border Patrol, and would soon be released and transported to their destination in the United States, despite low expectations that they will comply with immigration proceedings or ever qualify to remain legally.</p><p>While apprehensions are a good metric for assessing the number of migrants who have attempted to enter illegally, the more important statistic is the number of migrants who were released into the country. According to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, more than 85 percent of these illegal migrants have been allowed to enter country - in defiance of federal laws stating that, with few exceptions, they should be held in custody for expedited due process and removal (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrantsreleased-into-us-sources"">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-tells-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigrantsreleased-into-us-sources</url>).</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has estimated that at least 4.7 million illegal aliens have been released into the country since President Biden took office. Only about 10,000 of those released have completed their immigration proceedings and been removed. Releasing illegal migrants instead of promptly removing them has swamped ICE's dockets and the alreadydysfunctional immigration courts. As of the end of FY2023, there were 6.2 million cases on ICE's non-detained docket, of whom more than 617,000 have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. (<url normalizedValue=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicansjudiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worseningmagnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf"">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicansjudiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-01-18-new-data-reveal-worseningmagnitude-of-the-biden-border-crisis-and-lack-of-interior-immigration-enforcement.pdf</url>.)</p><p>Open Border/Catch and Release Policies Undermine Public Safety. Besides the enormous fiscal costs of providing transportation, shelter, medical care, schooling, and other services to the illegal migrants, the Biden catch and release policies have created new public safety problems, with a human cost that is incalculable. Proponents of mass immigration often claim (without evidence) that illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than Americans, and therefore concerns about crimes committed by illegal immigrants are exaggerated, misplaced, or motivated by racial animus. These assertions are unproven, usually based on faulty interpretations of crime or Census data, and defy common sense and experience. They are profoundly demeaning to the victims of crimes committed by released illegal migrants who by law should have been detained and removed to their home country after apprehension. These are victimizations that are directly attributable to the Biden border catch and release policies.</p><p>For example, millions of Americans have seen the video of a shocking attack on police officers in Times Square by a group of migrants in New York City (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-squareattack-yet-arrested"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrants-stomped-kicked-nypd-officers-vicious-times-squareattack-yet-arrested</url>). In another disturbing case, New York City authorities recently arrested eight members of a ring of Venezuelan illegal migrants who were living in the city's shelters, and who are accused of stealing scooters to cruise through city streets and snatch phones and handbags, sometimes violently. The phones were then hacked to gain access to financial information, and the victim's back accounts were drained. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegalmasterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas"">https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegalmasterminds-nyc-robbery-ring-hacked-bank-apps-resold-stolen-phones-overseas</url>). Reportedly, the suspects are associated with the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Gang members and hundreds of other criminals are believed to have escaped through tunnels from a Venezuela prison last year, and dozens have been arrested after illegally crossing our southern border. There is no way to know how many may have been caught and released, because immigration agents have no way to access records in Venezuela, and no diplomatic or law enforcement relationships to assist in the vetting of these migrants (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agentothers-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/"">https://www.ktsm.com/news/fbi-agentothers-warn-of-venezuelan-gang-entering-into-us/</url>).</p><p>The most tragic outcomes of these irresponsible policies have already occurred. Just three months ago, Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was kidnapped and brutally murdered by an illegal alien who had been caught and released at the border. A House Judiciary Committee report provides a chronology of how the man accused of killing Riley was able to enter and remain in the United States:</p><p>According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Biden Administration released Ibarra into the United States in 2022 after he ""entered the U.S. illegally from Venezuela."" The Biden Administration released Ibarra into the country because it determined that Ibarra's release was warranted due to ""urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,"" despite Ibarra's reported affiliation with the dangerous Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua.</p><p>Ibarra's February 23, 2024, criminal arrest was not his first arrest in the United States. On August 31, 2023, New York City Police Department officers arrested Ibarra and charged him ""with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation."" Two months later, in October 2023, Ibarra and his brother Diego Ibarra ""were issued citations after being accused of shoplifting"" in Georgia. When Jose Ibarra ""failed to appear in court"" on December 20, ""[a] bench warrant was issued"" for his arrest. Despite Ibarra's criminal record, ICE did not arrest him.</p><p>In March, Haitian citizen Cory Alvarez was charged with aggravated rape of a disabled 15-year old girl in a Comfort Inn in Rockland, Massachusetts, that was being used as a shelter for newly arrived migrants. Alvarez reportedly came to the United States from Haiti in June, 2023 and was granted parole, with a ""sponsor"" in New Jersey (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Arthur/HaitianCHNV-Parole-Migrant-Arrested-Aggravated-Rape-Massachusetts"">https://cis.org/Arthur/HaitianCHNV-Parole-Migrant-Arrested-Aggravated-Rape-Massachusetts</url>).</p><p>Less than a week ago, Marvin Dionel Perez Lopez, age 20, a citizen of Guatemala, was arrested in Lake Worth, Florida and accused of snatching an 11-year old girl off the street and raping her in his van. He had crossed the border illegally in January, 2024, was released by the Border Patrol, and went to Florida, with an immigration court date scheduled in 2027. (<url normalizedValue=""https://cbs12.com/news/local/lake-worth-man-arrested-for-kidnapping-sexually-assaultingminor-marvin-dionel-perez-lopez-white-van-k-9-unit-saturday-captive-florida-may-6-2024"">https://cbs12.com/news/local/lake-worth-man-arrested-for-kidnapping-sexually-assaultingminor-marvin-dionel-perez-lopez-white-van-k-9-unit-saturday-captive-florida-may-6-2024</url>)</p><p>Migrants arriving at the border now receive only the most cursory screening before they are released into the country, which includes a fingerprint check of U.S. security, criminal justice, and immigration databases, a brief interview, and little other screening. Border officials generally cannot access criminal records in other countries, or do extensive background checks. Even worse, since the number of illegal crossings has reached crisis levels, border officials have sometimes been too overwhelmed to read and act on the results of security checks that indicate that an alien they have apprehended might be a threat. In at least four cases that I know of, a Lebanese-born Venezuelan citizen, a Colombian, and Afghan, and a Pakistani, border patrol agents released men who were watchlisted as known or suspected terrorists (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-VenezuelaDespite-FBI-Recommendation"">https://cis.org/Bensman/Report-ICE-Releases-BorderCrossing-Terrorist-Suspect-VenezuelaDespite-FBI-Recommendation</url>, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf"">https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-07/OIG23-31-Jun23-Redacted.pdf</url>, EXCLUSIVE: Pakistani Illegal Immigrant On Terror Watchlist 5</p><p>Given Free Day Of Release In US | The Daily Caller, <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/man-terrorist-watchlist-was-dropped-programmonitors-migrants-rcna148205"">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/man-terrorist-watchlist-was-dropped-programmonitors-migrants-rcna148205</url>).</p><p>Cartels Are Thriving and Expanding Into the United States. Thanks to unprecedented opportunities to move people and drugs across our border, the Mexican cartels and other transnational criminal organizations are reaping unprecedented profits, to the tune of $30 million a day, or nearly $1 Billion a month, according to a House Budget Committee report. They use the funds to acquire more sophisticated weapons and technology to solidify control over their territories in Mexico and beyond. More worrisome for the long term, however, is the way the cartels are using this cash cow to underwrite an expansion of their operations within the United States. This expansion presents profound implications for public safety that will persist for years into the future.</p><p>According to Border Patrol testimony to Congress, the smuggling fee is currently about $8,000 for passage to America. Many migrants make only a down payment up front of about $500, and agree to work off the rest when they get to their destination. The remainder is typically paid through debt bondage accomplished by wage garnishment, fees for housing and food, and other forms of exploitation and outright threats and extortion. Long-haul migrants from other continents pay more, sometimes up to $50,000. It is Biden's catch and release policy that entices these migrants to put themselves into the hands of a criminal organization, risking their own safety to journey here, and then being subject to exploitation, abuse and trafficking for labor and other purposes.</p><p>The migrant-moving business is lucrative enough, but it also helps further another critical illicit cartel activity -- drug smuggling. The cartels routinely send large groups of migrants over the border in certain areas to bog down the Border Patrol while they move drug loads through the other unguarded areas, along with high-value clients, such as criminals and watch-listed individuals, who don't want to be caught by the Border Patrol.</p><p>In the last three years, the amount of illicit drugs flowing into American communities has exploded, with deadly, tragic consequences, and the cartels are behind nearly all of it, according to a recent exhaustive report by the House Homeland Security Committee. It's happening not just in southwest border states, not just in cities, but also in rural areas, including Montana, Kansas, Kentucky, and many others.</p><p>The cartels are not humanitarian actors seeking to help asylum seekers; nor are they young, impetuous gang-bangers. They behave like terrorists, and they have a plan, for which they hire well-trained and well-armed violent thugs to carry out. The porous border and catch and release policies have made it easy to move their operatives into this country as well.</p><p>In 2022 federal authorities alone made more than 300 arrests for Mexican cartel-related crimes, according to one analysis [Map: Tracking drug cartel arrests across the United States (newsnationnow.com)]. The cartels are sophisticated business people, and nimble at adapting to emerging opportunities. The have evolved horizontally to branch out into new ventures, for example human trafficking as well as drug trafficking, in fentanyl trafficking as well as heroin and marijuana trafficking, and stealing oil as well as automobiles. Noticing the trend in some jurisdictions away from imposing stiff consequences for shoplifting and burglary, some cartels have branched out into the $70 billion organized retail theft industry, creating squads of operatives to steal goods on a major scale, even roping in recent illegal migrants as a way to pay off their smuggling debt, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators [HSI, ACAMS take aim at organized retail crime | ICE].</p><p>Executive Actions That Would Secure the Border. Reportedly, for more than three months, President Biden has been contemplating executive action on border security. There is no one action that would be a silver bullet, but we know from experience that a layered or multi-faceted approach would be successful in dramatically curbing mass illegal immigration. Among the actions he could take:</p><p>1. Putting the Border Patrol back on the line to patrol, and direct them to work cooperatively with border state authorities to prevent the entry of illegal migrants.</p><p>2. Resume construction of physical barriers in areas where these barriers would be effective in preventing illegal entry.</p><p>3. The administration should use diplomacy and other leverage to convince our neighbors in the hemisphere to prevent and disrupt illegal migration to the U.S. border. In addition, the administration should identify allies or partner countries to receive migrants who do not qualify for entry, as countries in Europe have done successfully(<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Report/Gatekeeper-Countries-Key-Stopping-Illegal-Immigration"">https://cis.org/Report/Gatekeeper-Countries-Key-Stopping-Illegal-Immigration</url> and <url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Transcript/Panel-Transcript-Illegal-Immigration-Sea"">https://cis.org/Transcript/Panel-Transcript-Illegal-Immigration-Sea</url>).</p><p>4. In addition to engaging with other countries, the President should accept help from state and local governments. Since 2021, fourteen states have sent National Guard or other troops to the southern border to assist Texas in dealing with the crisis. If the Biden administration were to change course and begin working in partnership rather than at cross purposes with the states, then these forces would be an effective force multiplier toward regaining border security under federal leadership. Similarly, the Biden administration should expand partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies in the interior to focus on crime problems that have been exacerbated by the open border, including the spread of cartel drug operations in rural America, the proliferation of certain transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, and the surge in human trafficking. Such partnerships can take the form of multi-jurisdictional task forces or delegation of authority programs authorized by INA Section 287(g).</p><p>5. Instead of using discretionary parole authority on a categorical basis to allow most illegal migrants to enter and settle in the United States with a work permit, use the authority granted to the president in section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Arthur/If-You-Title-42-Youll-Love-Section-212f"">https://cis.org/Arthur/If-You-Title-42-Youll-Love-Section-212f</url>) to suspend the entry of more groups of aliens arriving illegally:</p><p>Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.</p><p>President Biden used this authority as recently as December, 2023 to suspend the entry of corrupt public officials (A Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Enabling Corruption | The White House). It would not be difficult to make the case for suspending the entry of other broad classes of illegal migrants, including citizens of those countries to which they cannot be removed, or other categories of migrants that represent an articulable threat or burden to this country.</p><p>6. Adopt practical and realistic standards for handling asylum seekers that are faithful to the law and maintain appropriate standards to protect those facing persecution, but do not facilitate abuse of the system. For example, those who could have relocated within their home country, or who could have sought asylum in another country before arriving in the United States should be removed. In addition, in accordance with the law, asylum seekers should be detained until their case is complete or await proceedings in Mexico. Cases should be completed as quickly as possible, and those who do not qualify should be removed.</p><p>7. Border enforcement officers should be instructed to make maximum use of the accelerated forms of removal, including expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security agencies and the Department of Justice should work together to impose consequences for illegal crossing, and especially for re-entry after deportation, human and drug smuggling, and other border crimes.</p><p>8. The Biden administration should suspend the Mayorkas enforcement priorities (Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law (ice.gov)), which greatly restrict the types of removal cases that can be pursued by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). These should be replaced with directives to prioritize removal of all criminal aliens, prior deportees, failed asylum seekers, absconders from immigration proceedings, failed immigration benefit applicants, and aliens encountered in worksite enforcement operations. In addition, ICE/HSI should be directed to give higher priority to investigations of illegal employment, labor trafficking, identity theft, and overstays.</p><p>9. CBP-1, the program that has allowed inadmissible migrants to make appointments to enter at the land and sea ports of entry must be terminated. This program has enticed migrants to come to the U.S. border, further enriching the cartels that control the territory and the smugglers, and putting the migrants in vulnerable situations in Mexico and other transit countries and also within the United States as they work off their debt to the smugglers and cartels.</p><p>10. The president should refrain from re-designating Temporary Protective Status for recent arrivals from the countries whose citizens already have this protection, so as not to entice more illegal migration from these countries. In addition, illegal migrants should not be permitted to ""sponsor"" inadmissible family and friends from abroad for recently-created parole programs, which undercut our legal immigration system.</p><p>Legislative Options to Secure the Border. Although the current crisis is due to policies enacted by the Biden administration, and thus legislation is not required to restore border security, there is a role for Congress to play as well. Many of the items listed above for executive action would lend themselves to codification through legislation. In addition, there is a need for certain changes to the INA that would facilitate federal border security efforts. These include:</p><p>1. Adopting the Secure the Border Act of 2023 (HR2), which was passed by the House of Representatives and is already on the Senate's legislative calendar (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/housebill/2/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20addresses%20issues%20regarding,imposing"">https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/housebill/2/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20addresses%20issues%20regarding,imposing</url> %20limits%20to%20asylum%20eligibility.&amp;text=requires%20DHS%20to%20create%20 an,employers%20to%20use%20the%20system). This bill would provide further tools to the president for border security and address most of the loopholes and weaknesses that currently exist in the INA. It covers physical security of the border, the asylum system, the handling of unaccompanied minors and families, illegal employment, and more. Unlike the bill passed by the Senate this year, HR2 would not mandate the release of illegal migrants claiming to seek asylum, nor incentivize bogus asylum claims, nor mandate release of a certain number of inadmissible aliens, nor accelerate issuance of work permits to inadmissible aliens, nor increase issuances of green cards.</p><p>2. Congress should create a new type of ""designation"" for the cartels similar to the approach to international terrorist groups, which would enable authorities to target the financial assets of the cartels, to utilize other government resources, including the military and intelligence agencies, and to bar or deport foreign citizen operatives from our country.</p><p>3. Congress should act against the infrastructure that supports cartel-sponsored illegal immigration and trafficking, especially the money transmission networks that supports the vast flow of remittances to overseas. A significant share of this outflow of funds is not a transfer of funds from migrants to their families in their home countries, or even payments directly from the migrants to their smugglers, but actually huge sums of money that are being laundered by the cartels and disguised as remittances. To help disrupt this, Congress should pass new ""know your customer"" provisions that require money transmitters to collect secure identification from anyone sending funds abroad, in addition to levying a tax or fee on the funds that are sent.</p><p>No Urgency for a DACA Amnesty. It would be a grave mistake for Congress to give consideration to an amnesty or legalization program, either for DACA recipients or any other group of illegal aliens, at this time - when the government does not have operational control of the border and is catching and releasing illegal migrants on a mass scale. We know from past experience that rumors and public discussion of an amnesty provoke more illegal immigration as hopeful migrants rush to get here before the opportunity might be cut off. In the years following the implementation of DACA, Customs and Border Patrol reported a significant increase in the number of illegal aliens being apprehended at the southern border, and the number of unaccompanied minors and parents bringing children began to increase noticeably. This influx continued at what were then record-breaking levels for several years, until dropping off sharply in early 2017, when President Donald Trump implemented new policies. The general awareness of the DACA program, the push for a large-scale amnesty in 2013, and Barack Obama's attempt to enact a similar amnesty by executive fiat in 2014 likely contributed to an impression among illegal migrants that an amnesty that would cover their children, if not their entire family, was very likely to be enacted in the near future.</p><p>There is no doubt that the DACA benefits have been a major blessing for the recipients and their families. The educational institutions they attended and their employers also benefited. But there also have been some adverse side effects for the American economy, for local communities, and for our immigration system. The DACA program not only was an egregious abuse of executive authority, it was carelessly implemented. It has displaced legal U.S. workers from employment opportunities, added to the cost of public welfare and assistance programs, provided deportation protection to criminals, diverted resources away from processing benefits for legal immigrants, invited fraudulent applications, and helped inspire a surge of new illegal immigration.</p><p>Proponents of a DACA amnesty argue that the DACA beneficiaries arrived as children, did not choose to live here illegally, have grown up like Americans, and are unfamiliar with and have no ties to their country of citizenship. In the past, these amnesty proposals have lacked sufficient support in Congress due to concerns about the significant fiscal costs (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53409"">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53409</url>) , the labor market effects that result in displacement and wage depression for U.S. workers, and the need to avoid encouraging more illegal immigration, especially at a time when border security and interior enforcement have not reached their full potential. Further, there are legitimate concerns about the lack of rigor in the vetting process for DACA. (<url normalizedValue=""https://cis.org/Testimony/Oversight-Administrations-Decision-EndDeferred-Action-Childhood-Arrivals"">https://cis.org/Testimony/Oversight-Administrations-Decision-EndDeferred-Action-Childhood-Arrivals</url>). The lenient eligibility criteria and ""lite and lean"" background checks that were directed under then-USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas meant that many individuals with criminal histories were able to obtain DACA. According to a USCIS report, about 12 percent of DACA applicants had arrest records, include assault, battery, rape, murder and driving under the influence, and 85 percent of those applicants were approved. (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.uscis.gov/archive/uscis-releases-report-on-arrest-histories-of-illegal-aliens-whorequestdaca#:~:text=Of%20approved%20DACA%20requestors%20with%20an%20arrest%2C%20mor"">https://www.uscis.gov/archive/uscis-releases-report-on-arrest-histories-of-illegal-aliens-whorequestdaca#:~:text=Of%20approved%20DACA%20requestors%20with%20an%20arrest%2C%20mor</url> e%20than%2031,approved%E2%80%9D%20as%20of%20October%202019).</p><p>There is very little socio-economic, educational, or employment data available to the public about DACA beneficiaries, but in what little information about this population that has been disclosed, there is nothing to suggest that DACA beneficiaries are filling jobs that Americans (or legal immigrants) can't or won't do. The DACA policy did not require applicants to have completed a minimum level of education or have any particular skills. Applicants only had to have completed high school or be enrolled in an educational program, loosely defined, and applicant claims were not verified. The most credible research on the DACA population suggests that a significant share of the beneficiaries, between one-fifth and one-half, are adults who have not completed high school or have a high school degree but no further education. DACA beneficiaries span the entire spectrum of educational achievement, but on average they are somewhat less educated than the U.S. population as a whole. Therefore, they are not filling any particular gaps in the U.S. labor market, especially considering that there are millions of Americans who have dropped out of the labor market.

You must also remember that constant increases in immigration have consequences for Americans, and that continued tolerance of illegal immigration damages the integrity of our legal immigration system and erodes public support for legal immigration. For these reasons, an amnesty is appropriate only if it occurs after the border is under operational control and interior enforcement is robust. It should be kept to a small scale with well-defined eligibility criteria that are consistent with other legal immigration categories, and it should be enacted along with other provisions to mitigate the unavoidable fiscal costs, increases in chain migration, and encouragement to illegal immigration that will ensue.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-05-08_-_testimony_-_vaughan.pdf"">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-05-08_-_testimony_-_vaughan.pdf</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8655339 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">TNS-PR8655339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:6C5G-MKV1-JC11-10MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2024-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""5457""/><timeReceived>11:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""201""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""LOGOS""/><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=""02"" month=""06"" year=""2024""><dateText>June 2, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
