In the past Sanctuary city policies often centered around supporting faith-based organizations and movements. This included those cities where religious movements were offering safe places for not only war resisters, but for refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala. In the 1980s and 1990s, communities began to see sanctuary as more of a human rights issue than a religious one. The focus moved increasingly toward developing policies that would limit the involvement of local police with federal issues of immigration.

# Why Do Communities Choose to be Sanctuary Cities?

In alignment with the history of sanctuary city policies, many communities are now choosing to develop policies that separate local law enforcement from potential deportation activities at the federal level. Under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the focus on deporting undocumented individuals has been increasing. This includes individuals who are law-abiding, and parents working and raising children in the U.S. There are several reasons why communities enact policies and regulations to define themselves as sanctuary cities.

* **A Human Rights Standpoint:** Many people across the country see immigration as a positive process and human rights issue, and consider it the duty of U.S. citizens and officials to help protect all people. This includes people who are fleeing wars, poverty, and famine. [Chicago](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/tyl/topics/immigration-law/sanctuary-cities-federalisms-local-frontiers/) is one such city, where the sanctuary policies – also known as the Welcoming City Ordinance – state that Chicago officials will not help investigate or prosecute individuals based solely on their resident status. Chicago also does not discriminate against non-citizens for city services intended for those in need, and even offers a local ID to use for transportation and library access.
* **A Constitutional Standpoint:** Under the Constitution of the United States, being an undocumented immigrant is not actually a crime – it is a [civil violation](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/dec/02/kathy-sheehan/being-undocumented-immigrant-us-not-crime/). Criminal violations allow for punishments such as jail time. Civil violations result in penalties. Currently. the accepted penalty for being in the United States undocumented is deportation. There are many who see this as a punishment, and therefore a human rights issue as well as a Constitutional issue.",0,2024-07-27 19:20:49 UTC

You and they are full of that brown smelly stuff.  Texas is breaking FEDERAL Law pulling this crap.  SCOTUS has long established that immigration is a FEDERAL issue.  If you don't like Immigration law, get Congress to change it.  Oh right!  The GQP decided to block a bipartisan border bill because they would rather talk about the border than actually do something about it.

Oh, before you start the BS about the Border Bill having Ukraine aid or any other RWNJ's conspiracy theories, here is the actual text of the Bill that James Lankford provided to his GQP colleagues.  Nowhere in the bill's text it has any of the conspiracy theory BS in it.

Face it, your Idiot-In-Chief doesn't want to do anything about Immigration - he just wants it as a campaign issue.  This is just like having Mexico pay for the wall.  He doesn't care if they do as long as they say they would.  Go look at the transcript of the Trump/Nieto call.  He told Nieto that he didn't care if Mexico paid for the wall as long as they say they would:

I have several friends whi are mangers at different DK gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for two years, rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a place to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have a nice day.And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the way until she had the money to get her own place. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a place and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another DK, had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for about a year and a half. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",22,2024-03-28 02:25:24 UTC

Just keep an open mind and understand ""God"" is the same thing in all languages. Just be honest with yourself and with them, a good Muslim is always there to be of help to God's creations. By the way, I'm agnostic/borderline atheist, but I respect a good person of faith when I see one.

As for the desert in the Kern region, pick a good day to find somewhere high up enough to get a good view. I used to waltz into UTEP whenever I wanted and there are spots that will give a good birds eye view. Might even see an old camping spot. Go for a day hike. I think the spots I used to enter the desert were where Rim and Hawthorne cross and then another patch of desert in between Hawthorne and River.Again, this is decade old memories, so mileage may vary. There's also a patch of desert in the Kern area by New York st that's dense with brush.

Good luck my friend and keep a good attitude. Lots of people in El Paso will be of help if you show you're on the way to improving yourself. The library is also a good day time resource. If you collect some math and science books, go to the basement floor of the library and find yourself a table thats out of the way. They'll let you nap if it looks like you're a studying student. Same with the UTEP library, you can just waltz in there and go to the upper floors and look like you're studying to catch a nap. During test season, I think they'll even let you stay late.  


As for money, try to get yourself a pair of work gloves and go door to door and offer to pull weeds. You can charge $20/hr minimum on some yards or go as low as $10/hr. I had a lot of luck on the west side by coronado with this hustle.",4,2024-03-29 04:44:24 UTC

More housing is important for all of us across the board really, not just the homeless. And not just affordable housing—studies have shown time and time again that more housing of any kind actually brings the cost of all types of housing down. The most important thing that cities can do right now is to amend zoning laws so that we can build with more density! That means more apartment buildings, more duplexes, etc., rather than just single-family homes with lawns. The only people who might suffer from such changes are investors, which might explain why we struggle so much to make these fixes.

I’m really no expert on the issue of homelessness, but it is something that I’ve been reading and trying to learn more about over the past couple years. It’s indisputable that rates of alcohol and drug abuse among the homeless are much higher than among the general population, but the issue of cause and effect certainly remains controversial. I’ve seen studies placing addiction as the second-most significant cause of homelessness, while others put it significantly further down the list. What’s certain though is that getting people out of homelessness once they’re already experiencing it becomes much more difficult if they’re suffering from addiction on top of it.",2,2022-10-26 14:26:18 UTC

There is a feeling out here that a Hispanic will never be homeless because we are too prideful and hardworking, and that only white people end up homeless because they are lazy and want handouts. When in reality a lot of people who are homeless, Hispanic or not, do work, and have jobs. They are usually homeless due to addiction and mental illness, many times both. 

By the way the reason why you will see more white homeless than Hispanic homeless, is because white American culture is very individualistic, at 18 they kick you out of home and you are on your own, you are shamed if you still live at home as an adult if you are a white American. I worked with a girl who lived in a car and she proudly stated that at least she is not living at mom's house as an adult like many of us where. Also many white Americans will disown family members who are involved in drugs other shit, so many of these people really have no where else to go. The same is not with Hispanics. Hispanic culture is very collectivist, you always have a place at mom's house, no matter what, and if she kicks you out, aunt will take you in, or your cousin, or your grandma. Hispanics for the most part are never at risk of being homeless because someone's couch in your family is always open. Most homes here are not only multigenerational, but extended family members usually live together as well. Grandma's house is usually occupied by aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, everyone. Not to mention, family friends usually become members of the family, so friends here will take you in as well if you need to. We are very community oriented. And even if you are involved in drugs, crimes, whatever, family usually turns a blind eye, which I admit is an issue, but preferable to disownment.

So yeah mix white American individualism with poverty, drug addiction and untreated mental illness and that is how you end up with so many white homeless people. We should not bash them for that, but it is one of the reasons why I personally hate White American culture so much, and why I feel we should fight to keep the Southwest Hispanic and our traditions alive as much as we can, as asshole as that sounds.",4,2023-06-20 01:54:35 UTC

I assumed it was recently

To me it seems more like someone fabricating a story based on a single image and doing it for social media points, and that someone not being EPPD or even a resident of El Paso.

I've only had two interactons with EPPD - both of them positive. I'm 100% sure there are bad things about EPPD, as there are about every police department, but many of the officers are no doubt excellent people who would likely be willing to do what is alleged to have done here.

I'd just rather get the real story than whatever this is.",5,2024-12-26 22:37:10 UTC

Dad moving from LA to El Paso.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/1dhe2e8/dad_moving_from_la_to_el_paso/,2024-06-16 18:35:23 UTC,"A couple of things come to mind. Questions actually. Does your dad plan on buying a home of equal value to the home he sold in LA? I am assuming not. However, if he wants to avoid capital gains tax then a 1031 exchange would allow him to use the entire proceeds of his home sale in LA to purchase a home in El Paso so long as the purchase price equals the price he sold his home for in LA.

Also keep in mind for single homeowners whose home was their primary residence for at least 2 out of the past 5 years there is a capital gains exemption of up to $250K and up to $500K for married couples. Of course, that does not include the cost basis (the original purchase price he paid for the home) It is always a good idea to know these things for tax time next tax season.

Your dad should be prepared for much higher property tax rates in El Paso. The average tax rate in El Paso county is around 3% and higher in some places like Horizon City where I happen to live. It is important to understand this so he knows that if he is buying an expensive home well that value is going to come with a high annual property tax obligation. Let's use some real numbers to illustrate. If your dad buys a $300K home he's probably looking at a $9K annual property tax bill. Of course homestead exemptions will reduce this to some extent BUT here in El Paso the only exemptions you get for homestead are the $100K exemption on the school ISD taxes and a measly $5K exemption on the El Paso County taxes.  There are no exemptions for the other entities like community college, city, MUD (municipal utility district), fire, police & hospital. The good news is once the exemption is in place taxable value can only increase 10% per year. However when he buys his home he's essentially starting at exemptions on the full price he paid. So for the $300K example he would be taxed on $200K for the ISD portion of his taxes (taking the $100K exemption on school ISD portion of taxes) and $295K for the county taxes (taking into account the $5K exemption). On all the other aforementioned entities he will be taxed on $300K. Make sure once he purchases his home he IMMEDIATELY submits his application for the homestead exemption. He may qualify for senior over 65 exemption or disability. Please please please-I cannot emphasize this enough-make sure he gets this done as soon as he closes on his new home. Very important!!!

With all that said there are plenty of options for homes that are still even under $200K. Many of those affordable options can be found on the far East and Horizon city where new homes are still being built. Pena realty are a good group of people who can help him find a new home. They have a youtube channel with very helpful information about real estate in El Paso as well as living in El Paso. Look up their youtube channel Living In El Paso. Hope this helps.",18,2024-06-16 19:04:21 UTC

Usually there is a capital gains tax when you sell a house. You can defer the tax if you buy a similar property within in 3 months. There are strict rules to follow because you have to properly identify the new properties of interest and then close within 3 months. 

His realtor should be an able to get in touch with a company that specializes in this. Companies hold the funds from the sale until the property is purchased and of course the companies charge fees for this.",4,2024-06-16 22:25:33 UTC

We have a homeless epidemic, I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can help and often volunteer about once a month or so, I've seen first hand how many we have and the fact that its considered a good low number is twisted. Obviously Texas has a significantly better government than California and New York so it isn't as bad here as there but our numbers should be what those two states experience and ours should be near nonexistent. 

  
Japan has managed to essentially eradicate homelessness with a worse GDP to population than we have, no excuses for the USA to not have done the same thing. Being in a profit over humanity country really sucks sometimes. We got all the money in the world to give to useless foreign countries that do not help us and set up camps for migrants who will never see citizenship because we've designed it as a tax write off instead of an immigration point, but none to spend to help our people, not just with homelessness but education, healthcare, and literally everything under the sun all the way down to school supplies for teachers.

There's a place on Yandell called [La Familia](http://www.lafamiliadelpaso.com/). It's basically a facility for people living with mental health issues and intellectual disabilities. Lots of times these individuals don't have anything to do during the day which can be depressing. So they provide a space for people to go to- they have chores, they exercise, they have art classes once a week and go on day trips. It really gives disabled people a sense of agency and independence that they wouldn't have otherwise.


It's a great organization!
Maybe they could use a computer lab...

By the way, if you know of anybody who could use these services, have them go check it out.  It saves disabled from being bored/stuck at home and gives caregivers a much needed break to go and take care of some stuff for themselves.  It's free as far as I know, although if the group decides to go to a restaurant for their weekly outing the individual is responsible for their part of the tab (drink, burger, etc.).

I think it was a lady that came out on the news saying she was paying for them.  The Red Cross seems to have been distributing clothing and stuff.  I felt an overwhelming feeling to help but don't know how.  Looks like they have clothing and food.  I saw a family with two little girls and I asked what they needed.  They said money for passage to family elsewhere.  I gave away as much money as I had.  Obviously, the need is great.

Broke my heart to not see any churches or organizations there.  

I thought it would be great if data could be gathered that showed profiles of migrants and how much money they need to get to their loved ones.  Maybe El Paso could rise and sponser them by buying bus tickets and helping them out.

For those of us who support open borders and mass immigration, it's time for us to stop virtue signaling and put our feelings of altruism into action.  We need to open up our own personal wallets, hearts, and homes to these poor, suffering people.

So if you voted for a Democrat in a federal or state election, please donate money, food, time, and clothing, and above all offer to shelter one or more of these poor homeless immigrants in your own house or apartment.  If you live elsewhere in the state or even out of state far from the southern border, please donate money and clothes (until it hurts) while offering to take people in if they travel to your home area.

If you believe that altruism is a moral ideal and that Americans need to come together and help the poor at home and abroad, then surely you feel (or should be feeling) a duty to sacrifice your personal selfish interests to help these poor people.  

The federal government is not going to be able to handle this competently, and state and local governments simply don't have the resources.  But if we hold true to our feelings and give of ourselves and open up our hearts and our homes, we can make a real difference.

I love El Paso. I have never seen a homeless person there. I know they are there but it's not like in LA or NorCal. Everything is so affordable in El Paso! People are nice. Kids can do dual language in elementary school. The restaurants are wonderful. The mountains are beautiful. It's hot in the summer but I get up early for my walk and the sunrise/sunsets are gorgeous.

When politicians and management at the federal, state and local levels **fail to do their jobs**, the blame game starts (because the problem couldn't possibly be due to their malfeasance.)

The truth is, legislators at all levels have failed us.  Even when we have had Executive Branch leadership, the Congress and lower level state legislators have failed us.  What is worse, it would be far less costly to do things right, to do things humanely, to serve the people and not political schemers.

Another truth is that the US reaps economic and social benefits from immigrants. Right now, we should work to increase immigration by doubling the current growth of 1 million people a year. This to compensate for declining birth rates and the need to keep the population stable or slowly growing.

As a group of French master’s students, we take the opportunity to solicit your participation in a survey conducted within the framework of a research project on the representation of the American-Mexican border in crime movies. Our aim is to assess the impact that this type of film has had on the perception of the borderland in the last twenty years among American and Mexican citizens living near the border. Here is the link to the survey (https:// forms.gle/cDZGjYDSyPWvycNRA), which will not take you more than a couple of minutes. Once you have completed it, we would be grateful if you could share it with relatives likely to be interested, since it would allow us to extend the size of our sample.

>Do you feel more part of the western states and cultures of New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Mexico?

In my brief time here, yes. In some ways, El Paso has a very ""Montreal"" feel to it. What I mean by that is, in Montreal by far the first language is French, but if you are an English speaker and you go to Montreal (or even live there), everyone speaks English to you. (I've had friends who hoped to practice their French in Montreal, only to find that everywhere they go, once a local realizes you are an American, they speak English to you, even if you speak French to them). And just comparing big cities in Canada, Montreal has its own culture compared to others because of their Acadian French heritage. 

Here in EP, by far the first language of most people is Spanish, but English speakers have absolutely no problem getting by on English only because everyone will speak English to you. And EP has a different culture than other big cities in the US because of the Mexican heritage. edit: I should have added here, that it's even different than cities like LA, San Diego, and other cities with large Mexican populations.  I'll also, say, that ""Montreal"" feel that I get here in EP, I don't get it down in Brownsville and McAllen, interestingly enough. Those areas, while also border towns, feel more like Mexico than EP does. I think EP being a military town has something to do with that. I suspect if the military presence was completely gone from EP, it might feel more like Brownsville/McAllen.",35,2023-01-24 16:10:51 UTC

It was normal to hear in the news on blunt racist diatribes being directed against the community by these regents and other politicians.

I honestly no longer care what the rest of Texas thinks about my city. In a way we were our own worst enemy because local leadership back then was an absolute embarrassment.

We are also for obvious reasons connected with Southern New Mexico. We are honestly a mix between Southern Tejano, New Mexican and Chihuahua. For example let's look at the local population.

Southern Tejanos, as opposed to the Tejanos found in areas like San Marcos, San Angelo and San Antonio are Tejanos who are from border areas and are more Mexican, prefer Spanish and still keep connections to Mexico, also tend be working class, unlike other Tejanos outside the border who are more Americanized, middle class and conservative. Many families in San Elizario, Socorro and Ysleta fall under this category.

Then you have people who are similar to the Nuevo Mexicanos of New Mexico, descendants of Spanish conquistadors and Spaniards who mixed little with the indigenous population or those who did  mix but manages to keep a Spanish culture as opposed to a Mestizo one. You will find these families in the Upper Valley and some of the older families in Sunset Heights, some have spread to areas like Coronado Heights. You know them from their last names like Cordova or Onate. And not to get racial but they tend to be lighter skinned Hispanics and upper class (in Juarez they would be called Fresas)

Puebloan people are found here as well, obviously with the Tigua tribe who came here from NM, giving the town that Pueblo southwest flavor NM is known for.

Northern Mexican mestizos from Chihuahua makes up most of the rest of the population so that gives a El Paso a strong Norteno macho culture, that Northern Mexico is know for, beards, cowboy boots and trucks, and a more conservative outlook.

But we also have connections to the rest of the Texas, again via the populations in the area, in the Upper valley and Coronado Heights areas, there is also a lot of Anglo, Germanic and Irish families who have been here for generations but trace their ancestry to Eastern Texas, which is why the Upper Valley really does have an Eastern Texas cowboy feel to it. (Most people in EP have never been there so they don't even know the different world it is there, compared to the rest of EP) Some of our location politicians come from these families. Beto and Dee Margo for example.

Basically the blending of these cultures makes El Paso such a unique culture, that makes it hard to put us in one category .",12,2023-01-24 17:12:40 UTC

Compare Lubbock to El Paso and they are polar opposites in politics, religion, geography, size, demographics, culture, etc. When you head east especially after Van Horn you definitely get a different vibe. The most notable feeling I get when I am in Central and East Texas is how Christian evangelism is a lot more prevalent. El Paso is a majority Catholic city. I've also noticed that the blue-collar central and east Texans and some Tejanos hate ELP even though they've never traveled beyond their driveway. Obviously it's a racial thing.

If you like a bustling city with tons of entertainment options and diversity, Austin hands down. But if you like a quiet city perfect for your family, El Paso takes the crown.

During my time in Austin, I enjoyed the lakes, strong workforce, diverse food and dining options, and how everything was near. I disliked the traffic and how expensive everything was. I truly loved my time there and still visit every once in a while.

El Paso is perfect for hiking since we have the footstep of the Rocky Mountains right in the middle of the city — Franklin Mountains State Park — and the New Mexico forests 2 hours away. Single-family homes are still affordable and crime rates are obviously lower here since we have local, state, and federal jurisdictions, and a strong military presence. I know many people overlook Juarez, but if you’re interested in flying to the beach resorts or major Mexican cities, Juarez offers direct flights for around $100 round trip! However, I dislike that El Paso has very limited options including restaurants, stores, flights, and geographic closeness to other cities. The job market here is a joke and people still work for $8 or $9 per hour, but if you work remotely for a company based in another city, you can live very comfortably since El Paso has a very low cost of living.

Austin was a great city to be in when I was in college, but now that I’m a bit older looking to settle, El Paso is the perfect one.

Being diverse, means that different veterans have different needs of course. I appreciate you mentioning that you provide service for male veterans too, and mentioning that since female veterans are less percentage than represented in society based on their service.

As humans, we have been divided by many categories including the ones you've mentioned for centuries due to social constructs.

In terms of the human experience, it's important to understand and be aware that we indeed have different and unique experiences because of those constructs thus, there is no one size fits all approach to helping people. For instance, I would suggest you read the DAVs latest report on women Veterans. Perhaps, it will help with understanding at least some of what women Veterans have and still go through. 

I'm sorry you haven't had a good experience w/TVC. If you were more specific about your experience I may be of better help. 

TVC is a state department so maybe that's why you refer to it as a ""mafia"" but I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a ""stranglehold on Veterans issues."" I do know that sometimes people confuse TVC and the VA and think TVC has authority over the VA. I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but I wanted to make that clarification anyways. 

I personally don't have success stories, but I have had many Veterans and family members reach out for information on resources and events and they seem very appreciative on that as well as what I share on social media. We do have newsletters that you can sign up for at [https://www.tvc.texas.gov/newsletter.html](https://www.tvc.texas.gov/newsletter.html). Or, if you scroll down to News & Media at [https://www.tvc.texas.gov/](https://www.tvc.texas.gov/) you can find some stories.

He gave lots of tips and great advice!

Here's what I remember:

* Save your money, don't join that gym just for the showers. This guy advised hitting up one of those trucker depot centers. The only one I know of is on the corner of Horizon Blvd and I-10. A long ways, but there might be others?! Not sure. He recommended those places because showering is simpler and cheaper than just joining a gym for shower rights. Plus you'll raise fewer suspicions for looking like shit.

* If you are going to live in your car a while, keep it as tidy, clean and comfortable as possible. Nothing says HOMELESS like crazy wrinkled clothes and terribly body odor!

* GOT A JOB? If not, keep some clean clothes elsewhere. Clean clothes to go to interviews in. Clean clothes to go to work in.

---
There was lots more, but I can't find the post :(

My own advice:

* Having your dog will make things really tough for you. You are trying to take care of yourself AND your dog. You both gotta eat, sleep AND stay healthy. Winter months coming up, and you can not prioritize taking care of yourself if you are caring for your dog also. My advice: beg your wife to just keep your dog. You really have no friends or family? If you do, I hope they can care for your dog for a while, while you get your self together.

* Avoid walmart parking lots. Even if they don't call the police, I'm sure they DO write down your plates. PLUS I don't know what the vagrancy or loitering laws are. Best to be careful. You don't want that showing up later.",1,2015-10-12 22:22:10 UTC

""My taxes shouldn't be used to build your housing""=> They won't. This project is privately funded  and owned. The developer competes for Low income Housing Tax Credits which are purchased by investors to offset their taxes. The Tax Credit proceeds are used as an additional source of funds to complete the construction. The LIHTC program was started in 1986 to incentivize the building of affordable housing. Can someone remind me the name of the president who signed this legislation into law? /s

""Section 8 housing attracts crime"" -> There is no evidence for this claim AND this is not going to be Section 8 housing.

""These people live in the 'program' and never get out""-> This is not a housing program. People who live in these communities earn between 50% and 80% of the Area Median Income. A family of 4 earning 60% of AMI makes $45K/year in El Paso.  They apply to live here like any other apartment complex and they qualify after a thorough background check and a review of their income status. They pay rent like any other renter, just at a reduced rate. The family of 4 above would pay about  $1,100 per month for a 3 BR unit.

""They were supposed to build a school here""  -> EPISD is shrinking not expanding. Putnam, the closest school in this neighborhood, is at risk of shutting down due to a diminishing student population. By bringing new families to the area, we can improve this vacant lot and potentially save our local school. The alternative is a shuttered elementary school and a vacant lot.

This project will increase traffic in the area.: - >There are over 700 multifamily units within 300 yards of this proposed community. Adding 100 more will have little if no impact on traffic.

I come from California and the low income housing units almost always bring crime with it. The issue with California is that so many people are on government assistance and they abuse the system bad.

Governments across all states should instead lower barriers to start your own business, force mid & large corporations to pay living wages, and stop healthcare and big pharma from financially abusing patients. 

Teaching people to be self sufficient is much better than government handouts and providing low income housing. And addressing the corporate greed from large corporations would relieve lots of financial stress for many people.

People greatly abuse the government system. The system is designed to keep you reliant on the government. It's why I say, that instead of giving handouts, the government should lower barriers to allow people to be self sufficient. 

California didn't drive people out because they think ppl shouldn't live on government handouts. California's high cost of living, paired with insane taxes, and insane crime has driven people AND business out. You can make $100k a year and you'll only take home $70k.

 The second reason, importantly, is that HOME residents who are convicted of a crime lose their housing, and their entire family has to move out with potentially no other options.

Better chance if you go take a day trip or weekend excursion to Ruidoso. Or you can drive near Santa Fe for a weekend getaway.

The rest of your questions are dependent on what you're looking for and what you're used to doing. If you need to be near metros upon metros of millions of people then yeah, it'll be isolating but a lot of El Pasoans only know the area so there's not that frame of reference. Military folk will have mixed opinions based on their backgrounds and what they like. Being born and raised in El Paso, I had thought it was the norm to be far from cities. New Mexico also made the case for metros being spread out. I generally like being able to drive for a little bit to get away from folks entirely. Others want the constant thrill of something or someone new and never standing still.

It's a great place to own a large home for a low cost relative to rest of the country. Feels small town and suburban being outside of the main city. El Paso is pretty spread out, so areas can really vary. The west side has higher end shopping, and a better variety of food, but is also pricier. 

The east side is growing and also has some great established restaurants that have been around for a long time. 

You should really consider what you like to do outside of work. For me personally, I like to hunt and explore wild country which is pretty much impossible to do in West Texas. So I have to drive 2 hours at least for my hobby. 

Having the airport close is nice, but know you will likely have to pay for connecting flights to a main hub. 

Weather is great, and it maybe snows an inch every year? The franklin's are always nice to look at with snow.

Weather extremes are usually just wind and a few weeks of rain. Make sure you get a good roof inspection for any home you purchase. Almost all housing seems to get a leak at some point in El Paso.",15,2021-12-21 21:53:19 UTC

El Paso has affordable houses. You can easily get a nice home for no more than $300,000, but the market is hot (as is the case in other cities, but not as bad as Austin). I would suggest living on the west side due to the diversity in food and entertainment options, because the homes are more “upscale” in my opinion, and because it’s closer to the mountains (after all, who doesn’t love to wake up to the sight of beautiful mountains?).

Does El Paso feel isolated? Depends on who you ask. If you’d like to drive to other major cities then, yes, it feels isolated. However, the El Paso airport has direct flights to every major city in Texas and the airport in Juarez, across the border, has direct flights to major Mexican cities. Also, New Mexico towns/resorts are near El Paso, so it’s not as isolated as people make it out to be.

Does it snow every year? Almost every year. It gets colder than your average Texan city for sure since the desert sand can’t retain heat. If you’d like to see snow, New Mexico is a short drive away, as stated earlier.

I’ve always said that El Paso is the hidden gem of Texas. It has too much to offer once you get over the culture shock.",26,2021-12-21 21:39:46 UTC

El Paso is easily my favorite place I’ve lived, and it is home. I absolutely love the weather, and I suggest finding a place with a decent-sized back yard. Whereas 100 degrees in Houston is unbearable, 100 degrees in El Paso can actually be perfectly comfortable if you find a bit of shade. During the summer, the evenings and nighttime are downright delightful, and are best spent outdoors. Back yard parties are a big thing here. 

We have an excellent minor-league baseball stadium that also serves as the facility for our soccer team. Tickets are cheap and parking is quick and convenient. My family really love going to Chihuahuas and Locomotive games. Sun Bowl Stadium at UTEP is a really cool college stadium that is down in bowl on a mountain, and we really enjoy going to UTEP games too. 

In addition to the great stadium, downtown has really come to life in the 6 years since I moved out here. COVID slowed down downtown development, but I have no doubt it will continue. San Jacinto Plaza and the surrounding area is really cool. We have a few really unique luxury hotels downtown, all with very good, upscale bars and restaurants. Of course El Paso has excellent Mexican food, but it also has a surprisingly high number of fine dining options. We enjoy having the occasional staycation downtown. Eat, drink, stroll around, etc. We also have decent history and art museums downtown that are completely free, and are walking distance from the hotels, San Jacinto Plaza, and the stadium. 

The city is bisected by the Franklin Mountains, and we have the largest urban State Park in the nation. Franklin Mountains State Park is a huge park right smack in the middle of the city, and is a great place to hike or mountain bike. Just outside of the State Park, on the east side of the range, there is the US Border Patrol Museum and the El Paso Archeology Museum, both are free. 

We have a TopGolf, indoor skydiving, ice skating (also a hockey team), and a really great small zoo. We also have a couple of casinos on lands owned by the Native Tribes of the area. Sunland Park Casino also has a quarter horse race track. 

It doesn’t snow much, and when it does it is gone quickly. Just two hours away, however, are Cloudcroft and Ruidoso, NM. Both towns have snow skiing in the winter. I’ve never been to the slopes on Cloudcroft, but Ski Apache (owned by the Mescalero Tribe) is a pretty decent ski resort. The Tribe also owns a nice hotel (Inn of the Mountain Gods) that has a casino. 

There are lots of other day trip options. White Sands National Monument is really cool, and you can sled down the pristine white sand dunes. Carlsbad Caverns is also just a couple hours away, and is amazing. If you go to the caverns, hike in and out rather than taking the elevator. The hike out is a killer, but you can take all the breaks you like lol. Balmorhea State Park is about a two hour drive away, and is an excellent summer destination, due to the huge natural spring-fed swimming pool. If you are a rock climber (or interested in rock climbing) Hueco Tanks State Park & Historic Site is a 30-minute drive, and is a world-renowned climbers’ Mecca that is know as one of the world’s top places for “bouldering.”

If driving, El Paso is closer to San Diego and LA than it is to Houston. Tucson, Santa Fe, and Taos are all 4-6 hours away, and are all great tourists spots. Within that same driving range you can find excellent kayaking, river rafting, and snow skiing/boarding. 

You can cross the border to Juarez and fly to anywhere in Mexico for under $200! Seriously. 

El Pasoans are great, and after 6 years living here I am a proud El Pasoan! This is home. The population is mostly Latino, and the local culture is heavily influenced by Mexican culture. As a white boy and girl from rural east Texas, my wife and I can honestly say that we do not at all feel isolated or excluded. We have felt welcomed and included in this community from day one. El Paso is a place that will return what you give to it tenfold. If you come out here with a closed mind and act like a dick, you won’t be well received. On the other hand, if you greet people with a smile, treat others with kindness and take time to appreciate, respect, and enjoy the local culture, El Paso will rerun your kindness and respect overwhelmingly! 

You don’t have to learn to speak Spanish to live in El Paso, because 90% of the people you encounter are fluently bilingual. Nonetheless, I recommend you learn as much Spanish as possible, because it helps you peel back even more layers to this unique and wonderful city. Don’t forget that there is a huge city, with over 1 million people, just on the other side of the river. Spanish speakers are always very appreciative that I make an effort to speak Spanish, but nobody will hold it against you if you don’t. 

Anyway, I could go on and on. I know there are other tons of other great aspects to this city that I am forgetting, but I hope this gives you a decent idea of what we have to offer.",20,2021-12-22 13:39:42 UTC

Locals won't have an idea of what isolated is unless they have to go out of town for something important that they can't find here. Recent transplants do talk about it being distant from major metropolitan areas though.

To give you an idea on the distances between El Paso and other cities, I've compiled the list below:

1. Los Angeles - 795 miles
2. San Diego - 717 miles
3. Phoenix - 396 miles
4. Tucson - 310 miles
5. Albuquerque - 259 miles
6. Denver - 645 miles
7. Dallas - 643 miles
8. Austin - 584 miles
9. San Antonio - 559 miles
10. Houston - 755 miles
11. Las Vegas - 697 miles
12. Santa Fe - 322 miles

NOTE: Above figures are approximate.

That'll give you an idea more or less on the distances. People here are friendly, genuine and humble for the most part. Life moves slower here. If you move to El Paso and keep your DFW salary, then you'll live very comfortably.",3,2022-02-08 20:08:10 UTC

If you like heat, dry heat, EP is a great place to live. Just get a refrigerated cooling system, and you're solid. The winters are pretty mild, if it snows, it doesn't last for longer than a day/two, but black ice is common during colder, wet days. Spring is a wonderful time, albeit windy, but the warmer seasons are perfect for outdoorsy activities. The heat isn't as brutal as Houston heat since it's a dry heat, and 100 in EP is more bearable than 100 in Houston, IMO. Depends on preference/acclimation to humidity (which EP is not).

There's always something to do. There's hotsprings nearby, there's camping nearby, there's malls, hiking, gamer scene, etc. It's a great big city with a small town feel. The mountains are also so fun and beautiful to explore and enjoy.

And currently in the area would have to dig about 600 feet to hit water. But obviously infrastructure would be the first thing done if this project were to happen. So I would of course foot the bill but also have several other financial avenues I can take to make it happen. This of course wouldn’t be an overnight thing. Infrastructure would be most important and would want to get that right the first time to ensure the success of the community. There are some who already have wells dug in the area but others opt for have water delivered which is a lot cheaper. Either way water wouldn’t be hard to obtain.,6,2024-08-20 02:32:16 UTC

I would also recommend reading up on things like restorative and transformative justice as a way to handle conflict and crime in your community. Your community will need some system of governance and your best bet will be to start working on that from the beginning so that people coming in understand what they’re getting themselves into and what’s expected of them.

It's easier to lash out at the individual rather than the corporation doing the same with the intent to rent out and squeeze the local populace. Hopefully most transplants are also bringing in remote jobs with them to bring new money into the local economy. Everyone who can should be getting remote jobs so they can keep skilled white collar workers in the metro so the city can point to that population when trying to entice companies to set up shop.

I'll also say it's not a new occurrence. Before the pandemic, you'd have military families come in and swoop up housing stock on the cheap and then move on while holding on to their property as a rental.

Don't take it personal. Most of the redditors here are regulars and some have very negative things to say about transplants. Not every native El Pasoan shares the same feelings and many of them are not on Reddit. I've said it before and I'll say it again. As a lifer here myself I view transplants as an overall positive because most have lots of disposable income they can use to spend on local, established small businesses. They also have an entrepreneurial spirit. This helps with diversity and creating more jobs. Fresh ideas also are a benefit they bring.

IMO...when you see questions like 'why are you locating here and for what', may not be necessarily hostile in its intent. The reasoning behind it is possibly because:
1. They were born and raised here and have a regret of not leaving.
2. They may have moved here voluntarily a few years back, and something in their life went wrong, so now they want to leave, but they can't, so their frustration turns to vitriol with everything that's local.
3. An involuntary transplant, usually military, who absolutely hates it here for whatever reason and in their own mind can not fathom why people would want to relocate to El Paso.
4. A local or old transplant who is being priced out and does not have the skill set to get a better-paying job. They want to keep up with the Jones's like before and as it gets harder to do that, their frustrations are directed at what they think are the causes.

Yes, things have gotten more expensive, but you have to do your best to adapt. That's what I had to do. Whether in enrolling in evening classes at EPCC, learning a trade or brainstorming on how you can create and maintain a side hustle. Also, you may just need to be disciplined with your income, shop smart, and determine what are your needs and what are your wants. I don't blame transplants because my parents came from south of the border back in the 60's. It's no different now than how it was back then.

I think people get angry perhaps because, for example, someone coming from California, where property values are insanely high, see El Paso home prices as a steal. Now to El Paso residents home values here have increased pretty significantly. To that guy from California they are low relatively speaking. That guy from CA won't even bother to negotiate to get a better price. They won't drive a hard bargain. They'll just accept the first price they see listed for a home. Once the home is purchased the county appraisal district uses that higher sales price as justification for raising values  of all surrounding homes. Residents then see their property taxes increase.

A lot of our parents here don’t speak English.  And how many of us went to school with ESL kids who could barely say a few sentences in English? They still have not learned English. Not to mention the people who cross from Juárez everyday to spend money. That is why businesses want you to speak Spanish . Outside of the government hospitals, you rarely can get a job in the medical field if you don’t speak Spanish. Even the Koreans in downtown speak Spanish. But the transplants will say you don’t need to learn it. And you don’t if you plan on having a white collar government job like most of them do and you plan to live in the west side. But say you are working class, have no degree and can only afford to live in central or lower valley ? Tell me not knowing Spanish won’t hurt you.    

There is also a feeling like you guys refuse to understand the culture or that you look down on it as backward. “Why is there so many Jesus loves you signs  everywhere?” Y’all didn’t know most of the population here is super religious? Even LGBT members have huge statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in their homes. “omg why is there so many dogs running around?” lol wait till you see how things are in Juarez, in regards to street dogs. “Why do my neighbors have roosters and chickens! Omg is that even allowed!?” I don’t think so, but we don’t care. “My neighbor just brought a goat to his backyard, wait are they killing it !” Complaints about the “mañana culture” (I’ll do it tomorrow) and very slow paced relax feel of the place. We are a city with a small town mentality. Even a ranch mentality. We do have a “third world” mindset as well. Which bothers people not from here.   

What bothers me the most is how transplants and I would say even upper middle class locals outright deny some of the issues this city faces simply because they don’t have to deal with them. I have heard El Paso does not have a homeless issue. Y’all seen Dyer ? Or all the homeless encampments in the northeast? People will come and ask about the migrant crisis. And transplants and well off locals will laugh it off , saying there is no migrant crisis. Bros, in the northeast we have a whole ass homeless war because there was so many migrants coming in that they pushed the homeless out of the shelters and they came to the northeast. There was a fight for resources out in the streets. There was also masses of migrants just dropped on low income areas of céntral and the NE. There was gang wars between local gangs and Venezuelan gangs. When the FBI noted this. But you ask People on here about it? It never happened. Of course if you are on the west side you never saw what was happening in the Lower valley and Northeast parts of town.   

Transplants will also deny the crime and gang issue. “There is gangs in El Paso ?” Meanwhile cartels are recruiting heavily from youth street gangs everyday in El Paso. And people are losing their sons to this. There is women in the Lower valley and northeast who have been raped, beat, robbed, but some upper middle class UTEP girl Or wife of a transplant will say these things don’t happen here. There is huge disconnect between the working and poor parts of town and the upper middle class areas where most transplants live.  

 Lastly there is a general feeling that we are being “colonized” once again. Out of town companies are coming in, buying all the houses and then flipping them. They also behind all that ugly suburban sprawl we are seeing in the far east side. We had tight close neighborhoods in this city. With neighborhood grocery stores and other small Shops,  community areas, churches serving as central pieces of the neighborhood and community. And now that is going away. We are being handed soulless suburbs, created by out of town era who don’t understand the collectivist traditional community oriented way of living we have here. Or they understand it. They just look at it as backwards. 

Look at how they are trying to destroy our historical neighborhoods to put some steel box for sports events or whatever they are trying do? But we are stuck in the past and our old backwards ways because we refuse that right ?  So yeah we feel like we are being colonized once again. I know it’s kinda cringe to say that. But that is how it feels like to some of us. Has this not happen to us before ? People from far away showing up and telling our ways are backward, we need to modernize and then using this area to profit from of us? The suburban sprawl is due to out of town developers realizing they can build Homes for cheap here (cheap materials and labor) then inflate the prices, make a lot of money and run away, leaving us with an inflated housing market and soulless suburbs. And who is helping them do that? Well people like you. And you trying to justify it by saying things were not good back where you were at and so you had come here and cause issues in the areas does not make it any better. Mf you think we are not struggling out here too? Not trying to get into the oppression Olympics thing. But I am pretty sure we are way worse than whoever these transplants are coming from.

“ . I promise you most of this town's ancestors aren't from here either unless you're pure indigenous.”

We have been here since before the US was even a country. El Paso, Las Cruces, Juárez, Chiahuahua city and other small towns in the area are connected and part of the same region. We descend from the Spaniards who founded these towns and the indigenous people who have always lived here. See what I mean. Now you come a community older than the US itself and tell us we are not from here? ",-1,2024-06-08 16:20:10 UTC

What are you going to college for? I'm probably going back and I wanted to share my plan. WGU is online; it's cheaper than universities and if you can do it, much faster. I know not all degrees are offered but I've heard great things from there.

Let me expand my comment: UTEP is cheap for a university but on average cost about $550 per credit hour was what I was seeing, and it seemed to average over 8k a semester. WGU averages about $400 a credit if you take the typical class load. If you want, WGU is self paced and allows you to take classes at a faster rate so you can drive that price down even further. The semesters are 6 months long too, so taking more classes quickly is more viable

Edit: Why the downvotes? Education is scary and expensive. I didn't me sharing a university that's known not being expensive would be viewed negatively. WGU is self paced so you can do it one or two semesters if you want.",6,2024-06-08 08:07:26 UTC

It's just a vocal minority that have no idea how things actually work that make it seem more prevalent than it actually is. 

In my life I've been lucky enough to always understand other people's opinions are fickle and hollow things. You do what you do and do your best to be a good person and if someone takes issue with that, that's on them. You could tear yourself apart and people still wouldn't be happy. I make a point that ""transplant"" is a perversion of language that whether people like you realize it or not has inherent ideas wrapped up in it. It comes wrapped with the idea that being native grants you rights others don't have (it doesn't), that you somehow deserve access to housing before other people (that's only given based on the seller and financial merit), that people from other states or towns are ""transplants"" because they don't belong here, or that ""transplants"" somehow aren't interested in seeing housing become more affordable everywhere. People that use ""transplant"" in a derogatory way really aren't thinking at that's my point.

Get the utilities transferred to a new name and let them sue a dead person all they want (they won't, again, assuming there is no estate to sue).

 Concentrating poverty in areas has proven to beget more poverty. It's a lesson the Northeast experienced the hard way. I say experienced and not learned because the Roosevelt projects just got what amounted to an expensive coat of paint instead of a demolition and dense redevelopment that mixed affordable units with market rate units, focusing walkability and some park space.

The exemption is only from getting an outdoor amplified sound permit, not from the entire noise ordinance. The ballpark’s amplification/speaker system, and that of any large venue, is already designed by a sound engineer, which is essentially what the permit requires.

The new language on measurement location specifies that the measurement takes place at the property line of the property producing the noise, not “wherever they choose”.

I did do extensive research about the issue including comparisons to many other cities (we are on the lenient end of things, even after these changes). I also borrowed a decibel meter from Code Enforcement and went out to take measurements for myself, both ambient and during more noisy hours.

Also note that I was not the one who proposed these amendments, though I did support them. In 2023, the Council chose to hire an outside expert (the Responsible Hospitality Institute, a nonprofit nightlife ecosystem/social economy consultant) to study El Paso’s specific noise nuisance situation, along with other aspects of our nighttime economy, and make recommendations. RHI conducted a significant amount of research and public outreach, including more than 40 public meetings, and these were the recommendations that they developed as a result of that process, which they presented as the El Paso’s Sociable City Assessment. You can find their full report and more info about RHI here: https://www.sociablecity.solutions/el-paso/home

We did not lower the dB(A) standard of 70dB, though we did add a new standard for dB(C), which for these purposes means bass/low end vibrations. At the end of the day, these were fairly minor changes that allow for more public involvement in the permitting process, simpler enforcement of the existing standards, and stricter penalties for repeated violators. Those who currently don’t violate the standard, which we didn’t make any lower, shouldn’t have anything to worry about as these changes will have little to no impact on them.",2,2024-12-28 22:10:11 UTC

Although it was voted in unanimously by city council in 2012, it was never actually implemented.

Some ideas were pretty grand (re-envisioning the railyards by magoffin as a central, landmark park with a lake and boats, for one) but there were all sorts of thought-out details to make new constructions more aesthetically pleasing and cohesive while still being  faithful to the city’s unique culture and history.

I can’t recommend it enough, they really did a beautiful job and clearly put so much work into it. The only thing that stands out to me in the plan is the abundant greenery used in the building renderings lol (the firm is from Coral Gables, FL).

They also made different recommendations for each area/zone based on its history and needs. 

You can download the plan [here](https://www.doverkohl.com/plan-el-paso)

In another note, San Jacinto Plaza has been so popular since the renovations, and it’s really cool to see how it’s organically become this job where all sorts of people like to gather for various reasons throughout the day and night. I personally would love to see more placitas with a central kiosko, food vendors, and retail, bars, coffee shops, and dining around its perimeter - it’s one of the improvements the city’s made that it seems like most people can agree on!

Five years ago we did some detailed research and settled on H.A.R.T. who supplied us an American Standard (same as Trane, a well regarded brand and built on the same assembly line in Texas). For our 2100sf single-level home with 12' ceilings throughout we wanted a higher SEER rating than the bottom of the heap and our system was rated at 15 SEER.  The 5-ton compressor mounted on a ground pad and was mated to a new American Standard heater with variable speed blower and programmable thermostat. We added the replacement of 13 registers for better temperature control throughout the house.  Our 220V electrical run was only about 20' and buried outside.

Note that some companies try to sell you higher tonnage than needed. This often causes your unit to freeze and stop working

If you get a quote ask how they determine their tonnage needs. 

High/Chapel ceilings will make you get .5 more tonnage.

Also, check what kind of reviews have been left for each one. I'd also look up the brands of the units they offer. Look on the internet for what the retail price is for these units. You can also look at Angie's List for the average cost for installing an HVAC unit at a residential home.

Honestly, I went with Kings Aire because of my prior experience with them. 

Some things to consider when choosing the right installer.

  - make sure they are licensed and bonded
  - make sure they provide you with the city permit for the installation. That permit is meant to protect the customer. A city inspector will come out to your home to inspect the work that the crew did. They'll bless off on the work if it was done right. Also, insurance companies require it if you have to file a home insurance claim.

Came for military and ended up staying because I wanted to pursue nursing and it was way easier to get into school here then back home in California.

El Paso has a lot of positive. I'm Anglo and don't speak Spanish and for the most part it's never been an issue. Families I serve are almost always pleasant and treat me like family.

Traffic has good and bad. For the most part you can go all over the city at a decent rate of speed so getting anywhere here is a breeze. The down side is that there is zero effort from City/EPPD to enforce laws on uninsured motorists, vehicles that are unsafe to be on road, Chihuahua plates vehicles, etc. EPPD also doesn't enforce/check paper plate checks either. So if you own a vehicle that only stays in El Paso, you technically never need to register it. People print out fake dealer plates and use them on their cars forever and since they avoid registering their vehicles you can bet they aren't insured. 

I worked closely with law enforcement as a nurse and can tell you that they have zero incentive to pull over someone with Chihuahua plates which gives some really awful drivers with unsafe vehicles freedom to do whatever they want. That said, not all drivers from Chihuahua are bad drivers.

I-10, 54, Spur and loop 375 are pretty nice to drive on, but outside of that the roads in El Paso are pretty awful. I've lived all over the country and never seen roads as bad as here. Also, if you're used to states like Arizona, New Mexico and California that have road engineers that plan for the future get ready for El Paso. Our city engineers that plan streets aren't the brightest. Get ready to see left hand turn lanes that were only built to accommodate three cars at a time that feed communities with 5,000 homes.

For housing, yes it's technically cheaper for the price of home but don't let that fool you. Objectively, I believe El Paso may have the highest (or near) property tax rate in Texas and the country. The property tax you'll pay on a $200,000 home here is the same as you would pay on a $600,000 home in Arizona/California/Washington. Rent is higher here too.

Drive down the exact middle of every parking lot entrance/exit and lanes leaving no room for opposing traffic.
Swing wide on every left turn, meaning they will advance into your lane to make a simple left as if they were driving a massive 18 wheeler.
Habitual lane steppers. El Paso drivers constantly have their passenger side tires invading into another lane and will swerve about nonchalantly as they text.

I just moved to central.

I spent last year looking for places on my weekends with a $750/mo budget and in that time couldn't find anything that looked good, and by good I just mean clean and not broken appliances and massive insulation problems.

I am married and moved here 3 days after my wedding from SC, so I can’t speak to the dating scene, but I can speak to 2 and 3. My husband and I got a chocolate lab and it’s a very dog friendly place. We don’t take him to restaurants because covid, but the weather is beautiful for walks and playing at the dog parks. We live on the west side and don’t have any complaints having a dog here. We rent a house with a yard which helps with that. Housing and cost of living is insanely affordable. I miss our friends and families a lot, but we haven’t gotten any salary offers that are enticing enough to move back. We are looking to move because of family and we’re closer to having kids, but EP is growing on me and I could stay another year or two. The community is very welcoming and friendly. People are incredibly friendly and nice from passing people in my neighborhood, to my coworkers, the cashiers at Target, and bartenders pretty much everywhere I’ve been. Friend’s families have opened their homes as if we’ve known them forever. I choose to isolate myself a bit, but still have made friends very easily through work. It did take me about a year and a half to actually like living here because I really missed my friend group and my sister in SC. The pandemic made me feel a bit depressed because I haven’t been able to visit them and normally would have flown back to my former city at least three times by now since last March. That’s been really hard, but I sure didn’t expect a pandemic when I moved here. I didn’t realize how much I like living here until we started looking to leave, though. I miss my friends, but I think I like the weather more here lol. As for traffic, it’s crappy on my way home and I do think the drivers are worse. My car was totaled in my neighborhood and I have had multiple near accidents from people ignoring stop signs or running very red lights, so you have to be super alert. If your family is here, I’d say go for it. Maybe wait to buy a house and rent for a year first, but why not. If you hate it, you can always move back to Michigan.

Should I move back to EP?,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/nxk2xt/should_i_move_back_to_ep/,2021-06-11 16:30:06 UTC,I’ve been back a few times to see family since leaving but I haven’t really explored much. We’re visiting in early July and will hopefully get to look around some. We both have degrees in theatre but aren’t necessarily looking for a jobs/careers in that field right now. My partner is from San Antonio so I feel like he might get bored with EP even if it’s grown since I’ve left,2,2021-06-11 21:29:35 UTC

Considering moving to EP. Looking for honest opinions,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/nb3e0j/considering_moving_to_ep_looking_for_honest/,2021-05-13 00:06:46 UTC,"Lived here for 5 years, don't hate it but don't love it either. Since you're familiar with the weather, I won't talk about the heat/wind/dust. 

Pros: 

The people. I have rarely run into anyone and thought ""wow, what a dick."" I did come from Florida though so it possibly puts that into perspective

The food. If you like authentic Mexican, there's no shortage. Although you may have to look harder for international places, they're definitely here and growing in number. 

Getting around. People who haven't lived anywhere else complain, but honestly being able to get anywhere in 30-45 minutes or less even in heavier traffic is amazing. 

Keeping active. From hiking and mountain biking to a fairly active adult sports scene, you can usually find something you're into.

No income tax. Self explanatory. 

Not politically charged. You'll find a lot of diversity in that regard here, but it seems to be lower on the ""importance"" scale if that makes sense.

Cons:

Distance from the rest of the world. I like to travel and it usually means by air if you want to go anywhere other than Albuquerque or Phoenix. Shipping usually takes an extra day to get here, and produce seems to spoil more quickly. 

Property taxes: It seems like the city's solution to every budgetary issue is to hike property taxes. Lots of people are getting upset about it, and even if you don't own a home it means higher rent. 

The hustle game. Income here is on the lower end, and even though COL is cheaper here, people still have to do what they can to get ahead. Lots of door to door stuff, and selling or buying from local listings gets really obnoxious sometimes (as it probably does most places). 

Internet. My particular neighborhood doesn't have many options in the way of ISP, so we pay higher than the national average for that. Water also costs a good bit here as you'd expect.",19,2021-05-13 00:40:22 UTC

Here are my pros/cons (for reference, lived in El Paso until 18, moved to Seattle, came back last year) 


As far as weather goes it’s pretty hot most of the time. Right now for example it’s getting into the mid 90s. 
Most people here are laid back, but get used to Hispanic culture. You’ll hear Spanish more than English here, so it would be good to learn stuff. 
If you go out, nightlife is ok. The city is very spread out but there’s good bars/clubs on most sides of town. You’re gonna need a car if you move here. Like I said everything is super spread out abs public transportation is virtually non existent here. Lots of cool trails and hiking spots. Finding a job here is virtually impossible unless you know someone, even with a degree.",6,2021-05-13 00:55:26 UTC

Looking for honest opinions,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/nb3e0j/considering_moving_to_ep_looking_for_honest/,2021-05-13 00:06:46 UTC,I would say that you need to take a look at the taxing area you might wish to live in.  The highest portion of the property tax is the school system. The current housing boom has the local appraisal district raising the price of home values to generate tax revenue. One fix is to live in a smaller town area of the county where growth and taxes won't shoot up by leaps and bounds. Inside the city of El Paso there is a buying frenzy occurring and that has made rates increase drastically.  All parts of the city are accessible within a reasonable driving distance so make your choice wisely. The comments above are good points and there are always pros and cons to it all. I have lived here most of my life and it would be hard to say how it compares to other locations so I will leave it to others. Good luck.,1,2021-05-13 21:34:45 UTC
