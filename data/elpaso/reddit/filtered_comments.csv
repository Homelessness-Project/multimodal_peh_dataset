Where to eat if homeless?,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/1bpg7j0/where_to_eat_if_homeless/,2024-03-27 23:15:27 UTC,"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different DK gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for two years, rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a place to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have a nice day.And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the way until she had the money to get her own place. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a place and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another DK, had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for about a year and a half. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",22,2024-03-28 02:25:24 UTC,homeless

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable place of comfort and refuge.

More housing is important for all of us across the board really, not just the homeless. And not just affordable housing—studies have shown time and time again that more housing of any kind actually brings the cost of all types of housing down. The most important thing that cities can do right now is to amend zoning laws so that we can build with more density! That means more apartment buildings, more duplexes, etc., rather than just single-family homes with lawns. The only people who might suffer from such changes are investors, which might explain why we struggle so much to make these fixes.

I’m really no expert on the issue of homelessness, but it is something that I’ve been reading and trying to learn more about over the past couple years. It’s indisputable that rates of alcohol and drug abuse among the homeless are much higher than among the general population, but the issue of cause and effect certainly remains controversial. I’ve seen studies placing addiction as the second-most significant cause of homelessness, while others put it significantly further down the list. What’s certain though is that getting people out of homelessness once they’re already experiencing it becomes much more difficult if they’re suffering from addiction on top of it.",2,2022-10-26 14:26:18 UTC,"homeless, homelessness, affordable housing"

There is a feeling out here that a Hispanic will never be homeless because we are too prideful and hardworking, and that only white people end up homeless because they are lazy and want handouts. When in reality a lot of people who are homeless, Hispanic or not, do work, and have jobs. They are usually homeless due to addiction and mental illness, many times both. 

By the way the reason why you will see more white homeless than Hispanic homeless, is because white American culture is very individualistic, at 18 they kick you out of home and you are on your own, you are shamed if you still live at home as an adult if you are a white American. I worked with a girl who lived in a car and she proudly stated that at least she is not living at mom's house as an adult like many of us where. Also many white Americans will disown family members who are involved in drugs other shit, so many of these people really have no where else to go. The same is not with Hispanics. Hispanic culture is very collectivist, you always have a place at mom's house, no matter what, and if she kicks you out, aunt will take you in, or your cousin, or your grandma. Hispanics for the most part are never at risk of being homeless because someone's couch in your family is always open. Most homes here are not only multigenerational, but extended family members usually live together as well. Grandma's house is usually occupied by aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, everyone. Not to mention, family friends usually become members of the family, so friends here will take you in as well if you need to. We are very community oriented. And even if you are involved in drugs, crimes, whatever, family usually turns a blind eye, which I admit is an issue, but preferable to disownment.

So yeah mix white American individualism with poverty, drug addiction and untreated mental illness and that is how you end up with so many white homeless people. We should not bash them for that, but it is one of the reasons why I personally hate White American culture so much, and why I feel we should fight to keep the Southwest Hispanic and our traditions alive as much as we can, as asshole as that sounds.",4,2023-06-20 01:54:35 UTC,homeless

We have a homeless epidemic, I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can help and often volunteer about once a month or so, I've seen first hand how many we have and the fact that its considered a good low number is twisted. Obviously Texas has a significantly better government than California and New York so it isn't as bad here as there but our numbers should be what those two states experience and ours should be near nonexistent. 

  
Japan has managed to essentially eradicate homelessness with a worse GDP to population than we have, no excuses for the USA to not have done the same thing. Being in a profit over humanity country really sucks sometimes. We got all the money in the world to give to useless foreign countries that do not help us and set up camps for migrants who will never see citizenship because we've designed it as a tax write off instead of an immigration point, but none to spend to help our people, not just with homelessness but education, healthcare, and literally everything under the sun all the way down to school supplies for teachers.

For those of us who support open borders and mass immigration, it's time for us to stop virtue signaling and put our feelings of altruism into action.  We need to open up our own personal wallets, hearts, and homes to these poor, suffering people.

So if you voted for a Democrat in a federal or state election, please donate money, food, time, and clothing, and above all offer to shelter one or more of these poor homeless immigrants in your own house or apartment.  If you live elsewhere in the state or even out of state far from the southern border, please donate money and clothes (until it hurts) while offering to take people in if they travel to your home area.

If you believe that altruism is a moral ideal and that Americans need to come together and help the poor at home and abroad, then surely you feel (or should be feeling) a duty to sacrifice your personal selfish interests to help these poor people.  

The federal government is not going to be able to handle this competently, and state and local governments simply don't have the resources.  But if we hold true to our feelings and give of ourselves and open up our hearts and our homes, we can make a real difference.  It's time for those of us who voted for the Democrats to directly face the [practical aspects of our political advocacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE) rather than push the costs of our charitable feelings onto our fellow Americans who advocated for different policy.",1,2022-12-21 15:59:16 UTC,homeless

He gave lots of tips and great advice!

Here's what I remember:

* Save your money, don't join that gym just for the showers. This guy advised hitting up one of those trucker depot centers. The only one I know of is on the corner of Horizon Blvd and I-10. A long ways, but there might be others?! Not sure. He recommended those places because showering is simpler and cheaper than just joining a gym for shower rights. Plus you'll raise fewer suspicions for looking like shit.

* If you are going to live in your car a while, keep it as tidy, clean and comfortable as possible. Nothing says HOMELESS like crazy wrinkled clothes and terribly body odor!

* GOT A JOB? If not, keep some clean clothes elsewhere. Clean clothes to go to interviews in. Clean clothes to go to work in.

---
There was lots more, but I can't find the post :(

My own advice:

* Having your dog will make things really tough for you. You are trying to take care of yourself AND your dog. You both gotta eat, sleep AND stay healthy. Winter months coming up, and you can not prioritize taking care of yourself if you are caring for your dog also. My advice: beg your wife to just keep your dog. You really have no friends or family? If you do, I hope they can care for your dog for a while, while you get your self together.

* Avoid walmart parking lots. Even if they don't call the police, I'm sure they DO write down your plates. PLUS I don't know what the vagrancy or loitering laws are. Best to be careful. You don't want that showing up later.",1,2015-10-12 22:22:10 UTC,homeless

""My taxes shouldn't be used to build your housing""=> They won't. This project is privately funded  and owned. The developer competes for Low income Housing Tax Credits which are purchased by investors to offset their taxes. The Tax Credit proceeds are used as an additional source of funds to complete the construction. The LIHTC program was started in 1986 to incentivize the building of affordable housing. Can someone remind me the name of the president who signed this legislation into law? /s

""Section 8 housing attracts crime"" -> There is no evidence for this claim AND this is not going to be Section 8 housing.

""These people live in the 'program' and never get out""-> This is not a housing program. People who live in these communities earn between 50% and 80% of the Area Median Income. A family of 4 earning 60% of AMI makes $45K/year in El Paso.  They apply to live here like any other apartment complex and they qualify after a thorough background check and a review of their income status. They pay rent like any other renter, just at a reduced rate. The family of 4 above would pay about  $1,100 per month for a 3 BR unit.

""They were supposed to build a school here""  -> EPISD is shrinking not expanding. Putnam, the closest school in this neighborhood, is at risk of shutting down due to a diminishing student population. By bringing new families to the area, we can improve this vacant lot and potentially save our local school. The alternative is a shuttered elementary school and a vacant lot.

This project will increase traffic in the area.: - >There are over 700 multifamily units within 300 yards of this proposed community. Adding 100 more will have little if no impact on traffic.

Just because you live on the westside or a certain neighborhood, doesn't mean you are more special that anyone else or deserve special treatment. 

Aside from that, affordable housing like this one does not bring crime with it. 

One of the worst things California has done is driven out folks that can't live there with this mentality of saying how people shouldn't live on gov handouts and gov housing like yourself. These folks aren't going to permanently live in these conditions, these programs are set up to help progress in their life.",-4,2024-05-08 22:31:18 UTC,affordable housing

Sure, it looks great on paper and I bet some do benefit from this, but to pretend that this also doesn’t attract shitty people is a lie. Also, not everyone who qualifies for affordable housing (AH) is because they were “unlucky.” There are shitty ass people who made bad decisions and because of that, now qualify for AH. Of course, that’s isn’t EVERYONE who could use AH, but let’s not deny that AH doesn’t also bring hoodlums. I can see why people wouldnt want that in the neighborhood. My sister lived in AH with her kids. Husband was a drug addict who didn’t work. She got into the AH, and then brought the same shitty drug-addicted husband to live there.

It's genuinely insane and ignorant that people think that housing developments like this one attract crime. There is no evidence that affordable housing brings crime to a neighborhood.

People with obtuse thinking and secluded perspectives like yourself think that developments like this one bring crime, drugs, or violence as if a cartel was moving into the neighborhood when in reality it's folks that are genuinely trying to make it day by day. I'd really evaluate and dig in really deep into the statistics and facts about these types of developments before making any unfounded generalizations like the one you just made.

"It's annoying how much ""transplant"" hate people have here",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/1dawl0k/its_annoying_how_much_transplant_hate_people_have/,2024-06-08 06:36:09 UTC,"Most of the hate y’all receive on here is due to the fact that the culture on this subreddit is not really El Pasoan. Most of there people, at least the most outspoken members of this subreddit come from well off, out of town background with no roots to the border. And then y’all try to speak for us. Which is what bothers people. Specially when people come here and ask about the city or issues from the area.   

Examples would, Spanish. El Paso Reddit will tell you, you don’t need Spanish in this city. And this subreddit has been dragged for y’all saying that. KLAQ had people bashing this place for that. You do need Spanish here. There is a lot of people here who are monolingual, even the local native tribe, their elders only speak Spanish. A lot of our parents here don’t speak English.  And how many of us went to school with ESL kids who could barely say a few sentences in English? They still have not learned English. Not to mention the people who cross from Juárez everyday to spend money. That is why businesses want you to speak Spanish . Outside of the government hospitals, you rarely can get a job in the medical field if you don’t speak Spanish. Even the Koreans in downtown speak Spanish. But the transplants will say you don’t need to learn it. And you don’t if you plan on having a white collar government job like most of them do and you plan to live in the west side. But say you are working class, have no degree and can only afford to live in central or lower valley ? Tell me not knowing Spanish won’t hurt you.    

There is also a feeling like you guys refuse to understand the culture or that you look down on it as backward. “Why is there so many Jesus loves you signs  everywhere?” Y’all didn’t know most of the population here is super religious? Even LGBT members have huge statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in their homes. “omg why is there so many dogs running around?” lol wait till you see how things are in Juarez, in regards to street dogs. “Why do my neighbors have roosters and chickens! Omg is that even allowed!?” I don’t think so, but we don’t care. “My neighbor just brought a goat to his backyard, wait are they killing it !” Complaints about the “mañana culture” (I’ll do it tomorrow) and very slow paced relax feel of the place. We are a city with a small town mentality. Even a ranch mentality. We do have a “third world” mindset as well. Which bothers people not from here.   

What bothers me the most is how transplants and I would say even upper middle class locals outright deny some of the issues this city faces simply because they don’t have to deal with them. I have heard El Paso does not have a homeless issue. Y’all seen Dyer ? Or all the homeless encampments in the northeast? People will come and ask about the migrant crisis. And transplants and well off locals will laugh it off , saying there is no migrant crisis. Bros, in the northeast we have a whole ass homeless war because there was so many migrants coming in that they pushed the homeless out of the shelters and they came to the northeast. There was a fight for resources out in the streets. There was also masses of migrants just dropped on low income areas of céntral and the NE. There was gang wars between local gangs and Venezuelan gangs. When the FBI noted this. But you ask People on here about it? It never happened. Of course if you are on the west side you never saw what was happening in the Lower valley and Northeast parts of town.   

Transplants will also deny the crime and gang issue. “There is gangs in El Paso ?” Meanwhile cartels are recruiting heavily from youth street gangs everyday in El Paso. And people are losing their sons to this. There is women in the Lower valley and northeast who have been raped, beat, robbed, but some upper middle class UTEP girl Or wife of a transplant will say these things don’t happen here. There is huge disconnect between the working and poor parts of town and the upper middle class areas where most transplants live.  

 Lastly there is a general feeling that we are being “colonized” once again. Out of town companies are coming in, buying all the houses and then flipping them. They also behind all that ugly suburban sprawl we are seeing in the far east side. We had tight close neighborhoods in this city. With neighborhood grocery stores and other small Shops,  community areas, churches serving as central pieces of the neighborhood and community. And now that is going away. We are being handed soulless suburbs, created by out of town era who don’t understand the collectivist traditional community oriented way of living we have here. Or they understand it. They just look at it as backwards. 

Look at how they are trying to destroy our historical neighborhoods to put some steel box for sports events or whatever they are trying do? But we are stuck in the past and our old backwards ways because we refuse that right ?  So yeah we feel like we are being colonized once again. I know it’s kinda cringe to say that. But that is how it feels like to some of us. Has this not happen to us before ? People from far away showing up and telling our ways are backward, we need to modernize and then using this area to profit from of us? The suburban sprawl is due to out of town developers realizing they can build Homes for cheap here (cheap materials and labor) then inflate the prices, make a lot of money and run away, leaving us with an inflated housing market and soulless suburbs. And who is helping them do that? Well people like you. And you trying to justify it by saying things were not good back where you were at and so you had come here and cause issues in the areas does not make it any better. Mf you think we are not struggling out here too? Not trying to get into the oppression Olympics thing. But I am pretty sure we are way worse than whoever these transplants are coming from.

“ . I promise you most of this town's ancestors aren't from here either unless you're pure indigenous.”

We have been here since before the US was even a country. El Paso, Las Cruces, Juárez, Chiahuahua city and other small towns in the area are connected and part of the same region. We descend from the Spaniards who founded these towns and the indigenous people who have always lived here. See what I mean. Now you come a community older than the US itself and tell us we are not from here? ",-1,2024-06-08 16:20:10 UTC,homeless

Random point aside, you're 100% on the money that people moving here means the town expands in an economically beneficial way. The housing thing needs to be fixed. Affordable housing to be more pervasive, the 20th century saw a lot of red tape around zoning laws concerning affordable housing.

Does anyone know why our affordable housing options seem to be projects rather than a percentage of units like in other places? Is that also a Texas thing?

 Concentrating poverty in areas has proven to beget more poverty. It's a lesson the Northeast experienced the hard way. I say experienced and not learned because the Roosevelt projects just got what amounted to an expensive coat of paint instead of a demolition and dense redevelopment that mixed affordable units with market rate units, focusing walkability and some park space. It's off a bike lane, had a bus stop, and is near a BRIO stop. It would've been a good opportunity for the city to walk the walk with progress.",7,2024-12-27 20:46:56 UTC,affordable housing
