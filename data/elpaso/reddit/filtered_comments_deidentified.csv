[ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON],378,"[PERSON]. You don’t have to. But, spoiler: [ORGANIZATION] also has the same program to fly homeless people back to the mainland. The [ORGANIZATION] program though is about reuniting people with family who may be able to help them as well as the state providing some support once they arrive. Neither the [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] program are about simply dumping people but, the idea of sending homeless people to [ORGANIZATION] which has a very serious homeless problem to begin with did not sit well with residents.

Where to eat if homeless?,49,"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",22

Significant increase in the number of homeless people ,12,[ORGANIZATION] has recently passed laws that are making it more difficult for the homeless and panhandlers here and since the [ORGANIZATION] ruling on homeless camps the city has been breaking up homeless camps here so perhaps some of the homeless have moved next door to [PERSON].

Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,Yeah I once offered a homeless man a free meal. I'm an [ORGANIZATION] driver and I had a customer cancel so I had free food. He took one look at it and cursed me out and said he didn't want it.,13
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,Homelessness is only going to get worse.  Interest rates and housing costs are going up.  Minimum wage earners cannot afford housing anywhere in the country.  The city should stop wasting money on stadiums and theaters and use it to help people instead.,21
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"It’s rough out there for sure, homelessness is no joke. Rising housing costs and lack of access to any sort of social help really does take a toll on our homeless brothers and sisters. I’m sure there are those that show some aggression, but I mean I know some wealthy people who act the same [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] is advertised for our safety and our affordability, which is becoming less of a thing thanks to the city consistently selling out to corporations that can control pricing. The troubles are going to get worse before they get any better unless we start looking at them as people who are lacking and probably need those of us who can to help organizations that help them!",7
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I moved to [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] before the pandemic happened and I distinctly remember remarking to myself about how few homeless people the city seemed to have compared to many other places that I’ve lived before. Now DATE0 it seems more like every other big city in [PERSON]; that is to say, I’ve definitely noticed a significant increase.",3
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Been living in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] and the homeless population was fairly noticeable. After [ORGANIZATION] took office, the homeless population skyrocketed. I noticed a lot of those folks weren’t from the city or [PERSON] for that matter.

Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Some of these homeless people like to ask for free rides. they're coming from [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON], some of them are being homeless because the businesses that they work for get shut down, or they just suddenly run out of business. A friend of mine had two jobs. He lost one of his jobs because the business that he works for just got shut down. A lot of my friends are unable to afford rent or anything and a lot of people that I know are wanting to go to school to get s\*\*\* done. My parents are worried about losing the house, it's impossible to live out here. One of my cousins moved to GPE2 with his wife to get better jobs and they moved back because of how nasty the neighborhoods and the people are out there. homelessness is a big problem especially in [ORGANIZATION]. If you don't have money or a good paying job, you won't survive. Ppl are not smart enough to know how to get anything done. a lot of people have no education. they think hard work is going to pay the bills but they don't know how to be smart about it. and that's why a lot of senior citizens are coming back to the workforce because it's not as great as it sounds. !gif!gif!gif!gif!gif",0
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people. They often come to check out my apartment complex's dumpster in the evening, which I know because I can see from my window, and I see homeless people resting or signs of habitation underneath the bridges over train tracks and interstates and places like that.

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable [STREET] of comfort and refuge. 

[ORGANIZATION] is pretty bad for homeless too - it can be hard to even find a bathroom as someone with no car. I've been told to walk over a mile to use the bathroom before. Being homeless would be far worse.",0
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Things are not always as they appear. Don't assume they are homeless just because they approach and beg. In my experience in [ORGANIZATION] the true homeless sleeping on the sidewalks with the shopping carts don't ask for money.

Those guys on [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] are a team. I see them  get dropped off and picked up. It's basically a job. City authorities are well aware of this and do nothing about it.

And the ones that walk around downtown and ask for money do it [ORGANIZATION].",0
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I have noticed a lot more homeless here since the pandemic. Many of them are from out of town and unfortunately they bring their bad attitude with them. I've offered to get them food, but they refuse. Luckily none have cussed me out. Maybe because I'm over six feet tall...either [STREET] I hope they know that there are resources out there for help, but they're going to want to seek and want it.",1
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,That the dude who hangs out by the trolley stop and asks for money from drivers stopped at the stop sign? My father-in-law was visiting from [ORGANIZATION] and when he refused to give him money the panhandler started throwing racial slurs at him in Spanish (despite the fact that the dude looks Mexican/Mexican-American himself). My father-in-law just responded “por eso andas así de jodido” haha,44
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Not saying that those aren’t factors—they definitely are—but the truth is that the majority of homeless people are mentally ill, addicted to drugs, or both. If I had to guess I’d say this is especially the case when it comes to the individuals who tend to harass or get aggressive with other people as being discussed here.",7
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Yeah PERSON0 and PERSON1 battle is bad. I saw one of the homeless men relieving himself under the pass. I’ve seen another man tweaked out on drugs literally on the ground where he could get run over, had to swerve to not hit him (called 911 on him). I’ve had to call the fire dept when it’s cold because they just lay on the ground in freezing temps. It seems that now on every intersection I see more and more homeless. New faces from the ones in used to seeing. 
No idea how or what can be done, but something needs to be done. Not even sure where to offer donations.",3
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"lol has nothing to do with advertising, homelessness is a huge problem everywhere. People aren't choosing to go homeless because of a tagline, there isn't even tourism in [ORGANIZATION] hahaha",6
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I've been living in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and although the homeless population isn't nearly as bad as other major cities, I have noticed an increase since the pandemic. Not sure what the root cause is either. 

I speculate that a lot of homeless come from out of town and end up staying here because they noticed is so quiet and peaceful compared to say [PERSON] or GPE2.",9
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Yeah he really put emphasis on the horrible, and I had to keep my eye on him cuz he made me uncomfortable after that, but that was a while ago and I haven't seen em. One of few times a homeless guy ever made me feel that",3
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Friendly remember: most of us would be similar to our worst-selves if forced into homelessness, mental health issues, and substance abuse.

I'm sorry for your negative experience, but I'm grateful for your patience with those among us with the least.",3
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Homelessness happens when you have a city whose government ignores its most vulnerable population and not focus on improving people's material conditions. Start with more affordable housing, social programs to help drug addicts, free healthcare at the point of service, etc. 

They rely on drinking and drugs to numb the pain of living in the streets.",7
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I absolutely agree with all three of your suggestions. More housing is important for all of us across the board really, not just the homeless. And not just affordable housing—studies have shown time and time again that more housing of any kind actually brings the cost of all types of housing down. The most important thing that cities can do right now is to amend zoning laws so that we can build with more density! That means more apartment buildings, more duplexes, etc., rather than just single-family homes with lawns. The only people who might suffer from such changes are investors, which might explain why we struggle so much to make these fixes.

I’m really no expert on the issue of homelessness, but it is something that I’ve been reading and trying to learn more about over [ORGANIZATION]. It’s indisputable that rates of alcohol and drug abuse among the homeless are much higher than among the general population, but the issue of cause and effect certainly remains controversial. I’ve seen studies placing addiction as the second-most significant cause of homelessness, while others put it significantly further down the list. What’s certain though is that getting people out of homelessness once they’re already experiencing it becomes much more difficult if they’re suffering from addiction on top of it.",2
Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"Haha do what about it? Type another snarky remark on the internet? NOPE. None of you soy boys intimidate me anyway. Homeless issues affects all working classes from all walks of life, liberal or not. So what if I posted it here?  There are plenty of ""right wing badasses"" in [ORGANIZATION].

I genuinely do not believe you’re doing this in good faith. You have a lot to learn before even attempting this project if you’re even the slightest bit genuine about wanting to help people.",1
Where can I find homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,0,"He is just being an asshole. There is a feeling out here that a Hispanic will never be homeless because we are too prideful and hardworking, and that only white people end up homeless because they are lazy and want handouts. When in reality a lot of people who are homeless, Hispanic or not, do work, and have jobs. They are usually homeless due to addiction and mental illness, many times both. 

By the [STREET] the reason why you will see more white homeless than Hispanic homeless, is because white American culture is very individualistic, at [ORGANIZATION] they kick you out of home and you are on your own, you are shamed if you still live at home as an adult if you are a white American. I worked with a girl who lived in a car and she proudly stated that at least she is not living at mom's house as an adult like many of us where. Also many white Americans will disown family members who are involved in drugs other shit, so many of these people really have no where else to go. The same is not with Hispanics. Hispanic culture is very collectivist, you always have a [STREET] at mom's house, no matter what, and if she kicks you out, aunt will take you in, or your cousin, or your grandma. Hispanics for the most part are never at risk of being homeless because someone's couch in your family is always open. Most homes here are not only multigenerational, but extended family members usually live together as well. [PERSON]'s house is usually occupied by aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, everyone. Not to mention, family friends usually become members of the family, so friends here will take you in as well if you need to. We are very community oriented. And even if you are involved in drugs, crimes, whatever, family usually turns a blind eye, which I admit is an issue, but preferable to disownment.

So yeah mix white American individualism with poverty, drug addiction and untreated mental illness and that is how you end up with so many white homeless people. We should not bash them for that, but it is one of the reasons why I personally hate White American culture so much, and why I feel we should fight to keep the Southwest Hispanic and our traditions alive as much as we can, as asshole as that sounds.",4

Housing The Immigrants,3,"This problem is too large to be solved by government alone.  For those of us who support open borders and mass immigration, it's time for us to stop virtue signaling and put our feelings of altruism into action.  We need to open up our own personal wallets, hearts, and homes to these poor, suffering people.

So if you voted for a Democrat in a federal or state election, please donate money, food, time, and clothing, and above all offer to shelter one or more of these poor homeless immigrants in your own house or apartment.  If you live elsewhere in the state or even out of state far from the southern border, please donate money and clothes (until it hurts) while offering to take people in if they travel to your home area.

If you believe that altruism is a moral ideal and that Americans need to come together and help the poor at home and abroad, then surely you feel (or should be feeling) a duty to sacrifice your personal selfish interests to help these poor people.  

The federal government is not going to be able to handle this competently, and state and local governments simply don't have the resources.  But if we hold true to our feelings and give of ourselves and open up our hearts and our homes, we can make a real difference.

Here's what I remember:

* Save your money, don't join that gym just for the showers. This guy advised hitting up one of those trucker depot centers. The only one I know of is on the corner of FAC0 and FAC1. A long ways, but there might be others?! Not sure. He recommended those places because showering is simpler and cheaper than just joining a gym for shower rights. Plus you'll raise fewer suspicions for looking like shit.

* If you are going to live in your car a while, keep it as tidy, clean and comfortable as possible. Nothing says HOMELESS like crazy wrinkled clothes and terribly body odor!

* GOT A JOB? If not, keep some clean clothes elsewhere. Clean clothes to go to interviews in. Clean clothes to go to work in.

There was lots more, but I can't find the post :(

My own advice:

* Having your dog will make things really tough for you. You are trying to take care of yourself AND your dog. You both gotta eat, sleep AND stay healthy. DATE0 coming up, and you can not prioritize taking care of yourself if you are caring for your dog also. My advice: beg your wife to just keep your dog. You really have no friends or family? If you do, I hope they can care for your dog for a while, while you get your self together.

* Avoid ORG0 parking lots. Even if they don't call the police, I'm sure they [ORGANIZATION] write down your plates. PLUS I don't know what the vagrancy or loitering laws are. Best to be careful. You don't want that showing up later.",1

""My taxes shouldn't be used to build your housing""=> They won't. This project is privately funded  and owned. The developer competes for Low income [ORGANIZATION] which are purchased by investors to offset their taxes. [ORGANIZATION] proceeds are used as an additional source of funds to complete the construction. The LIHTC program was started in [ORGANIZATION] to incentivize the building of affordable housing. Can someone remind me the name of the president who signed this legislation into law? /s

""Section 8 housing attracts crime"" -> There is no evidence for this claim AND this is not going to be Section 8 housing.

""These people live in the 'program' and never get out""-> This is not a housing program. People who live in these communities earn between 50% and 80% of [ORGANIZATION]. A family of 4 earning 60% of [ORGANIZATION] makes $45K/year in [ORGANIZATION].  They apply to live here like any other apartment complex and they qualify after a thorough background check and a review of their income status. They pay rent like any other renter, just at a reduced rate. The family of 4 above would pay about  $1,100 per month for a 3 [ORGANIZATION] unit.

""They were supposed to build a school here""  -> ORG0 is shrinking not expanding. [PERSON], the closest school in this neighborhood, is at risk of shutting down due to a diminishing student population. By bringing new families to the area, we can improve this vacant lot and potentially save our local school. The alternative is a shuttered elementary school and a vacant lot.

This project will increase traffic in the area.: - >There are over 700 multifamily units within 300 yards of this proposed community. Adding 100 more will have little if no impact on traffic.

Aside from that, affordable housing like this one does not bring crime with it.

"It's annoying how much ""transplant"" hate people have here",31,"Most of the hate y’all receive on here is due to the fact that the culture on this subreddit is not really [ORGANIZATION]an. Most of there people, at least the most outspoken members of this subreddit come from well off, out of town background with no roots to the border. And then y’all try to speak for us. Which is what bothers people. Specially when people come here and ask about the city or issues from the area.   

[PERSON] would, Spanish. [PERSON] will tell you, you don’t need Spanish in this city. And this subreddit has been dragged for y’all saying that. [PERSON] had people bashing this [STREET] for that. You do need Spanish here. There is a lot of people here who are monolingual, even the local native tribe, their elders only speak Spanish. A lot of our parents here don’t speak English.  And how many of us went to school with [ORGANIZATION] kids who could barely say a few sentences in English? They still have not learned English. Not to mention the people who cross from [PERSON] to spend money. That is why businesses want you to speak Spanish . Outside of the government hospitals, you rarely can get a job in the medical field if you don’t speak Spanish. Even the Koreans in downtown speak Spanish. But the transplants will say you don’t need to learn it. And you don’t if you plan on having a white collar government job like most of them do and you plan to live in [ORGANIZATION]. But say you are working class, have no degree and can only afford to live in central or lower valley ? Tell me not knowing Spanish won’t hurt you.    

There is also a feeling like you guys refuse to understand the culture or that you look down on it as backward. “Why is there so many [ORGANIZATION] loves you signs  everywhere?” Y’all didn’t know most of the population here is super religious? Even [ORGANIZATION] members have huge statues of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] in their homes. “omg why is there so many dogs running around?” lol wait till you see how things are in GPE2, in regards to [STREET] dogs. “Why do my neighbors have roosters and chickens! [PERSON] is that even allowed!?” I don’t think so, but we don’t care. “My neighbor just brought a goat to his backyard, wait are they killing it !” Complaints about the “mañana culture” (I’ll do it DATE1) and very slow paced relax feel of the [STREET]. We are a city with a small town mentality. Even a ranch mentality. We do have a “third world” mindset as well. Which bothers people not from here.   

What bothers me the most is how transplants and I would say even upper middle class locals outright deny some of the issues this city faces simply because they don’t have to deal with them. I have heard [ORGANIZATION] does not have a homeless issue. Y’all seen PERSON2 ? Or all the homeless encampments in the northeast? People will come and ask about the migrant crisis. And transplants and well off locals will laugh it off , saying there is no migrant crisis. Bros, in the northeast we have a whole ass homeless war because there was so many migrants coming in that they pushed the homeless out of the shelters and they came to the northeast. There was a fight for resources out in the streets. There was also masses of migrants just dropped on low income areas of [LOCATION] and the LOC2. There was gang wars between local gangs and Venezuelan gangs. When the [PERSON] noted this. But you ask People on here about it? It never happened. Of course if you are on [ORGANIZATION] you never saw what was happening in the [PERSON] and [PERSON] parts of town.   

Transplants will also deny the crime and gang issue. “There is gangs in [ORGANIZATION] ?” Meanwhile cartels are recruiting heavily from youth [STREET] gangs [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And people are losing their sons to this. There is women in the [PERSON] and northeast who have been raped, beat, robbed, but some upper middle class ORG3 girl Or wife of a transplant will say these things don’t happen here. There is huge disconnect between the working and poor parts of town and the upper middle class areas where most transplants live.  

 Lastly there is a general feeling that we are being “colonized” once again. Out of town companies are coming in, buying all the houses and then flipping them. They also behind all that ugly suburban sprawl we are seeing in the far east side. We had tight close neighborhoods in this city. With neighborhood grocery stores and other small [LOCATION],  community areas, churches serving as central pieces of the neighborhood and community. And now that is going away. We are being handed soulless suburbs, created by out of town era who don’t understand the collectivist traditional community oriented [STREET] of living we have here. Or they understand it. They just look at it as backwards. 

Look at how they are trying to destroy our historical neighborhoods to put some steel box for sports events or whatever they are trying do? But we are stuck in the past and our old backwards ways because we refuse that right ?  So yeah we feel like we are being colonized once again. I know it’s kinda cringe to say that. But that is how it feels like to some of us. Has this not happen to us before ? People from far away showing up and telling our ways are backward, we need to modernize and then using this area to profit from of us? The suburban sprawl is due to out of town developers realizing they can build Homes for cheap here (cheap materials and labor) then inflate the prices, make a lot of money and run away, leaving us with an inflated housing market and soulless suburbs. And who is helping them do that? Well people like you. And you trying to justify it by saying things were not good back where you were at and so you had come here and cause issues in the areas does not make it any better. Mf you think we are not struggling out here too? Not trying to get into the oppression Olympics thing. But I am pretty sure we are [STREET] worse than whoever these transplants are coming from.

“ . I promise you most of this town's ancestors aren't from here either unless you're pure indigenous.”

We have been here since before the [PERSON] was even a country. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and other small towns in the area are connected and part of the same region.
