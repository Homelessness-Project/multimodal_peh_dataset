[ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON],378,"""Sanctuary city"" refers to those places where local law enforcement does not carry out the duties of [ORGANIZATION] without a warrant or local [STREET] order.

In [LOCATION] Sanctuary city policies often centered around supporting faith-based organizations and movements. This included those cities where religious movements were offering safe places for not only war resisters, but for refugees from [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]. In [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION], communities began to see sanctuary as more of a human rights issue than a religious one. The focus moved increasingly toward developing policies that would limit the involvement of local police with federal issues of immigration.

# Why Do Communities Choose to be Sanctuary Cities?

In alignment with the history of sanctuary city policies, many communities are now choosing to develop policies that separate local law enforcement from potential deportation activities at the federal level. Under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the focus on deporting undocumented individuals has been increasing. This includes individuals who are law-abiding, and parents working and raising children in the GPE2 There are several reasons why communities enact policies and regulations to define themselves as sanctuary cities.

* **A Human Rights Standpoint:**¬†Many people across the country see immigration as a positive process and human rights issue, and consider it the duty of GPE2 citizens and officials to help protect all people. This includes people who are fleeing wars, poverty, and famine.¬†[[PERSON]]([URL]¬†is one such city, where the sanctuary policies ‚Äì also known as [ORGANIZATION] ‚Äì state that [PERSON] officials will not help investigate or prosecute individuals based solely on their resident status. [PERSON] also does not discriminate against non-citizens for city services intended for those in need, and even offers a local ID to use for transportation and library access.
* **A [ORGANIZATION] Standpoint:**¬†Under the Constitution of GPE4, being an undocumented immigrant is not actually a crime ‚Äì it is a¬†[civil violation]([URL] Criminal violations allow for punishments such as jail time. Civil violations result in penalties. Currently. the accepted penalty for being in GPE4 undocumented is deportation. There are many who see this as a punishment, and therefore a human rights issue as well as a [ORGANIZATION] issue.",0

Where to eat if homeless?,49,"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",22

Aggressive homeless/pan handlers in [ORGANIZATION],60,"I absolutely agree with all three of your suggestions. More housing is important for all of us across the board really, not just the homeless. And not just affordable housing‚Äîstudies have shown time and time again that more housing of any kind actually brings the cost of all types of housing down. The most important thing that cities can do right now is to amend zoning laws so that we can build with more density! That means more apartment buildings, more duplexes, etc., rather than just single-family homes with lawns. The only people who might suffer from such changes are investors, which might explain why we struggle so much to make these fixes.

I‚Äôm really no expert on the issue of homelessness, but it is something that I‚Äôve been reading and trying to learn more about over [ORGANIZATION]. It‚Äôs indisputable that rates of alcohol and drug abuse among the homeless are much higher than among the general population, but the issue of cause and effect certainly remains controversial. I‚Äôve seen studies placing addiction as the second-most significant cause of homelessness, while others put it significantly further down the list.

Where can I find homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?,0,"He is just being an asshole. There is a feeling out here that a Hispanic will never be homeless because we are too prideful and hardworking, and that only white people end up homeless because they are lazy and want handouts. When in reality a lot of people who are homeless, Hispanic or not, do work, and have jobs. They are usually homeless due to addiction and mental illness, many times both. 

By the [STREET] the reason why you will see more white homeless than Hispanic homeless, is because white American culture is very individualistic, at [ORGANIZATION] they kick you out of home and you are on your own, you are shamed if you still live at home as an adult if you are a white American. I worked with a girl who lived in a car and she proudly stated that at least she is not living at mom's house as an adult like many of us where. Also many white Americans will disown family members who are involved in drugs other shit, so many of these people really have no where else to go. The same is not with Hispanics. Hispanic culture is very collectivist, you always have a [STREET] at mom's house, no matter what, and if she kicks you out, aunt will take you in, or your cousin, or your grandma. Hispanics for the most part are never at risk of being homeless because someone's couch in your family is always open. Most homes here are not only multigenerational, but extended family members usually live together as well. [PERSON]'s house is usually occupied by aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, everyone. Not to mention, family friends usually become members of the family, so friends here will take you in as well if you need to. We are very community oriented. And even if you are involved in drugs, crimes, whatever, family usually turns a blind eye, which I admit is an issue, but preferable to disownment.

So yeah mix white American individualism with poverty, drug addiction and untreated mental illness and that is how you end up with so many white homeless people. We should not bash them for that, but it is one of the reasons why I personally hate White American culture so much, and why I feel we should fight to keep the Southwest Hispanic and our traditions alive as much as we can, as asshole as that sounds.",4

Dad moving from [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON].,0,"A couple of things come to mind. Questions actually. Does your dad plan on buying a home of equal value to the home he sold in [ORGANIZATION]? I am assuming not. However, if he wants to avoid capital gains tax then a [DATE] exchange would allow him to use the entire proceeds of his home sale in [ORGANIZATION] to purchase a home in [PERSON] so long as the purchase price equals the price he sold his home for in [ORGANIZATION].

Also keep in mind for single homeowners whose home was their primary residence for at least 2 out of [DATE] there is a capital gains exemption of up to $250K and up to $500K for married couples. Of course, that does not include the cost basis (the original purchase price he paid for the home) It is always a good idea to know these things for tax time DATE0.

Your dad should be prepared for much higher property tax rates in [PERSON]. The average tax rate in [PERSON] county is around 3% and higher in some places like GPE2 where I happen to live. It is important to understand this so he knows that if he is buying an expensive home well that value is going to come with a high [LOCATION] property tax obligation. Let's use some real numbers to illustrate. If your dad buys a $300K home he's probably looking at a $9K [LOCATION] property tax bill. Of course homestead exemptions will reduce this to some extent BUT here in [PERSON] the only exemptions you get for homestead are the $100K exemption on the school [ORGANIZATION] taxes and a measly $5K exemption on the [PERSON] County taxes.  There are no exemptions for the other entities like community college, city, [ORGANIZATION] (municipal utility district), fire, police & hospital. The good news is once the exemption is in [STREET] taxable value can only increase 10% per year. However when he buys his home he's essentially starting at exemptions on the full price he paid. So for the $300K example he would be taxed on $200K for the [ORGANIZATION] portion of his taxes (taking the $100K exemption on school [ORGANIZATION] portion of taxes) and $295K for the county taxes (taking into account the $5K exemption). On all the other aforementioned entities he will be taxed on $300K. Make sure once he purchases his home he [ORGANIZATION] submits his application for the homestead exemption. He may qualify for senior over DATE2 exemption or disability. Please please please-I cannot emphasize this enough-make sure he gets this done as soon as he closes on his new home. Very important!!!

With all that said there are plenty of options for homes that are still even under $200K. Many of those affordable options can be found on the far [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION] where new homes are still being built. [PERSON] are a good group of people who can help him find a new home. They have a youtube channel with very helpful information about real estate in [PERSON] as well as living in [PERSON]. Look up their youtube channel Living In [PERSON]. Hope this helps.",18
Dad moving from [ORGANIZATION] to [PERSON].,0,"Have him ask his realtor in [ORGANIZATION] about a [DATE] exchange. Usually there is a capital gains tax when you sell a house. You can defer the tax if you buy a similar property within in [ORGANIZATION]. There are strict rules to follow because you have to properly identify the new properties of interest and then close within [ORGANIZATION]. 

His realtor should be an able to get in touch with a company that specializes in this. Companies hold the funds from the sale until the property is purchased and of course the companies charge fees for this.",4

Lots of times these individuals don't have anything to do during [ORGANIZATION] which can be depressing. So they provide a space for people to go to- they have chores, they exercise, they have art classes once a week and go on [DATE] trips. It really gives disabled people a sense of agency and independence that they wouldn't have otherwise.


It's a great organization!
Maybe they could use a computer lab...

By the [STREET], if you know of anybody who could use these services, have them go check it out.  It saves disabled from being bored/stuck at home and gives caregivers a much needed break to go and take care of some stuff for themselves.  It's free as far as I know, although if the group decides to go to a restaurant for their DATE1 outing the individual is responsible for their part of the tab (drink, burger, etc.).

I think it was a lady that came out on the news saying she was paying for them.  [ORGANIZATION] seems to have been distributing clothing and stuff.  I felt an overwhelming feeling to help but don't know how.  Looks like they have clothing and food.  I saw a family with two little girls and I asked what they needed.  They said money for passage to family elsewhere.  I gave away as much money as I had.  Obviously, the need is great.

Broke my heart to not see any churches or organizations there.  

I thought it would be great if data could be gathered that showed profiles of migrants and how much money they need to get to their loved ones.  Maybe [ORGANIZATION] could rise and sponser them by buying bus tickets and helping them out.

I live in [PERSON] and struggling with health issues but I wish I could do more.  Leaving for GPE2 in [LOCATION] but I will try and organize something to help these fellow human beings in such drastic need.  If anyone else has any ideas how to contribute, please let me know.

Housing The Immigrants,3,"This problem is too large to be solved by government alone.  For those of us who support open borders and mass immigration, it's time for us to stop virtue signaling and put our feelings of altruism into action.  We need to open up our own personal wallets, hearts, and homes to these poor, suffering people.

So if you voted for a Democrat in a federal or state election, please donate money, food, time, and clothing, and above all offer to shelter one or more of these poor homeless immigrants in your own house or apartment.  If you live elsewhere in the state or even out of state far from the southern border, please donate money and clothes (until it hurts) while offering to take people in if they travel to your home area.

If you believe that altruism is a moral ideal and that Americans need to come together and help the poor at home and abroad, then surely you feel (or should be feeling) a duty to sacrifice your personal selfish interests to help these poor people.  

The federal government is not going to be able to handle this competently, and state and local governments simply don't have the resources.  But if we hold true to our feelings and give of ourselves and open up our hearts and our homes, we can make a real difference.

Do you feel separated /forgotten about from the rest of [ORGANIZATION]?,87,"Having just moved from the [ORGANIZATION] area, yes, but that is the draw.

>Do you feel more part of the western states and cultures of New [PERSON], [PERSON], GPE6, and [PERSON]?

In my brief time here, yes. In some ways, GPE7 has a very ""[PERSON]"" feel to it. What I mean by that is, in [PERSON] by far the first language is French, but if you are an English speaker and you go to [PERSON] (or even live there), everyone speaks English to you. (I've had friends who hoped to practice their French in [PERSON], only to find that everywhere they go, once a local realizes you are an American, they speak English to you, even if you speak French to them). And just comparing big cities in [LOCATION], [PERSON] has its own culture compared to others because of their Acadian French heritage. 

Here in [PERSON]0, by far the first language of most people is Spanish, but English speakers have absolutely no problem getting by on English only because everyone will speak English to you. And [PERSON]0 has a different culture than other big cities in the [PERSON]1 because of the Mexican heritage. edit: I should have added here, that it's even different than cities like [PERSON]2, [PERSON]3, and other cities with large Mexican populations.  I'll also, say, that ""[PERSON]"" feel that I get here in [PERSON]0, I don't get it down in [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5, interestingly enough. Those areas, while also border towns, feel more like [PERSON] than [PERSON]0 does. I think [PERSON]0 being a military town has something to do with that. I suspect if the military presence was completely gone from [PERSON]0, it might feel more like [PERSON]4/[PERSON]5.",35

Do you feel separated /forgotten about from the rest of [ORGANIZATION]?,87,"We are very culturally connected to [ORGANIZATION]. We are also for obvious reasons connected with [PERSON]. We are honestly a mix between [ORGANIZATION], New Mexican and [PERSON]3. For example let's look at the local population.

[ORGANIZATION]s, as opposed to the [LOCATION] found in areas like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and GPE2 are [LOCATION] who are from border areas and are more Mexican, prefer Spanish and still keep connections to [PERSON], also tend be working class, unlike other [LOCATION] outside the border who are more Americanized, middle class and conservative. Many families in GPE4, [PERSON] and GPE6 fall under this category.

Then you have people who are similar to [ORGANIZATION] of New [PERSON], descendants of Spanish conquistadors and Spaniards who mixed little with the indigenous population or those who did  mix but manages to keep a Spanish culture as opposed to a [PERSON] one. You will find these families in LOC2 and some of the older families in [LOCATION], some have spread to areas like GPE9. You know them from their last names like [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. And not to get racial but they tend to be lighter skinned Hispanics and upper class (in [PERSON]0 they would be called [LOCATION])

[PERSON]2an people are found here as well, obviously with the [LOCATION] tribe who came here from [PERSON]1, giving the town that [PERSON]2 southwest flavor [PERSON]1 is known for.

Northern Mexican mestizos from [PERSON]3 makes up most of the rest of the population so that gives [PERSON]4 a strong [PERSON] macho culture, that Northern [PERSON] is know for, beards, cowboy boots and trucks, and a more conservative outlook.

But we also have connections to the rest of the [PERSON]5, again via the populations in the area, in the [ORGANIZATION] and GPE9 areas, there is also a lot of [ORGANIZATION] and Irish families who have been here for generations but trace their ancestry to [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]5, which is why LOC2 really does have an [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]5 cowboy feel to it. (Most people in [PERSON] have never been there so they don't even know the different world it is there, compared to the rest of [PERSON]) Some of our location politicians come from these families.

If you like a bustling city with tons of entertainment options and diversity, [ORGANIZATION] hands down. But if you like a quiet city perfect for your family, [PERSON] takes the crown.

During my time in [ORGANIZATION], I enjoyed the lakes, strong workforce, diverse food and dining options, and how everything was near. I disliked the traffic and how expensive everything was. I truly loved my time there and still visit every once in a while.

[PERSON] is perfect for hiking since we have the footstep of [ORGANIZATION] right in the middle of the city ‚Äî [PERSON] ‚Äî and the GPE2 forests [TIME] away. Single-family homes are still affordable and crime rates are obviously lower here since we have local, state, and federal jurisdictions, and a strong military presence.

However, I dislike that [PERSON] has very limited options including restaurants, stores, flights, and geographic closeness to other cities.

Introduction - WVP for [ORGANIZATION],8,"Appreciate your outreach here. I disagree with the [ORGANIZATION] dividing veterans by identity, be it racial, sexual or otherwise, as veterans are one of the most diverse groups of citizens.

Introduction - WVP for [ORGANIZATION],8,"Thank you for your reply. 

As humans, we have been divided by many categories including the ones you've mentioned for [ORGANIZATION] due to social constructs.

In terms of the human experience, it's important to understand and be aware that we indeed have different and unique experiences because of those constructs thus, there is no one size fits all approach to helping people. For instance, I would suggest you read the ORG0 latest report on women ORG2. Perhaps, it will help with understanding at least some of what women ORG2 have and still go through. 

I'm sorry you haven't had a good experience w/[PERSON]. If you were more specific about your experience I may be of better help. 

[PERSON] is a state department so maybe that's why you refer to it as a ""mafia"" but I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a ""stranglehold on ORG2 issues."" I do know that sometimes people confuse [PERSON] and the [ORGANIZATION] and think [PERSON] has authority over the [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but I wanted to make that clarification anyways.

We do have newsletters that you can sign up for at [[URL] Or, if you scroll down to [LOCATION] at [[URL] you can find some stories.

* If you are going to live in your car a while, keep it as tidy, clean and comfortable as possible. Nothing says HOMELESS like crazy wrinkled clothes and terribly body odor!

* GOT A JOB? If not, keep some clean clothes elsewhere. Clean clothes to go to interviews in. Clean clothes to go to work in.

* Having your dog will make things really tough for you. You are trying to take care of yourself AND your dog. You both gotta eat, sleep AND stay healthy.

[ORGANIZATION] proceeds are used as an additional source of funds to complete the construction. The LIHTC program was started in [ORGANIZATION] to incentivize the building of affordable housing. Can someone remind me the name of the president who signed this legislation into law? /s

""Section 8 housing attracts crime"" -> There is no evidence for this claim AND this is not going to be Section 8 housing.

""These people live in the 'program' and never get out""-> This is not a housing program. People who live in these communities earn between 50% and 80% of [ORGANIZATION]. A family of 4 earning 60% of [ORGANIZATION] makes $45K/year in [ORGANIZATION].  They apply to live here like any other apartment complex and they qualify after a thorough background check and a review of their income status. They pay rent like any other renter, just at a reduced rate. The family of 4 above would pay about  $1,100 per month for a 3 [ORGANIZATION] unit.

""They were supposed to build a school here""  -> ORG0 is shrinking not expanding. [PERSON], the closest school in this neighborhood, is at risk of shutting down due to a diminishing student population. By bringing new families to the area, we can improve this vacant lot and potentially save our local school. The alternative is a shuttered elementary school and a vacant lot.

The rest of your questions are dependent on what you're looking for and what you're used to doing. If you need to be near metros upon metros of millions of people then yeah, it'll be isolating but a lot of [ORGANIZATION]ans only know the area so there's not that frame of reference. Military folk will have mixed opinions based on their backgrounds and what they like. Being born and raised in [ORGANIZATION], I had thought it was the norm to be far from cities. [PERSON] also made the case for metros being spread out. I generally like being able to [STREET] for a little bit to get away from folks entirely.

Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION] because I work remotely and [ORGANIZATION] has nice affordable houses. Any suggestions on areas? Does it feel isolated living so far from other places?,49,"I work from home in the [ORGANIZATION]. It's a great [STREET] to own a large home for a low cost relative to rest of the country. Feels small town and suburban being outside of the main city. [ORGANIZATION] is pretty spread out, so areas can really vary. The west side has higher end shopping, and a better variety of food, but is also pricier. 

The east side is growing and also has some great established restaurants that have been around for a long time. 

You should really consider what you like to do outside of work. For me personally, I like to hunt and explore wild country which is pretty much impossible to do in [LOCATION]. So I have to [STREET] [TIME] at least for my hobby. 

Having the [INSTITUTION] close is nice, but know you will likely have to pay for connecting flights to a main hub. 

[PERSON] is great, and it maybe snows an inch DATE0? The [ORGANIZATION]'s are always nice to look at with snow.

[PERSON] extremes are usually just wind and [PERSON] of rain. Make sure you get a good roof inspection for any home you purchase. Almost all housing seems to get a leak at some point in [ORGANIZATION].",15
Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION] because I work remotely and [ORGANIZATION] has nice affordable houses. Any suggestions on areas? Does it feel isolated living so far from other places?,49,"Hey! Welcome.

[ORGANIZATION] has affordable houses. You can easily get a nice home for no more than $300,000, but the market is hot (as is the case in other cities, but not as bad as [PERSON]). I would suggest living on the west side due to the diversity in food and entertainment options, because the homes are more ‚Äúupscale‚Äù in my opinion, and because it‚Äôs closer to the mountains (after all, who does[LOCATION] love to wake up to the sight of beautiful mountains?).

Does [ORGANIZATION] feel isolated? Depends on who you ask. If you‚Äôd like to [STREET] to other major cities then, yes, it feels isolated. However, the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] has direct flights to every major city in [ORGANIZATION] and the [INSTITUTION] in [LOCATION], across the border, has direct flights to major Mexican cities. Also, [PERSON] towns/resorts are near [ORGANIZATION], so it‚Äôs not as isolated as people make it out to be.

Does it snow [ORGANIZATION]? Almost [ORGANIZATION]. It gets colder than your average Texan city for sure since the desert sand ca[LOCATION] retain heat. If you‚Äôd like to see snow, [PERSON] is a short [STREET] away, as stated earlier.

I‚Äôve always said that [ORGANIZATION] is the hidden gem of [ORGANIZATION]. It has too much to offer once you get over the culture shock.",26
Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION] because I work remotely and [ORGANIZATION] has nice affordable houses. Any suggestions on areas? Does it feel isolated living so far from other places?,49,"I grew up in [ORGANIZATION], and I‚Äôve lived in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and GPE6. [ORGANIZATION] is easily my favorite [STREET] I‚Äôve lived, and it is home. I absolutely love the weather, and I suggest finding a [STREET] with a decent-sized back yard. Whereas 100 degrees in [ORGANIZATION] is unbearable, 100 degrees in [ORGANIZATION] can actually be perfectly comfortable if you find a bit of shade. During DATE0, the evenings and nighttime are downright delightful, and are best spent outdoors. Back yard parties are a big thing here. 

We have an excellent minor-league baseball stadium that also serves as the facility for our soccer team. Tickets are cheap and parking is quick and convenient. My family really love going to [ORGANIZATION] and ORG1 games. FAC0 at ORG2 is a really cool college stadium that is down in bowl on a mountain, and we really enjoy going to ORG2 games too. 

In addition to the great stadium, downtown has really come to life in [LOCATION] since I moved out here. ORG3 slowed down downtown development, but I have no doubt it will continue. [PERSON] and the surrounding area is really cool. We have a few really unique luxury hotels downtown, all with very good, upscale bars and restaurants. Of course [ORGANIZATION] has excellent Mexican food, but it also has a surprisingly high number of fine dining options. We enjoy having the occasional staycation downtown. Eat, drink, stroll around, etc. We also have decent history and art museums downtown that are completely free, and are walking distance from the hotels, [PERSON], and the stadium. 

The city is bisected by [PERSON], and we have the largest urban FAC1 in the nation. [PERSON] is a huge park right smack in the middle of the city, and is a great [STREET] to hike or mountain bike. Just outside of the FAC1, on the east side of the range, there is the [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] Archeology Museum, both are free. 

We have a ORG6, indoor skydiving, ice skating (also a hockey team), and a really great small zoo. We also have a couple of casinos on lands owned by the Native ORG10s of the area. ORG7 also has a quarter horse race track. 

It doesn‚Äôt snow much, and when it does it is gone quickly. [TIME] away, however, are [PERSON]0 and [PERSON]1, [PERSON]2. Both towns have snow skiing in [DATE]. I‚Äôve never been to the slopes on [PERSON]0, but [ORGANIZATION] (owned by ORG9) is a pretty decent ski resort. The ORG10 also owns a nice hotel ([ORGANIZATION]) that has a casino. 

There are lots of other day trip options. [PERSON] is really cool, and you can sled down the pristine white sand dunes. FAC5 is also [TIME] away, and is amazing. If you go to the caverns, hike in and out rather than taking the elevator. The hike out is a killer, but you can take all the breaks you like lol. [PERSON] is [TIME] [STREET] away, and is an excellent [ORGANIZATION] destination, due to the huge natural spring-fed swimming pool. If you are a rock climber (or interested in rock climbing) [ORGANIZATION] is a [TIME] [STREET], and is a world-renowned climbers‚Äô [PERSON]3 that is know as one of the world‚Äôs top places for ‚Äúbouldering.‚Äù

If driving, [ORGANIZATION] is closer to [PERSON]4 and [PERSON]5 than it is to [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON]6, [PERSON]7, and [PERSON]8 are all [TIME] away, and are all great tourists spots. Within that same driving range you can find excellent kayaking, river rafting, and snow skiing/boarding. 

You can cross the border to [PERSON]9 and fly to anywhere in [ORGANIZATION]0 for under $200! Seriously. 

[ORGANIZATION]ans are great, and after [PERSON] living here I am a proud [ORGANIZATION]an! This is home. The population is mostly Latino, and the local culture is heavily influenced by Mexican culture. As a white boy and girl from rural east [ORGANIZATION]1, my wife and I can honestly say that we do not at all feel isolated or excluded. We have felt welcomed and included in this community from DATE5. [ORGANIZATION] is a [STREET] that will return what you give to it tenfold. If you come out here with a closed mind and act like a dick, you won‚Äôt be well received. On the other hand, if you greet people with a smile, treat others with kindness and take time to appreciate, respect, and enjoy the local culture, [ORGANIZATION] will rerun your kindness and respect overwhelmingly! 

You don‚Äôt have to learn to speak Spanish to live in [ORGANIZATION], because 90% of the people you encounter are fluently bilingual. Nonetheless, I recommend you learn as much Spanish as possible, because it helps you peel back even more layers to this unique and wonderful city. Don‚Äôt forget that there is a huge city, with over 1 million people, just on the other side of the river. Spanish speakers are always very appreciative that I make an effort to speak Spanish, but nobody will hold it against you if you don‚Äôt. 

Anyway, I could go on and on. I know there are other tons of other great aspects to this city that I am forgetting, but I hope this gives you a decent idea of what we have to offer.",20

Locals won't have an idea of what isolated is unless they have to go out of town for something important that they can't find here. Recent transplants do talk about it being distant from major metropolitan areas though.

To give you an idea on the distances between [ORGANIZATION] and other cities, I've compiled the list below:

1. [PERSON]. GPE2 - 717 miles

11. GPE11 - 697 miles
12. GPE12 - 322 miles

NOTE: Above figures are approximate.

Hopefully most transplants are also bringing in remote jobs with them to bring new money into the local economy. Everyone who can should be getting remote jobs so they can keep skilled white collar workers in the metro so the city can point to that population when trying to entice companies to set up shop.

I'll also say it's not a new occurrence. Before the pandemic, you'd have military families come in and swoop up housing stock on the cheap and then move on while holding on to their property as a rental.

"It's annoying how much ""transplant"" hate people have here",31,"I understand your concerns. Don't take it personal. Most of the redditors here are regulars and some have very negative things to say about transplants. Not every native [ORGANIZATION]an shares the same feelings and many of them are not on [ORGANIZATION]. I've said it before and I'll say it again. As a lifer here myself I view transplants as an overall positive because most have lots of disposable income they can use to spend on local, established small businesses. They also have an entrepreneurial spirit. This helps with diversity and creating more jobs. Fresh ideas also are a benefit they bring.

IMO...when you see questions like 'why are you locating here and for what', may not be necessarily hostile in its intent. The reasoning behind it is possibly because:
1. They were born and raised here and have a regret of not leaving.
2. They may have moved here voluntarily [ORGANIZATION], and something in their life went wrong, so now they want to leave, but they can't, so their frustration turns to vitriol with everything that's local.
3. An involuntary transplant, usually military, who absolutely hates it here for whatever reason and in their own mind can not fathom why people would want to relocate to [ORGANIZATION].
4. A local or old transplant who is being priced out and does not have the skill set to get a better-paying job. They want to keep up with the [ORGANIZATION]'s like before and as it gets harder to do that, their frustrations are directed at what they think are the causes.

Yes, things have gotten more expensive, but you have to do your best to adapt. That's what I had to do. Whether in enrolling in [TIME] classes at [ORGANIZATION], learning a trade or brainstorming on how you can create and maintain a side hustle. Also, you may just need to be disciplined with your income, [PERSON], and determine what are your needs and what are your wants. I don't blame transplants because my parents came from south of the border back in [LOCATION]'s. It's no different now than how it was back then.

I think people get angry perhaps because, for example, someone coming from [ORGANIZATION], where property values are insanely high, see [PERSON] home prices as a steal. Now to [PERSON] residents home values here have increased pretty significantly. To that guy from [ORGANIZATION] they are low relatively speaking. That guy from [ORGANIZATION] won't even bother to negotiate to get a better price. They won't [STREET] a hard bargain. They'll just accept the first price they see listed for a home.

"It's annoying how much ""transplant"" hate people have here",31,"Most of the hate y‚Äôall receive on here is due to the fact that the culture on this subreddit is not really [ORGANIZATION]an. Most of there people, at least the most outspoken members of this subreddit come from well off, out of town background with no roots to the border. And then y‚Äôall try to speak for us. Which is what bothers people. Specially when people come here and ask about the city or issues from the area. ¬†¬†

[PERSON] would, Spanish. [PERSON] will tell you, you don‚Äôt need Spanish in this city. And this subreddit has been dragged for y‚Äôall saying that. [PERSON] had people bashing this [STREET] for that. You do need Spanish here. There is a lot of people here who are monolingual, even the local native tribe, their elders only speak Spanish. A lot of our parents here don‚Äôt speak English. ¬†And how many of us went to school with [ORGANIZATION] kids who could barely say a few sentences in English? They still have not learned English. Not to mention the people who cross from [PERSON] to spend money. That is why businesses want you to speak Spanish . Outside of the government hospitals, you rarely can get a job in the medical field if you don‚Äôt speak Spanish. Even the Koreans in downtown speak Spanish. But the transplants will say you don‚Äôt need to learn it. And you don‚Äôt if you plan on having a white collar government job like most of them do and you plan to live in [ORGANIZATION]. But say you are working class, have no degree and can only afford to live in central or lower valley ? Tell me not knowing Spanish won‚Äôt hurt you.¬†¬† ¬†

There is also a feeling like you guys refuse to understand the culture or that you look down on it as backward. ‚ÄúWhy is there so many [ORGANIZATION] loves you signs ¬†everywhere?‚Äù Y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt know most of the population here is super religious? Even [ORGANIZATION] members have huge statues of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] in their homes. ‚Äúomg why is there so many dogs running around?‚Äù lol wait till you see how things are in GPE2, in regards to [STREET] dogs. ‚ÄúWhy do my neighbors have roosters and chickens! [PERSON] is that even allowed!?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so, but we don‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúMy neighbor just brought a goat to his backyard, wait are they killing it !‚Äù Complaints about the ‚Äúma√±ana culture‚Äù (I‚Äôll do it DATE1) and very slow paced relax feel of the [STREET]. We are a city with a small town mentality. Even a ranch mentality. We do have a ‚Äúthird world‚Äù mindset as well. Which bothers people not from here. ¬†¬†

What bothers me the most is how transplants and I would say even upper middle class locals outright deny some of the issues this city faces simply because they don‚Äôt have to deal with them. I have heard [ORGANIZATION] does not have a homeless issue. Y‚Äôall seen PERSON2 ? Or all the homeless encampments in the northeast? People will come and ask about the migrant crisis. And transplants and well off locals will laugh it off , saying there is no migrant crisis. Bros, in the northeast we have a whole ass homeless war because there was so many migrants coming in that they pushed the homeless out of the shelters and they came to the northeast. There was a fight for resources out in the streets. There was also masses of migrants just dropped on low income areas of [LOCATION] and the LOC2. There was gang wars between local gangs and Venezuelan gangs. When the [PERSON] noted this. But you ask People on here about it? It never happened. Of course if you are on [ORGANIZATION] you never saw what was happening in the [PERSON] and [PERSON] parts of town.¬† ¬†

Transplants will also deny the crime and gang issue. ‚ÄúThere is gangs in [ORGANIZATION] ?‚Äù Meanwhile cartels are recruiting heavily from youth [STREET] gangs [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. And people are losing their sons to this. There is women in the [PERSON] and northeast who have been raped, beat, robbed, but some upper middle class ORG3 girl Or wife of a transplant will say these things don‚Äôt happen here. There is huge disconnect between the working and poor parts of town and the upper middle class areas where most transplants live.¬†¬†

¬†Lastly there is a general feeling that we are being ‚Äúcolonized‚Äù once again. Out of town companies are coming in, buying all the houses and then flipping them. They also behind all that ugly suburban sprawl we are seeing in the far east side. We had tight close neighborhoods in this city. With neighborhood grocery stores and other small [LOCATION], ¬†community areas, churches serving as central pieces of the neighborhood and community. And now that is going away. We are being handed soulless suburbs, created by out of town era who don‚Äôt understand the collectivist traditional community oriented [STREET] of living we have here. Or they understand it. They just look at it as backwards.¬†

Look at how they are trying to destroy our historical neighborhoods to put some steel box for sports events or whatever they are trying do? But we are stuck in the past and our old backwards ways because we refuse that right ?¬† So yeah we feel like we are being colonized once again. I know it‚Äôs kinda cringe to say that. But that is how it feels like to some of us. Has this not happen to us before ? People from far away showing up and telling our ways are backward, we need to modernize and then using this area to profit from of us? The suburban sprawl is due to out of town developers realizing they can build Homes for cheap here (cheap materials and labor) then inflate the prices, make a lot of money and run away, leaving us with an inflated housing market and soulless suburbs. And who is helping them do that? Well people like you. And you trying to justify it by saying things were not good back where you were at and so you had come here and cause issues in the areas does not make it any better. Mf you think we are not struggling out here too? Not trying to get into the oppression Olympics thing. But I am pretty sure we are [STREET] worse than whoever these transplants are coming from.

‚Äú¬†. I promise you most of this town's ancestors aren't from here either unless you're pure indigenous.‚Äù

We have been here since before the [PERSON] was even a country. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and other small towns in the area are connected and part of the same region.

[ORGANIZATION] averages about $400 a credit if you take the typical class load.

Have you ever seen portraits of [ORGANIZATION]? He was a conquistador who brutalized both Aztec & Mayan people. He had red hair & blue eyes. You're speaking a white mans language yet you act as if Spanish is indigenous language. It isn't. Take a trip to [ORGANIZATION].

Updates from City Rep. [PERSON] ‚Äî [ORGANIZATION],41,"There was significant misunderstanding of the exemption due to capacity. The exemption is only from getting an outdoor amplified sound permit, not from the entire noise ordinance.

The new language on measurement location specifies that the measurement takes [STREET] at the property line of the property producing the noise, not ‚Äúwherever they choose‚Äù.

I did do extensive research about the issue including comparisons to many other cities (we are on the lenient end of things, even after these changes). I also borrowed a decibel meter from [ORGANIZATION] and went out to take measurements for myself, both ambient and during [TIME].

In [ORGANIZATION], the ORG1 chose to hire an outside expert (ORG2, a nonprofit nightlife ecosystem/social economy consultant) to study [ORGANIZATION] specific noise nuisance situation, along with other aspects of our nighttime economy, and make recommendations. [PERSON] conducted a significant amount of research and public outreach, including more than 40 public meetings, and these were the recommendations that they developed as a result of that process, which they presented as the [ORGANIZATION] Sociable City Assessment. You can find their full report and more info about [PERSON] here: [URL]

We did not lower the dB(A) standard of 70dB, though we did add a new standard for dB(C), which for these purposes means bass/low end vibrations. At the end of [LOCATION], these were fairly minor changes that allow for more public involvement in the permitting process, simpler enforcement of the existing standards, and stricter penalties for repeated violators. Those who currently don‚Äôt violate the standard, which we didn‚Äôt make any lower, shouldn‚Äôt have anything to worry about as these changes will have little to no impact on them.",2

Reasonable A/C installation ,0,"If you are worried about getting a good deal, then I'd try getting estimates from at least 3 different reputable HVAC companies. Also, check what kind of reviews have been left for each one. I'd also look up the brands of the units they offer. Look on the internet for what the retail price is for these units. You can also look at [ORGANIZATION] for the average cost for installing an HVAC unit at a residential home.

Honestly, I went with [PERSON] because of my prior experience with them. 

Some things to consider when choosing the right installer.

  - make sure they are licensed and bonded
  - make sure they provide you with the city permit for the installation. That permit is meant to protect the customer. A city inspector will come out to your home to inspect the work that the crew did. They'll bless off on the work if it was done right. Also, insurance companies require it if you have to file a home insurance claim. 

I included a helpful link.  [URL]",3
Reasonable A/C installation ,0,"Yes, shoot for 15 SEER or higher. You will not likely need a 5-ton unit, more like 2-ton and consider replacing windows if they are not thermopane. I would guess you will be about $5,000 for a quality brand.",1

I'm not sure about your transportation situation so that might not be an option. My kids enjoyed going to a smash room and the local one is called FAC0.

Is there any reason I should not move to [ORGANIZATION]?,19,"I've been in [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION]. Came for military and ended up staying because I wanted to pursue nursing and it was [STREET] easier to get into school here then back home in [PERSON].

[ORGANIZATION] has a lot of positive. I'm [PERSON] and don't speak Spanish and for the most part it's never been an issue. Families I serve are almost always pleasant and treat me like family.

Traffic has good and bad. For the most part you can go all over the city at a decent rate of speed so getting anywhere here is a breeze. The down side is that there is zero effort from [ORGANIZATION] to enforce laws on uninsured motorists, vehicles that are unsafe to be on [STREET], GPE2 plates vehicles, etc. [PERSON] also doesn't enforce/check paper plate checks either. So if you own a vehicle that only stays in [ORGANIZATION], you technically never need to register it. People print out fake dealer plates and use them on their cars forever and since they avoid registering their vehicles you can bet they aren't insured. 

I worked closely with law enforcement as a nurse and can tell you that they have zero incentive to pull over someone with GPE2 plates which gives some really awful drivers with unsafe vehicles freedom to do whatever they want. That said, not all drivers from GPE2 are bad drivers.

FAC0, FAC1, FAC2 and loop 375 are pretty nice to [STREET] on, but outside of that the roads in [ORGANIZATION] are pretty awful. I've lived all over the country and never seen roads as bad as here. Also, if you're used to states like [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON] that have [STREET] engineers that plan for the future get ready for [ORGANIZATION]. Our city engineers that plan streets aren't the brightest. Get ready to see left hand turn lanes that were only built to accommodate three cars at a time that feed communities with 5,000 homes.

For housing, yes it's technically cheaper for the price of home but don't let that fool you. Objectively, I believe [ORGANIZATION] may have the highest (or near) property tax rate in [PERSON] and the country. The property tax you'll pay on a $200,000 home here is the same as you would pay on a $600,000 home in [PERSON]/[PERSON]/Washington. Rent is higher here too. The property taxes affect [LOCATION] rent and since the military has a designated BAH rate, even the worst of the worst apartments know to keep the minimum rent at the level of BAH.

Mexican food around here is incredible too. When we travel with the kids and eat at ""Mexican"" food restaurants in other cities it makes you miss this [STREET].",9

I just moved to [ORGANIZATION].

I spent DATE0 looking for places on my weekends with a $750/mo budget and in that time couldn't find anything that looked good, and by good I just mean clean and not broken appliances and massive insulation problems.

I do want to live in a nice enough [STREET] that I'm not ashamed to have company over.

I like my roommate but the [STREET] we're in is in ROUGH shape and it sounds like the landlord, like most of them here, is a real pain the in ass to work with.

Now that I'm here, at least I have [LOCATION] to look for work and other housing options while I go to school.",13

$1000 a month used to be realistic for 1 person, but may be a lot trickier now.

[ORGANIZATION] is beautiful and close to [ORGANIZATION], but typically expensive unless you get roommates. FAC1 is another option but going to be a little further than the previous listed spots.

1: honestly don't know, [ORGANIZATION] has made meeting people difficult.

3: traffic isn't horrible, every city claims ""worst drivers"" and people here seem to be friendly on the roads.  

4: pretty chill vibe, cool people, beautiful weather, i think it's awesome here.  I love desert and heat, so it's great for me. 

Good luck with whatever you decide.",9

I am married and moved here DATE2 after my wedding from [ORGANIZATION], so I can‚Äôt speak to the dating scene, but I can speak to 2 and 3. My husband and I got a chocolate lab and it‚Äôs a very dog friendly [STREET]. We don‚Äôt take him to restaurants because covid, but the weather is beautiful for walks and playing at the dog parks. We live on the west side and don‚Äôt have any complaints having a dog here. We rent a house with a yard which helps with that. Housing and cost of living is insanely affordable. I miss our friends and families a lot, but we haven‚Äôt gotten any salary offers that are enticing enough to move back. We are looking to move because of family and we‚Äôre closer to having kids, but [ORGANIZATION] is growing on me and I could stay [ORGANIZATION]. The community is very welcoming and friendly. People are incredibly friendly and nice from passing people in my neighborhood, to my coworkers, the cashiers at [ORGANIZATION], and bartenders pretty much everywhere I‚Äôve been. [ORGANIZATION]‚Äôs families have opened their homes as if we‚Äôve known them forever. I choose to isolate myself a bit, but still have made friends very easily through work. It did take me [PERSON] to actually like living here because I really missed my friend group and my sister in [ORGANIZATION]. The pandemic made me feel a bit depressed because I haven‚Äôt been able to visit them and normally would have flown back to my former city at least three times by now since [PERSON]. That‚Äôs been really hard, but I sure didn‚Äôt expect a pandemic when I moved here. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I like living here until we started looking to leave, though. I miss my friends, but I think I like the weather more here lol. As for traffic, it‚Äôs crappy on my [STREET] home and I do think the drivers are worse. My car was totaled in my neighborhood and I have had multiple near accidents from people ignoring stop signs or running very red lights, so you have to be super alert. If your family is here, I‚Äôd say go for it. Maybe wait to buy a house and rent for [ORGANIZATION] first, but why not. If you hate it, you can always move back to [PERSON]. Hope this helps a bit!",4

Possibly moving to [ORGANIZATION]. Looking for some answers from locals,10,"I moved here, lived near [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], and came back here.

Its [STREET] better than [PERSON] where no one understands the left [STREET] is for passing and no one can comprehend how 4 [STREET] stop signs work.

Property taxes are high here, but there is no state income tax.

Not a reason to move/stay - just a caution - when you're looking for a [STREET] to live, be sure that it has ""Refrigerated Air"" (which is what the rest of the country calls ""air conditioning""), many homes here (not sure about apartments) have ""evaporative cooling"" which I haven't lived with, but is said to be less comfortable.

To answer your question, while a lot of folks keep their friends from high school as they go to [ORGANIZATION], the difference I've found is that they are welcoming to new people. College is a time for exploration and that extends to simple things like new interests. People who gravitate towards clubs will meet new folks.

Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION]. Looking for honest opinions,7,"Lived here for [ORGANIZATION], don't hate it but don't love it either. Since you're familiar with the weather, I won't talk about the heat/wind/dust. 

[PERSON]: 

The people. I have rarely run into anyone and thought ""wow, what a dick."" I did come from [ORGANIZATION] though so it possibly puts that into perspective

The food. If you like authentic Mexican, there's no shortage. Although you may have to look harder for international places, they're definitely here and growing in number. 

Getting around. People who haven't lived anywhere else complain, but honestly being able to get anywhere in [TIME] or less even in heavier traffic is amazing. 

Keeping active. From hiking and mountain biking to a fairly active adult sports scene, you can usually find something you're into.

No income tax. Self explanatory. 

Not politically charged. You'll find a lot of diversity in that regard here, but it seems to be lower on the ""importance"" scale if that makes sense.

Cons:

Distance from the rest of the world. I like to travel and it usually means by air if you want to go anywhere other than [PERSON] or GPE2. Shipping usually takes [LOCATION] to get here, and produce seems to spoil more quickly. 

Property taxes: It seems like the city's solution to every budgetary issue is to hike property taxes. Lots of people are getting upset about it, and even if you don't own a home it means higher rent. 

The hustle game. Income here is on the lower end, and even though [ORGANIZATION] is cheaper here, people still have to do what they can to get ahead. Lots of door to door stuff, and selling or buying from local listings gets really obnoxious sometimes (as it probably does most places). 

Internet. My particular neighborhood doesn't have many options in the [STREET] of [ORGANIZATION], so we pay higher than the national average for that. Water also costs a good bit here as you'd expect.",19
Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION]. Looking for honest opinions,7,"Hey man, the person above me commented some awesome stuff. Here are my pros/cons (for reference, lived in [ORGANIZATION] until [ORGANIZATION], moved to [PERSON], came back [PERSON]) 


As far as weather goes it‚Äôs pretty hot most of the time. Right now for example it‚Äôs getting into DATE2. 
Most people here are laid back, but get used to Hispanic culture. You‚Äôll hear Spanish more than English here, so it would be good to learn stuff. 
If you go out, nightlife is ok. The city is very spread out but there‚Äôs good bars/clubs on most sides of town. You‚Äôre gonna need a car if you move here. Like I said everything is super spread out abs public transportation is virtually non existent here. Lots of cool trails and hiking spots.

Considering moving to [ORGANIZATION]. Looking for honest opinions,7,I would say that you need to take a look at the taxing area you might wish to live in.  The highest portion of the property tax is the school system. The current housing boom has the local appraisal district raising the price of home values to generate tax revenue. One fix is to live in a smaller town area of the county where growth and taxes won't shoot up by leaps and bounds. Inside the city of [ORGANIZATION] there is a buying frenzy occurring and that has made rates increase drastically.  All parts of the city are accessible within a reasonable driving distance so make your choice wisely. The comments above are good points and there are always pros and cons to it all. I have lived here most of my life and it would be hard to say how it compares to other locations so I will leave it to others. Good luck.,1
