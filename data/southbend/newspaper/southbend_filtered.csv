southbend,Tracking Down Mayor Pete's Black Voter Problem,2020-02-07T00:00:00Z,The Nation Blogs,South Bend Tribune,"But I spent the icy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend in South Bend, talking to black people about former mayor Pete Buttigieg and his presidential campaigns difficulties with black voters, and his efforts to rectify the situation.1 Ad Policy1 We come to where the East Race is reunited with the main course of the St. Joseph River. Here, the river is a rebellious churn of swirls and eddies, in a hurry to get somewhere. Trotting up a flight of concrete stairs, we pick up the East Bank Trail, which incorporates a former railway and will take us all the way up to the edge of the Notre Dame campus. The asphalt is smooth and wide, and the daylight is now peeking through between leaves under a canopy of trees that arches over us, as if the city were nowhere near. From my office on the fourteenth floor, most of the city looks like a forest, and in the summertime you would never guess that whole neighborhoods sit below the dark green carpet of treetops.2 Pete Buttigieg, Shortest Way Home One Mayors Challenge and a Model for Americas Future3Buttigiegs blend of coming-of-age memoir and campaign manifesto reveals the obsessive, weird inner focus of the achiever who made up his mind to do great things at an early age and embarked on the error-free path. Born in 1982, a winner of the Profile in Courage high school essay contest, he met Senator Ted Kennedy and gave an address at the John F. Kennedy Library. An undergraduate at Harvard in 2004, when TheFacebook.com was launched, he studied, among other things, Arabic, having fallen for Tayeb Salihs Season of Migration to the North. Buttigieg remembers the novel as being about an Arab graduate students sexual conquests among British women. Although he doesnt say so in his memoir, we know that Buttigieg taught himself enough Norwegian to read Nave. Super by Erlend Loe, a coming-of-age novel about a graduate school dropout. James Joyce learned Norwegian in order to write to Ibsen of his deep admiration, and Buttigiegs title is a reflection of the soft spot he says he has for Ulysses, in which Leopold Bloom muses, 8216Think youre escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.82174 Related Article As a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, Buttigieg studied the analytical tradition in philosophy, lessons that would come back to him as an elected official obliged to adopt a utilitarian approach to policy what brings the greatest good to the greatest number. He writes that as an associate in the Chicago office of McKinsey amp Company, the 8216pinnacle of smart and useful analysis in the business world,8217 he became fascinated by 8216the nature of data.8217 But the rewards of the private sector could not answer the hunger of one called to service.5 He was offered a place on Barack Obamas Senate campaign but chose to work for John Kerry instead. Buttigieg watched from Arizona the convention speech that made the future president famous. In 2008, he took time off from his job to knock on doors in Iowa for Obama. And he was preparing to act on his belief that it was a failure of the postwar political elite to avoid military service. He survived the vetting that goes with getting a top security clearance and in 2009 signed on as an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. Buttigieg tells us, perhaps too often, that in 2014 he had to take time off from the South Bend mayors office because hed been called up for a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan.6 Bird-dogging Mayor Pete Protesters with Black Lives Matter outside a Buttigieg campaign visit to a homeless shelter in Los Angeles. Richard Vogel  AP Photo A failed campaign for state treasurer and, after winning two terms as mayor, a strategically useful but unsuccessful bid to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee put some starch in his political collar. 8216Meet Pete,8217 his early signs read. He was one of those 8216impatient millennial products of South Bend,8217 dreaming of a city administration that kept its 8216public character8217 but ran on 8216business principles.8217 In 2011 he finally got his chance when the long-serving Democratic incumbent mayor of South Bend decided to step down. Buttigieg took office in 2012, sharing 911 with his generation as a formative experience and also a simmering resentment about corporate cynicism in the Great Recession of 2008.7 Purposeful, humorless, corny, sincereButtigieg offers idealism, not ideology, and his claim to be an agent of good governance comes from having revived a city that Newsweek once dismissed as part of the dying industrial Midwest. 8216Good policy, like good literature, takes personal lived experience as its starting point.8217 Mayor Peteeveryone calls him thatis the butch voice of this sensitive flyover country. In his white shirtsleeves and dark ties, he looks like a Mormon missionary but projects a Macron-like, slightly-out-of-it technocrats air, and I dont understand the criticism that says his meeting with Al Sharpton showed that he did not know how to eat chicken. In Shortest Way Home, Buttigieg remembers that he was in Brookville, Indiana, in the summer of 2010 when it broke the world record for the amount of chicken served at one sitting 1,645 pounds.8 Face to face Angry attendees at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa, confront the candidate, January 1 Patrick Semansky  AP Photo 8216Why are they picking on him about the black vote?8217 Dr. Janet Evelyn demands. Caribbean born and a former president of Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend, Evelyn acts as a campaign surrogate, speaking on behalf of Buttigieg. 8216If Kamala Harris had the black vote, shed still be in the race,8217 she tells me. 8216If Cory Booker had the black vote, he would still have been in. Why are you only focusing on Pete?82179 Were sitting in one of the carefully staged parlors of the inn where I was staying, once the kind of mansion that tormented Theodore Dreisers unhappy youths. It suddenly comes to me that I am nearly twice Mayor Petes age. Evelyn is on her way to South Carolina. I ask why his polling numbers in that state are so low among black voters. She says they didnt know him. She also says that 40percent of the Buttigieg volunteers are black or Latino. She mentioned Nina Smith, his black traveling press secretary. Mayors arent superheroes theyre servants of the people, she says. And from her experience, Mayor Pete was a true servant of the people.10 Hed been ambushed by protesters in Iowa. 8216If you are Black Lives Matter South Bend, why are you in Iowa?8217 Evelyn wanted to know. She added that some people were just showing off for CNN. Yet Buttigiegs controversies with South Bends black citizens during his tenure as mayor provide a convincing explanation for why he has not been able to make himself more popular among black voters elsewhere in the country.11 Shortest Way Home is not told chronologically. It moves by theme and anecdote, sometimes taking a while to circle back. Buttigieg seems uncomfortable in his account of what happened with black South Bend. He recalls deciding on a new approach to dealing with gang-related violence when the homicide rate started going up as he began his first term in 2012. 8216Controversially, I hired an outsider from Massachusetts to fill a vacancy in the position of police chief.8217 He doesnt say at this point in the book that South Bends new white police chief from Boston replaced the citys black police chiefa man he at first asked to resign and then demoted because of a wiretapping scandal that had put the newly reappointed chief under an FBI investigation.12 Buttigieg inherited the FBI problem when he took office. Late in his book, he writes that the South Bend Police Department needed reform but he mistakenly put off tackling the issue. Darryl Boykins, the incumbent black police chief whom Buttigieg does not refer to by name, was well liked and had built confidence between the black community and the police department. But the internal politics of the department 8216boiled over.8217 Boykins allegedly confronted white officers in the department with tape recordings of their conversations that would embarrass them if they became public. 8216Some phone lines in the department were connected to recording equipment used for interviews and investigations,8217 Buttigieg writes, 8216and the officers had been recorded on that equipment without their knowledge. Enter the Federal Wiretap Act.8217 He notes that 8216making such recordings or disclosing their content can be a felony.8217 The recorded officers complained to federal authorities, and a few weeks into his new job as mayor, Buttigieg got a message, 8216thinly veiled but quite clear, from federal prosecutors the people responsible for the covert recordings needed to go, or charges might be filed.821713 He got bounced into it, he seems to be saying. He phoned Boykins and accepted the resignation that the police chief offered. 8216The reaction was instant and fierce.8217 Community outcry led the police chief to change his mind about quitting. But Buttigieg had lost confidence in Boykinss leadership. The mayor demoted the chief to the rank of captain. 8216As of this writing, I have not heard the recordings, and I still dont know if I, and the public, ever will.8217 Buttigieg says that the deeper meaning of the controversy had to do with trust between the black community and the police. It affected his relationship with the black community for years. He also had to explain why, in 2015, he used the loaded phrase 8216All lives matter8217 in a State of the City address when discussing racial bias. Last June, after a black man, Eric Logan, was killed by a white police officer, Buttigieg suspended his campaign in order to attend a town hall meeting. The killing remains the subject of a special prosecutors investigation, and the tapes scandal is still tied up in the courts.14 Related Article Its hard to present yourself to black voters as a fresh start in presidential politics when youre associated with cases easily portrayed as unresolved because of police cover-ups.15 Evelyn was quick to say that Eric Logans brother had marched with Mayor Pete. Maybe getting dogged by the old accusations was proof that Mayor Petes candidacy was real.16 I spoke with Vernado Malone, a founder of the group Justice for South Bend, about Logans death. At 330 in the morning on Fathers Day in 2019, Logan, 54, left a group of his friends who had been planning a cookout for their children. Malone said that based on what the police chief, Scott Ruszkowski, told them, a police officer meant to tase Logan, who was said to have been breaking into a car, but pulled the wrong weapon. Delivering Logan to the ER himself instead of calling an ambulance, the officer may have exacerbated Logans wounds. The officers body camera wasnt turned on. Malone contended that there was no blood at the crime scene, a parking lot. It had been cleaned up, he said, the evidence further tainted when an officer touched the car Logan had supposedly tried to break into. Malone also claimed the police woke the white owner of the vehicle in question and coached him on what to say.17 Malone observed that the police said Logan was holding a knife. Malone was adamant that black men in his part of town did not carry knives 8216We carry guns.8217 Therefore, he did not trust the police version of events.18 The community, Malone said, asked that the officer involved be suspended without pay. Buttigieg refused. 8216He didnt correct the problems, and they became a mistake.821719 There may be a new mayor in South Bend now, but the Board of Public Safety, the civic authority charged with investigating the Logan shooting, was Buttigiegs old board, its appointees too close to the city and the police to be anything but ineffective. The police couldnt be trusted to investigate themselves. There was no civilian oversight committee because 8216they8217 didnt want one. No charges have been filed against the officer. The Urban League doesnt exist in South Bend anymore, and the citys NAACP chapter is dormant.20 Black and white and blue Former South Bend police chief Darryl Boykins. Shayna Breslin  South Bend Tribune via AP Buttigieg with the current South Bend police chief, Scott Ruszkowski. Robert Franklin  South Bend Tribune via AP I didnt go on a tour of black South Bend offered by Theodore Randall, a professor of anthropology at Indiana UniversitySouth Bend. However, he tried to give me a general picture of the grievances the black community might have against Pete Buttigieg, including that hes seen as not being from South Bend but from Notre Dame, where his parents were high-powered faculty. They sent him to Catholic schools he didnt come up through the public school system. He was the mayor of downtown but not of the rest of the city, and blacks have won a meager percentage of government construction contracts. Some people minded 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days, his program to replace benighted and derelict housing around the city. I couldnt see for myself whether or not there were holes where structures had been demolished but nothing rebuilt in their place in black areas.21 Randall urged on me recent articles in The Root and The Young Turks. In an article for TYT Investigates, Jonathan Larsen challenges Buttigiegs assertion that he has no way of knowing whats on the tapes from the Boykins scandal. Larsen claims that Buttigiegs lawyers asked someone who knew what was on them. The conversations on the tape have been characterized by some sources as racist and include discussion about pressuring Buttigieg to get rid of the black police chief. The Roots Michael Harriot examines the decline in the number of black police officers on the South Bend PD since the scandal broke, going in a short period from just under 12 percent, or 29of 244 officers, to slightly over 6percent, or 15 officers. Black people make up 26percent of South Bends total population.22 Randall also recommended I watch the Black Lives Matter South Bend media call concerning Buttigieg, during which Buttigiegs old foe on the Common Council, Henry Davis Jr., insisted Mayor Pete isnt naive, called him no better than Trump, and said black people are being harmed by his leadership. Davis didnt believe Buttigieg had even 4 percent black support nationally, as the polls were saying. 8216Youre not trying to do it. You dont want to do it, sir,8217 Davis fumed.23 Black Lives Matters national spokesperson, Melina Abdullah, denounced Buttigieg for representing a liberal white supremacy that sustains the oppression of black people in spite of its rhetoric in favor of diversity. It was an insult, she said, for him to equate his being gay with the black experience. She said hes not working for the black vote he seems to think that strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire will mean he wont have to. She said Buttigieg is just blaming black people for not voting for him because hes gay.24 Current Issue Randall introduced me to two leaders of Black Lives Matter South Bend, Jorden Giger and E-Lexus Thornton, thoughtful, intelligent, questing young math teachers.25 Most teachers in the South Bend public school system are white. Giger and Thornton said they despair of getting through to their students, of being able to make up for what they lack at home, starting with parents who dont know what to do, who themselves do not understand school. They spend a lot of time showing their classes that they are the bosses. They both have thick afros and look as with-it as any black youth.26 And yet they shrugged off what having a same-race teacher in math may mean to their black middle school students. Thornton had been president of the Society of Physics Students. We assured them that some of their students will remember them for the rest of their lives. The young teachers, close friends, looked away, off toward a noisy table at the Linden Grill, a popular black restaurant where we sat for some time, making a mess.27 Giger said that for him, Buttigieg was not the candidate to lead the nation in the 21st century because of his record in South Bend. He spent so little money on the black community while he was in office. He was too clubbable, made pals too easily with the old city network of white interests. 8216He doesnt want to own his black problem,8217 Giger said. 8216He just wants to say he has black friends.8217 Both he and Thornton repeated to me the complaints against Buttigieg made in the press and on social media, one of them being that his campaign is a media creation.28 Giger was the host of the Black Lives Matter South Bend media call. Mixed in with their criticisms of Buttigieg was the sense that he had used South Bend as a stepping-stone, that he had known all along he was just passing through. Janis Joplin once talked about the small-town blowback she got when she returned home a star. 8216This raggedy-ass city,8217 Giger said. 8216The Democratic Party is dying, and hes a symptom of it.8217 Thornton is from elsewhere, but Giger came of age during Mayor Petes time in office. It seemed odd that Buttigieg, only 38 years old, should be the object of what seemed to me their generational scorn. For them, hip-hop is political. Cardi B would be as good a candidate as anyone.29 8216Every time we say, 8216This generation will be different. You have to be able to reach them, and were not. Because nothing ever happens for them,8217 Thornton said of his black students. It was hard to counter their 8216inability ever to believe they will ever get out of our situation.8217 What he said of his students, I wanted to say of him and Giger, their teachers. Giger said hed held out against Afro-pessimism, but now30 Shoulder to shoulder A bronze statue in South Bend depicts the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, a longtime president of Notre Dame, with Martin Luther King Jr. Becky Malewitz  South Bend Tribune via AP There is an element of people going after Buttigieg because they can. Approval of him is power over him, and the longer it is withheld, the more important the fence-sitter appears. Black Lives Matter in Buttigiegs case gives off an atmosphere not unlike some Me Too cases You will never be forgiven. However, Abdullah seemed to hold out the possibility that if Buttigieg addressed the problem nationally and admitted his shortcomings, then black peoplethe 8216forgiving tribe,8217 Jill Nelson once called usmight get over the hurt he caused us in South Bend. But that is also trying to establish control over him.31 A young white Buttigieg campaign worker, Sean Savett, and a young black colleague, Rodericka Applewhaite, expressed frustration with what they saw as a narrative that got going because people kept repeating it Mayor Pete has a problem with the black vote. We were in the Chicory Caf, a hipster locale that could have been cited in Buttigiegs book as another sign of downtown revival. The two alert, cautious campaign workers were so prepared to defend Mayor Pete that my questions abandoned me. They did smile when I said I liked the campaigns website and videos.32 Id wanted to talk to them about Buttigiegs Douglass Plan, an extraordinary document about investing in black America that, regrettably, is suffering in the weather arising from its authors perceived failure to side with black South Bend in any controversy with the white mans police force. Most of the black people I spoke with gave the same answer when I asked if theyd read it Not yet.33 The Douglass Plan is written in the language of reparations. Indeed, Buttigieg calls for a committee to propose reparations policies to Congress. 8216Americas racist structures were built to justify and perpetuate slavery, and by achieving greater equity for Black Americans we lay the groundwork for achieving greater equity for other people of color as well.821734 A technocrats version of call and response, the plan has several components in which problems are identified and solutions proposed. A national health equity strategy would 8216prioritize anti-racism.8217 The Douglass Plan speaks of health equity zones and accountable communities of health and the underrepresentation of black people in health care. In the area of education, the Douglass Plan proposes using Title I funding to increase teachers pay. It also pays particular attention to the mission of historically black colleges and universities.35 The Douglass Plan seeks to end the War on Drugs, proposing to legalize marijuana, eliminate the prosecution of drug offenses, and improve police recruitment practices. It also calls for a reduction of sentences, the elimination of mandatory minimums, the formation of a clemency commission, and, importantly, the abolition of private prisons. It sees the end of so-called broken windows policing and the abolition of the death penalty by constitutional amendment. It envisions a 21stCentury Voting Rights Act as well as something called the Walker-Lewis Initiative, named for 20th century black entrepreneurs, to address the inequalities of capital and asset accumulation in the black community. The Douglass Plan also proposes a 21stCentury Community Homestead Act and a public trust for investment. This provision is crucial, given the astronomical cost projections of most direct reparation plans.36 It is a document meant to be discussed, not summarized, drawing on sources ranging from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research and the Black Economic Alliance to Ebony magazine and the Brookings Institutiona sign, maybe, of Buttigiegs style the accumulation of data, continual evaluation with a goal in mind. Were Buttigiegs name not attached to the Douglass Plan, we would be talking about its political descent from the black nationalist manifesto of the National Black Political Convention held in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 or its systemic reach, as called for in the manifesto of the Movement for Black Lives. The Douglass Plan says the District of Columbia should be a state.37 The king of Dyng Mayor Pete presides over South Bends celebration of Dyngus Day, a Polish festival held on the day after Easter. Robert Franklin  South Bend Tribune via AP I scraped the snow from the plaque at the base of the statue Buttigieg proudly refers to in his book, an almost life-size bronze of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, beloved president of Notre Dame, hand in hand with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., commemorating the moment in 1964 when they demonstrated together in Chicago. Shortest Way Home is not Dreams From My Father. Its coziness of memory, its protectiveness toward South Bend, says everything about the racial divide and the different experiences of growing up white and black there. Buttigieg is tender in his recollection of those drunken, Polish celebrations of Dyngus Day. However, he resembles or models himself on Barack Obamain his bipartisan inclinations, in the value he puts on being able to work across the aisle, in his public displays of an always equitable temper. And also in how he has been able to be openly gay in the most mainstream of political arenas.38 Back during Obamas first campaign, the word was that his advisers didnt want him to call too much attention to his being black. After all, he needed only to show up to get the point across. Buttigieg, on the other hand, had to go publicly from situational passing for straight to being out and in office. We blush for him in the romantic paragraphs of his book when he remembers going down on one knee to propose to Chasten at the airport. He has been criticized for not being gay enough. Something similar was once said about Obama not being black enough. Buttigieg has a difficult task, saying hes not the status quo while having to get across that he is, indeed, normal. Except he isnt. Hes not really a privileged white male. Insides matter.39 Related Article 82168216But there is this one little thing,8217 I remember Evelyn saying, quoting a black woman in South Carolina explaining her main reservation concerning Buttigieg. We get offended that the black community is said to be antigay, as if white communities werent also homophobic, but I kept hearing black people in South Bend say, 8216You know how they are down South.821740 8216Get over it,8217 Minister Deb Franklin said with a flash of her hands after the 8 oclock service at Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church. Buttigieg is devout. The mornings soloist sang, 8216Dont give up on God  This aint the time to do it anyway, yall,8217 and I thought, not for the first time that weekend, how like a bloc the black vote seems from a distance and how far across the political spectrum the black vote stretches when viewed up close.41 Marla Godette, the dynamic organizer of the very emotional annual Martin Luther King Jr. Americas Sunday Supper, held in a large downtown hotel, said she did not like to be told that because she is black, she ought to vote in a certain way. 8216Quit worrying about who I am and come help me.821742 Its something of a manipulation to complain that the black vote is being taken for granted, I said, when everyone has been saying that no one is going to win without it, that the Democrats cant choose someone black voters will stay home on, as many did with Hillary Clinton. But then black voters are so morally opposed to Agent Oranges gangsterism, have so had enough of Republican Party collusion that the split between moderate and progressive factions in the Democratic Party was maybe not as meaningful to them as the question that cannot yet be answered Who can win? I wondered if the longing for community radiated by every speaker at the supper wasnt gratified by the black vote being a bloc vote once the primaries are over. Black people for the most part do not vote against their own interestsalthough not voting is a form of voting for the wrong side. Voter suppression is another matter.43 At this point, Godettes jovial husband confessed that he was a Republican. He thought Trump would win a second term. I was shocked. Wed been having such a good time.44 The next morning, I tiptoed down the stairs of my landmark inn. On the way out of town, along the two-lane highway, we passed a white kid, hooded up and puffing through the snow along the blue side of the road. His job had to be up ahead, in one of the Pizza Huts or gas stations in the early-shift lights. In 2018 unemployment was just 3.2 percent in Indiana and 3.7percent among blacks there. But much of it may be underemployment, without benefits, for instance. My Caribbean taxi driver of a certain age had scarcely mumbled a whole sentence to me over the weekend.

Affordable for whom? It is not just a question from communities within the footprint of every proposed rezoning in New York City. It is a question that is being asked across the nation. More than in any campaign in recent memory, housing has become a key topic in the 2020 presidential race, reflecting a national housing crisis spanning from megacities like New York and San Francisco to smaller urban centers like Cleveland and rural areas like Randolph County, Georgia.According to some research, home prices in 70 percent of the country are more than average household can afford.","homeless, housing crisis"
southbend,"This Year, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis",2020-02-10T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,South Bend Tribune,"The Pew Charitable Trust found that in 2015, 38 percent of all renter households were rent burdened, an increase of about 19 percent from 2001. In South Bend, Ind., where Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg is mayor, there are 400 homeless households. In former Mayor Mike Bloombergs town, there are nearly 60,000 people living in homeless shelters. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, almost 7 million housing units are needed to make up for the lack of affordable housing stock in the country. Last June, the Trump administration took steps that could have a heavy impact on the future of housing, such as creating a White House Council, chaired by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, which will look at ways to reform local zoning laws that prevent the construction of multifamily housing units. Six months later, HUD proposed a revision to the Obama administrations anti-discrimination Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule Secretary Carson proposed that rules implementation and method be left up to local jurisdictions rather than the federal government. Some candidates have come up with comprehensive, ambitious housing plans while others have proposed more modest responses. Housing policy experts and advocates say this is the first time in modern history that housing has become a main presidential issue and also the first time moderators asked a question about affordable housin2g during a nationally televised Democratic presidential debates. The core of the crisis is the lack of affordable housing for lower income households, and voters are interested in knowing the candidates housing plans before they make a vote, says Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of National Low Income Housing Coalition. In some cities and towns, there are enough apartments or housing-but there are not enough households who can afford those housing units.Its a multifaceted problem, and there are already federal programs in place aimed at addressing some aspects of italthough they appear to be falling short. The mix of targets and tools means the candidates plans share broad similarities and some striking differences.Theres actually quite a bit of overlap, says Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings. The first is that they acknowledge that there are people who have low incomes who cant afford housing. Thats basically a national problem that everywhere in the country, there are some people who just earn so little that they cant afford to pay rent that would cover the operating costs on a basic apartment.The second big box idea is that they need to talk about is the fact that in some places like New York and California, we havent been building enough new housing to keep up with demand, and most of the candidates have acknowledged that, adds Schuetz. And then the third big point, is talking about racial disparities in housing markets the past history of discrimination for things like mortgage lending and the degree of racial segregation that still exists in most cities.Of course, comparing what the candidates propose is just one lens. Whether the ideas are legally, financially and politically viable is another key test. With that in mind, heres a detailed look at the key housing proposals from candidates in the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary.Biden Few specificsFor 36 years, Joe Biden served as a U.S. senator until he became Vice President in the Obama administration. During his time as Senator, Biden co-sponsored or sponsored 11 pieces of legislation related to housing and development ranging from the National Homestead Assistance Act-which allowed the HUD secretary to purchase vacant, single-family homes-to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1981 to include persons with disabilities including other measures. The Fair Housing Amendments Act, which expanded the forms of discrimination deemed violative of fair-housing laws, and enlarged the list of classes protected from housing discrimination to include the disabled. Biden in 2013. Although Biden has not released a comprehensive housing plan like his rivals Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg or Buttigieg  Bidens campaign does focus on investing in the middle class through entrepreneurship and community investments.We have spoken to almost every candidate and I am bewildered that Biden has not put out a plan yet, says Yentel.The Biden campaign raised 61 million at last report. After retirees and law firms, the real estate industry is the third-biggest source of Bidens contributions, according to Open Secrets. Dozens of smaller contributions in increments ranging from 2.50 to 5,600 were made by several New York real-estate developers. Other contributions include 3,500 from Roger Tackeff a Boston-based developer. Bloomberg A vow to cut homelessnessAs mayor of the nations largest city for 12 years, Mike Bloomberg oversaw the largest public housing authority in the country, ran a homeless shelter system under a unique local legal right to shelter and helped regulate one of the largest biggest real-estate markets in the world. That gives him a deeper track record  for praise andor scrutiny  than any of the other candidates in the race, even the other mayors Buttigieg, currently, and, formerly, Sanders.That record is decidedly mixed. Bloomberg rezoned 40 percent of the city, but some of those zonings prevented any increase in affordable housing. His housing plan generated lots of units 165,000 but many of them were unaffordable to the neighborhoods in which they were built. He made big promises on reducing homelessness, but cut off the supply of Section 8 and public housing to the shelters. Until late in his term, he did little for NYCHA.Bloomberg laid out his housing plan for the nation in late January. He plans on guaranteeing housing vouchers to all Americans at or below 30 percent of the area median income, which is an estimated 28,830 for a household of three help families stay in their homes by funding emergency financial assistance expand federal grants to cities that implement effective eviction prevention programs and create pilot programs for tenant counseling and legal-advice services. He would also raise the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC and increase the Child Tax Credit for low-income households. Mike Bloomberg For access to housing, Bloomberg plans on recruiting more landlords into the voucher system and reducing the red tape within that system. He says he will use regulation and incentives to mitigate discrimination by landlords. He will also establish navigator services to help tenants find and secure housing. Additionally, Bloomberg plans to cut the homeless population in half using existing federal resources coupled with initiatives by local governments. He wants to double federal spending on homelessness from under 3 billion to 6 billion annually. He says he will increase federal support for housing-first strategies and provide housing-search support and short-term rental assistance. As preventative measures, he wants to expand the promotion of rapid-rehousing and permanent supportive housing, providing stability to the chronically homeless to address issues such as substance use disorder and mental-health services where needed and serving as a bridge to rental assistance. He will also integrate homeless support with critical wrap-around services and expand federal grants to cities that implement effective homelessness prevention programs.In order to increase housing supply, Bloomberg plans on increasing funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and prioritizing new transportation funding for areas that have undertaken progressive zoning reform and reward municipalities that support affordable housing development in neighborhoods with good schools, transportation, and economic opportunity. He will also provide funding for public housing by streamlining the Rental Assistance Demonstration program and increasing funding to the National Housing Trust Fund. Additionally, his plan will provide resources to help homeowners, building owners, and tenants for energy-saving renovations. He will also increase funding for energy retrofits and fully fund the existing Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program which helps mitigate home energy, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs costs. For tenants, Bloomberg wants to help renters become homeowners through a pilot program targeted to assist people with down payments for new homes, provide federal matching funds to offer all residents of the 100 communities as down payment and expand access to financial services. His goal includes one million new African-American homeowners. For local governments, Bloomberg wants streamline investments to address the housing crisis by building on President Obamas Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative by driving an interagency effort from the White House. The Obama 2011 initiative was created to give technical assistance to local governments in order to execute their economic vision and strategies through public and private partnerships. Bloomberg, a billionaire, is financing his own campaign to the tune of 200 million so far and is not accepting contributions. Buttigieg Douglass Plan targets vacant-land potentialDecades younger than most of his presidential rivals , Pete Buttigieg came onto the campaign stage with experience as mayor of South Bend. His housing plan was released last year November along with several other plans to help middle-to low-income households by lowering child care costs, making college more affordable, lowering health care costs and furthering consumer rights protections. Buttigiegs housing plan is similar in scope to Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warrens housing plans. He will invest 430 billion to create access to affordable housing for over 7 million households and to create an additional 2 million housing units through creation and preservation initiatives. He also plans on working to reform local zoning laws. He wants to also invest in homeownership and is looking to facilitate homeownership of one million low-income households. Refoming zoning is a common theme among the Democrats. Schuetz says this is new territory for federal policy.  Because thats really new, its hard to say at this point that any of those are more likely to succeed or even more likely to get adopted, she says.Another Buttigieg plan is to target redlined neighborhoods part of a comprehensive plan, known as the Douglass Plan, to mitigate racial and income in equities, particularly in communities of color. The Douglass Plan lists several initiatives ranging from criminal justice to health equity reforms. Mayor Pete Buttigieg Within the Douglass Plan, Buttigiegs housing agenda includes the Community Homestead Act in which cities would apply for federal funding to operate land banks to acquire vacant properties and provide them to low-income families under a 10-year residency obligation.Schuetz notes the Douglass Plan offers more to cities like South Bend or Baltimore or Detroit where there are swathes of land with city-owned houses in certain poor conditions, but was not tailored for larger cities where vacant space is rare.It is not the first time Buttigieg has pushed to create housing. After he was elected to Mayor of South Bend in 2011, he created a task force to analyze the citys vacancy stock which identified 1,900 vacant and 1,275 abandoned properties to renovate and reuse. In a report, similar to the Douglass Plan, the task force recommended establishing a land bank to encourage neighborhood revitalization efforts such as renovating homes with violations. In response in 2013, Buttigieg launched a 1,000 Homes in a 1000 Days initiative with a budget of 10.5 million dollars funded by HUDs Community Development Block Grant program, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and the states Blight Elimination Program3, a program to bring up property value through revitalization efforts. According to HUD4, the initiative has met with some success. The city handled 1,122 houses 427 were repaired, 569 were demolished, 10 were deconstructed, six were set aside for repair by community development corporations, and 110 were under contract for demolition. Despite the success, the initiative also came under criticism for displacing some families from debilitated housing, instead of fixing their homes. The South Bend city administration argued that those homes had not been occupied for over 90 days, according to South Bend Tribune5. Buttigiegs campaign fundraising has topped 76 million, with an estimated 932,988 from individuals connected to real estate groups, according to Open Secrets.Klobuchar A broad if modest plan Sen. Amy Klobuchar Senator Amy Klobuchars rise began when she became Minnesotas Hennepin County Attorney. She became the first woman elected Senator in her state in 2006 just a couple of years shy of the 2008 foreclosure crisis. At the cusp of the crisis, Klobuchar co-sponsored several Congressional measures ranging from the bills to protect mortgage applicants to an amendment to the tax code allowing some flexibility for homeowners who originally financed their mortgages through a qualified subprime loan. Since then, she has cosponsored several measures to mitigate homelessness, end discrimination against victims of domestic violence, and create easier access to the federal housing voucher program, among over 30 other housing and development bills and amendments. Akin to the housing plans proposed by Buttigieg, Warren and Sanders, Klobuchars housing plan is focused on creating affordable housing, mitigating homelessness and creating paths to homeownership but she focuses on tweaking several existing federal programs. Klobuchar plans to fight housing discrimination by creating a new federal grant program for access to free legal counsel for people facing evictions prohibiting discrimination based on income source or the blacklisting of tenants who have been evicted in the past modifying the current Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule and restoring the Office of Fair Lending and Opportunity to monitor fair lending practices whose authority has been reduced by the Trump administration. For tenants, she plans on expanding rental assistance for affordable housing in rural towns by improving access to existing federal programs, and through the purchasing power of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, her administration will encourage lenders to serve rural mortgage markets. Additionally, she will expand support for affordable senior housing and direct affordable housing programs to allow retrofitting of rental housing for seniors. She also has plans for major investments in the Housing Choice Voucher pilot program, which allows families to use their vouchers in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Additionally, Klobuchar plans on tackling outdated zoning policies by incentivizing cities who change their zoning policies with federal housing and infrastructure grants. As a path to prevent future evictions, she wants to create a personal savings account called UP Accounts for retirement and emergencies. Under her UP Accounts plan, employers will set aside at least 50 cents per hour worked to help people build more than 600,000 in wealth over the course of a career. The funds could also be accessed during emergencies that cause delayed payments for rent. Klobuchar also plans to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit for developing affordable rental housing and investing in homeless assistance grants that provide emergency and long-term housing. She proposes a new federal tax credit, similar to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, to encourage investment in family-owned homes in distressed neighborhoods. She also wants to build on existing programs to allow certain types of rental housing assistance to be used for homeownership expenses and also plans on proposing legislation that will expand access to capital for down payments. She also wants to allow credit bureaus to use on-time payment data from cell phone bills, utilities, and rent in calculating credit scores so it is easier to build credit. During the first 100 days of her presidency, Klobuchar plans on strengthening Community Reinvestment Act protections, developing policies to encourage financial institutions to make loans and investment in local communities. Klobuchar also wants to focus on educating first-time homebuyers through improving education programs that especially target communities with low levels of homeownership. Klobuchar also plans on reversing the Trump Administrations proposed changes to federal housing subsidies and updating regulations for reverse mortgages, especially for seniors. Her plan for funding some of these existing and new programs will come from raising the capital gains rate to the income tax rate for households making over 400,000, and part of her infrastructure plan, which includes plans for housing, will raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.According to the Federal Election Commission FEC, Klobuchars campaign has raised an estimated 29 million dollars. Her campaign has raised an estimated 300,741 dollars6 from the real estate industry ranging from a maximum of 2,800 to even one dollar7 in donations, according to Open Secrets and the FEC. Next to Bidens punt, Klobuchar offers the most modest plan among the major Democratic candidates.Sanders Rent control and moreLast year in September, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a 2.5 trillion plan to mitigate the growing housing crisis across the country.Sanders plans to invest 1.48 trillion in the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund in order to create, preserve and rehabilitate permanently affordable housing units within mixed-income development. An additional 400 billion will be invested to build 2 million mixed-income social housing units also administered through the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. He also plans on investing an additional 500 million dollars in the United States Department of Agriculture USDA Section 515 program, an existing rural rental housing loans program to provide affordable rental housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. Sanders calls for increasing funding for the Indian Housing Block Grant Program to 3 billion to build, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing in Indian country. Sanders also plans on investing 70 billion dollars in improving public housing, including to provide broadband services, and wants to repeal the Faircloth Amendment which does not allow HUD to construct new public housing units. Sen. Bernie Sanders On Section 8, Sanders plans on fully funding the rental assistance program with 410 billion dollars over the next 10 years and making it a mandatory funding program for all eligible households. He also plans on expanding and strengthening the enforcement of the Small Area Fair Market Rent rule, which reforms voucher payments to help recipients move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods. When it comes to tenant protections, Sanders proposal for national rent regulation would cap annual rent increases at no more than 3 percent while allowing landlords to apply for waivers if significant capital improvements are made on the property. Bernie Sanders has a proposal for whats essentially nationwide rent-control, which is way outside the box of anything thats been discussed before and Im not totally clear whether thats constitutional. And it would be very difficult to implement, Scheutz says. He also plans to implement a just-cause requirement for evictions. Additionally, he wants to provide 2 billion towards states and localities right to counsel programs for tenants facing evictions or foreclosure proceedings, or at risk of losing their Section 8 rental assistance.Sanders also wants to streamline the review process and direct funding towards implementing fair and inclusive zoning ordinances with a focus on communities that face gentrification. For example, he proposes to place a 25 percent house flipping tax on speculators who sell a non-owner-occupied property, if the property is sold for more than its purchase price within within years of the procurement. Another proposal from Sanders will impose a 2 percent Empty Homes tax on the property value of vacant, owned homes. Hes called for creating an independent agency to protect Section 8 renters from discriminatory landlords, fully funding the existing Fair Housing Assistance and Fair Housing Initiatives Programs at 1 billion over the next 10 years and ensuring formerly incarcerated residents are not excluded from public housing options. Sanders wants to use 25,000 National Affordable Housing Trust Fund units in the first year for homeless households and also double the funding for the McKinney-Vento homelessness assistance grants to over 26 billion over the next five years to build permanent supportive housing. Additionally, he plans on providing 500 million in funding to states and localities for homeless outreach programs. Sanders also wants to invest 50 billion over 10 years to provide grants for community land trusts and other shared equity homeownership models and invest an additional 15 billion to enact a 21st Century Homestead Act, which will revitalize abandoned properties and historically disadvantaged communities. For first-time home buyers, he wants to invest an additional 2 billion in USDA and an additional 6 billion in HUD to create a first-time homebuyer assistance program that will increase home ownership. Sanders campaign has raised the most money110 millionamong his Democratic counterparts for the 2020 presidential elections. According to Open Secrets, almost 380,000 was donated by members of real-estate groups.Warren Aiming to limit Wall Streets roleSen. Elizabeth Warren got her start as an academic and became an advisor to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in the 1990s. But her profile grew after she spoke as a proponent of heavier regulations on banks, especially after the role they played in the 2008 financial crisis. Her plan revolves around four main goals reducing rents for lower- and middle- class families closing the racial barriers to housing that the federal government created decades ago with redlining removing other kinds of discrimination from affordable housing and finally, ending Wall Streets heavy influence on the housing market. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Warrens plan promises 500 billion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, with almost all of that going to the Housing Trust Fund, a HUD affordable housing production program. The leftover cash includes over 500 million going into the USDAs Rural Housing Service8, 2.5 billion into the Indian Housing Block Grant9 and the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant10, and 4 billion into creating a new grant called the Middle-Class Housing Emergency Fund, designed to help fund housing construction for middle-class families specifically in areas where affordable housing is scarce. A large portion of the 500 billion will be shouldered by private-public partnerships, which puts Warren in line with President Obamas housing policy.11 To pay for the rest, the bill proposes a lower cap on the estate tax. Instead of taxing inheritances starting at 22 million, Warren proposes the tax start at 7 million, adding about 14,000 more multi-million dollar families to the pool of funding.Warren promises to curb cities exclusionary zoning policies, like mandatory parking requirements12, development fees or minimum lot sizes, which a report from 201513 says caused a massive increase in segregation. Warrens plan to incentivize cities to axe these policies? Dangle a 10 billion carrot. Her bill proposes a new grant program that cities can apply for in order to build infrastructure, schools or parks. Warren also plans to dismantle the effects of redlining14. Warren proposes a substantial housing grant for residents in affected neighborhoods, provided that they have lived there for four-or-more years, qualify as low-income and are first-time home-buyers. The grant is aimed towards eliminating or easing the cost of a down payment on a home for minorities in disadvantaged areas. She also plans on expanding rights under the Fair Housing Act, which currently prohibits landlords from discriminating on the basis of sex or race. Her bill proposes to expand the act to include sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, and the source of ones income, like a housing voucher.When the FHA acquires single-family homes through foreclosure, it often sells those homes to private equity firms like Blackstone15. These firms, in turn, will hike up the price of those homes. Warrens plan aims to stop this cycle. Warren would mandate that a minimum of 75 percent of these foreclosed homes are sold directly to an individual owneroccupant, or to a community group that will rehabilitate the home and sell it directly to an owneroccupant. Her plans for tenants focus on rent-burdened households by investing 500 billion over the next 10 years to create, preserve, and rehabilitate over 3 million affordable housing units for lower-income families and her plan would lower rents by 10 percent. According to the FEC, Warren has raised 82 million. Her campaign has seen an estimated 255,181 dollars from members of the real-estate industry, per Open Secrets.A broader discussionAs part of the National Low Income Housing Coalitions campaign Our Homes, Our Voices which started last year, the national housing advocacy group has issued a list of recommendations it hopes will guide candidates and, eventually, the next presidential administration.The NLIHC recommendations are four-fold. The first is to preserve and produce deeply affordable homes to meet the 7 million unit shortageat a cost of at least 40 billion, plus another 50 billion dollar investment in repairing public housing. The second policy is funding rental cash assistance and the third recommendation is emergency cash assistance for households who may have faced a medical emergency and lack the funds to pay rent for a period of time. The last policy recommendation is to protect tenants from all discrimination and abuses. Schuetz believes the housing policy discussion needs to expand even more, to discuss the environmental impactespecially in the context of climate changeof building housing in car-dependent suburbs, and to address the role of housing value in perpetuating the racial wealth gap. Most middle income households, their largest financial asset is the equity in their home thats been pretty detrimental to African-American and Latino households who are less likely to be homeowners or they become homeowners later in life and tend to buy houses in neighborhoods where prices dont appreciate as much, she says. So the homeownership strategy has created this very large racial wealth gap, and theyre sort of nibbling around the edges of that, but not actually addressing the fact that there are some limits to using homeownership. None of them have explicitly linked this to is there another way that we can help Americans save money and develop wealth thats not tied to home ownership.Read deeper NPS, NYCHA, DVIDSHUB, SlowkingOn City Streets and in Wild Landscapes, the Fight for Americas Soul in 2020 is About Land16 The post This Year, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis17 appeared first on City Limits18.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18","homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing"

southbend,2:00PM Water Cooler 4/22/2019,2019-04-22T00:00:00Z,Naked Capitalism,South Bend Tribune,"Like many regimes in the developing world, Beijing fears the middle-income trap, in which rising wages undermine its advantage as a center of low-cost manufacturing before it develops the capacity to produce higher-value goods. China worries that unless it moves from assembling iPhones to inventing them, economic growth will stagnate and popular unrest will follow. China therefore erects tariffs to protect industries it hopes will help it make that leap. So did the United States when it was industrializing. And Complaints dominate Beltway discourse not because the evidence underlying them is particularly strong. It isnt. They have come to dominate Beltway discourse because Democrats and Republicans both believe that Trumps anti-China message helped him win Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and that the path to the presidency runs through those states again in 2020.

In a way, I think that you could make a case that there are two black Americas among the people descended of the enslaved in this country The sons and daughters of the Great Migration and the sons and daughters of the people who stayed in the South. One difference is religiosity. While black people in general are more religious than the overall population, black people in the South are also appreciably more religious than black people in other parts of the country, according to Gallup data. This religiosity translates into a form of social conservatism.  Blow is, I think, treading delicately around Californias Proposition 85 Based on National Eelction Pool NEP estimates, 70 percent of blacks cast their ballots in favor of Proposition 8 i.e., against gay marriage while 49 of white, 53 of Latinos, 49 of Asians, and 51 of those from another racialethnic identity supported a ban on gay marriage.  The seeming paradox can be resolved if the liberal Democrat Establishment regards Buttigieg as a catspaw, with their ultimate goal preventing Sanders from winning 50  1 of the delegates, and a brokered convention.

David Axelrod davidaxelrod April 14, 20197Buttigieg D3 South Bend considers legal options with homeless under Main Street South Bend Tribune8. Two days after removing wooden pallets that the homeless were using for beds under the Main Street viaduct, the city was still letting people camp there Wednesday. Shortly after the city destroyed the pallets Monday morning, people returned and set up new encampments with cardboard boxes, bedding and assorted possessions. Mayor Pete Buttigieg doesnt want that happening either, and he said his administrations attorneys were researching whether Indianas public nuisance law authorizes the city to prohibit the encampments altogether.. John Shafer, founder of the nonprofit Michiana Five For the Homeless, which secured the pallets from an Elkhart food pantry and brought them to the viaduct, has called their confiscation and destruction by the city shameful. Buttigieg said the city didnt think it was taking anyones possessions, as Shafer has said. People have different ideas about being helpful, Buttigieg said. The pallets symbolize, in some ways, a real concern we have about people who are well-intentioned but can be doing more harm than good. Buttigieg D4 Buttigieg says he doesnt support boycotts of companies over political donations CNN9. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg cautioned against boycotts of companies like Chick-fil-A because of their political giving in an interview on Wednesday, arguing that it leads people to sometimes slip into a sort of virtue signaling in some cases where were not really being consistent. The comment  which comes a day after Buttigieg, who is gay, said he doesnt support Chick-fil-As politics but supports its chicken  is significant because of past controversy surrounding Chick-fil-A. The fast food companys president Dan Cathy said in 2012 that the company was supportive of the biblical definition of the family unit and that society was inviting Gods judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage. As a result, many groups boycotted the chain. People have different ideas about being helpful. Moulton D Massachusetts Rep.

She would pay for it with revenue generated by her proposed increase in taxes for Americas most wealthy families and corporations, which the campaign estimates to be 2.75 trillion over 10 years. In addition to eliminating undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities, she would expand federal grants to help students with nontuition expenses and create a 50 billion fund to support historically black colleges and universities. She would eliminate up to 50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of less than 100,000 borrowers who make between 100,000 and 250,000 would have a portion of their debt forgiven.

The Massachusetts senator launched into a brief history lesson on African-American homebuyers being rejected outside designated areas, black families getting hit hardest by subprime mortgages and foreclosures during the 2008 crash, and black homeownership still lagging far behind whites.

We Asked Democratic Activists Who Theyre Backing  And Who Theyd Hate To See Win FiveThirtyEight26. As part of my ongoing book research, Ive been in touch with roughly 60 Democratic activists in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, D.C.,1 asking them about their preferences for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. About 35 people from the respondent pool participated in each wave of interviews This time around, I also asked respondents who they didnt want as the nominee.  n  35. The party decideds?Hmm. Better start training those poll-watchers and coin-flippers. Evaluating the 2020 Democratic Primary Field RealClearPolitics27. Assessing the Democratic presidential primary at this point is a nearly impossible task. With around 15 serious candidates who have declared or formed an exploratory committee, and with another handful seriously looking at joining the race, the slate is very much in flux. Like the Republican primary in 2016, small changes in the polling position of candidates can translate to a large change in their position relative to one another, which in turn incentivizes rising candidates to stay in. So rather than, say, power-ranking the candidates - how does one really decide how to rank John Hickenlooper versus Jay Inslee? - I will look at them through the lens of buy versus sell.  Fun methodology! Abrams buy, Biden sell, Booker sell, Buttigieg sell, Harris hold, Klobuchar buy, ORourke buy, Sanders buy, Warren sell, Yang buy. Penny stocks Castro, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Inslee, Bennet, and some other members of Congress and candidates you may have never heard of.Realignment and LegitimacyReparations I think many of us are in agreement that HR40 will benefit from revision.

Jane McAlevey on How To Organize for Power Current Affairs31. McAlevey Im not critical of mobilization, Im very clear that we need plenty of mobilization. Its just, Im critical when thats all we do. The difference between the twoand this is sort of the essential reason why we have to do both, not just onemobilizing is essentially when we just spend all of our time talking to people who already agree with us. Its getting more effective at the technology of turnout. Its calling up a protest, and 300 people show up the first time, and you say Wow, that wasnt what we thought, and you double down, and you do way better social media, and you use every single piece of technology you can, and you get 4,000 out the next time. And thats a huge jump, and you feel great. The problem is that your organization is more like 100,000, and so youre still only turning out a teeny fraction, and even worse, youre not actually engaging anyone or expanding your base. So, what organizing is, by contrast, if I just use that example If your base is 100,000, organizing is an explicit strategy to go from 100,000 to 1,000,000 and to make it simple, realistic, with a plan. In organizing, were consciously, every single day, doing what we call base expansion.  If Sanders is organizing, and not mobilizing His staff and he are in for quite a ride.

Research suggests that even if you dont ditch your tracker after the first few months43, it can be difficult to develop a healthy, effective relationship with the device thats monitoring your calories, steps, and minutes of sleep. In one study44, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, overweight participants who wore fitness trackers each day lost less weight than those who didnt. In another45, people who wore them for a full year were no healthier than theyd been at the start of the study. On the other end of the spectrum, users can become too obsessed with the data their devices are collecting, leading them to self-diagnose problems that dont exist46 they can get so invested in their stats that it drains any enjoyment47 from previously pleasant activities and, in some cases, fitness trackers can even exacerbate disordered eating behaviors48 Transportation Union Pacific Corp.s precision railroading plan is triggering a major shift in the carriers investment plans.

In the summer of 2010, I made the first notes towards a book called Underland, about burial and unburial, deep time and journeys into darkness, which would eventually take almost a decade to write. It was hard, that summer, not to think of the underland, for three extraordinary stories were unfolding, dominating global news for months the Deepwater Horizon52 disaster, the entrapment of 33 Chilean miners beneath the Atacama desert53, and the eruption of Icelands Eyjafjallaj√∂kull54 volcano.  Damn, one more book to read. This article has a fascinating perspective, and its well worth a read. I quoted this paragraph to memoriaize the Deepwater Horizon disaster I still remember the live videos from the ocean floor Was There a Civilization On Earth Before Humans? The Atlantic55. When it comes to direct evidence of an industrial civilizationthings like cities, factories, and roadsthe geologic record doesnt go back past whats called the Quaternary period 2.6 million years ago. For example, the oldest large-scale stretch of ancient surface lies in the Negev Desert. Its just 1.8 million years old And, if were going back this far, were not talking about human civilizations anymore. So, could researchers find clear evidence that an ancient species built a relatively short-lived industrial civilization long before our own? Perhaps, for example, some early mammal rose briefly to civilization building during the Paleocene epoch about 60 million years ago. Fifty-six million years ago, Earth passed through the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum PETM. During the PETM, the planets average temperature climbed as high as 15 degrees Fahrenheit above what we experience today. It was a world almost without ice, as typical summer temperatures at the poles reached close to a balmy 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Looking at the isotopic record from the PETM, scientists see both carbon and oxygen isotope ratios spiking in exactly the way we expect to see in the Anthropocene record.  Its always been my secret theory that civilization killed the dinosaurs. No evidence, though!s Southern Ocean diatoms small, yet mighty! oceanbites56. The organic carbon produced by the phytoplankton helps fuel the carbon cycle by either 1 being eaten by zooplankton, a type of larger planktonic organism 2 sinking out to the deep ocean after dying or 3 contracting a marine virus that causes the cellular content organic carbon to leak out. The contribution that phytoplankton make to the carbon pump differs between ocean regions as the types and abundance of phytoplankton vary. Phytoplankton species vary between the different regions of the ocean depending on specific environmental conditions, such as light, nutrients or temperature. Pointless rare knee bone makes evolutionary comeback in humans Sky News57. The fabella, described as the appendix of the skeleton, is buried in a tendon behind the knee and acted as a kneecap in Old World monkeys. It can cause pain and discomfort and was once rare in humans - but a new study has shown it is becoming more common. Scientists from Imperial College London ICL examined 21,000 knee studies from 27 countries spanning 150 years. Between 1918 and 2018, the number of people with a fabella increased more than threefold. In 1918, just 11.2 of the world population had one, but by 2018 the percentage had risen to 39.  Evolution in historical time. Amazing. A highway runs through it Grist58. Progressives like Chris Sensenig now see freeway removal as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redress the wrongs of the past and make cities radically greener. For nearly a decade, the urban designer has been thinking seriously about what Oakland would look like without I-980. And the more he thought about it  the more he collected old ma s and pictures of the landscape before the highway  the more excited he became. He joined up with other like-minded people to form ConnectOakland59, a small organization dedicated to envisioning a neighborhood free of I-980. The key thing is that this is public land, Sensenig said. Public land is for the public good. We should be seeking to maximize the public good, not just accepting whatever happens to already be there.  But the local politics are interesting apparently, when I-980 was put through, the community was involved, so they are invested in a way that, say, the North End of Boston was not with the horrid Central Artery. MMT The left should resist the siren song of modern monetary theory Heather Boushey, WaPo60. But to me, as someone who shares some of the policy goals of MMT advocates, it seems crazy to give up on taxes as an important source of revenue for vital social programs  to define taxes as, in a sense, irrelevant to government spending  at a time when the public, finally, seems to have an appetite for universal health care, wealth taxes and similar ambitious policies. At such a moment, why embrace a theory that has never been tested on a significant scale? To shift toward an economic theory that sees taxes as largely irrelevant to government spending is economically and politically unwise. Heather Boushey is the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. So this is what passing the baton61 means? Hits the jackpot Fortunately, climate change will wait while we fight over fiscal space.  Stephanie Kelton StephanieKelton April 19, 201962The 420 New Yorkers Get Cannabis With Their Lunch for 420 Day Bloomberg63. Confusion reigns over the legality of marijuana-related products. Federal regulators are focused on commercial claims that CBD has beneficial health effects, for which theres no conclusive evidence. Meanwhile, retailers claim the additive can help with chronic pain or anxiety, but again, theres no evidence. Then theres the unanswered question, as the FDA noted earlier this year, of whether there are negative long-term effects from CBD use. None of this has gotten in the way of clever marketing aimed at consumers who dont knowor careabout the latest scientific study.  Amazingly, Bloomberg does not expand the CBD acronym it refers to cannabidiol, the second-most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis64 after THC, with which I am familiar but non-intoxicating. Class Warfare The California exodus is speeding up Quartz65. According to recently released66 data from the US Census, about 38,000 more people left California than entered it in 2018. This is the second straight year that migration to the state was negative, and its a trend that is speeding up. Every year since 2014, net migration has fallen. Besides births, the main reason Californias population hasnt already started falling has been international migration into the state. Every year since 2011, net domestic migration has been negativei.e., more people leave California than move in from other states. But from 2011 to 2016, the number of international migrants moving into California was larger than the number of locals who were moving out.  Hmm. Lawyer files 5-million claim, saying L.A.

I juxtapose these two snippets not to trash California, but to point out that California, with its very high Gini coefficient, is not necessarily a model for the rest of the country to follow and we should be wary of the local oligarchy that runs it, if we were not already from CalPERS.

Thank you!  This entry was posted in Water Cooler95 on April 22, 201996 by Lambert Strether97.About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clintons wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since Ive been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.  1  2  3  4  5 page_scan_tab_contents  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38 top  39 top  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 .VnhQMqZXbdt  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71 eid11735892  72  73  74  75 eid12073134  76  77  78 eid11735280  79  80  81  82 eid21558501  83 eid12429836  84  85 eid36890616  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97",homeless

Festival of Buttigieg today Buttigieg D 1 Buttigieg Says Flooding in the Midwest Is Not Big Deal, Just a Small Fraction of Years Rainfall CEPR3. That is not quite what he said, but it is pretty much in the same spirit as what Buttigieg said about trade and jobs, according to the Washington Post. The post told readers Buttigieg has said six times as many jobs were lost because of automation as trade from 2000 to 2010. This is more or less right in the same way that Nebraska will get far more rain over the course of 2019 than the rain that caused the recent flooding. And, the assertion makes about as much sense in the context of the floods as in the context of jobs lost to imports.  Looks like Mayor Pete is trying to drive in Yangs lane? Buttigieg D 2 After Gaza slaughter, Buttigieg praised Israeli security responses as moving and faulted Democrats for easy judgment Mondoweiss4. Buttigieg is a quick study and what leaps out from these remarks is how completely the Rhodes Scholar imbibed the official pro-Israel version of events, and showed contempt for Palestinian understanding. There is no sense in Buttigiegs remarks that Israel is a militarized, rightwing country that adores Donald Trump and that is led by a strongman and that answers resistance to the existing order with overwhelming force that international human rights organizations said at the time of his remarks were likely war crimes. Buttigieg did not meet with AIPAC last week but we can expect Buttigieg to take a centrist pro-Israel position in opposition to the Democratic base, which is highly critical of Israel.

As expected, Sanders set the early pace in fundraising, with more than 18 million raised from 525,000 individual contributors who gave, on average, 20 Sanders has a massive existing list from his 2016 campaign, and in that race, demonstrated his appeal in the online giving world. He raised an unbelievable 228 million for his primary against Hillary Clinton, a number that still boggles the mind. Still, just because Sanders number isnt surprising, it also shouldnt be taken for granted. Sanders fundraising ability  and the fact that he rarely if ever holds fundraisers to collect cash  is a major advantage for his campaign as we move forward into the rest of this year and into 2020 when voters start voting.  I like the Sanders average contribution has dropped. It means the 90 are donating. Sanders D 3 Sanders launches mega volunteer program Politico17. Bernie Sanders campaign will unveil a slate of top hires and kickoff events Wednesday  the latest sign that he plans to harness his record-breaking grassroots army earlier and more strategically than he did during his first run for the White House. More than 1 million people have signed up to volunteer for his campaign, aides said, and the Sanders team will ask them Wednesday to host house parties across the country on April 27, a date that will double as the official launch of Sanders 2020 organizing program.  Looks like lambert preens I was right There are three carefully assembled strategic assets for the Sanders campaign From 2016, the list not available to other Democrats from 2018, the media empire not available to other Democrats and for 2020, the canvassing operation not available to other Democrats.

Trump Trump says Biden accusations are work of Dem socialists Politico18. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists, suggesting that a recent wave of criticism of the potential 2020 presidential candidate is the product of attacks hatched by his own partys left wing.  Liberal Democrats agree! Personally, I think Putin planted the clips in the C-SPAN video library. Warren Elizabeth Warren Corporate executives must face jail time for overseeing massive scams WaPo19. we should enact the Ending Too Big To Jail Act, which I introduced last year. That bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks accountable for scams by requiring them to certify that they conducted a due diligence inquiry and found that no illegal conduct was occurring on their watch. This would force executives to look for wrongdoing or face prosecution for filing false certifications with the government. The proposal would also create a permanent and well-funded unit dedicated to investigating financial crimes.  Thats the stuff to give the troops! Although oddly, or not, Warren focuses on Wells-Fargo, and not not on Holder and Obamas miserable record of non-prosecution after the Crash. Black leaders blast Dem war on super PACs Politico20. In a letter obtained by POLITICO, The Collective PAC  which helps elect black candidates to office  asked major liberal groups like Indivisible and Democracy for America to stop calling for Democratic presidential contenders to distance themselves from single-candidate super PACs.

In the beginning, Pittsburgh was a great branch. As recently as six months ago, there were 1,000 dues-paying members. There were four elected officials in Pittsburgh who had won with the aid of the branchs endorsement and hard work, and the branch was running a wide array of issue-based campaigns in the city on labor, housing, and more. The success of the branch in the 2017 elections led many more candidates to seek its support in 2018. Everything was looking up. Today the chapters membership is decimated. Only around 50 members attended the February 2019 general meeting.  Due to the clique. More I admit to feeling a certain degree of sympathy. These the clique are clearly deeply alienated people who have been forced to retreat into political organising to find the meaning and community they cannot get outside it. Capitalism regularly creates miserable people, and miserable people lack the psychological resources to put the needs of the community or the movement ahead of their own. They are themselves emotionally under-resourced, and we cannot expect people with this much pain inside them to protect others from their pain.  My first thought was to be reminded of the problem unrealized unrealizable? opportunity the homeless posed for Occupy. My second thought was to reread the piece and note that the head of the clique was previously expelled from the Israeli Communist Party for internal subversion. Or, in LeCarrs world, so they say.

There is a curious void at the heart of Democratic politics. It isnt necessary to believe in some absurd, magical notion of willpower to note that at its highest level, the party seems to lack an essential, motivating will. Instead, it views itself as something more akin to a professional membership organization that has a convention in a nice hotel every few years.

A sharp upward revision to February in Fridays data is a possibility, as this month. And but This month the rate of ADPs private employment year-over-year growth is on the low side of the tight range seen over this year. However, the rolling average of the year-over-year rate of growth remains unchanged for the last 7 months. Last months employment numbers were revised upward Econintersect27.

A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.. The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one. I wonder why? Manufacturing Between Two Boeing Crashes, Days of Silence and Mistrust New York Times37. In the days after the crash, American aviation officials visiting Jakarta cast aspersions on their Indonesian counterparts, even as they refused to speak on the record Which was more reliable?

Multiple whistleblowers provided the committee with information alleging that numerous FAA employees, including those involved in the Aircraft Evaluation Group for the Boeing 737 MAX, had not received proper training and valid certifications, Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said in a letter to the FAAs Acting Administrator Daniel Elwell Tuesday. Manufacturing U.S. Air Force Again Halts Delivery of Boeings Tanker Over Debris Bloomberg40. Amazing quotes Elaborating on the trash left behind by workers, Secretary Heather Wilson told the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee later in the day that it was a manufacturing discipline issue on the assembly line where we saw a breakdown. If you drop a wrench you have to find a wrench, she said. You have to wipe down surfaces so you dont have pieces of aluminum that over time get in the midst of things and cause serious problems. The latest delivery halt was prompted after the service opened up some closed compartments, such as inside wings, and found flaws, she said without elaborating.  Sounds like a demoralizes workforce, to me. I sure hope there arent loose wrenches sliiding around inside the wings of civilian aircraft, because that would be bad. Manufacturing Pontifications I dont know what to make of this Leeham News41. One cant help but think, a lot, about the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes and the facts that Boeing created the system, linked it to one sensor, not two, didnt tell the airlines pilots about it, didnt include it in pilot manuals, didnt have a safety alert system as standard equipment, initially blamed the Lion Air pilots and reportedly lobbied Donald Trump not to ground the airplanes. And self-certified the system too42, let us remember. More Four concurrent commercial airplane programs the KC-46A being a hybrid between commercial and military each had trouble. Two of their last four airplanes have been grounded by regulators. A third airplane had such poor quality control the customer stopped taking delivery. Three of the four were years late. Whats going on here? Boeing resources were clearly stretched too thin. Billions of dollars were going out the door in cost overruns. Were bad management decisions made by the bean-counting McNerney regime? Was there something systemic happening? Or just a run of bad luck and bad timing?  Good questions. Well worth a read. Manufacturing Disaster and the Boeing CEO Crains Chicago Business43. Though Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburgs career will be defined by the 737 Max, Leehams Scott Hamilton and Cowens Cai von Rumohr say the crisis is unlikely to end it. That would require a game-changing development, like federal prosecutors discovering that executives misled regulators about safety. But Erik Gordon of the University of Michigans Ross School of Business, who views Muilenburgs performance in the hot seat less favorably, is less sure. He is particularly critical of Boeings decision after the crashes to make standard on the Max a safety feature that was previously optional and cost extra. He argues that the move makes it appear as if safety were optional. It has negative PR consequences in the way that punching a guy in the face has PR problems The real problem is that you punched someone, Gordon says. Dennis mistakes are glaring such that, if I were on the board, I would be holding side meetings saying, Do we have alternatives for a CEO? Ironically, the crisis Muilenburg faces is largely of McNerneys making. Decisions about the Maxs design and budget, as well as to rush production to beat competition from Airbus, happened on McNerneys watch. The first Max test flight came seven months after Muilenburg became chief executive in 2015. By then, Hamilton says, the die was already cast.  Yup. Boeing stumbled with the 787, but still kept moving forward, though off balance. Then, with the 737, it fell. NOTES  MCAS was self-certified by Boeing, and filed the tech doc with the FAA late. Perhaps thats what the criminal investigation is looking into.  So, Im not the only one.  Manufacturing Daimler CEO Boeing safety debate highlights challenge for autonomous tech Reuters44. What is very important is the psychological dimension. If you look at what is happening with Boeing then you can imagine what happens when such a system has an incident, Zetsche said, commenting on the motor industrys efforts to develop autonomous cars. Half of U.S. adults think self-driving vehicles are more dangerous than those driven by people, while two-thirds would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle, a ReutersIpsos poll found this week. In the same poll, about 63 percent of respondents said they would not pay more to have a self-driving feature on their vehicle, and 41 percent of the rest said they would not pay more than 2,000.

Microsoft has a DRM-locked ebook store that isnt making enough money, so theyre shutting it down and taking away every book that every one of its customers acquired effective July 1. Customers will receive refunds. This puts the difference between DRM-locked media and unencumbered media into sharp contrast. I have bought a lot of MP3s over the years, thousands of them, and many of the retailers I purchased from are long gone, but I still have the MP3s. Likewise, I have bought many books from long-defunct booksellers and even defunct publishers, but I still own those books. When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didnt get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund.  Well, thats why we need DRM, right? Tech Toyota to allow free access to 24,000 hybrid and electric vehicle tech patents to boost market Japan Times46. Toyota said it will offer around 23,740 patents related to electrification technology, with the grant period running from Wednesday to the end of 2030. Toyota also hopes that opening up its technology for motors and batteries, which are key components of electric and fuel-cell vehicles, will increase their supply and help it to cut costs in developing such vehicles. But it remains uncertain whether the use of Toyota patents will be as widespread as the carmaker hopes, observers said. Toyota said in January 2015 it will offer patents related to its fuel-cell vehicles but it has only led to a dozen contracts. Tech The ugliness of photorealism Wireframe47. The issue of photorealism in games is a matter of personal taste, a question of aesthetics. Id argue that what people are responding to is the technical mastery. That weve been conditioned to believe more polygons, more particles, newer more advanced shaders are what is crucial and amazing. Beauty can rise up out of ugliness. It is possible. But I cant help but find the reflexive need to fall over these massive commercial ventures and characterise them as beautiful extremely distasteful. We should know better. Most, if not entirely all, game developers who work at triple-A studios dont enjoy many protections from abusive crunch practices massive layoffs as weve just seen at Activision Blizzard to make earnings calls sound better, or the ability to petition for the kinds of bonuses or residuals they deserve from shipping a title that sells. We know that labour conditions in this industry suck because we know how quickly people burn out and leave. Transport Filling the Friendly Skies With Hot Air Bloomberg48. In 2016, Lockheed Martin Corp. won a nearly 500 million order for as many as a dozen of its hybrid-electric LMH-1 airships operational in 2020 or 2021 from a buyer who plans to lease their 20-tons of freight capacity to Arctic oil and gas companies. Leasing an airship is cheaper than building new roads across permafrost melting due to climate change, and roughly seven times cheaper per ton than using heavy-lift helicopters. As China and the rest of the world extend their search for raw materials into ever-more remote regions, airships are likely to become crucial links in logistics chains.

The deck Part one of a three-part series on how philosophy contends with our possible annihilation. Not sure about this one, but I am pleased that the culture hasnt completely rotted. Here are the first paragraphsIn Butlers 2017 video installation, On Exactitude in Science, is one of the most remarkable things Ive seen in the last few months. The work consists of two screens. On the left plays Godfrey Reggios Koyaanisqatsi Life Out Of Balance, the 1982 stoner classic of slow motion and time lapse footage of cities and landscapes complete with pulsing, shimmering Philip Glass soundtrack. On the right Butlers shot-by-shot remake, in which he has  somehow, marvelously, painstakingly  reproduced the film in its entirety by modding Grand Theft Auto V. On paper, reproducing Koyannisqatsi in GTA form sounds like it would be an impressive technical feat  surely nothing more. But when you actually sit down and watch the thing, it turns out to be utterly spellbinding. For long stretches, it can be hard to remember which screen is which Butlers land- and city-spaces are so unerringly accurate that I found myself checking left and right to keep my bearings, miming writing with my dominant hand to confirm. But then every now and then  and as the film develops, increasingly often  a human face will enter, and the difference becomes bluntly, laughably obvious. On the left, commuters walk briskly. People  builders, waitresses, fighter pilots  stand by machines, looking into the camera intently, often slightly uncomfortably. On the right, their doubles simply mill about, almost at random their faces, at any rate generic, have nothing in them.Impressive.

Thank you!  This entry was posted in Water Cooler62 on April 3, 201963 by Lambert Strether64.About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clintons wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize!

southbend,Sunburn   The morning read of what's hot in Florida politics   7.23.19,2019-07-23T00:00:00Z,Florida Politics,WSBT,"Margaret Good challenging Vern Buchanan is bittersweet for her Tallahassee colleagues. Theres no way you can replace a Margaret Good or an Adam Hattersley in the Florida House, said House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee. Still, he believes the Democratic caucus boasts 47 members talented enough to champion the cause. If these two go, the caucus will lose a pair of strong freshman, one a Deputy Democratic Leader. But in a chamber filled with political optimism, change remains constant, said Rep. Evan Jenne. When you lose good House members, you miss them at meetings, on the floor and just walking around the building. But it happens every cycle on both sides, he said. Jenne, set to share Democratic leadership with Bobby DuBose after the 2020 election, acknowledges significant political consequences as well. Good and Hattersley flipped red sets blue in 2018. What happens now? Jenne wont discuss Hattersleys seat the Riverview Democrat has yet to declare. But Good is one of four House Democrats representing districts won by Donald Trump in 2016. November, she won by the smallest margin of any victorious House Democrat. Thats not an easy district for Democrats to win, but we have shown with great candidates we can play in any part of the state, he said. The Florida House Victory Fund already has eyes on recruits, Jenne promised. McGhee said its ultimately up to the people. And the people voted Democratic as recently as November, so hes confident. Latino voters will make up an increasing share of the electorate in 2020, and that doesnt bode well for Trump, according to a new poll from Priorities USA, a Democratic Party super PAC. The committee found 25 percent of Florida Latino voters are firmly behind the president, and another 11 percent were leaning his way. Meanwhile, 57 percent are either planning to vote for a Democrat or seriously considering it. About the only bright spot for the President is his standing with CubanAmerican voters, 41 percent of whom plan to vote for him in 2020 compared to 24 percent who plan to vote for the Democratic nominee. That metric is the only one in the poll, which also measured Arizona and Nevada, to show Trump above water. That margin is dwarfed by the number of Puerto Ricans and voters of South American descent living in Florida who are ready for a change the certain to vote blocs and are nearly 2-to-1 against him. And more than 20 percent in each of those demos have one foot in the D column. Priorities USA attributes POTUS weak showing to Trumps immigration policies, which they say are deeply unpopular with the Latino communities in these states, and can be seen as emblematic of his larger racist and divisive message that, not surprisingly, is toxic with Latino voters. Still, the PAC says it needs to up its outreach efforts to capitalize on the trend. Among the softer Democratic supporters that means addressing their priorities rather than relying solely on anti-Trump sentiment. In Florida, a quarter of respondents said health care was their top issue, followed by 23 percent who said immigration and 16 percent who picked gun violence. Chances of a tropical system double to 60 as a disturbance creeps toward Florida3 via Joe Mario Pederson of the Orlando Sentinel In a matter of six hours, odds rose to 60 percent that the disturbance over the Bahamas would become a tropical system by Wednesday as it moves toward Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. If the disturbance develops into a tropical storm, it would be the third named storm of 2019, with the name Chantal. The disturbance was detected Sunday afternoon and had a 20 percent chance of tropical development within 48 hours. By 8 a.m. Monday those chances crept up to 30 percent but have since ballooned. The disturbance is expected to follow a possible curve up the east Florida Peninsula and toward the Georgia coast, the NHC said. A tropical disturbance is making way to Florida, which if it strengthens could turn into TS Chantal.

Joe Gruters and Senate Judiciary Chairman David Simmons plan to file measures that illustrate different approaches to the thorny topic of immigration, the source of some of the Legislatures most heated controversies in recent years. While Gruters proposals would further crack down on illegal immigration, Simmons is seeking to add protections for undocumented residents living and working in the Sunshine State.

Such a policy change would have an impact on roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants living in the state.

STATEWIDE Pension suspension lawsuit in Florida could become a dogfight12 via James Call of the Tallahassee Democrat A dispute over who gets to supervise the Department of Corrections canine unit almost cost Samuel Culpepper his state pension, according to his lawyers. Culpepper retired in May as the DOCs Director of Intelligence. Earlier this month, the State Board of Administration placed a hold on his retirement account. When the SBA froze his pension, he filed a lawsuit. The SBA lifted the hold the next day. Now his lawyers say that the encounter with IG Lester Fernandez was part of a ploy to regain control of DOCs 31 dogs that the department deploys to detect and recover contraband at state prisons. The canines were taken from the IG three years ago when the Intelligence unit was created. A pension fight over Samuel Culpepper, the former Director of Intelligence for the Department of Corrections, could be just a ploy to take control of the DoC canine unit.

What Jeff Brandes is reading Are Uber and Lyft the future of transit? Not so fast18 via Aaron Short of StreetsBlog USA Cities that turn to technology companies to save their transit systems are bound to be disappointed. Pinellas Countys transit authority was the first in the country to supplement its bus service with taxpayer-subsidized rides from Uber in February 2016. A new report from the Shared Mobility Center shows that West Floridians were too optimistic about the effects that such taxi companies would have on transit. In the first phase of the authoritys Direct Connect program, only two Uber rides were ordered per day. The second phase extended the service, allowing passengers to get rides to or from one of eight designated locations across the county, but trips rose to only 40 per day by October 2017. Pinellas Countys transit agreement with ride-sharing companies may not be as lucrative as first imagined. Best state for retirement?

MATTERS Federal budget would raise spending by 320 billion20 via Emily Cochrane, Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley of The New York Times White House and congressional negotiators reached accord on a two-year budget that would raise spending caps and lift the governments debt ceiling, likely averting a fiscal crisis but splashing still more red ink on an already surging deficit. If passed by Congress and signed by Trump, the deal would stop a potential debt default this fall and avoid automatic spending cuts next year. The agreement would also bring clarity about government spending over the rest of Mr. Trumps term. But it is another sign that a Capitol once consumed by fiscal worries simply no longer cares even as the governments red ink approaches 1 trillion a year. Meet the woman who ties Jeffrey Epstein to Donald Trump and the Clintons21 via Ben Schreckinger and Daniel Lippmann of POLITICO People who know those involved said Epsteins connections to two U.S. presidents ran through one bubbly British heiress Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, who has denied accusations made in civil suits of aiding and participating in Epsteins sexual abuse of minors, has been among the financiers closest associates. Unlike Epstein, she comes from a rarefied background that gave her entre to the rich and powerful. For years, beginning in the early 90s, Maxwell and Epstein cut glittering figures on the Manhattan and Palm Beach social circuits, with Maxwell taking the lead. Her family knew Trump before Epstein arrived on the scene, and she continued to socialize with Chelsea Clinton after Epstein was jailed on sex offenses.

But the presidents digital strategy goes far beyond typing whatever is on his mind, 280 characters at a time. That information is used to solicit donations, but its also used to put ads in front of both supporters and enemies alike, aiming to motivate or discourage specific behaviors. According to online spending data tracked by Bully Pulpit Interactive, Trump is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on immigration-related ads online some targeting his base with one message, while others target Latino voters with a completely different message.

Secret donors and Trump allies Inside the operation to push noncitizen voting laws in Florida and other states31 via By Amy Gardner and Alice Crites of The Washington Post A network of out-of-state political consultants, secret donors and activists with close ties to Trump is behind an effort to change the Florida constitution to explicitly state that only citizens may vote in elections, a measure that would amplify the issue of immigration in the 2020 battleground state. In recent months, organizers said they have collected nearly twice the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot next year The exact legal effect the amendment would have remains unclear.

Everybody elses country, Mr. Kirk. Make that everybody elses but the one whose borders are being ignored, called America. A quick scan of Google images from Democrat debates shows no flag.

The ad begins with a photo of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC and then it begins to burn to show the atrocities caused by socialism. The left was mad about the burning picture but not about the photos of the results of socialism. The video is below and is called New Faces GOP and was produced by a GOP Super PAC.56 Does New Drone Footage Reveal Underground Lair on Jeffrey Epsteins Pedo Island?57 Ever since Jeffrey Epstein made national headlines for pedophilia in 2008, the disgraced financiers lifestyle has been under a microscope. Following his June 6 arrest on federal charges of sex trafficking minors, however, particular attention has been paid to his Caribbean island, Little St. James  also known as pedo island, where Epstein allegedly kept a harem of underage sex slaves to serve at the pleasure of he and his rich and famous visitors. While Epstein sat in jail pending trial  before his alleged suicide  a YouTube channel under the name Rusty Shackleford began uploading high-resolution drone footage of just about every visible nook and cranny of Little St. James. From the main property where a previously seen computer mysteriously disappeared days later, to the strange cube-shaped temple, to Epsteins giant sun-dial, to an ambulance  the island, which is still being maintained by an active staff of locals, has no shortage of oddities.58 Dopey Former Bartender Says Miami Will Not Exist In Few Years if We Dont Obliterate Economy With Her Green New Deal59 Earlier this year Democrat leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed an impossible 93 trillion Green New Deal to obliterate and ruin the US economy in the name of global warming junk science. The liberal media has been propping up this lunacy since AOC introduced it months ago. And they wonder why no one trusts them anymore? But AOC was not through. This idiot told an audience this week that Miami will not exist in a few years if we dont obliterate the US economy.60 Ex-NFL Player Arrested for Jussie Smollett-Style Hate Crime Hoax61 A former NFL player has been accused of faking a hate crime in an effort to profit from an insurance payout, but his stupidity in failing to cover his tracks has won him comparisons to Jussie Smollett, the Empire actor who infamously fabricated a hate crime in which he was allegedly attacked by two white men in MAGA hats. This time around, Edawn Coughman, who played in both the NFL and Canadian football leagues, was arrested and charged earlier this week with insurance fraud and filing a phony police report.62 HBO and Apple Lead Hollywoods Climate Change Propaganda Campaign63 Hollywood is ramping up its efforts to feature the environment and climate change storylines in its TV movie productions, with a host of recent and upcoming titles being released this year addressing global warming, pollution, and other issues, according to a new report. Among the most prominent titles are HBOs Years and Years, starring Emma Thompson, and Apples upcoming Losing Earth, based on the New York Times Magazine article about climate change. Variety reported that Hollywood is wrestling with the way it portrays climate change as the industry takes a more activist role.

Reports show former NBC chairman Bob Wright has briefed Trump officials on a proposal to create an agency called Health Advanced Research Projects Agency, or HARPA, to design inventive ways to use data for preventing violent incidents. Wright is one of Trumps long-time friends. Ivanka Trump asked people pushing for the new agency if it could prevent mass shootings, one person familiar with the conversations who spoke on anonymity because off the sensitive details told The Washington Post on Sept. 9.

At the time, Apple said in a statement that it had never  and wound never  do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product.

Unfortunately, locals in the small town of Rachel, Nevada were not very happy about the idea of thousands of curiosity seekers descending on their neighborhood. After the festival was announced, a warning was posted on the towns website in response to the news, stating that local residents would defend their property by force if they had to, saying that the situation could get ugly.76 Red Flag Gun Laws Are Rooted in Communist Methods of Oppression77 This week government officials came back from their summer recess, and I have heard from a couple different sources that the US Senate in particular is seeking to fast track legislation on Red Flag gun laws as well as a possible ban on private party transfers of firearms and a possible ban on high capacity magazines. I can only hope that these are just rumors, but I suspect they are accurate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has publicly vowed to pursue any new gun control legislation that the Trump Administration supports, and Donald Trump has openly called for Red Flag gun laws involving mental health guidelines. The mainstream media now claims that a majority of Americans on both sides of the political divide support red flag legislation, but we all know how rigged such polls can be. The real question is, does the average American even know what red flag laws would entail? I think they do not.78 Sam Brownback Says Christian Persecution is at All-Time High79 Americas ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, said this week that hostility toward Christians in the world has reached an all-time high.

To make matters worse, she has some serious mental health issues. She is autistic, has obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suffers from Asperger syndrome. She is currently in the United States on a sort of climate change tour, and to speak at the United Nations. She is also participating in protests. During a demonstration at the White House on Friday, Thunberg said the U.S. has a moral responsibility to act on climate change. Funny, her handlers dont seem interested in bringing this message to China or India.

Actually, corporations have become nothing but a modern, more efficient form of slavery. Though, as the result of some legal chicanery, for some purposes they are considered people, corporations have no soul. Moreover, they have no ethics, principles or morals. Despite claims on the contrary they usually make in their institutional advertising, the only purpose of a corporation is to maximize the profits of its shareholders  at any cost. A film based on Joel Bakans book The Corporation The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, shows that most corporations exhibit many of the traits of psychopathic behavior, such as Callous unconcern for the feelings of others Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships Reckless disregard for the safety of others Deceitfulness repeated lying and conning of others for profit Incapacity to experience guilt Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior.Corporations have created a particular sort of mirage. You look around and are tricked to believe that you see hospitals, colleges, department stores, hardware stores, drug factories, airlines, etc., but that is part of the illusion. Ultimately, corporations do not care about the products they make  be it cars, drugs, electronic gadgets, food, books, gas, or airplanes , much less about their workers or the customers who buy their products. Their only goal is to persuade you to buy their products, disregarding whether or not their products are safe, negatively affect your health or create an addiction. To reach their goals they resort to any type of mind manipulation through advertising that includes falsehood, fabrications, deception, and outright lies, in order to maximize their profits. Proof that corporations do not care less about their customers is the fact that, to maximize profits, they have outsourced most of the manufacture of their products. But, having solved a short-term problem, they have created a long-term one they have destroyed the way of living of their own consumers. The direct result of moving production overseas to Mexico, China, and other countries to profit from quasi-slave labor, is that they have deprived most of their working-class customers of their source of income. Currently, 9 out of every 10 products sold by the Walmart corporation are made in China, and 9 out of every 10 Walmart customers is a worker who lost his well-paid job because, to maximize its profits, Walmart does not buy American-made products. But that is not the only problem corporations pose. Once they become economically powerful they aim for political power as well. Their ultimate goal is to take control of the state, a political system Benito Mussolini called lo stato corporativo  the corporate state another name for Fascism. Like most things wrong on this planet, the modern corporation is a Rockefeller baby  initially they called it a trust. No wonder critics called the Rockefellers one of the families that have done more damage to the people of the world.

So, if there is no evidence to prove that America has the most mass shootings in the world, why would the media and Democrats accept the flawed study without looking into it a little deeper? Could a push for gun control, regardless of the truth be the answer? But the claim is based on just one study, and the author of that study, Adam Lankford, would not release his data to either John Stossel or researchers in the field. Economist John Lott says that Lankfords study has many flaws. Watch, as top economist Jon Lott appears on John Stossel TV where he reveals the flawed data used by leftist media and politicians like Barack Obama to promote gun control. Lott calls Lankfords study, academic malpractice. The Washington Times reports  John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, crunched the numbers and said his count shows that the U.S. had less than 3 percent of the worlds mass public shootings over a 15-year period. That is smaller than the 4.6 percent of the worlds population that the U.S. accounts for  and way less than the 31 percent of global mass shooters that Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama, claimed in his widely publicized studies.

One family from Sacramento, California, is grieving after their mother became ill and lost virtually all motor functions due to a mercury poisoning that experts say is the first of its kind in the US. Jay, the California womans son, told local Sacramento news outlet KTXL that his mother quickly became sick at the end of June and was taken to the hospital for a week after using a special kind of Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream that she had been importing from Jalisco, Mexico, through a friend for 12 years. Though she had been using the cream without any issues for over a decade, doctors were eventually able to identify this recent batch was tainted with methylmercury, a form of mercury that is toxic to the central and peripheral nervous systems92 USC Hosts Anime Writing Course, But Apparently Lacks Funds for State-Required Constitution Course93 The University of South Carolina offers a course in which students can learn about anime writing while it refuses to comply with a state law mandating a Constitution course.

The Austria Press Agency reported that more than 98 of delegates at a party congress in Graz backed Hofer, who ran unopposed. Hofer was designated for the job after Heinz-Christian Strache, the partys leader of the past 14 years, resigned in May following the publication of a video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.96 France Police Face Protesters in Nantes as Yellow Vest Marches Resume97 NANTES, France Reuters  Hundreds of demonstrators faced police in a tense stand-off in the French city of Nantes on Saturday as revived yellow vest protests against the government of President Emmanuel Macron took place across the country.

Senior government partner the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement M5S gets 21 undersecretaries while junior partner the centre-left Democratic Party PD gets 18, government sources said. The other government components, the tiny leftwing Free and Equal LeU party and the Italians abroad group MAIE get two and one respectively. The M5S will also have an advantage in terms of deputy ministers with six compared to the PDs four. Only 14 of the 42 are women. Government sources voiced satisfaction that an agreement had been found on the undersecretaries. Both the M5S and the PD said they were satisfied with the number of officials they had obtained. Now were ready to give our utmost, said M5S leader and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. The government team is complete, ready to give its all for the country!, he said. On Monday the new team will be sworn in which will be composed of 21 exponents of the 5-Star Movement, and six of these will be deputy ministers. For us that means a lot of work to do and greater responsibility. We are ready! Premier Giuseppe Conte said the acceleration on the government team is important because the country is awaiting responses. This team is sufficiently young and amalgamated, said the premier who confirmed the new team will be sworn on Monday. Its a great team, built to last, said Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora. But anti-migrant Euroskeptic League party leader Matteo Salvini said weve seen a disgraceful divvying up of seats by the M5S and the PD. Also on Friday, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said Italy is a protagonist in Europe again thanks to the new government. Italy has just formed an unprecedented alliance between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement M5S and the centre-left and pro-EU Democratic Party PD, of which Gualtieri was an MEP for several years before being named economy minister in the new M5S-PD executive. With this government, Gualtieri said, Italy returns to being a protagonist in Europe, resumes the role that it is entitled to as a founder member of the EU which has ideas, imposes its vision of the EU as a path to improve, change, and make it more capable of facing the challenges of our world. The new government has said, among other things, that it will try to change the Stability and Growth Pact, as President Sergio Mattarella also hoped in helping set up the M5S-PD coalition. Today we will present the government programme as illustrated in parliament by Premier Giuseppe Conte, Gualtieri went on. The programme includes averting a 23-billion-euro VAT hike, cutting the tax wedge for low-to-medium earners, free nurseries for low-to-medium income families, and trying to get investments in the green economy excluded from EU fiscal parameters. Gualtieri said Friday, however, that the 2020 budget and excluding green investments had different timescales, with the first obviously taking precedence over the second. The reform of monetary union is on a separate plane from the 2020 budget bill, he said. Gualtieri stressed, however, that the time of clashes with Europe, like those under former interior minister and Euroskeptic League party leader Matteo Salvini, was over. Salvini, who pulled the plug on an M5S-League government August 8 hoping for a snap election to capitalise on high poll numbers and never thinking the M5S would get together with traditional foe the PD, had frequent run-ins over EU fiscal constraints. In an interview with La Repubblica daily, Gualtieri said there will never be wars with Europe again. He also said the flat tax pledged by the League would be shelved, the quota 100 pension reform would run its course in three years, and a basic income would be improved. Gualtieri also vowed that the VAT hike would not happen, with an unprecedented crackdown on tax evasion helping to get the 23 billion euros needed to fund its exclusion. The minister also announced that Italy will join the pro-climate coalition. In Helsinki, he announced that Rome was joining the coalition of financial ministers for the fight against climate change. This is a change, since Italy had thus far chosen not to take part in the initiative, which is made up of 40 countries. The aim of the coalition is to boost green investments. Eurogroup President Mario Centeno said that Gualtieri had reiterated Italys pro-euro commitment at an informal Eurogroup meeting. Gualtieri, he said, had outlined the priorities for the near future and the commitment on policies that help preserve the stability of the euro. He said Roberto is not new to the group, seeing as how he frequented it already before, in his capacity as chair of the economy committee. Today was not the day to discuss his presentation in detail. The Italian dossier will return to the fore in the context of the stability bills, together with those of all the other countries, said the Portuguese finance minister.100 Sweden Gang Rape in Lule, Police Currently Looking for Two Dark-Skinned Men101 In the earlier hours on Thursday morning, police in Lule received a call from a woman who claimed to have been raped by two men.

Treating them earnestly alienates even the tolerant, and has no place in the classroom. The unceasing gender proliferation tipped over from a hoary dad joke into a bona fide social problem when a recent taxpayer-paid BBC Teach video featured educator Kate Daniels telling pre-teen children this We know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now. The now is particularly endearing  recognizable from my own schoolmasters having to upend years of teaching a curriculum due to superior recent knowledge We used to think that peptic ulcers were caused by diet but NOW we know it is a bacteria. Yet what are these stunning gender discoveries that have led us to find scores of new genders whose very existence we didnt even fathom at the turn of the millennium? Quantitative experiments must have been conducted or psychological questionnaires taken. At worst, some professor of sociology or gender studies must have written a paper categorizing them. But no. Most of these new genders have literally come from microblogging site Tumblr. They are random users inventions, many are whimsies or equivalents of doodling a cool picture of an imaginary animal or a pirate and making it your avatar. Due to literal-minded inclusiveness taken to its logical conclusion, each one has now been catalogued, and is now being taught as objective fact, all in the space of less than five years.

Thousands of fetal remains were found at the home of a former South Bend abortion doctor, WSBT reports. The remains were discovered while family members were searching through the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on Sept. 3. His home is in Will County, Illinois. WSBT reports Kloper used to practice at the Womens Pavilion in South Bend. His medical license was suspended in 2015 after he was accused of failing to report an abortion on a 13-year-old girl.

Other than that, its a great place to live.52 A New Chicago Muslim Colleges Islamist Ties53 The Prayer Center of Orland Park OPPC, Illinois, recently declared the establishment of an Islamic university at its premises, the Universal Islamic College of Chicago UICC that will provide higher Islamic education to the American Muslim community as well as serve as a seminary that would prepare imams for mosques in North America. The foundation of this four-year university is a joint effort between the OPPC and the Universal School in Bridgeview, Illinois. The identities of the founders and faculty of the university are deeply concerning and suggest the seminary will be promoting an Islamist ideology to Muslim students in Illinois and throughout the United States. In the video announcing the colleges founding, Universal School is represented by its Superintendent Safaa Zarzour. Zarzour has extensive ties to Islamist groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, including serving as a board member and president of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations CAIR, and currently vice-president and formerly Secretary General of the Islamic Society of North America ISNA. Zarzour also served as operations officer for the Zakat Foundation.54 A Third of Democrats Favor Declaring NRA Terrorist Orgnization 28 Say it Should be Illegal to Join55 A new Rasmussen poll reveals that almost one-third 32 of likely Democratic voters favor declaring the National Rifle Association a terrorist organization, after officials in San Francisco did just that. Meanwhile, 28 of Democrats say Americans should be banned from joining pro-gun rights organizations like the NRA  a view surprisingly shared by 15 of Republicans and 10 of unaffiliated voters. Just 13 of likely voters believe NRA members are more likely to commit a crime with a gun  and in fact 47 believe that members are less likely to commit such a crime. 28 think NRA membership makes no difference vs. the general population. The poll also revealed that 50 of voters have a favorable impression of the NRA, while 44 do not. Of that, 30 have a Very Favorable view of the group, while 33 have a Very Unfavorable one  virtually the same opinion as those polled held in March of last year. As we noted on Tuesday, the NRA has sued the city and county of San Francisco after its Board of Supervisors declared it a domestic terrorist organization. Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the suit accuses city officials of violating the groups free speech rights for political purposes, and claims the city is attempting to create a blacklist to prevent NRA-associated individuals from doing business there, according to Fox News. The lawsuit asks the court to instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.56 Bernie Sanders Was Asked to Leave Hippie Commune for Shirking, Book Claims57 Bernie Sanders was asked to leave a hippie commune in 1971 for sitting around and talking about politics instead of working, according to a forthcoming book. We Are As Gods by Kate Daloz, scheduled for release April 26, chronicles the rise and fall of the Myrtle Hill Farm in northeast Vermont. Daloz, a Brooklyn writer, was in a special position to write a history of Myrtle Hill she was raised near the commune in a geodesic dome residence with an outhouse called the Richard M. Nixon Memorial Hall. Her parents were close acquaintances of the commune residents, who offered them tips about wilderness living.58 Democrat Senators Fear Beto ORourke Torpedoed Gun Control With Confiscation Push59 ORourke made clear that handing over AR-15s will be mandatory under his plan.60 Forbes Blames Climate Change for Cognitive Decline And Suicide61 Forbes magazine has attributed a whole new list of negative effects to climate change, including lost productivity, violent crime, and cognitive decline. Climate change has become the bogeyman responsible for all the worlds ills, from racism to mass migration, but in its new article, Forbes has arguably taken climate hysteria to a whole new level.62 Gangs of Black Youth Preying on Elderly White People63 Three separate videos show a gang of Minneapolis blacks acting like hyenas attacking and robbing vulnerable white people in a string of possible hate crimes. Police conducted a three-day search and arrested 16 individuals ranging from ages 13-25. In the first video, an elderly white man is seen trying to walk past a crowded area full of young black people when hes stopped and shoved by multiple suspects. One of the suspects appears to reach into the mans pocket and take something before running off with his loot. In the second video, another white man is standing on the sidewalk surrounded by a large group of young black men who begin to take his cell phone out of his hands.64 Greenpeace Members Face Federal, State Charges in Houston Protest65 HOUSTON Reuters  Federal and state authorities on Friday criminally charged climate change protesters for shutting down the largest U.S. energy-export port for a day by dangling from a bridge.66 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Comey and McCabe Will Face Criminal Charges for Attempted Coup Video67 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was on Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo today and he made some bold statements about James Comey and Andrew McCabe.

Biden has apparently told this story before and now hes spinning the yarn again. He claims that years ago when he was a lifeguard at a pool in a black neighborhood in Delaware, he had a confrontation with a gang leader named Corn Pop.70 Make No Mistake The GOP is Losing Texas71 To date, five congressmen from Texas have resigned instead of seeking re-election in 2020. Their resignations signal two things from GOP leadership. The first is the realization that Texas is now lost. The second is that this loss is due entirely to the changing demographics resulting from legal and illegal immigration. The five congressmen that have resigned are Bill Flores 17th, Will Hurd 23rd, Pete Olson 22nd, Kenny Marchant 24th, and Mike Conaway 11th. Of these five, Congressman Conaway is unique in that his district will likely remain red for some time. He has not faced an opponent in numerous election cycles As noted, the reason for this is simple demographics. For decades, the Republicans have told their voters that they were going to clamp down on illegal immigration and address the legal immigration policies that have facilitated this takeover. They have made excuse after excuse for not fulfilling those promises and now that lack of action is turning Texas blue one district at a time.72 New York Times Publishes New Uncorroborated Allegation Against Brett Kavanaugh by Former Classmate73 If you think the left is done whining about Brett Kavanaugh, guess again. On Saturday evening, the New York Times published a rehash of the previous bogus allegations against now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, particularly the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, and threw in a brand new one for good measure. Ramirez had claimed Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale. Despite the potentially dozens of witnesses that would have seen this occur, Ramirezs story went uncorroborated throughout the entire confirmation process. If I had done that, it would have been the talk of campus, Kavanaugh said in an interview with Fox News Martha MacCallum.74 No Matter Who Wins in 2020, There Will be Blood75 The machinations of an illiberal left, on display in its ever-increasing violence accompanied by the ululations of a propagandist media in contravention of an imaginary white supremacist right, have riven the nation into diametrically opposed camps. The right will never accept socialism, while the left will accept nothing less. Trump Wins Those on the left will not allow a Trump victory, even should he win the popular vote and the Electoral College. They are used to getting what they want and like spoiled brats, have learned that tantrums work. Should Donald Trump prevail in his bid for a second term, the left will go insane, deploying every insurance policy weapon at their disposal to negate four more years of the Orange Man. What Obama, Comey, and Brennan et al. did to Trump in his first term will seem mild in comparison to what the left is planning should he win.76 NYC Public Schools Excusing Students Who Plan on Participating in Upcoming Climate Strike77 New Yorks public schools announced Thursday afternoon that they will excuse students who plan on attending various climate strikes throughout the city.

Richardsons father, Scott Richardson, also addressed the court and asked for his daughter to be released. My daughter is suffering from an eating disorder and we are concerned about her health, he said.80 Video Dems Swearing They Dont Want to Take Your Guns Away, Then Beto Promising to Take Them to Dem Cheers81 Its the cheering of the audience that shows its not just crazy Beto, but the Dems as a block who are endorsing this.82 Alarmists Ireland Heading for Climate Change Apocalypse By 205083 Ireland is heading for a climate change apocalypse come 2050 if we dont implement massive changes, claimed Emma McMenamy on Saturday in the Irish Mirror.

Prime Minister Johnson said last week hed rather be dead in a ditch than comply with a vote in Parliament forcing him to ask the EU to postpone Brexit beyond Oct. 31. But officials at the EU  which is broadly in favor of an extension if its the only way to prevent a no-deal Brexit  privately voiced fears that one of their own leaders could help Johnson out. If a no-deal divorce is to be avoided, all remaining 27 member states would need to agree with Britain to extend the Brexit negotiating period at an October summit in Brussels.88 Germany Thousands of Climate Protesters Target Frankfurt Auto Show89 Tens of thousands of climate demonstrators turned up to protest at Germanys biggest car show in Frankfurt on Saturday, using the event as a platform to demand the car industry address its role in damaging the environment.

Industry sources said it could take weeks to return full production levels to normal. Following what Yemens Houthis claimed was their own successful targeting of Saudi Arabias second largest oil field in the Khurais, as well as the sprawling Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq  described by Aramco as the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world  the Saudi company acknowledged it was forced to slash its output by half, equal to about 5 of world supply, specifically 5.7 million barrels a day of oil production lost. In the meantime, Saudi Arabias stock market fell by 2.3 at Sundays open. Though the company says alternative plans are in place to temporarily make up for the shortfall, such as tapping Aramcos global storage network, the 5.7 million barrels a day outage is the single worst supply disruption even over and against that brought on by the first Gulf War and the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.108 Oil Prices Soar After Attacks on Saudi Facilities109 Oil prices hit their highest in four months after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on Saturday knocked out more than 5 of global supply.

This is going to be mainstreamed, tweeted Alex Mazzara. The photo shows a presentation slide entitled Pedophilia as a Sexual Orientation. Conservatives have been warning for years that the ultimate endgame of every fetish, gender identity and sexuality being not merely tolerated but endorsed would eventually be the mainstreaming of pedophilia.132 Remains of Over 2,000 Fetuses Found in Home of Deceased Illinois Abortion Doctor133 This is a grotesque and heartbreaking story. Dr. Ulrich Klopfer recently passed away and his family found the remains of over 2,000 aborted babies in his home. Its the stuff of nightmares. FOX 59 reports Thousands of fetal remains found at home of former South Bend abortion doctor Thousands of fetal remains were found at the home of a former South Bend abortion doctor, WSBT reports. The remains were discovered while family members were searching through the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on Sept. 3. His home is in Will County, Illinois. WSBT reports Kloper used to practice at the Womens Pavilion in South Bend. His medical license was suspended in 2015 after he was accused of failing to report an abortion on a 13-year-old girl. The Washington Examiner has more134 The Left Hopes to Destroy Christianity by Changing It135 The Lefts assault of the Christian faith is three-pronged. First, leftists seek to redefine what it means to be a Christian. Next, they seek to silence Christian voices in the arena of public discussion. Third, they want to elevate the ideas of non-Christians to change traditional thinking. Hard to believe, but lets look. The Left wants to change the way culture sees Christianity. We see it on several fronts. The Left wants to divide the church about what is right and wrong. The United Methodists are ready to split on the issue of same-sex marriage. Theres a push among a small but loud faction of liberal voices that declare themselves exvangelicals, who resist the churchs stance of LGBT issues and abortion but want to retain and redefine what it means to be a Christian in 2019. In redefining Christianity, they want to shift the emphasis from a changed life to doing what they define as societal good.136 Thousands of Unborn Babies Found in Illinois Home of Abortionist Whose License Was Suspended for Performing Abortion on 13-Yr-Old137 Dr. Kermit Gosnell has been called Americas most prolific serial killer. He regularly killed babies born alive at his clinic, which itself was staffed with inexperienced nurses and littered with blood-stained furniture and the remains of fetuses stored in basement freezers. Gosnell was later convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and hundreds of lesser charges, and in 2013 was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In October 2018, filmmakers Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer released Gosnell The Trial of Americas Biggest Serial Killer. The film is the shocking true story of the investigation and trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell  his 30-year killing spree and the political and media establishment that tried to cover it up. Now, another gruesome finding tied to a recently deceased abortionist has surfaced in his Illinois home. The abortionist took the lives of unborn babies in two locations in Indiana. One of the practices was in South Bend, Indiana, where Notre Dame Catholic University is located. Breitbart News reports  Thousands of unborn children were found in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, an abortionist who passed away earlier this month. In 2015, the abortionists medical license was suspended after he allegedly failed to report an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl. The remains of 2,246 unborn children have been found inside the Will County, Illinois home of a now-deceased abortionist, Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on September 3, according to a report by WGN-TV. As the watchdog group Operation Rescue has extensively documented, Klopfer had a history of abuses, including failing to report statutory rape of a 13-year-old and a 10-year-old. He sent the latter home with her parents, who knew their daughter was raped by her uncle but didnt want him prosecuted, without reporting it to the police.138 UK Labours Lammy Hails Song Lyrics Describing White Shame, Evil Ancestry139 Labours David Lammy MP has shared song lyrics describing the shame of being a white male, and the evil of their ancestry. Deep lyrics just dropped by Sam Fender, tweeted the former Minister of State for Culture, quoting the following excerpt from the BBC-endorsed singer-songwriters White Privilege track The patriarchy is real, the proof is here in my song. Ill sit and mansplain every detail of the things it does wrong Cause Im a white male, full of shame My ancestry is evil, and their evil is still not gone140 Why Gen-Zers and Millennials Support Socialism141 Public-opinion polls reflect that large numbers of Americans in their 20s and 30s i.e., Gen Z and millennials support socialism. When one considers the indoctrination to which these young Americans have been subjected in their state-run educational systems, their preference for socialism actually makes sense. From the first grade, American students are indoctrinated with the notion that they live in a free country, one that has a free-enterprise economic system. By the time they graduate from high school, students have no doubts that this is true. The notion is refortified in those students who go on to college. By the time Americans start their careers, their mindsets are set in concrete They are grateful that they live in a free country. Many of them continue reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which they learned in school and which they were expected to recite every day, a pledge that confirms that in America there is liberty for all. Now, look around you. Examine the society in which you live. There are crises, chaos, and mayhem everywhere. Social Security. Health care. Immigration. Federal spending and debt. Monetary. Afghanistan. Iraq. Syria. Korea. Russia. China. Drug war. Forever wars. Secret surveillance. Assassinations. Death. Destruction. Bombings. Terrorism. Mass killings. Tribunals. Torture. Indefinite detention. Militarism. Invasions. Occupations. Coups. Regime-change operations. Trade wars. Sanctions. Embargoes. Police states. Alcoholism. Drug addiction. Homelessness. Poverty. Suicides. Its not a pretty picture, is it? Its a picture of a quite dysfunctional society. In the mind of the Gen Zer and the millennial, that is what comes with freedom and free enterprise. Given such, its perfectly logical to want something else, and that something else happens to be socialism. It even makes sense that so many young people decide to check out of life early through suicide. Theyre thinking, If this is freedom  if this is the best there is  no, thanks. Im leaving and hopefully going on to something better.142 Why Has the Overpopulation Myth Remained So Persistent When its So Easily Disproven?143 Malthus could never have imagined the dizzying capacity for innovation that human beings have shown in modern times, as Art Caden observes at Forbes. There were fewer than a billion people on the planet in 1800. The Earth is now nearing 8 billion people, and that population is far better fed today than they were in 1800. That population growth, the likes of which Malthus would have believed unimaginable, has been met, and even exceeded, by food production  to the extent that our government now subsidizes American farmers, to the tune of billions each year, in order to incentivize them to not grow excess food on their lands. These efforts exist as a measure to keep prices at profitable levels for farmers, in our governments vainglorious efforts to fix prices in a free market. But government price-fixing aside, shouldnt it be easy to conclude that any assertion that an increasing population invariably leads to famine is extremely illogical, or at the very least, quite simply an incorrect hypothesis? The idea that increased population leads to scarcity of resources is seductive, however, and has remained incredibly persistent, despite all the evidence that has proven it false over the years.144  1 370401  2 370459  3 370417  4 370393  5 370455  6 370397  7 370439  8 370407  9 370483  10 370463  11 370461  12 370423  13 370457  14 370419  15 370481  16 370409  17 370399  18 370441  19 370465  20 370479  21 370475  22 370388  23 370389  24 370437  25 370449  26 370433  27 370429  28 370445  29 370471  30 370411  31 370467  32 370469  33 370425  34 370473  35 370453  36 370431  37 370451  38 370477  39 370443  40 370447  41 370435  42 370413  43 370403  44 370421  45 370405  46 370427  47 370395  48 370415  49  50 topheadline  51  52 topheadline  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  85  86 topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  120 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline",homelessness

southbend,Opportunity Zones will help those who help themselves,2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WNDU,"This makes sense to me for three reasons. Opportunity Zones are a decentralized program and funds are easy to set up, even for small developers. A decentralized program points to decentralized geography. Second, the sheer size of the programwith 6 trillion in potential capital gains waiting to be investedmeans that capital cannot pour into a few places and meet the deadline for getting projects started. Third, destinations where land prices are already sky high may not offer the best future returns. I believe the best potential for Opportunity Zones, given current markets, is in mixed-use, walkable places. How many of the zones have plans, infrastructure, and coding in place for significant mixed-use development? Preparation is key. Whats the difference between an Opportunity Zone project idea, and an opportunity zone project? One word Readiness, notes Ian Ross, founder of the websiteOppsites2. Cities with shovel-ready plans for downtowns and neighborhoods, which are also OZs, could see many of their projects move forward more quickly. These cities offer a wide variety of sizes and locations in urban and suburban contexts. Ranson, West Virginia, a small city about an hour and a half from DC, is one example of a place with extensive new urban plans and Opportunity Zones. The market demand for urbanism will continue to grow in the next decade, and such cities could offer an affordable urban lifestyle alternative to central city neighborhoods. The more investment comes in via OZs, the more value will grow in a place like Ranson.Powhatan Place rendering. Source City of RansonThe Powhatan Place former foundry on Mildred Street communitys ultimate goal is to create a more livable and sustainable community in Old Town Ranson and Charles Towna place where residents can live where they work, walk to shop, and have easy access to nature and recreation, according to anOppsites listing3. For another illustration, see Westminster, Colorado, where a new downtown is being built for a suburban city with no existing walkable downtownon 105-acre former shopping mall site see rendering at top of article. Downtown Westminsters plan comprises 2,300 residential units, including substantial affordable housing, and 1.7 million square feet of commercial uses, such as a grocery store, shops, restaurants, a movie theater, and office space. There will be 18 publicly accessible parks and civic spaces. Construction of the first phase is well underway. It is likely that Downtown Westminster would be built without an opportunity zoneyet the OZ status will give the project a lift and reduce the likelihood of it stalling. When all of the phases are built out, the city has plans to make the downtown even larger by extending the street grid to adjacent sites. Notes one city official Having land control allows us to better negotiate getting affordable housing. We highly value equity and inclusivity and think it should be part of our vision. Downtown Westminster is designed as a place that will grow incrementally over time, serving as the center of public life in a community that has evolved from a purely suburban growth paradigm, explains the project designers, Torti Gallas  Partners. All of downtown Detroit and surrounding neighborhoods are Opportunity Zones. Downtown Detroits resurgence this decade is well known, but parts of the city center have received relatively little investment. The creation of a new public space on the west side of the Central Business District is spurring development.Beacon Park was built to anchor an emerging district, spur economic growth within the neighborhood, and provide a high-quality gathering space for Detroit residents.Beacon Park. Source livingLABand TouloukianTouloukianThrough an inclusive community engagement process, an idea for a pop-up park on a large vacant parcel grew over time into a plan, and then construction, of a permanent square with a restaurant, community gathering space, and large circular lawn. Located on Grand River Avenue, one of downtowns five radiating arteries, the park serves as a gateway to downtown from the west, and will make investment into the area through an Opportunity Zone more attractive. The transformation of this space is nothing short of remarkable, says Mayor Michael Duggan. Elkhart, a city of 52,000 in north Indiana, is not a place that is well known nationally for its urban revival. Yet Elkhart adopted a plan for a 400 million, 90-acre River District across from downtown. The district offers a setting for a great deal of urbanist development, including a thousand housing units, 170,000 square feet of retail space, 110,000 square feet of office space, and a hotelall in an Opportunity Zone. A project like this in a small city may seem unlikely, but it is moving forward quickly. Elkhart Common Council last week approved4 a development loan to support a major project in the district, including a supermarket and 134 residential units. Planning is by Speck ...sociates and StantecUrban Places.Town square at the heart of the Elkhart River District.The rules for Opportunity Zones are still not finalized, and the impact of this federal program will not be known for some time. That said, Opportunity Zones aregenerating interest5at a level that indicates this program will live up to its hypewith regard to level of investment. Significant potential for urbanism lies outside of central locations in East and West Coast cities. This potential is likely to get a boost from Opportunity Zones. The biggest support willcome where the public sector has established the ground rules and infrastructure for compact urbanism.  1  2  3  4  5",affordable housing
