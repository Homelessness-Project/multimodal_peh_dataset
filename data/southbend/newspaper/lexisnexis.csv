(AP) - The old mail chute remains at the former Hoffman Hotel, next to the two original elevators, framed in wood - both tiny nods to the past.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Similar reminders show up in other parts of the 85-year-old building, from the decorative railing in the main stairwell to the pockmarked terrazzo floor in the lobby.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">""They've done a really good job of preserving a lot of unique features of the building,"" Chris Fielding, assistant executive director of Community Investment for the city, said of the developers. ""I really like that.""</p><p>By and large, though, the former hotel in the heart of downtown has been completely updated over the past seven months, as Equal Development works to transform the 12-story structure into a modern apartment building for artists.</p><p>Plaster walls have been demolished and replaced with drywall; old, outdated flooring has been ripped up; plumbing, heating and cooling systems have been updated.</p><p>New windows - about 200 in total - are on order, and should arrive sometime late January or early February.</p><p>After that, it will be a race to finish the $5.3 million project before a planned ribbon-cutting early next year.</p><p>The fully renovated building will include 48 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, studio and performance spaces, a gallery, a dark room, a bike room, and a penthouse ""inspiration room"" and lounge area.</p><p>As for the number of tenants, that remains to be seen.</p><p>According to property manager Tami Chin, who also manages Prairie Apartments, another Equal Development property in South Bend, just eight applications for residency have been approved at this point, out of 15 submitted.</p><p>Blame strict residency guidelines and a complicated application process.</p><p>While anyone who qualifies for affordable housing can apply for residency at the hotel, preference is given to artists.</p><p>On top of that, applicants must earn less than 60 percent of the median income for the area, or $24,120 for an individual or $34,380 for a family of four.</p><p>What constitutes an artist?</p><p>""I always tell people art is in the eye of the beholder,"" Chin said, noting nontraditional artists such as culinary, tattoo or floral artists are welcome to apply for residency the same as painters or musicians.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision falls to a selection committee consisting of representatives of ownership and the city, hotel staff and local artists and/or entrepreneurs.</p><p>Despite the rigmarole, Chin said she expects demand for the units to only increase as the project nears completion.</p><p>The building sits in the middle of downtown - close to shops, restaurants, theaters and recreational opportunities - and offers stunning views of downtown and the larger metro area, including the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>And the price is right: rents range from $553 per month for a studio to $699 per month for a two-bedroom - or less depending on income.</p><p>""We probably get 10 to 15 calls per day,"" Chin said. ""So there's a lot of interest.""</p><p>The city, which has invested $175,000 in the project - not including a $390,000 tax break - will be watching closely to see how it fairs.</p><p>The Hoffman is the first of several high-profile residential projects set to open next year, accounting for more than 260 new apartment or condo units and upward of $30 million in private investment downtown.</p><p>In that sense, the project is seen as a bellwether of sorts for the downtown housing market, which, according to a 2013 study, is capable of absorbing as many as 1,500 new housing units over the next 10 years.</p><p>""Certainly it's the first residential building to come on line, and we want it to be successful,"" Fielding said.</p><p>""Do I think it will be full on day one? No,"" Fielding said. ""But I certainly don't think it will take long to fill up.""</p><p>More importantly, he said, the project will provide opportunities for housing for ""a segment of the market that's extremely underrepresented,"" namely ""starving artists.""</p><p>""So this offers diversity of housing in the market that is really needed,"" Fielding said. ""Without diversity of housing you won't have diversity of people.""</p><p>___</p><p>Source: South Bend Tribune, <url normalizedValue=""http://bit.ly/1NHgZkn"">http://bit.ly/1NHgZkn</url></p><p>___</p><p>Information from: South Bend Tribune, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.southbendtribune.com"">http://www.southbendtribune.com</url></p><p>This is an AP Member Exchange shared by the South Bend Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTNE-afb287cb60644a5caa03c6e374dde84e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5HKF-32T1-DYN6-W03F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""704""/><timeReceived>8:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(AP) — The foundations are poured, wall frames and ceiling trusses are on their way, and by the end of the summer, a new “tiny” living concept is expected to make a big difference in Elkhart County.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The Faith Mission of Michiana and the Crossing School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship broke ground last week on a $300,000 effort to provide short-term housing for homeless people in and around Elkhart.</p><p>Inspired by a trend growing nationally, a dozen 12-by-16 tiny shelters will provide one-night or brief-stay housing through Faith Mission’s Low Barrier Shelter program, created in 2019.</p><p>The Low Barrier Shelter program already serves about 50 people seeking emergency shelter through communal housing, Faith Mission Resource/Development Director Mike Perez said.</p><p>However, the tiny shelters will appeal more broadly to people, such as those with pets, PTSD or mental illness, who might find greater comfort in an individual space.</p><p>The 192-square-foot, cabin-like structures will each be outfitted with a toilet, sink, bed and chair, and will be connected via outdoor pathways to a communal bath and laundry house.</p><p>Elkhart city leaders joined Faith Mission and the Crossing, whose students are assisting in construction, for a recent ground breaking of the project.</p><p>“We realize there’s a group of folks that need shelter but don’t want all of the services a shelter provides,” Perez said. “This really will allow police and the city to help get people to somewhere safe no matter what.”</p><p>A team of about 10 students in the Construction Career Pathway program at the Crossing in Goshen have been working in the last three to four weeks during school hours to measure, cut and build wall frames and ceiling trusses for the shelters which will ship in pieces to foundations poured at the Faith Mission.</p><p>Perez said partnering with the Crossing, a faith-based school providing small business and job training to students who may have struggled in traditional education environments, just made sense.</p><p>Students at the Crossing will pick-up real-world construction trades experience while assisting Faith Mission in its goal to expand the availability of short-term housing.</p><p>“It was just one of those things that worked out perfectly,” Perez said. “It benefits them and it benefits us.”</p><p>Six frames have already been delivered to Faith Mission. Community volunteers will help build the structures onsite this spring, Perez said.</p><p>Duffy Sherman, instructor for the Construction Career Pathway, said he has approached each step of the project like a job, training students both in construction trades and soft skills like time management and working as a team. His support dog, Raven, joins the team daily, to provide some levity as the teens work on their next half dozen structures.</p><p>“Some of these kids, in the path they’re on, may end up there,” Sherman said of Faith Mission. “This is a chance to pay it forward.”</p><p>For Caitlyn Ortiz, 16, who started her first year at the Crossing during the pandemic, the project provides the opportunity to stay engaged in hands-on experiences in a small group setting.</p><p>The high school sophomore, who had little construction experience before joining the school, said she’s now considering career possibilities in the trades.</p><p>“It’s a lot more entertaining,” Ortiz said. “I just feel like at this school, there’s a bigger bond between the students and between the teachers.”</p><p>She and other students say they are hopeful the partnership with Faith Mission can draw attention from others who could use the students’ services.</p><p>“The whole purpose of this tiny homes thing is to get more recognition from other people and seeing, hopefully, bigger businesses get invested into our school so we can start building things for them,” said Brady Brell, a freshman at the Crossing.</p><p>Faith Mission, which is paying for the tiny shelters, has raised $160,000 so far and is continuing to seek support for the project.</p><p>The first shelters should be open between late July and early August, Perez said.</p><p>Faith Mission’s next phase will be to add a dozen slightly larger structures, with full kitchens and bedrooms, to serve as longer term housing for those transitioning out of the mission’s shelter program.</p><p>Those tiny houses are expected to cost about $800,000, Perez said. Although some projects stalled during the coronavirus pandemic, Perez said Faith Mission hopes to roll directly into its second phase by the end of the year.</p><p>“We know there’s individuals in our community that need shelter, they need help and they need resources,” Perez said. “Sometimes the very basic things you do can change things, and sheltering is one of them.”</p><p>Faith Mission is seeking donations for its continuing projects at its website, thefaithmission.org or by calling Mike Perez at (574) 293-3406 ext. 105.</p><p>__</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/tiny-shelters-aim-to-bring-big-change-for-the-homeless-in-elkhart-county/article_bfbc0fa2-a210-11eb-b20d-2f09cc5792db.html"">South Bend Tribune</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTE-bbcc20eee7550dbbf39dd342a22bb95c20210429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:62JJ-5FN1-DYMD-61CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2021-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""802""/><timeReceived>7:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(AP) — The foundations are poured, wall frames and ceiling trusses are on their way, and by the end of the summer, a new “tiny” living concept is expected to make a big difference in Elkhart County.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The Faith Mission of Michiana and the Crossing School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship broke ground last week on a $300,000 effort to provide short-term housing for homeless people in and around Elkhart.</p><p>Inspired by a trend growing nationally, a dozen 12-by-16 tiny shelters will provide one-night or brief-stay housing through Faith Mission’s Low Barrier Shelter program, created in 2019.</p><p>The Low Barrier Shelter program already serves about 50 people seeking emergency shelter through communal housing, Faith Mission Resource/Development Director Mike Perez said.</p><p>However, the tiny shelters will appeal more broadly to people, such as those with pets, PTSD or mental illness, who might find greater comfort in an individual space.</p><p>The 192-square-foot, cabin-like structures will each be outfitted with a toilet, sink, bed and chair, and will be connected via outdoor pathways to a communal bath and laundry house.</p><p>Elkhart city leaders joined Faith Mission and the Crossing, whose students are assisting in construction, for a recent ground breaking of the project.</p><p>“We realize there’s a group of folks that need shelter but don’t want all of the services a shelter provides,” Perez said. “This really will allow police and the city to help get people to somewhere safe no matter what.”</p><p>A team of about 10 students in the Construction Career Pathway program at the Crossing in Goshen have been working in the last three to four weeks during school hours to measure, cut and build wall frames and ceiling trusses for the shelters which will ship in pieces to foundations poured at the Faith Mission.</p><p>Perez said partnering with the Crossing, a faith-based school providing small business and job training to students who may have struggled in traditional education environments, just made sense.</p><p>Students at the Crossing will pick-up real-world construction trades experience while assisting Faith Mission in its goal to expand the availability of short-term housing.</p><p>“It was just one of those things that worked out perfectly,” Perez said. “It benefits them and it benefits us.”</p><p>Six frames have already been delivered to Faith Mission. Community volunteers will help build the structures onsite this spring, Perez said.</p><p>Duffy Sherman, instructor for the Construction Career Pathway, said he has approached each step of the project like a job, training students both in construction trades and soft skills like time management and working as a team. His support dog, Raven, joins the team daily, to provide some levity as the teens work on their next half dozen structures.</p><p>“Some of these kids, in the path they’re on, may end up there,” Sherman said of Faith Mission. “This is a chance to pay it forward.”</p><p>For Caitlyn Ortiz, 16, who started her first year at the Crossing during the pandemic, the project provides the opportunity to stay engaged in hands-on experiences in a small group setting.</p><p>The high school sophomore, who had little construction experience before joining the school, said she’s now considering career possibilities in the trades.</p><p>“It’s a lot more entertaining,” Ortiz said. “I just feel like at this school, there’s a bigger bond between the students and between the teachers.”</p><p>She and other students say they are hopeful the partnership with Faith Mission can draw attention from others who could use the students’ services.</p><p>“The whole purpose of this tiny homes thing is to get more recognition from other people and seeing, hopefully, bigger businesses get invested into our school so we can start building things for them,” said Brady Brell, a freshman at the Crossing.</p><p>Faith Mission, which is paying for the tiny shelters, has raised $160,000 so far and is continuing to seek support for the project.</p><p>The first shelters should be open between late July and early August, Perez said.</p><p>Faith Mission’s next phase will be to add a dozen slightly larger structures, with full kitchens and bedrooms, to serve as longer term housing for those transitioning out of the mission’s shelter program.</p><p>Those tiny houses are expected to cost about $800,000, Perez said. Although some projects stalled during the coronavirus pandemic, Perez said Faith Mission hopes to roll directly into its second phase by the end of the year.</p><p>“We know there’s individuals in our community that need shelter, they need help and they need resources,” Perez said. “Sometimes the very basic things you do can change things, and sheltering is one of them.”</p><p>Faith Mission is seeking donations for its continuing projects at its website, thefaithmission.org or by calling Mike Perez at (574) 293-3406 ext. 105.</p><p>__</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=""https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/tiny-shelters-aim-to-bring-big-change-for-the-homeless-in-elkhart-county/article_bfbc0fa2-a210-11eb-b20d-2f09cc5792db.html"">South Bend Tribune</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTE-bbcc20eee7550dbbf39dd342a22bb95c20210428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:62J9-NBP1-DYMD-62FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2021-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""802""/><timeReceived>4:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(AP) - If you've been around downtown South Bend, you may have noticed bags of scarves, hats, gloves and socks hanging from the trees. South Bend native and creator of the Warming Tree Project Jan Hill Edwards decided to help those less fortunate in the community by hanging these bags for anyone in need to take, especially with colder weather taking over the city.</p><p>Edwards modeled the project after a similar effort in Elkhart. She, along with family members and friends, decided the same kind of project needed to happen in South Bend early in January when the temperatures dropped.</p><p>Edwards said all of the bags hung by the St. Joseph County Public Library were taken within a day.</p><p>A homeless man came up to her while she was hanging more.</p><p>""He did have a pair of gloves on, but you could tell they weren't warm gloves,"" she said. ""I offered him a bag that had a pair of better gloves and a pair of socks. He was so thankful not just for the gloves, but he specifically was excited to have a new pair of socks.""</p><p>Anyone familiar with harsh Midwestern winter conditions can appreciate how difficult it is for people living on the streets, especially overnight, to stay warm, said Emily Sims, director of events for South Bend's Center for the Homeless. Efforts such as Edwards' that provide help that doesn't have to be searched out, Sims said, ""is just such a kindness.""</p><p>The Warming Tree Project has hung more than 100 bags in trees around the downtown area and Howard Park, each containing different winter items that are free for the homeless or people in need to take. Edwards, a senior loan officer for Ruoff Home Mortgage, has placed bags twice so far and will continue to do it until the weather warms up.</p><p>""It's a really easy project that doesn't require a whole lot,"" Edwards said. ""I've grown up in South Bend, I love the city. I just want to help people. It goes back to being the change you want to see in the world, and if I can inspire people to do the same, that's awesome.""</p><p>___</p><p>Source: South Bend Tribune, <url normalizedValue=""http://bit.ly/1Urk217"">http://bit.ly/1Urk217</url></p><p>___</p><p>Information from: South Bend Tribune, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.southbendtribune.com"">http://www.southbendtribune.com</url></p><p>This is an AP-Indiana Exchange story offered by the South Bend Tribune.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTNE-7b859e7ada3843ed987690e6a9760556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5HYN-NX11-JC65-50G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""365""/><timeReceived>10:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

""We would hope if we were in this situation, they would do the same for us.""</p><p>Comer said the Humane Society of the United States called Pet Refuge and asked it to accept the dogs, and Pet Refuge staff drove to an airport in Waukegan, Ill. Monday night to pick them up. The Humane Society of Indianapolis also picked up 11 dogs.</p><p>""They are a wonderful mix of breeds from chihuahuas to Labradors, all showing much personality and good health, even after a plane ride yesterday afternoon,"" said Steven Stolen, CEO of The Humane Society of Indianapolis.</p><p>Pet Refuge and The Humane Society of Indianapolis are two of about 26 shelters nationally that have agreed to take in more than 600 pets from Houston area shelters to make room for Harvey-separated animals, said Kim Alboum, director of the Humane Society of the United States' Emergency Placement Partner Program. They are dogs and cats but mostly dogs thus far, she said.</p><p>""This number is just going to continue to grow,"" Alboum said. ""This is a long-term effort.""</p><p>Comer said the timing was right for Pet Refuge to accommodate the request because recent adoptions have freed up kennel space. Alboum said shelters around the country have told similar stories. If a silver lining has emerged from this tragedy, it's been the realization that shelters have made real advances in reducing the pet population over the past decade, she said.</p><p>""They have the capacity to do it because they've been doing such good work in their communities with spay and neuter and finding creative new ways to adopt out pets,"" Alboum said. ""Something of this volume probably wasn't possible 10 years ago. It's exciting.""</p><p>The HSUS also is giving displaced pet owners pet food and crates for their pets to sleep in, and has teams on the ground in Houston that are partnering with municipalities to help reunite flood victims with their pets.</p><p>Animal shelters there are being careful not to send flood-separated pets out of the area. Animal rescuers learned lessons during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when animal shelters were full, forcing many abandoned animals to be taken to out-of-state shelters where reunions with owners were much more difficult.</p><p>""We're being extremely cautious not to do that,"" she said. ""Pets are a significant part of our family.

(AP) - The Indiana University School of Medicine-South Bend is attempting to carve out a niche in medical education by focusing on community health.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">With this, officials say, the school will set itself apart from the other IU School of Medicine satellite campuses, defining its future and developing a distinct identity.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">""What happens in the doctor's office and hospital, only accounts for 10 to 20 percent of health outcomes,"" explained associate dean and director Dr. Mark Fox. ""When you think about genetics and behavior, social circumstances, all the other slices of the pie, those are things that aren't really the focus of a traditional medical school curriculum.""</p><p>The new focus includes the Community Health Innovation Program, a partnership with the University of Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns that provides a stipend to regional undergraduates and IUMS-SB students to work for community organizations and conduct research into local needs and develop new programs.</p><p>The program allows students from the medical school and Notre Dame to learn about the factors that impact community health and well-being while serving at local nonprofits. The students are working on solutions for solving problems, such as youth homelessness, lack of access to mental healthcare, and unhealthy eating habits.</p><p>The IU School of Medicine in Terre Haute has already implemented its own focus, with its Rural Medical Education Program that is tailored for medical students who plan to serve rural communities.</p><p>Next year Fox said the South Bend medical school will implement some of the new courses, and begin marketing to prospective medical students in the next application cycle.</p><p>The move comes at a time that the school is celebrating 50 years of medical education in South Bend. The school has come a long way since starting in 1968 as a pilot program with just two students. Since then the regional campus has graduated 600 doctors and is currently educating 76 medical students.</p><p>Dr. Paula Toth-Russell, a neurologist with Saint Joseph Health System, was a student in the program after it began offering two years of medical school. Now she mentors students one-on-one in her practice for a month apiece.</p><p>""There's a science to medicine and there's and art to medicine,"" Toth-Russell said. ""They've got to learn how to approach patients and talk to them.""</p><p>In 2005, the school expanded, building the Ernestine Raclin and O.C. Carmichael Jr. Hall at the southeast corner of the intersection between Notre Dame Avenue and Angela Boulevard. and three years later, it began a four-year program.</p><p>John Rice, a pediatrician at the South Bend Clinic, was also a former IUSM-SB student and now hosts students in clerkships as well as giving lectures in pediatrics at the school.</p><p>""At major med center there are many layers between you and professor,"" Rice said. ""But here you're elbow to elbow with people who are world renowned in their fields.""</p><p>Establishing the new focus in community medicine is just one of the additions planned for the school. Fox also hopes to leverage the unique opportunity with Notre Dame to continue IUSM-SB's partnership with the university, and foster innovation in the field.</p><p>""The South Bend region is manageable size for healthcare innovation opportunities. When you think about things like Innovation Park, The IDEA center at Notre Dame is doing things with health related startups,"" Fox said. ""We've got a medical student currently pursuing his MBA at Mendoza. He'll be right in that mix as far as the innovation that's going on.""</p><p>Fox also hopes to see more students stay in South Bend during their clerkships, when they have the option to also go to Indianapolis, and to expand the residency opportunities for students after they graduate. Currently, residencies are hosted at Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center and Memorial Hospital in the field of family medicine.</p><p>""Across the state we're seeing communities that are expanding their training options,"" Fox said. ""There is discussion in the community about what are our opportunities to expand the residency training options.""</p><p>Moving forward, Fox doesn't know what the medical school will look like 50 years from now. Its growth began with two students in 1968. Now there and 74, and more than 600 physicians have graduated from IUSM-SB.</p><p>""In 1968, no one would have projected what the campus looks like now,"" Fox said. ""Since Notre Dame just celebrated its 175th anniversary, 50 years kinds of looks like chump change. We're just entering adolescence.""</p><p>__</p><p>Source: South Bend Tribune</p><p>___</p><p>Information from: South Bend Tribune, <url normalizedValue=""http://www.southbendtribune.com"">http://www.southbendtribune.com</url></p><p>This is an AP Member Exchange shared by the South Bend Tribune.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTNE-5fb85e5348244b9281bd261b3fa29154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5TMD-4WC1-DYN6-W3H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2018-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""781""/><timeReceived>8:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Jan. 29, 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Editorial: Reaching deeper to find and help the vulnerable</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The phrase “fall between the cracks” accurately describes people unreached by existing sources of help.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">A pandemic has widened those cracks. More people are falling between the gaps because of despair, isolation and job losses. Too often, friends, neighbors and coworkers find out only after something dire happens.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Some of those folks get addicted to drugs or alcohol. Others wind up homeless. Some face both predicaments.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Two efforts revved up this week to connect the homeless and addicted to services in the Wabash Valley. Though separate, the projects target a widening sea of people in need in Terre Haute and the surrounding region. Both could use a boost of support from a community that already has given so much since COVID-19 began sweeping through America last March.</p><p>On Thursday, two advocates for addiction services issued a plea for donations to recovery agencies and shelters. Two facilities were on the brink of closure from a lack of funds. Wabash Valley Recovery Center Director Christy Crowder and Vigo County Prosecutor Terry Modesitt explained that the nonprofit support groups rely on contributions and are struggling.</p><p>A day earlier, advocates for the homeless ventured through Vigo County to conduct a pandemic-modified Point-in-Time Count. The annual winter process strives to enumerate people living outdoors, or in non-habitable shelters like abandoned houses, vehicles and RVs parked in vacant lots. The co-chairs of the Homeless Council of the Wabash Valley — Bethany House Director Danielle Elkins and Vigo County Commissioner Brendan Kearns — led other volunteers to find people in those situations. That survey process continues through today.</p><p>The ranks of the homeless and addicted have grown in 2020 and 2021. That growth puts stress on assistance facilities and programs.</p><p>“The last year has been tough on everybody, especially people who struggle with addictions,” said Crowder, the Recovery Center director. “So much has been cut off because of COVID-19.”</p><p>Two Terre Haute recovery facilities nearly closed in December, lacking funds to pay utilities and operation costs. Prosecutor Modesitt explained that the governmental legal system — namely jails and prisons — cannot provide recovery programs that guide the addicted back to sober, productive lifestyles. Treatment also can prevent addicts from committing crimes to buy more substances.</p><p>Several recovery outlets get support from churches. Construction firm Thompson Thrift also took on a three-year commitment to renovate the Next Step Foundation residential recovery facility at Sixth and Washington streets. Interested donors can contact one of nearly a dozen local recovery nonprofits by phone. Those include: The Avenues, 812-229-1632; Club Gobi, 812-232-4144; Club Soda, 812-841-6349; House of Hope, 812-446-1717; Odyssey House, 812-298-3125; Next Step, 812-917-5006; Ruth House, 812-699-9831; Salvaged Lives, 812-232-1700; Truman House, 812-229-7244; Wabash Valley Recovery Center, 812-917-0068; and Wabash Valley Teen Challenge, 812-624-5679.</p><p>The Point in Time Count of the homeless is a survey required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to determine federal funding to communities for housing assistance and shelters. Because of COVID-19 precautions, the counters could not set up hubs in city parks, where homeless people could pick up food, clothing and supplies. So, volunteers visited common areas, where the homeless often live in cars or wooded places like the Wabash River front.</p><p>Through those contacts, the needy received necessities and got counted.</p><p>The survey opens up funding that will help establish a day center for the homeless at Reach Services on South 15th Street. There, people will be able warm up or cool down in adverse weather, rest on cots, collect mail and access computers, showers and a laundry.</p><p>“It is something that is definitely missing in the community,” Elkins said.</p><p>Reach Services itself serves the special-needs community. Anyone interested in donating or volunteering can call 812-232-6305.</p><p>The pandemic has intensified physical, mental and financial hardships. The entire community will benefit from intensified support of the relief agencies</p><p>___</p><p>South Bend Tribune. Jan. 31, 2021.</p><p>Editorial: Cautious optimism for Hoosier nursing home reforms</p><p>Indiana took an important step toward addressing the issues that have plagued a nursing home system that puts the lives of the most vulnerable Hoosiers at risk.</p><p>That’s reason for cautious optimism, and this should be seen as only a good start at fixing problems — including understaffing and a lack of transparency — that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Officials from the Family and Social Services Administration outlined proposed reforms aimed at increasing the quality of care for aging Hoosiers. The four-point plan would allow more Hoosiers to age at home and would incentivize quality care for residents of the state’s nursing homes.</p><p>The reforms come after a series of reports by our colleagues at the Indianapolis Star revealed alarming problems with the state’s nursing home system. The reports offered a path to reform, including stricter requirements for nursing home staffing, cracking down on the practice of county hospitals directing Medicaid money away from nursing homes they own and funding more options for home care.</p><p>Under the plan laid out by FSSA Secretary Jennifer Sullivan and Chief Medical Officer Dan Rusyniak, the state would pursue a managed care system that would allow Hoosiers to access information about the different types of care that are available, including home care. Under a managed care system, an organization or company becomes the clearinghouse for directing residents and their families toward the care they need.</p><p>Other reforms include linking funding to quality outcomes, offering faster approvals for home or community-based care and better data tracking by the state to allow it to assess providers and determine which are the best and worst performers.</p><p>The plan should help the state make inroads in the systemic problems that have been overlooked by state leaders for years. And it should help Indiana move beyond a status quo that hasn’t served the best interests of residents in long-term care facilities.</p><p>Indiana still has plenty of work to do to make the state’s nursing home system the priority that it needs to be. But this four-point plan is an encouraging sign that state officials are finally turning their attention to a long-standing problem.</p><p>___</p><p>Kokomo Tribune. Jan. 30, 2021.</p><p>Editorial: Hike cigarette tax for health</p><p>Raising the cigarette tax in Indiana could provide added incentive for smokers to quit while generating a much-needed boost for funding of public health initiatives.</p><p>But Hoosier lawmakers should also consider this: Smoking is legal and shouldn’t be taxed into oblivion. Raising the tax too high would put an outsized financial burden on Hoosier smokers, many of whom are struggling financially during the pandemic.</p><p>Twenty-two health organizations have called jointly on the state to hike its tax on a 20-pack of cigarettes from $1 to $3. That seems extreme, considering that Hoosier smokers currently pay an average of $5.75 for a pack. Add two more dollars, and the $7.75 cost would be comprised of 39% excise tax, not to mention the 7% state sales tax.</p><p>House Bill 1434, authored by state Rep. Julie Olthoff, R-Crown Point, takes a more reasonable approach. It would add $1 per pack to the cigarette tax. HB 1434 would also impose an 8-cent tax per milliliter on e-liquids containing nicotine.</p><p>Olthoff’s bill would nudge Indiana’s cigarette tax closer to the middle of the Midwestern pack. Illinois’ cigarette tax is $2.98, while Michigan charges $2, Ohio $1.60 and Kentucky $1.10. The average state cigarette tax is $1.89.</p><p>The $1 increase in Indiana, which hasn’t raised its cigarette tax since 2007, would generate about $175 million in revenue that could be channeled to public health care, where the state’s spending ranks 48th nationally. The new revenue could be used for smoking cessation efforts, as well as other health initiatives to deal with the pandemic and to address Indiana’s litany of health concerns, including maternal and neonatal care.</p><p>Studies have shown that the cost of a pack of cigarettes does discourage some smokers from lighting up.</p><p>Research reported in the publication Epidemiology in 2017 found that a $1 increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes prompts a 20% decrease in cigarette purchases.</p><p>The proposed $1 per pack increase in Indiana’s cigarette tax would cost three-pack-a-week Hoosier smokers, who currently pay about $900 a year to support their habit, an additional $160 annually. While that amount wouldn’t break the bank for most, it might be yet another factor encouraging them to quit tobacco.</p><p>The stakes are high. More than 1,100 Hoosiers die each year from smoking and about 1,400 die of exposure to secondhand smoke, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The economic cost of smoking is colossal, as well.</p><p>Smoking-related illnesses demand almost $170 billion for direct medical care annually across the country, according to the CDC. Indiana is hit harder than most. Nineteen percent of Hoosier adults smoke, exceeding the national average of 16%.</p><p>Given the staggering costs and the need for better funding of public health care in Indiana, the General Assembly should move decisively to pass HB 1434 and raise the cigarette tax for the first time in 14 years.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTE-7a61e0826521573cdcb34fcc838c867620210202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:61X6-KDH1-JC5B-G2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2021-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""1597""/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(AP) - Keith Cooper, a former Elkhart resident wrongfully convicted of a 1996 armed robbery, recalls the moment he walked out of prison in 2006, nine years into a 40-year sentence for a crime he did not commit.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">""That was one of the happiest moments of my life, to be free,"" Cooper said. ""To be told that, 'Keith, you back among the living now. You can go and get your family.""</p><p>But his journey to freedom was not a smooth one, hampered at nearly every turn by a system that seemed designed to deny him justice - even in the face of overwhelming evidence of his innocence.</p><p>The first person pardoned in Indiana based on actual innocence, Cooper spoke of that journey April 12 as part of a discussion hosted by the Innocent Project Club at the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>The 49-year-old was joined by his attorney, Elliot Slosar of the Chicago Exoneration Project and the law firm Loevy and Loevy, and wife, Nicole Cooper.</p><p>Jimmy Gurule, a professor of law at the university and an expert in the field of international criminal law, moderated the discussion.</p><p>Now 49 and living in Chicago, Cooper was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison in Elkhart County in 1997 based on faulty DNA evidence and witness statements.</p><p>""On Sept. 9, 1997, there was a travesty of justice that occurred,"" Gurule said April 12. ""An innocent man was wrongfully convicted. And by the way, he was convicted next door, he was convicted literally a few miles away from this campus.""</p><p>In 2002, the Indiana Court of Appeals overturned the conviction of his codefendant, Michael Parish, and offered Cooper a choice: a new trial before the same judge who previously convicted him or release with a felony on his record.</p><p>With his family living in a homeless shelter, Cooper chose the latter, figuring, he said, ""I'm going to take this so I can get home and immediately assist my family.""</p><p>Twelve years later, in 2014, the Indiana Parole Board unanimously recommended that then-<person><nameText>Gov. Mike Pence </nameText></person>pardon Cooper, but Pence's general counsel advised Cooper to first exhaust all of his legal options.</p><p>Finally, in February, Pence's successor, <person><nameText>Eric Holcomb, </nameText></person>did what Pence would not do: grant Cooper a pardon based on actual innocence.</p><p>""For the past 20 years, Keith has been fighting this wrongful conviction,"" Slosar said Wednesday.</p><p>A law student at the time, Slosar met Cooper while representing Parish, his codefendant, who later received a $5 million settlement from the city of Elkhart.</p><p>The victims in the case had recently admitted on tape that they had misidentified Parish and Cooper, Slosar said, and he thought Cooper should see it. So he invited him to his office in Chicago.</p><p>""He cried. I got emotional,"" Slosar said. ""I said, 'Gosh, how am I, as a law student, going to help this guy?'""</p><p>Rather than seek justice via the same judicial system that wrongfully convicted him in the first place, Slosar decided to go straight to the governor's office and request a pardon for Cooper.</p><p>He first did so in 2009, but was told he had to wait until five years after Cooper was released from prison. So he waited until 2011 and filed the paperwork again.</p><p>Finally, in 2014, the state Parole Board, after hearing from witnesses and Cooper himself, recommended a pardon based on actual innocence - not only for the armed robbery but for a subsequent battery conviction while in prison.</p><p>""And then we waited,"" Slosar said. ""And every two months until Gov. Pence went to D.C., we had conversations with his general counsel for the state of Indiana. And we were led to believe that if we were able to get a letter from the lawyer who prosecuted Mr. Cooper or the judge who wrongfully convicted him saying the conviction should be reversed, that Gov. Pence would then be comfortable granting the"" pardon.</p><p>He was able to get such a letter from the lawyer who prosecuted the case, he said, but ""Pence did nothing except for promise us he was giving it really careful consideration.""</p><p>In January, Pence left for Washington to serve as vice president under Donald Trump. One month later, Holcomb pardoned Cooper.</p><p>Slosar was meeting with another client in Arizona at the time, he said. But the witness they wanted to talk to wasn't home, so they went to the nearest café to wait.</p><p>""And the café was the Hoosier Café,"" he said. ""So when I got the call from the general counsel for the state of Indiana . I was sitting in the Hoosier Café, all the way across the country.""</p><p>Slosar is currently representing two other clients who he says were wrongfully convicted in Elkhart County as well, both in cases involving the same detective that investigated Cooper's case.</p><p>Cooper, meanwhile, has found life outside of prison difficult. Unlike his conviction, his arrest record has yet to be expunged, and he worries about what might happen if he's pulled over by police and they see it.</p><p>He also carries emotional scars from his time behind bars.</p><p>""He still has things that hurt him. Lots of things hurt him,"" his wife, Nicole Cooper, said. ""He has bad dreams. He gets frustrated. But we say a prayer and God keeps us moving.""</p><p>Sometimes, Nicole Cooper said, she'll dance with her husband in the middle of the night when he can't sleep, or head to the kitchen when he says, ""Baby, I have a taste for this,"" as a way to calm his nerves.</p><p>""We try to make sure we do that for him and it takes the stress off,"" she said.</p><p>Time has been kinder to those on the other side of the case.</p><p>Pence is now vice president of the U.S. The lawyer who prosecuted the case is now a judge. And the county prosecutor who oversaw the lawyer is now the attorney general for the state.</p><p>Said Gurule, the law professor, ""I don't know where the justice is in all that. Anyway .

And the thing I learned, the thing we all learned recently, in that statement that 200 word statement released was talked about getting the Justice department engaged in this. It s such a blatant abuse of power that I don t think it can stand. </p><p nitf:lede=""true""> Kimmel also asked Biden how the past 48 hours of news has ranked on the  outlandish scale  given Biden s long career in politics, to which Biden replied  18 out of 10.

It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau.

They are suddenly being forced to refrain from attacking each other, for the moment, and join together in an alliance against Trump.</p><p> So, to be crass, which of the front-runners benefits? Is it Biden, the candidate who has made Trump s unfitness for office the centerpiece of his campaign, one that sees removing him as the only important policy proposal?</p><p> Or is it  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA),  who, despite calling for his impeachment earlier than her rivals, has tried to move Trump to the periphery of the 2020 race and emphasize that just getting rid of him isn t enough because, she argues, the next president has to have a series of detailed revolutionary plans that will upend a rigged economic system and act as a vaccine against the rise of the next Trump?  </p><p> Interviews with people in several campaigns reveal a fraught debate over whether impeachment benefits Biden or Warren or has some other unintended consequences nobody foresees.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT)  is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.</p><p> The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.</p><p> But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that  Warren  is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.</p><p> Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny  Trump  a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race. </p><p> The twin sources of frustration and internal debate ... was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.  (<url normalizedValue=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-iowa-new-hampshire/index.html"">CNN</url>)</p><p> As a Democratic candidate for president,  Sanders  frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters.  </p><p> At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.  </p><p> A doctor who served the extremely impoverished told of his wife keeping her suffering silent until her colon cancer was fatal. She didn't want to worry him with medical bills. An Iowa woman spoke of losing a pregnancy while waiting for insurance at a new job to kick in, and a medical debt payment plan that would mean monthly reminders for decades of her lost child and fertility. More stories followed and audience members consoled each other.

(release) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""bf"">WARREN.</emphasis>  Throughout the primary,  Warren  has signalled unwavering loyalty to the Medicare for All proposal advanced by  Sanders,  a fellow progressive. But she was once more open to other positions. Though all presidential candidates agree on the need for universal coverage (27.5m Americans, or 8.5% of the population, still lack health insurance), they disagree on how to achieve that. Medicare for All, which has become the default progressive plan, envisions a single-payer system free at the point of service abolishing private health-insurance schemes. </p><p> The moderate candidates who dislike Mr Sanders s ideas like Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)   propose improvements to private health-insurance exchanges created by Obamacare and the creation of a public option for those who want it. Ms Warren once seemed persuaded by such thinking. Her Consumer Health Insurance Protection Act, reintroduced in April of this year, sensibly focuses on shoring up exchanges, ending surprise billing and closing some loopholes for sub-standard health-insurance. At a town hall broadcast on CNN in March, she sounded open to  different pathways  to Medicare for All.  </p><p> Since then, she has remained vague on the subject. This is striking:  Warren  is a candidate known for her attention to detail, but she often talks about health care in no more than generalities.  </p><p> Yet vagueness could be politically advantageous for  Warren.  Her steadfast support for Medicare for All allows her to attract progressive voters within the Democratic electorate especially the college-educated whites who have fuelled her rise in the polls. But the criticism of the plan from moderates has been directed at Mr Sanders. That dynamic was on vivid display in the last presidential debate, held in Houston on September 12th. Should  Warren, Sanders, and Biden  continue to lead the race, this could go on for months. Should it deliver Ms Warren the presidential nomination, she may have to cast aside Mr Sanders s idea and come up with her own plan after all.

The Swank family covers the foundation's operating expenses while additional financial support raised from other resources, such as wine dinners and auctions, goes directly to Jaxson Scholars.</p><p>Ten years ago a small event helped to raised $25,000 for the foundation. At the most recent dinner and auction at the Carriage House dining room, more than $600,000 was raised.</p><p>The foundation accepts applications every year from families with children ages 2½ to 5 and whose parents earn at or below 250% of the federal poverty level, which is $60,625 for a family of four.</p><p>It's a rigorous application process. There were 25 applications last year, but the foundation accepts no more than one or two children a year.</p><p>The first student - Jolie - was selected from a family who was staying at the Center for the Homeless in South Bend. In 2008, Jolie began attending Good Shepherd Montessori School in South Bend and today she's a freshman at LaLumiere School in LaPorte.

In doing so they've set a great example and also helped to changed lives.</p><p>___</p><p>Kokomo Tribune. January 3, 2020</p><p>Public's right to know</p><p>Hoosiers support the right to know what government at all levels is up to, and they believe public notices in community newspapers are a trusted source of that transparency.</p><p>A 2014 survey by the Princeton, New Jersey-based American Opinion Research asked state residents their thoughts on the importance of public notice advertisements in local newspapers. The study was commissioned by the Hoosier State Press Association's board of directors and surveyed 1,000 Indiana residents. The findings, published in the Nov. 13, 2014 edition of The Indiana Publisher, were overwhelming:</p><p>· 85% supported publication of public notices as a way to inform residents of government actions.</p><p>· 64% said governmental entities should be required to publish these announcements, even though they cost them thousands of extra dollars per year.</p><p>· 61% said they had read or seen public notice advertising in a newspaper.</p><p>State legislators placed a ""sunset"" in 2013 to the requirement that local government agencies publish their budgets as part of the notice of budget hearings. The rollback took effect in 2014.</p><p>The change in the budget-publishing requirement was sought by the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. Removing budget details from newspaper public notices reduced resident access to this important information. The Hoosier State Press Association says just 12,000 unique visitors saw local government budgets on the DLGF website in 2017, compared to the 3 million Hoosier newspaper readers who no longer read budget details in their local newspapers.</p><p>The American Opinion Research shows Hoosiers agree on the importance of public notice advertisements. It's pretty difficult to keep tabs on governmental entities if one can't even find basic information like the annual budgets they will debate.</p><p>In the 2020 legislative session, state lawmakers must make annual budgets a part of the notice of budget hearings again.</p><p>Such a requirement puts information in the one place where local residents are likely to find it: the community newspaper.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">APSTE-ce88f47a0027218a9785f7abb0e6eb3f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5XXR-NKX1-DYN6-W4TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""1149""/><timeReceived>6:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Indianapolis—my hometown, where my family is buried and where some of my best friends still live—was bad enough. I have not been back in a while. </p><p>But I spent the icy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend in South Bend, talking to black people about former mayor Pete Buttigieg and his presidential campaign's difficulties with black voters, and his efforts to rectify the situation.1 Ad Policy[1] We come to where the East Race is reunited with the main course of the St. Joseph River. Here, the river is a rebellious churn of swirls and eddies, in a hurry to get somewhere. Trotting up a flight of concrete stairs, we pick up the East Bank Trail, which incorporates a former railway and will take us all the way up to the edge of the Notre Dame campus. The asphalt is smooth and wide, and the daylight is now peeking through between leaves under a canopy of trees that arches over us, as if the city were nowhere near. From my office on the fourteenth floor, most of the city looks like a forest, and in the summertime you would never guess that whole neighborhoods sit below the dark green carpet of treetops.2 —Pete Buttigieg, Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future3Buttigieg's blend of coming-of-age memoir and campaign manifesto reveals the obsessive, weird inner focus of the achiever who made up his mind to do great things at an early age and embarked on the error-free path. Born in 1982, a winner of the Profile in Courage high school essay contest, he met Senator Ted Kennedy and gave an address at the John F. Kennedy Library. An undergraduate at Harvard in 2004, when TheFacebook.com was launched, he studied, among other things, Arabic, having fallen for Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North. Buttigieg remembers the novel as being about an Arab graduate student's sexual conquests among British women. Although he doesn't say so in his memoir, we know that Buttigieg taught himself enough Norwegian to read Nave. Super by Erlend Loe, a coming-of-age novel about a graduate school dropout. James Joyce learned Norwegian in order to write to Ibsen of his deep admiration, and Buttigieg's title is a reflection of the soft spot he says he has for Ulysses, in which Leopold Bloom muses, #8216;Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.#8217;4  Related Article As a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, Buttigieg studied the analytical tradition in philosophy, lessons that would come back to him as an elected official obliged to adopt a utilitarian approach to policy: what brings the greatest good to the greatest number. He writes that as an associate in the Chicago office of McKinsey &amp; Company, the #8216;pinnacle of smart and useful analysis in the business world,#8217; he became fascinated by #8216;the nature of data.#8217; But the rewards of the private sector could not answer the hunger of one called to service.5 He was offered a place on Barack Obama's Senate campaign but chose to work for John Kerry instead. Buttigieg watched from Arizona the convention speech that made the future president famous. In 2008, he took time off from his job to knock on doors in Iowa for Obama. And he was preparing to act on his belief that it was a failure of the postwar political elite to avoid military service. He survived the vetting that goes with getting a top security clearance and in 2009 signed on as an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. Buttigieg tells us, perhaps too often, that in 2014 he had to take time off from the South Bend mayor's office because he'd been called up for a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan.6  <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-BLM_ap_img.jpg"">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-BLM_ap_img.jpg</url> Bird-dogging Mayor Pete: Protesters with Black Lives Matter outside a Buttigieg campaign visit to a homeless shelter in Los Angeles. (Richard Vogel / AP Photo) A failed campaign for state treasurer and, after winning two terms as mayor, a strategically useful but unsuccessful bid to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee put some starch in his political collar. #8216;Meet Pete,#8217; his early signs read. He was one of those #8216;impatient millennial products of South Bend,#8217; dreaming of a city administration that kept its #8216;public character#8217; but ran on #8216;business principles.#8217; In 2011 he finally got his chance when the long-serving Democratic incumbent mayor of South Bend decided to step down. Buttigieg took office in 2012, sharing 9/11 with his generation as a formative experience and also a simmering resentment about corporate cynicism in the Great Recession of 2008.7 Purposeful, humorless, corny, sincere—Buttigieg offers idealism, not ideology, and his claim to be an agent of good governance comes from having revived a city that Newsweek once dismissed as part of the dying industrial Midwest. #8216;Good policy, like good literature, takes personal lived experience as its starting point.#8217; Mayor Pete—everyone calls him that—is the butch voice of this sensitive flyover country. In his white shirtsleeves and dark ties, he looks like a Mormon missionary but projects a Macron-like, slightly-out-of-it technocrat's air, and I don't understand the criticism that says his meeting with Al Sharpton showed that he did not know how to eat chicken. In Shortest Way Home, Buttigieg remembers that he was in Brookville, Indiana, in the summer of 2010 when it broke the world record for the amount of chicken served at one sitting: 1,645 pounds.8             <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-DesMoines_ap_img.jpg"">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-DesMoines_ap_img.jpg</url> Face to face: Angry attendees at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa, confront the candidate, January 1 (Patrick Semansky / AP Photo) #8216;Why are they picking on him about the black vote?#8217; Dr. Janet Evelyn demands. Caribbean born and a former president of Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend, Evelyn acts as a campaign surrogate, speaking on behalf of Buttigieg. #8216;If Kamala Harris had the black vote, she'd still be in the race,#8217; she tells me. #8216;If Cory Booker had the black vote, he would still have been in. Why are you only focusing on Pete?#8217;9 We're sitting in one of the carefully staged parlors of the inn where I was staying, once the kind of mansion that tormented Theodore Dreiser's unhappy youths. It suddenly comes to me that I am nearly twice Mayor Pete's age. Evelyn is on her way to South Carolina. I ask why his polling numbers in that state are so low among black voters. She says they didn't know him. She also says that 40percent of the Buttigieg volunteers are black or Latino. She mentioned Nina Smith, his black traveling press secretary. Mayors aren't superheroes; they're servants of the people, she says. And from her experience, Mayor Pete was a true servant of the people.10 He'd been ambushed by protesters in Iowa. #8216;If you are Black Lives Matter South Bend, why are you in Iowa?#8217; Evelyn wanted to know. She added that some people were just showing off for CNN. Yet Buttigieg's controversies with South Bend's black citizens during his tenure as mayor provide a convincing explanation for why he has not been able to make himself more popular among black voters elsewhere in the country.11  Shortest Way Home is not told chronologically. It moves by theme and anecdote, sometimes taking a while to circle back. Buttigieg seems uncomfortable in his account of what happened with black South Bend. He recalls deciding on a new approach to dealing with gang-related violence when the homicide rate started going up as he began his first term in 2012. #8216;Controversially, I hired an outsider from Massachusetts to fill a vacancy in the position of police chief.#8217; He doesn't say at this point in the book that South Bend's new white police chief from Boston replaced the city's black police chief—a man he at first asked to resign and then demoted because of a wiretapping scandal that had put the newly reappointed chief under an FBI investigation.12 Buttigieg inherited the FBI problem when he took office. Late in his book, he writes that the South Bend Police Department needed reform but he mistakenly put off tackling the issue. Darryl Boykins, the incumbent black police chief (whom Buttigieg does not refer to by name), was well liked and had built confidence between the black community and the police department. But the internal politics of the department #8216;boiled over.#8217; Boykins allegedly confronted white officers in the department with tape recordings of their conversations that would embarrass them if they became public. #8216;Some phone lines in the department were connected to recording equipment used for interviews and investigations,#8217; Buttigieg writes, #8216;and the officers had been recorded on that equipment without their knowledge. Enter the Federal Wiretap Act.#8217; He notes that #8216;making such recordings or disclosing their content can be a felony.#8217; The recorded officers complained to federal authorities, and a few weeks into his new job as mayor, Buttigieg got a message, #8216;thinly veiled but quite clear, from federal prosecutors: the people responsible for the covert recordings needed to go, or charges might be filed.#8217;13  He got bounced into it, he seems to be saying. He phoned Boykins and accepted the resignation that the police chief offered. #8216;The reaction was instant and fierce.#8217; Community outcry led the police chief to change his mind about quitting. But Buttigieg had lost confidence in Boykins's leadership. The mayor demoted the chief to the rank of captain. #8216;As of this writing, I have not heard the recordings, and I still don't know if I, and the public, ever will.#8217; Buttigieg says that the deeper meaning of the controversy had to do with trust between the black community and the police. It affected his relationship with the black community for years. He also had to explain why, in 2015, he used the loaded phrase #8216;All lives matter#8217; in a State of the City address when discussing racial bias. Last June, after a black man, Eric Logan, was killed by a white police officer, Buttigieg suspended his campaign in order to attend a town hall meeting. The killing remains the subject of a special prosecutor's investigation, and the tapes scandal is still tied up in the courts.14  Related Article It's hard to present yourself to black voters as a fresh start in presidential politics when you're associated with cases easily portrayed as unresolved because of police cover-ups.15 Evelyn was quick to say that Eric Logan's brother had marched with Mayor Pete. Maybe getting dogged by the old accusations was proof that Mayor Pete's candidacy was real.16 I spoke with Vernado Malone, a founder of the group Justice for South Bend, about Logan's death. At 3:30 in the morning on Father's Day in 2019, Logan, 54, left a group of his friends who had been planning a cookout for their children. Malone said that based on what the police chief, Scott Ruszkowski, told them, a police officer meant to tase Logan, who was said to have been breaking into a car, but pulled the wrong weapon. Delivering Logan to the ER himself instead of calling an ambulance, the officer may have exacerbated Logan's wounds. The officer's body camera wasn't turned on. Malone contended that there was no blood at the crime scene, a parking lot. It had been cleaned up, he said, the evidence further tainted when an officer touched the car Logan had supposedly tried to break into. Malone also claimed the police woke the white owner of the vehicle in question and coached him on what to say.17 Malone observed that the police said Logan was holding a knife. Malone was adamant that black men in his part of town did not carry knives: #8216;We carry guns.#8217; Therefore, he did not trust the police version of events.18 The community, Malone said, asked that the officer involved be suspended without pay. Buttigieg refused. #8216;He didn't correct the problems, and they became a mistake.#8217;19 There may be a new mayor in South Bend now, but the Board of Public Safety, the civic authority charged with investigating the Logan shooting, was Buttigieg's old board, its appointees too close to the city and the police to be anything but ineffective. The police couldn't be trusted to investigate themselves. There was no civilian oversight committee because #8216;they#8217; didn't want one. No charges have been filed against the officer. The Urban League doesn't exist in South Bend anymore, and the city's NAACP chapter is dormant.20             <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-ChiefBoykins_ap_img.jpg"">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-ChiefBoykins_ap_img.jpg</url> Black and white and blue: Former South Bend police chief Darryl Boykins.

(Robert Franklin / South Bend Tribune via AP) I didn't go on a tour of black South Bend offered by Theodore Randall, a professor of anthropology at Indiana UniversitySouth Bend. However, he tried to give me a general picture of the grievances the black community might have against Pete Buttigieg, including that he's seen as not being from South Bend but from Notre Dame, where his parents were high-powered faculty. They sent him to Catholic schools; he didn't come up through the public school system. He was the mayor of downtown but not of the rest of the city, and blacks have won a meager percentage of government construction contracts. Some people minded 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days, his program to replace benighted and derelict housing around the city. I couldn't see for myself whether or not there were holes where structures had been demolished but nothing rebuilt in their place in black areas.21  Randall urged on me recent articles in The Root and The Young Turks. In an article for TYT Investigates, Jonathan Larsen challenges Buttigieg's assertion that he has no way of knowing what's on the tapes from the Boykins scandal. Larsen claims that Buttigieg's lawyers asked someone who knew what was on them. The conversations on the tape have been characterized by some sources as racist and include discussion about pressuring Buttigieg to get rid of the black police chief. The Root's Michael Harriot examines the decline in the number of black police officers on the South Bend PD since the scandal broke, going in a short period from just under 12 percent, or 29of 244 officers, to slightly over 6percent, or 15 officers. Black people make up 26percent of South Bend's total population.22 Randall also recommended I watch the Black Lives Matter South Bend media call concerning Buttigieg, during which Buttigieg's old foe on the Common Council, Henry Davis Jr., insisted Mayor Pete isn't naive, called him no better than Trump, and said black people are being harmed by his leadership. Davis didn't believe Buttigieg had even 4 percent black support nationally, as the polls were saying. #8216;You're not trying to do it. You don't want to do it, sir,#8217; Davis fumed.23 Black Lives Matter's national spokesperson, Melina Abdullah, denounced Buttigieg for representing a liberal white supremacy that sustains the oppression of black people in spite of its rhetoric in favor of diversity. It was an insult, she said, for him to equate his being gay with the black experience. She said he's not working for the black vote; he seems to think that strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire will mean he won't have to. She said Buttigieg is just blaming black people for not voting for him because he's gay.24  Current Issue            <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/"">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/</url> Randall introduced me to two leaders of Black Lives Matter South Bend, Jorden Giger and E-Lexus Thornton, thoughtful, intelligent, questing young math teachers.25 Most teachers in the South Bend public school system are white. Giger and Thornton said they despair of getting through to their students, of being able to make up for what they lack at home, starting with parents who don't know what to do, who themselves do not understand school. They spend a lot of time showing their classes that they are the bosses. They both have thick afros and look as with-it as any black youth.26 And yet they shrugged off what having a same-race teacher in math may mean to their black middle school students. Thornton had been president of the Society of Physics Students. We assured them that some of their students will remember them for the rest of their lives. The young teachers, close friends, looked away, off toward a noisy table at the Linden Grill, a popular black restaurant where we sat for some time, making a mess.27 Giger said that for him, Buttigieg was not the candidate to lead the nation in the 21st century because of his record in South Bend. He spent so little money on the black community while he was in office. He was too clubbable, made pals too easily with the old city network of white interests. #8216;He doesn't want to own his black problem,#8217; Giger said. #8216;He just wants to say he has black friends.#8217; Both he and Thornton repeated to me the complaints against Buttigieg made in the press and on social media, one of them being that his campaign is a media creation.28 Giger was the host of the Black Lives Matter South Bend media call. Mixed in with their criticisms of Buttigieg was the sense that he had used South Bend as a stepping-stone, that he had known all along he was just passing through. Janis Joplin once talked about the small-town blowback she got when she returned home a star. #8216;This raggedy-ass city,#8217; Giger said. #8216;The Democratic Party is dying, and he's a symptom of it.#8217; Thornton is from elsewhere, but Giger came of age during Mayor Pete's time in office. It seemed odd that Buttigieg, only 38 years old, should be the object of what seemed to me their generational scorn. For them, hip-hop is political. Cardi B would be as good a candidate as anyone.29 #8216;Every time we say, #8216;This generation will be different.' You have to be able to reach them, and we're not. Because nothing ever happens for them,#8217; Thornton said of his black students. It was hard to counter their #8216;inability ever to believe they will ever get out of our situation.#8217; What he said of his students, I wanted to say of him and Giger, their teachers. Giger said he'd held out against Afro-pessimism, but now30             <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-statue-ap_img.jpg"">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-statue-ap_img.jpg</url> Shoulder to shoulder: A bronze statue in South Bend depicts the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, a longtime president of Notre Dame, with Martin Luther King Jr. (Becky Malewitz / South Bend Tribune via AP) There is an element of people going after Buttigieg because they can. Approval of him is power over him, and the longer it is withheld, the more important the fence-sitter appears. Black Lives Matter in Buttigieg's case gives off an atmosphere not unlike some Me Too cases: You will never be forgiven. However, Abdullah seemed to hold out the possibility that if Buttigieg addressed the problem nationally and admitted his shortcomings, then black people—the #8216;forgiving tribe,#8217; Jill Nelson once called us—might get over the hurt he caused us in South Bend. But that is also trying to establish control over him.31 A young white Buttigieg campaign worker, Sean Savett, and a young black colleague, Rodericka Applewhaite, expressed frustration with what they saw as a narrative that got going because people kept repeating it: Mayor Pete has a problem with the black vote. We were in the Chicory Caf, a hipster locale that could have been cited in Buttigieg's book as another sign of downtown revival. The two alert, cautious campaign workers were so prepared to defend Mayor Pete that my questions abandoned me. They did smile when I said I liked the campaign's website and videos.32 I'd wanted to talk to them about Buttigieg's Douglass Plan, an extraordinary document about investing in black America that, regrettably, is suffering in the weather arising from its author's perceived failure to side with black South Bend in any controversy with the white man's police force. Most of the black people I spoke with gave the same answer when I asked if they'd read it: Not yet.33 The Douglass Plan is written in the language of reparations. Indeed, Buttigieg calls for a committee to propose reparations policies to Congress. #8216;America's racist structures were built to justify and perpetuate slavery, and by achieving greater equity for Black Americans we lay the groundwork for achieving greater equity for other people of color as well.#8217;34 A technocrat's version of call and response, the plan has several components in which problems are identified and solutions proposed. A national health equity strategy would #8216;prioritize anti-racism.#8217; The Douglass Plan speaks of health equity zones and accountable communities of health and the underrepresentation of black people in health care. In the area of education, the Douglass Plan proposes using Title I funding to increase teachers' pay. It also pays particular attention to the mission of historically black colleges and universities.35 The Douglass Plan seeks to end the War on Drugs, proposing to legalize marijuana, eliminate the prosecution of drug offenses, and improve police recruitment practices. It also calls for a reduction of sentences, the elimination of mandatory minimums, the formation of a clemency commission, and, importantly, the abolition of private prisons. It sees the end of so-called broken windows policing and the abolition of the death penalty by constitutional amendment. It envisions a 21stCentury Voting Rights Act as well as something called the Walker-Lewis Initiative, named for 20th century black entrepreneurs, to address the inequalities of capital and asset accumulation in the black community. The Douglass Plan also proposes a 21stCentury Community Homestead Act and a public trust for investment. This provision is crucial, given the astronomical cost projections of most direct reparation plans.36 It is a document meant to be discussed, not summarized, drawing on sources ranging from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research and the Black Economic Alliance to Ebony magazine and the Brookings Institution—a sign, maybe, of Buttigieg's style: the accumulation of data, continual evaluation with a goal in mind. Were Buttigieg's name not attached to the Douglass Plan, we would be talking about its political descent from the black nationalist manifesto of the National Black Political Convention held in Gary, Indiana, in 1972 or its systemic reach, as called for in the manifesto of the Movement for Black Lives. The Douglass Plan says the District of Columbia should be a state.37             <url normalizedValue=""https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-Dyngus-ap_img.jpg"">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pinckney-MayorPete-Dyngus-ap_img.jpg</url> The king of Dyng: Mayor Pete presides over South Bend's celebration of Dyngus Day, a Polish festival held on the day after Easter. (Robert Franklin / South Bend Tribune via AP) I scraped the snow from the plaque at the base of the statue Buttigieg proudly refers to in his book, an almost life-size bronze of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, beloved president of Notre Dame, hand in hand with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., commemorating the moment in 1964 when they demonstrated together in Chicago. Shortest Way Home is not Dreams From My Father. Its coziness of memory, its protectiveness toward South Bend, says everything about the racial divide and the different experiences of growing up white and black there. Buttigieg is tender in his recollection of those drunken, Polish celebrations of Dyngus Day. However, he resembles (or models himself on) Barack Obama—in his bipartisan inclinations, in the value he puts on being able to work across the aisle, in his public displays of an always equitable temper. And also in how he has been able to be openly gay in the most mainstream of political arenas.38 Back during Obama's first campaign, the word was that his advisers didn't want him to call too much attention to his being black. After all, he needed only to show up to get the point across. Buttigieg, on the other hand, had to go publicly from situational passing for straight to being out and in office. We blush for him in the romantic paragraphs of his book when he remembers going down on one knee to propose to Chasten at the airport. He has been criticized for not being gay enough. Something similar was once said about Obama not being black enough. Buttigieg has a difficult task, saying he's not the status quo while having to get across that he is, indeed, normal. Except he isn't. He's not really a privileged white male. Insides matter.39  Related Article #8216;#8216;But there is this one little thing,'#8217; I remember Evelyn saying, quoting a black woman in South Carolina explaining her main reservation concerning Buttigieg. We get offended that the black community is said to be antigay, as if white communities weren't also homophobic, but I kept hearing black people in South Bend say, #8216;You know how they are down South.#8217;40 #8216;Get over it,#8217; Minister Deb Franklin said with a flash of her hands after the 8 o'clock service at Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church. Buttigieg is devout. The morning's soloist sang, #8216;Don't give up on God / This ain't the time to do it anyway, y'all,#8217; and I thought, not for the first time that weekend, how like a bloc the black vote seems from a distance and how far across the political spectrum the black vote stretches when viewed up close.41 Marla Godette, the dynamic organizer of the very emotional annual Martin Luther King Jr. America's Sunday Supper, held in a large downtown hotel, said she did not like to be told that because she is black, she ought to vote in a certain way. #8216;Quit worrying about who I am and come help me.#8217;42 It's something of a manipulation to complain that the black vote is being taken for granted, I said, when everyone has been saying that no one is going to win without it, that the Democrats can't choose someone black voters will stay home on, as many did with Hillary Clinton. But then black voters are so morally opposed to Agent Orange's gangsterism, have so had enough of Republican Party collusion that the split between moderate and progressive factions in the Democratic Party was maybe not as meaningful to them as the question that cannot yet be answered: Who can win? I wondered if the longing for community radiated by every speaker at the supper wasn't gratified by the black vote being a bloc vote once the primaries are over. Black people for the most part do not vote against their own interests—although not voting is a form of voting for the wrong side. Voter suppression is another matter.43 At this point, Godette's jovial husband confessed that he was a Republican. He thought Trump would win a second term. I was shocked. We'd been having such a good time.44 The next morning, I tiptoed down the stairs of my landmark inn. On the way out of town, along the two-lane highway, we passed a white kid, hooded up and puffing through the snow along the blue side of the road. His job had to be up ahead, in one of the Pizza Huts or gas stations in the early-shift lights. In 2018 unemployment was just 3.2 percent in Indiana and 3.7percent among blacks there. But much of it may be underemployment, without benefits, for instance. My Caribbean taxi driver of a certain age had scarcely mumbled a whole sentence to me over the weekend. Finally he relented and became the only black person I'd met in South Bend who supported Joe Biden. #8216;Obama worked with him.#8217; Most of my cousins are for either Elizabeth Warren or Amy Klobuchar. I decided I'd be the queer cousin for Pete Buttigieg.45 [ 1]:            <url normalizedValue=""http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy"">http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">NEWSTX-TNTN103220158107475316175776100138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:5Y56-3XK1-JCMN-Y01V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">484287</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""4739""/><timeReceived>11:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Nation Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=""07"" month=""02"" year=""2020""><dateText>February 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""company""><classificationItem score=""58""><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""industry""><classificationItem score=""58""><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""58""><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=""58""><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

From my old days in New York City, I can attest to how the loss of cheap housing led directly to a rise in homelessness.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">This post deals with another layer of this problem, that many  live in dilapidated, dangerous rentals, unable to afford to move and lacking any way to get the landlord to fix the property. The communist city of New York at least has a 311 line where tenants can report a lack of heating (below a certain temperature in the winter) and IIRC water and the city does get on those cases pretty quickly. But nationally, that sort of thing is lacking.</p><p>For instance, in Birmingham, the regular short cut to the airport (a mere 5 minute drive from a tony area) had a fallen down house and ones near it that were in similarly bad shape. One driver told me he'd repeatedly called the city to get the collapsed house razed. I was going to have the driver stop for a second and take a picture and write this up on my blog, since this house had fallen down months ago and the site still had not been cleared. The driver told me he had already been on this (!!!) and had called the city repeatedly about it. When he finally was able to reach a nominally responsible person, he was told no one would schedule a removal till someone in the neighborhood filed a complaint. We discussed at lenght that the pretense that no one had complained was clearly bogus; someone was looking for a payoff.</p><p>By Fran Quigley, who directs the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University McKinney School of Law. Originally published at <url normalizedValue=""https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/housing-crisis-kills"">Common Dreams</url></p><p>Last week, my students and I worked with several unhoused persons who had been recently living in dangerous, unhealthy apartments or homes in our community of Indianapolis. One, a young mother of a toddler with another baby soon on the way, had just left a home where eight people across three generations were living. The house had no central heat, so space heaters were the only source of warmth during a month when the temperature dipped below zero for several days. Those heaters and everything else electrical in the house were linked to a complex web of extension cords connected to a solitary working outlet.</p><p>On Thursday, we were in court with another client, a mother of four young children still living in a house where mold is spreading, windows are nailed shut, and electrical wires are exposed. This summer, a decrepit air conditioner unit overheated to the point where it nearly caught fire. The landlord repeatedly ignored the mom's requests for repairs, claiming she accepted the home 'as is'—a disclaimer that may be allowed with used car purchases but is explicitly illegal in rental housing. When the landlord finally did take some action, it was to simply paint over the mold.</p><p>Also last week, I read that, in the Indiana city of South Bend, six children ranging in age from 17 months to 11 years old were killed when the home where they were living caught fire. <url normalizedValue=""https://www.southbendtribune.com/story/news/fire/2024/01/26/sixth-child-in-north-laporte-avenue-house-fire-dies/72368060007/"">The South Bend Tribune reports</url>  that the rental home failed a safety inspection in July after an inspector found ten separate violations, including an 'electrical problem throughout the entire home.' Demetris Smith, 10 years old; Davida Smith, 9 years old; Deontay Smith, 5 years old; D'Angelo Smith, 4 years old; and Faith Smith, 17 months old, all perished. Angel Smith, 11 years old, survived for a few days before dying last week in Riley Children's Hospital here in Indianapolis. Angel's death officially made it the most deadly fire in the city's history.</p><p>Almost every person we speak with in eviction court, along with virtually every unhoused person we connect with, has been or still is living in housing that is seriously unhealthy and often dangerous. Health departments struggle to regulate housing codes. The handful of lawyers available to file claims against landlords are overwhelmed with their current docket, constantly having to turn away tenants who endure horrible conditions.</p><p>We do our work in Indiana. Our state is certainly not alone in our struggle to ensure decent housing conditions, but we are among those who do the least to protect tenants. The Greater Indianapolis Multifaith Alliance told the stories of some Indiana renters in <url normalizedValue=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX2qaYDH6mA"">this short video</url> ; our student Jacob Purcell wrote a detailed analysis of the housing conditions crisis in a comprehensive report <url normalizedValue=""https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/practice/clinics/health-human-rights.html"">available on our clinic web page</url> . Ko Lyn Cheang, then of the IndyStar, wrote <url normalizedValue=""https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/marion-county/2021/11/24/indianapolis-apartments-lakeside-pointe-tenants-suffered-neglect-before-fire/8725147002/"">here</url> about one of the many local investor-owned apartment complexes where tenants are forced to live in egregious conditions.</p><p>Thank goodness for all the tenant leaders and organizers, outreach workers, shelter staff, social workers, physical and mental health professionals, lawyers, advocates, and others who work every day to make the situation as tolerable as possible for as many people as possible.</p><p>But we can add the toll that indecent housing conditions takes on low-income renters to the suffering caused by housing insecurity overall. A study by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Eviction Lab at Princeton University showed <url normalizedValue=""https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2024/01/princeton-news-broadfocus-research-rent-prices-eviction-lab#:~:text=The%20study%20ultimately%20found%20that,age%2C%20race%2C%20and%20gender."">dramatic increases in mortality rates</url>  associated with evictions. 'Simply being threatened with an eviction—even when that case did not result in an eviction judgment—was associated with a 19% increase in mortality,' <url normalizedValue=""https://evictionlab.org/rising-rents-and-evictions-linked-to-premature-death/"">the researchers reported</url> . 'Receiving an eviction judgment was associated with a 40% increase in the risk of death.'</p><p>Add that startling finding on top of what we know happens post-eviction. It has long been clear that there is a <url normalizedValue=""https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2023/10/426426/homeless-people-are-16-times-more-likely-die-suddenly#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHomeless%20individuals%20die%20young%2C%20at,death%20to%20the%20homeless%20population."">hugely disproportionate death toll among unhoused people</url> . Homeless individuals die at an average age of 50 years old.</p><p>None of this comes as a surprise here: with our clients, it is easy to see the physical and mental pain caused by their housing crises. Fortunately, none have yet suffered the unimaginable tragedy that was visited on the Smith family in South Bend. But our housing crisis is definitely a life-and-death struggle, and this week a lot of people were losing that fight.</p><p>This entry was posted in <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/free-markets-and-their-discontents"">Free markets and their discontents</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/guest-post"">Guest Post</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/politics"">Politics</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/privatization"">Privatization</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/real-estate"">Real estate</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/regulations-and-regulators"">Regulations and regulators</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/social-policy"">Social policy</url> , <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/category/social-values"">Social values</url>  on <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/01/our-housing-crisis-is-literally-killing-people.html"">January 31, 2024</url>  by  <url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/author/yves-smith"">Yves Smith</url>  .</p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/01/our-housing-crisis-is-literally-killing-people.html"">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""DOC-ID"">NWTXNC-NAKE102057170670214190925876100230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">NAKE-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:6B77-KBS1-F03R-N190-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">484268</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2024-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=""1043""/><timeReceived>11:52 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Naked Capitalism</publicationName><publicationDate day=""31"" month=""01"" year=""2024""><dateText>January 31, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""publicationtype""><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=""language""><classificationItem classificationScheme=""lang.english""><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""licensor.indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""licensor.subject""><classificationItem><className>Free markets and their discontents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Guest Post</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privatization</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Real estate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulations and regulators</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social values</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=""indexing-terms""><classification classificationScheme=""legal""><classificationItem score=""90""><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=""90""><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDMzNTc4RDQzQUI0NDJGODhFNUIyNUFEQzVDNkRGQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVBNzBGMzM3NUY1NEExQjg1QTUxRTZCRjA1QTU1NDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=""subject""><classificationItem score=""90""><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Affordable for whom? It is not just a question from communities within the footprint of every proposed rezoning in New York City. It is a question that is being asked across the nation.  More than in any campaign in recent memory, housing has become a key topic in the 2020 presidential race, reflecting a national housing crisis spanning from megacities like New York and San Francisco to smaller urban centers like Cleveland and rural areas like Randolph County, Georgia.According to some research, home prices in 70 percent of the country are more than average household can afford. </p><p>The Pew Charitable Trust found that in 2015, 38 percent of all renter households were rent burdened, an increase of about 19 percent from 2001. In South Bend, Ind., where Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg is mayor, there are 400 homeless households. In former Mayor Mike Bloomberg's town, there are nearly 60,000 people living in homeless shelters. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, almost 7 million housing units are needed to make up for the lack of affordable housing stock in the country. Last June, the Trump administration took steps that could have a heavy impact on the future of housing, such as creating a White House Council, chaired by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, which will look at ways to reform local zoning laws that prevent the construction of multifamily housing units. Six months later, HUD proposed a revision to the Obama administration's anti-discrimination Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule; Secretary Carson proposed that rule's implementation and method be left up to local jurisdictions rather than the federal government.  Some candidates have come up with comprehensive, ambitious housing plans while others have proposed more modest responses. Housing policy experts and advocates say this is the first time in modern history that housing has become a main presidential issue and also the first time moderators asked a question about affordable housin[2]g during a nationally televised Democratic presidential debates. 'The core of the crisis is the lack of affordable housing for lower income households, and voters are interested in knowing the candidates housing plans before they make a vote,' says Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of National Low Income Housing Coalition. 'In some cities and towns, there are enough apartments or housing-but there are not enough households who can afford those housing units.'It's a multifaceted problem, and there are already federal programs in place aimed at addressing some aspects of it—although they appear to be falling short. The mix of targets and tools means the candidates' plans share broad similarities and some striking differences.'There's actually quite a bit of overlap,' says Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings. 'The first is that they acknowledge that there are people who have low incomes who can't afford housing. That's basically a national problem that everywhere in the country, there are some people who just earn so little that they can't afford to pay rent that would cover the operating costs on a basic apartment.''The second big box idea is that they need to talk about is the fact that in some places like New York and California, we haven't been building enough new housing to keep up with demand,' and most of the candidates have acknowledged that,' adds Schuetz. 'And then the third big point, is talking about racial disparities in housing markets: the past history of discrimination for things like mortgage lending and the degree of racial segregation that still exists in most cities.'Of course, comparing what the candidates propose is just one lens. Whether the ideas are legally, financially and politically viable is another key test.  With that in mind, here's a detailed look at the key housing proposals from candidates in the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary.Biden: Few specificsFor 36 years, Joe Biden served as a U.S. senator until he became Vice President in the Obama administration. During his time as Senator, Biden co-sponsored or sponsored 11 pieces of legislation related to housing and development ranging from the National Homestead Assistance Act-which allowed the HUD secretary to purchase vacant, single-family homes-to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1981 to include persons with disabilities including other measures. The Fair Housing Amendments Act, which expanded the forms of discrimination deemed violative of fair-housing laws, and enlarged the list of classes protected from housing discrimination to include the disabled. Biden in 2013. Although Biden has not released a comprehensive housing plan like his rivals Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg or Buttigieg — Biden's campaign does focus on 'investing in the middle class' through entrepreneurship and community investments.'We have spoken to almost every candidate and I am bewildered that Biden has not put out a plan yet,' says Yentel.The Biden campaign raised $61 million at last report. After retirees and law firms, the real estate industry is the third-biggest source of Biden's contributions, according to Open Secrets. Dozens of smaller contributions in increments ranging from $2.50 to $5,600 were made by several New York real-estate developers. Other contributions include $3,500 from Roger Tackeff a Boston-based developer.  Bloomberg: A vow to cut homelessnessAs mayor of the nation's largest city for 12 years, Mike Bloomberg oversaw the largest public housing authority in the country, ran a homeless shelter system under a unique local legal right to shelter and helped regulate one of the largest biggest real-estate markets in the world. That gives him a deeper track record — for praise and/or scrutiny — than any of the other candidates in the race, even the other mayors (Buttigieg, currently, and, formerly, Sanders).That record is decidedly mixed. Bloomberg rezoned 40 percent of the city, but some of those zonings prevented any increase in affordable housing. His housing plan generated lots of units (165,000) but many of them were unaffordable to the neighborhoods in which they were built. He made big promises on reducing homelessness, but cut off the supply of Section 8 and public housing to the shelters. Until late in his term, he did little for NYCHA.Bloomberg laid out his housing plan for the nation in late January. He plans on guaranteeing housing vouchers to all Americans at or below 30 percent of the area median income, which is an estimated $28,830 for a household of three; help families stay in their homes by funding emergency financial assistance; expand federal grants to cities that implement effective eviction prevention programs; and create pilot programs for tenant counseling and legal-advice services. He would also raise the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and increase the Child Tax Credit for low-income households. Mike Bloomberg For access to housing, Bloomberg plans on recruiting more landlords into the voucher system and reducing the red tape within that system. He says he will use regulation and incentives to mitigate discrimination by landlords. He will also establish navigator services to help tenants find and secure housing. Additionally, Bloomberg plans to cut the homeless population in half using existing federal resources coupled with initiatives by local governments. He wants to double federal spending on homelessness from under $3 billion to $6 billion annually. He says he will increase federal support for housing-first strategies and provide housing-search support and short-term rental assistance.  As preventative measures, he wants to expand the promotion of rapid-rehousing and permanent supportive housing, providing stability to the chronically homeless to address issues such as substance use disorder and mental-health services where needed and serving as a bridge to rental assistance. He will also integrate homeless support with critical 'wrap-around' services and expand federal grants to cities that implement effective homelessness prevention programs.In order to increase housing supply, Bloomberg plans on increasing funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and prioritizing 'new transportation funding for areas that have undertaken progressive zoning reform and reward municipalities that support affordable housing development in neighborhoods with good schools, transportation, and economic opportunity.' He will also provide funding for public housing by streamlining the Rental Assistance Demonstration program and increasing funding to the National Housing Trust Fund. Additionally, his plan will provide resources to help homeowners, building owners, and tenants for energy-saving renovations. He will also increase funding for energy retrofits and fully fund the existing Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program which helps mitigate home energy, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs costs.  For tenants, Bloomberg wants to help renters become homeowners through a pilot program targeted to assist people with down payments for new homes, provide federal matching funds to offer all residents of the 100 communities as down payment and expand access to financial services. His goal includes one million new African-American homeowners.  For local governments, Bloomberg wants streamline investments to address the housing crisis by building on President Obama's 'Strong Cities, Strong Communities' initiative by driving an interagency effort from the White House. The Obama 2011 initiative was created to give technical assistance to local governments in order to execute their economic vision and strategies through public and private partnerships.  Bloomberg, a billionaire, is financing his own campaign (to the tune of $200 million so far) and is not accepting contributions.  Buttigieg: Douglass Plan targets vacant-land potentialDecades younger than most of his presidential rivals , Pete Buttigieg came onto the campaign stage with experience as mayor of South Bend. His housing plan was released last year November along with several other plans to help middle-to low-income households by lowering child care costs, making college more affordable, lowering health care costs and furthering consumer rights protections.  Buttigieg's housing plan is similar in scope to Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's housing plans. He will invest $430 billion to create access to affordable housing for over 7 million households and to create an additional 2 million housing units through creation and preservation initiatives. He also plans on working to reform local zoning laws. He wants to also invest in homeownership and is looking to facilitate homeownership of one million low-income households.  Refoming zoning is a common theme among the Democrats. Schuetz says this is new territory for federal policy. ' Because that's really new, it's hard to say at this point that any of those are more likely to succeed or even more likely to get adopted,' she says.Another Buttigieg plan is to target redlined neighborhoods part of a comprehensive plan, known as the Douglass Plan, to mitigate racial and income in equities, particularly in communities of color. The Douglass Plan lists several initiatives ranging from criminal justice to health equity reforms. Mayor Pete Buttigieg Within the Douglass Plan, Buttigieg's housing agenda includes the 'Community Homestead Act' in which cities would apply for federal funding to operate land banks to acquire vacant properties and provide them to low-income families under a 10-year residency obligation.Schuetz notes the Douglass Plan offers more to cities like South Bend or Baltimore or Detroit where there are swathes of land with city-owned houses in certain poor conditions, but was not tailored for larger cities where vacant space is rare.It is not the first time Buttigieg has pushed to create housing. After he was elected to Mayor of South Bend in 2011, he created a task force to analyze the city's vacancy stock which identified 1,900 vacant and 1,275 abandoned properties to renovate and reuse. In a report, similar to the Douglass Plan, the task force recommended establishing a land bank to encourage neighborhood revitalization efforts such as renovating homes with violations. In response in 2013, Buttigieg launched a '1,000 Homes in a 1000 Days' initiative with a budget of $10.5 million dollars funded by HUD's Community Development Block Grant program, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and the state's Blight Elimination Program[3], a program to bring up property value through revitalization efforts.  According to HUD[4], the initiative has met with some success. The city handled 1,122 houses: 427 were repaired, 569 were demolished, 10 were deconstructed, six were set aside for repair by community development corporations, and 110 were under contract for demolition.  Despite the success, the initiative also came under criticism for displacing some families from debilitated housing, instead of fixing their homes. The South Bend city administration argued that those homes had not been occupied for over 90 days, according to South Bend Tribune[5].  Buttigieg's campaign fundraising has topped $76 million, with an estimated $932,988 from individuals connected to real estate groups, according to Open Secrets.Klobuchar: A broad if modest plan Sen. Amy Klobuchar Senator Amy Klobuchar's rise began when she became Minnesota's Hennepin County Attorney. She became the first woman elected Senator in her state in 2006 just a couple of years shy of the 2008 foreclosure crisis. At the cusp of the crisis, Klobuchar co-sponsored several Congressional measures ranging from the bills to protect mortgage applicants to an amendment to the tax code allowing some flexibility for homeowners who originally financed their mortgages through a qualified subprime loan. Since then, she has cosponsored several measures to mitigate homelessness, end discrimination against victims of domestic violence, and create easier access to the federal housing voucher program, among over 30 other housing and development bills and amendments.  Akin to the housing plans proposed by Buttigieg, Warren and Sanders, Klobuchar's housing plan is focused on creating affordable housing, mitigating homelessness and creating paths to homeownership but she focuses on tweaking several existing federal programs.  Klobuchar plans to fight housing discrimination by creating a new federal grant program for access to free legal counsel for people facing evictions; prohibiting discrimination based on income source or the blacklisting of tenants who have been evicted in the past; modifying the current Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule and restoring the Office of Fair Lending and Opportunity to monitor fair lending practices (whose authority has been reduced by the Trump administration).  For tenants, she plans on expanding rental assistance for affordable housing in rural towns by improving access to existing federal programs, and through the purchasing power of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, her administration will encourage lenders to serve rural mortgage markets. Additionally, she will expand support for affordable senior housing and direct affordable housing programs to allow retrofitting of rental housing for seniors. She also has plans for major investments in the Housing Choice Voucher pilot program, which allows families to use their vouchers in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Additionally, Klobuchar plans on tackling 'outdated' zoning policies by incentivizing cities who change their zoning policies with federal housing and infrastructure grants. As a path to prevent future evictions, she wants to create a personal savings account called 'UP Accounts' for retirement and emergencies. Under her UP Accounts plan, employers will set aside at least 50 cents per hour worked to help people 'build more than $600,000 in wealth over the course of a career.' The funds could also be accessed during emergencies that cause delayed payments for rent.  Klobuchar also plans to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit for developing affordable rental housing and investing in homeless assistance grants that provide emergency and long-term housing.  She proposes a new federal tax credit, similar to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, to encourage investment in family-owned homes in distressed neighborhoods. She also wants to build on existing programs to allow certain types of rental housing assistance to be used for homeownership expenses and also plans on proposing legislation that will expand access to capital for down payments. She also wants to allow credit bureaus to use on-time payment data from cell phone bills, utilities, and rent in calculating credit scores so it is easier to build credit.  During the first 100 days of her presidency, Klobuchar plans on strengthening Community Reinvestment Act protections, developing policies to encourage financial institutions to make loans and investment in local communities. Klobuchar also wants to focus on educating first-time homebuyers through improving education programs that especially target communities with low levels of homeownership. Klobuchar also plans on reversing the Trump Administration's proposed changes to federal housing subsidies and updating regulations for reverse mortgages, especially for seniors.  Her plan for funding some of these existing and new programs will come from raising the capital gains rate to the income tax rate for households making over $400,000, and part of her infrastructure plan, which includes plans for housing, will raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Klobuchar's campaign has raised an estimated $29 million dollars. Her campaign has raised an estimated $300,741 dollars[6] from the real estate industry ranging from a maximum of $2,800 to even one dollar[7] in donations, according to Open Secrets and the FEC.  Next to Biden's punt, Klobuchar offers the most modest plan among the major Democratic candidates.Sanders: Rent control and moreLast year in September, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion plan to mitigate the growing housing crisis across the country.Sanders plans to invest $1.48 trillion in the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund in order to create, preserve and rehabilitate permanently affordable housing units within mixed-income development. An additional $400 billion will be invested to build 2 million mixed-income social housing units also administered through the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. He also plans on investing an additional $500 million dollars in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Section 515 program, an existing rural rental housing loans program to provide affordable rental housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities.  Sanders calls for increasing funding for the Indian Housing Block Grant Program to $3 billion to build, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing in Indian country. Sanders also plans on investing $70 billion dollars in improving public housing, including to provide broadband services, and wants to repeal the Faircloth Amendment which does not allow HUD to construct new public housing units. Sen. Bernie Sanders On Section 8, Sanders plans on fully funding the rental assistance program with $410 billion dollars over the next 10 years and making it a mandatory funding program for all eligible households. He also plans on expanding and strengthening the enforcement of the Small Area Fair Market Rent rule, which reforms voucher payments to help recipients move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods.  When it comes to tenant protections, Sanders' proposal for national rent regulation would cap annual rent increases at no more than 3 percent while allowing landlords to apply for waivers if significant capital improvements are made on the property.  'Bernie Sanders has a proposal for what's essentially nationwide rent-control, which is way outside the box of anything that's been discussed before and I'm not totally clear whether that's constitutional. And [it] would be very difficult to implement,' Scheutz says.  He also plans to implement a 'just-cause' requirement for evictions. Additionally, he wants to provide $2 billion towards states and localities' 'right to counsel' programs for tenants facing evictions or foreclosure proceedings, or at risk of losing their Section 8 rental assistance.Sanders also wants to streamline the review process and direct funding towards implementing fair and inclusive zoning ordinances with a focus on communities that face gentrification. For example, he proposes to place a 25 percent 'house flipping' tax on speculators who sell a non-owner-occupied property, if the property is sold for more than it's purchase price within within years of the procurement. Another proposal from Sanders will impose a 2 percent Empty Homes tax on the property value of vacant, owned homes.  He's called for creating an independent agency to protect Section 8 renters from discriminatory landlords, fully funding the existing Fair Housing Assistance and Fair Housing Initiatives Programs at $1 billion over the next 10 years and ensuring formerly incarcerated residents are not excluded from public housing options.  Sanders wants to use 25,000 National Affordable Housing Trust Fund units in the first year for homeless households and also double the funding for the McKinney-Vento homelessness assistance grants to over $26 billion over the next five years to build permanent supportive housing. Additionally, he plans on providing $500 million in funding to states and localities for homeless outreach programs.  Sanders also wants to invest $50 billion over 10 years to provide grants for community land trusts and other shared equity homeownership models and invest an additional $15 billion to enact a 21st Century Homestead Act, which will revitalize abandoned properties and historically disadvantaged communities. For first-time home buyers, he wants to invest an additional $2 billion in USDA and an additional $6 billion in HUD to create a first-time homebuyer assistance program that will increase home ownership.  Sanders; campaign has raised the most money—$110 million—among his Democratic counterparts for the 2020 presidential elections. According to Open Secrets, almost $380,000 was donated by members of real-estate groups.Warren: Aiming to limit Wall Street's roleSen. Elizabeth Warren got her start as an academic and became an advisor to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in the 1990s. But her profile grew after she spoke as a proponent of heavier regulations on banks, especially after the role they played in the 2008 financial crisis.  Her plan revolves around four main goals: reducing rents for lower- and middle- class families; closing the racial barriers to housing that the federal government created decades ago with redlining; removing other kinds of discrimination from affordable housing; and finally, ending Wall Street's heavy influence on the housing market. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Warren's plan promises $500 billion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, with almost all of that going to the Housing Trust Fund, a HUD affordable housing production program. The leftover cash includes over $500 million going into the USDA's Rural Housing Service[8], $2.5 billion into the Indian Housing Block Grant[9] and the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant[10], and $4 billion into creating a new grant called the Middle-Class Housing Emergency Fund, designed to help fund housing construction for middle-class families specifically in areas where affordable housing is scarce.  A large portion of the $500 billion will be shouldered by private-public partnerships, which puts Warren in line with President Obama's housing policy.[11] To pay for the rest, the bill proposes a lower cap on the estate tax. Instead of taxing inheritances starting at $22 million, Warren proposes the tax start at $7 million, adding about 14,000 more multi-million dollar families to the pool of funding.Warren promises to curb cities' exclusionary zoning policies, like mandatory parking requirements[12], development fees or minimum lot sizes, which a report from 2015[13] says caused a massive increase in segregation. Warren's plan to incentivize cities to axe these policies? Dangle a $10 billion carrot. Her bill proposes a new grant program that cities can apply for in order to build infrastructure, schools or parks.  Warren also plans to dismantle the effects of redlining[14]. Warren proposes a substantial housing grant for residents in affected neighborhoods, provided that they have lived there for four-or-more years, qualify as low-income and are first-time home-buyers. The grant is aimed towards eliminating or easing the cost of a down payment on a home for minorities in disadvantaged areas. She also plans on expanding rights under the Fair Housing Act, which currently prohibits landlords from discriminating on the basis of sex or race. Her bill proposes to expand the act to include sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, and the source of one's income, like a housing voucher.When the FHA acquires single-family homes through foreclosure, it often sells those homes to private equity firms like Blackstone[15]. These firms, in turn, will hike up the price of those homes. Warren's plan aims to stop this cycle. Warren would mandate that a minimum of 75 percent of these foreclosed homes are sold directly to an individual owner/occupant, or to a community group that will rehabilitate the home and sell it directly to an owner/occupant.  Her plans for tenants focus on rent-burdened households by investing $500 billion over the next 10 years to create, preserve, and rehabilitate over 3 million affordable housing units for lower-income families and her plan would lower rents by 10 percent.  According to the FEC, Warren has raised $82 million. Her campaign has seen an estimated $255,181 dollars from members of the real-estate industry, per Open Secrets.A broader discussionAs part of the National Low Income Housing Coalition's campaign 'Our Homes, Our Voices' which started last year, the national housing advocacy group has issued a list of recommendations it hopes will guide candidates and, eventually, the next presidential administration.The NLIHC recommendations are four-fold. The first is to preserve and produce deeply affordable homes to meet the 7 million unit shortage—at a cost of at least $40 billion, plus another $50 billion dollar investment in repairing public housing. The second policy is funding rental cash assistance and the third recommendation is emergency cash assistance for households who may have faced a medical emergency and lack the funds to pay rent for a period of time. The last policy recommendation is to protect tenants from all discrimination and abuses.  Schuetz believes the housing policy discussion needs to expand even more, to discuss the environmental impact—especially in the context of climate change—of building housing in car-dependent suburbs, and to address the role of housing value in perpetuating the racial wealth gap.  'Most middle income households, their largest financial asset is the equity in their home that's been pretty detrimental to African-American and Latino households who are less likely to be homeowners or they become homeowners later in life and tend to buy houses in neighborhoods where prices don't appreciate as much,' she says. 'So the homeownership strategy has created this very large racial wealth gap, and they're sort of nibbling around the edges of that, but not actually addressing the fact that there are some limits to using homeownership. None of them have explicitly linked this to is there another way that we can help Americans save money and develop wealth that's not tied to home ownership.'Read deeper: <url normalizedValue=""https://citylimits.org/2019/04/16/on-city-streets-and-in-wild-landscapesthe-fight-for-americas-soul-in-2020is-about-land/"">https://citylimits.org/2019/04/16/on-city-streets-and-in-wild-landscapesthe-fight-for-americas-soul-in-2020is-about-land/</url> NPS, NYCHA, DVIDSHUB, SlowkingOn City Streets and in Wild Landscapes, the Fight for America's Soul in 2020 is About Land[16] The post This Year, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis[17] appeared first on City Limits[18].

Private first-class Joseph Eskenazi survived two close encounters during the Pearl Harbor attack, and we salute him for his service. Thank you so much. Happy Birthday. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME starts right now. Hey, Jesse.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, Bret. Thank you. Fox News Alert, the New York Times tonight is reporting that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware is closing in on a decision on whether to prosecute Hunter Biden. But sources close to the investigation are telling the New York Times that the U.S. attorney is not going to go big. Not only are they not going to go after the Big Guy, but they're not looking into any of Hunter's foreign schemes. If he does prosecute at all, it's going to be on a nickel and dime tax charge.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">According to the Times, it's for filing late returns, and maybe claiming a deduction Hunter wasn't entitled to. He's also considering charging Hunter with lying on a gun application. And if this is the case, then the president's right, no one Fs with the Biden.</p><p>But keep in mind, this was leaked to the New York Times probably by Hunter's team. And it's probably being used to box in the U.S. Attorney provide talking points to Democrats in the media and lower expectations for House Republican investigators.</p><p>And another Fox News Alert, Biden was just caught again with even more highly classified documents. NBC News is now reporting Biden's aides uncovered at least one additional batch of classified documents, a location separates from his DC office. Sources say aides have been sifting through documents stored at multiple locations. Joe only goes to Delaware, so where exactly are these locations? Are they looking into the dumpster that Hunter threw his gun in and blamed the Mexicans? Are they looking into the beach house that Biden is building a wall around?</p><p>Don't tell us Joe stuffed his documents in the Georgetown office. You know the place where the Big Guy and Hunter shared keys with a Chinese communist named Gong Dong. Remember that highly secured building where Hunter was bringing strippers and crackheads, that'd be pretty surprising, right? Wouldn't be the first time though Joe has been surprised by all of this. The binder woman says it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How can anyone be that irresponsible? Isn't that what this president says about mishandling classified documents?</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The president spoke to this personally. He spoke to this personally and he again, he believes that classified documents and information should be taken seriously. He takes them seriously. And he was surprised to learn by any records.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So, did Joe just accidentally stuff his pockets full of intelligence reports on Iran, Great Britain and Ukraine as he was walking out of the White House in 2017. Right after he spent the last week of his vice presidency in Ukraine. While no one really cares on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Second to talk about the classified documents found President Biden's think-tank</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No evidence of deliberate intent, or obstruction of justice as we see in the case of Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that poses a national security threat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because I don't think so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have any comment on President Biden keeping classified documents.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: She's eating a cookie. But there's a lot more to the story than meets the eye. It's not like Joe's personal lawyers were grabbing their coats from the closet and boom, what do you know, box of documents labeled top secret just fell on top? Joe's lawyers were there to pack? Why is President Biden closing down the Penn Biden Center in the middle of his presidency? And why did he send lawyers to pack boxes instead of staff? If I'm closing down my office, I'm sending Johnny (ph), I'm not paying a lawyer 1200 an hour to carry boxes. Johnny (ph) will do it for free.</p><p>But the Washington Post has an answer and they say, it's unclear. It wasn't just first year lawyers packing Joe's office either. The lawyer who they say found the documents is Dana Remus, does she look like she can carry boxes. Joe's so woke, he's having women help them move now. But who is Dana Remus. She was the one responsible for all of Obama's records. Her job was to literally keep these documents in check and report straight back to the persnickety librarians over at the National Archives.</p><p>Obama liked her so much that he even officiated her wedding. Do you realize how many favors you have to do to have Obama officiate your wedding? Then when Joe runs, she becomes Joe's campaign lawyer. He gets elected. She becomes Chief White House Counsel. But a month before these documents are discovered, Dana Remus steps down and becomes legal partner at Covington and Burling, where she becomes Joe's private attorney and then she just happens to find Joe's secret stash of documents a week before the midterms. And the first person she calls is the librarian who got Trump in trouble. And the librarian suddenly has no comment, the librarian who loves Barack,</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we were fortunate that President Obama, in his open government initiative recognized the importance of good record keeping. And we were just dancing in the streets when we got that attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Is this team Obama trying to set Joe up so that he bows out and Newsom moves in? Right. She just found the documents at the Penn Biden Center, the place where Joe had at least 10 of his White House staff members working out of. People like Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel Emanuel, who was in-charge of the Penn Biden Center. Tony Blinken, Managing Director, Steven Ricchetti, the guy meeting behind closed doors with Min Madoff months before he donated 70 million to the Dems. What were they managing there?</p><p>Well, Hunter called the Penn Biden Center, the Clinton Global Initiative without the fundraising. So, who was fundraising for all this and paying all of Joe's buddies? The Chinese were. As soon as Penn Biden Center opened, the Chinese quadrupled its donations to the University of Pennsylvania pouring in at least 55 million. Who were some of these Chinese donors? One of Joe's mega donors came from a Chinese shell company called the Nice Famous Corporation. We wish you were kidding. Did totally not a bribe LLC give Joe money too? It wouldn't surprise us. But maybe it's surprised Joe.</p><p>Let's bring in Dan Bongino, host of Unfiltered on Saturday nights. So, more documents are being discovered, Dan. I have a feeling this might not be the last batch.</p><p>DAN BONGINO, HOST, UNFILTERED: No, probably not. And you hit on something really interesting there in your monologue. I've been covering on my podcasts here for a while. I'm not trying to take credit for your idea, please, in any way. But if you're a listener to the show, you know, I've hit on this, right. Joe Biden, it was a useful tool for the Democrats to get rid of Donald Trump because they had Bernie Sanders and these other lunatics running last time. So, they figured that this bowl of oatmeal would be better than this socialist communist, right. So, let's use them.</p><p>Now. I said the minute Joe Biden, I've said this on my show probably 100 times decides he's going to run again. And then the Democrats think they have better options out there. The Democrats are going to throw him under the bus like they threw him under the bus to push him aside when Hillary wanted to run. So, I don't know. But I think your monologue, I'm not saying, I'm just saying as my friends in Queens used to say, you may kind of hit on something right there. I don't know. We'll see where that goes. But let me just throw in one more point here.</p><p>Don't - having said all that, don't discount this guy and throw him in the garbage either because he's the single luckiest human being on planet earth. He has been caught lying about having three degrees being the outstanding student, being at the top of his class, having Angelo (ph) from Amtrak tell him he's a million-mile member, getting arrested with Nelson Mandela, having Puerto Rican heritage, having Jewish heritage--</p><p>WATTERS: Italian heritage.</p><p>BONGINO: Having corn pop, rub his legs in the pool, having Italian heritage. The guy has been caught plagiarizing his speech by Neil Kinnock. That guy's son turned over a laptop performing UFC type maneuvers with hookers overseas while smoking crack in a deprivation tank. The guy's business partner went on Fox News and said he's the Big Guy and a potential international influence scandal for his last name. And he's still sitting at the White House. So, don't count this guy out.</p><p>WATTERS: I agree. I agree. He's Teflon so far. And he can lie like that. And then he says, yes, I never knew I had classified docs at my center. And the media goes, you know what, you're right. It's just an honest mistake. Trump, he's the bad guy. He was selling nuclear secrets out of his Palm Beach state. This guy, you know what, it's not suspicious at all. He's not suspicious, Dan, but he's taking a million dollar a year salary from the Chinese that they launder through the Penn Biden Center. But Biden has never even gone to because he doesn't even know what's in the closet.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, I heard he got paid something like $540,000 a year for two years for this gig for nine appearances and 300,000 another year. So, you're telling me this guy got paid what $30,000 to $40,000 in appearance like what was he doing in these appearances, man? I mean, seriously, what's he giving you like some words of wisdom were you (inaudible) books or is he writing courses. No, but listen this guy, the big demarcation points between him and Trump that the media conveniently leaves out of every narrative.</p><p>When they say all, you know, Trump obstructed. Trump, that's an allegation. He's never been charged with that. And secondly, the reason they say he obstructed is because Trump had a legitimate claim. He said, hey, I was the president. I declassified it. Therefore, there's a dispute over the status of the document. Joe Biden doesn't have any of those claims. The vice president can't declassify jack squat and jack left town, so the media people again, shocker, are lying, which they always.</p><p>WATTERS: Another difference Trump had the documents for a year and a half, Biden had them for six in a place next to a steakhouse in Washington, DC.</p><p>BONGINO: The janitor was probably in there, cleaning up, reading things, taken. screenshots of them, sending them to the Chinese Communist Party. Who knows.</p><p>WATTERS: Let's do a background check on the custodial staff at the Penn Biden Center. Thanks very much. Dan Bongino, check him out, Saturday nights at 9. So, why did every flight in America get canceled this morning? PRIMETIME investigation, next.</p><p>WATTERS: There's a lot of people in the White House, so you don't really hear much about Sure, we want to hear from the Attorney General, Secretary of Defense or Homeland Security guy. But the Department of Interior, Agriculture, Transportation, I'm already bored. They're important jobs. But if they're on camera, there's a problem. Can you name Clinton's Secretary of Transportation? What about Bush's or Obama's or Trump's? You don't know their names because you don't have to. But I bet you know Biden's, Mayor Pete, who's on TV more than Fauci.</p><p>When the guy was running for president, nobody knew who he was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who's this guy?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John Lennon?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John Lennon?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he from the Beatles.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tom Hanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wait, is that you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm like I don't know who that is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do we lookalike?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tiny bit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Now they know him. Every time there's a travel catastrophe, Pete's on TV. It started with the supply chain. When we were getting worried, we weren't going to be able to get Christmas presents in time. Pete told us to shop early.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: I think there's always been two kinds of Christmas shoppers. There's the ones who have all their list completed by Halloween. And then there's people like me who show up at the mall on Christmas Eve. If you're in that latter bucket, obviously there's going to be more challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: When flights were delayed last summer because of the pilot shortage. The vax mandate, Pete clapped. And when rail unions were about to strike, Pete was in Portugal, getting tan. When a snowstorm crippled the country, thousands of flights were canceled. Pete said he'd get you a refund. Did you get your refund yet? I don't think you did.</p><p>Today, every flight in America was canceled, every flight. This time Pete couldn't blame the airlines or the weather. The FAA's computers went down and thousands of us were stranded. But don't worry, Pete called Biden.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I just spoke with Buttigieg, they don't know what the cause is. But I was on the phone with him for about 10 minutes. Told them to report directly to me when they find out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So, Pete called the president to tell him he doesn't know what happened. And the conversation lasted 10 minutes. I'm really glad. Biden shared that with us. But it doesn't matter if America grounds more flights and we did since 9/11. Biden still loves Pete.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Does President Biden have confidence in Transportation Secretary Buttigieg?</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.</p><p>DOOCY: Why?</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE: Because Secretary Buttigieg is a - he respects the secretary and the work that he has been doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: OK, so our very own stupid son of a bitch stumped her. Let's see if she can answer an easier question like, What day is today?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE: Alright. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Monday. OK. Monday. See? That is how my week is going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Every week's a tough week for that lady. So, the computers went down and thousands of flights were just gone. We're going to blame the Russians, right?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any indication that there was a cyber-attack involved?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: There's been no direct evidence or indication of that. But we are also not going to rule that out until we have a clearer and better understanding what's taking place. But again, no indication of that at this time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: I'm shocked, Democrats didn't blame the Russians. I mean, that was a layup. But their computers are ancient. Everybody knows this. If one guy trips over a telephone cord, the whole thing goes down. Why hasn't Pete been banging the table demanding new computers. Pete, can we get a refund since this one's on you?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Should the government be reimbursing people who missed flights and now have to take hotels about their expenses as they are required to do by you when it's the airline's fault?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, we're not-for-profit companies selling tickets that the way an airline is. Our responsibility is to make sure that everybody is safe and we're always going to air on the side of safety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe this is Pete's way of making us bike. I'm not shocked this is happening. When he was mayor in Indiana, he couldn't even figure out how to fill the potholes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: His hometown South Bend Tribune wrote in 2018 of major issues with potholes. It's the worst that area of repair shops can remember and well over 10 years with lines of vehicles awaiting repair for pothole related damages nearly every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Pete got the job in the cabinet because he dropped out, endorsed Joe over Bernie and likes to talk about racism. The guy was on a racist bridge tour while the FAA computers crapped out. And instead of fixing the computer system, they renamed it. It's called No Tam, which used to stand for Notices to Airmen. But that's not inclusive. Air women must have been offended or air they. And so, Pete changed it to notices to air mission and patted himself on the back job well done. And then it all fell apart.</p><p>What about the billions in funding that the FAA gets? What did they use that money for? Did they upgrade anything? Well, we took a look at Biden's little infrastructure bill. And they sent a lot of cash to the FAA. But it wasn't really clear if any of that was used for computers, we do know, they're using 20 million for racial equity. And they set aside 15 billion in discretionary funding to help promote environmental justice. And now, he's shaking down Congress for even more cash.</p><p>He'll probably use it to buy the flight attendants' gender-neutral luggage, don't tell Sticky Fingers Sammy that. We got our hands on footage from an FAA Summit. And they're brainstorming how to make people see that inclusion is more important than safety.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's interesting, because safety is separate from the mission, but it's more integral to any mission, to any technical goal, any objective than diversity and equity and inclusion in particular. So, how do we make them more the same? How do we show that important, particularly with inclusion?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Integral. They also talked about how it's easier to fly a plane, if you can tell your co-pilot, you're gay.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we have inclusive language, and everybody is using the inclusive language, oh, I'm going to be comfortable. And yes, I am. I am part of the LGBTQ. And I feel absolutely great about bringing my ideas and once I'm free of having to hide and do all these things. Boy, my creativity can be absolutely put into work and come up with those ideas to solve problems and make aerospace, the safest in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: They want the cockpit to be a safe space. And this is just the first step.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The idea of using pronouns and everybody representing who they want to be. And I think that's really the first step that we're looking at all of the language that is used on an everyday basis, and seeing if it is holding any patriarchal views or excluding people, or setting up a specific standard of participants that it shouldn't be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Just stop people from fighting, and coach and take off on time. That's really all we want. So, they have the money to hire a team to sniff out patriarchal views, but can't buy new computers. The FAA's inclusion task force isn't messing around if you use the wrong pronoun or worse, joke about pronouns. You might be driving a bus next month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Regarding pronouns, who would make a lot of jokes about it such as like, well, I identify as a strawberry, so call me a strawberry now, which was just not appropriate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Just fly the plane. I don't care how my pilot identifies, just identify on time. Let's bring it over to a former White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, whose flight was also canceled today. So, we're glad she could join us tonight. So, how was the airport. No one was knocking back drinks and trying to cold caulk the flight attendants.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR: They were trying but there was no transparency and accountability as usual. That was the 5:37 AM flight at Little Rock to DCA this morning. We got lucky because we eventually came. But Jesse look, we have to update Pete Buttigieg's resume. The rap on Buttigieg including from his Democratic rival, Joe Biden is that you've just been mayor of South BendIndiana, less than 100,000 people that Biden had insulted Buttigieg by saying his biggest infrastructure accomplishment was that he put decorative lighting in the rivers and on the pavements, really a low blow.</p><p>Now Pete Buttigieg has a ton of experience. He's presided over a supply chain crisis, a railroad strike, ships and containers stuck in our oceans, rising gas prices, of course, today, the first national ground hold of flights since 9/11, when Pete Buttigieg was 19-years-old. So, he does have the experience. The man speaks eight languages, none of which make any sense to we, the flying public.</p><p>And his FAA, his Department of Transportation has 58,000 employees, and a budget in 2023, Jesse of $23.5 billion. Folks, women out there, ladies if I gave you $1,000 more a week or a month and two extra people to help you how different your life would be. This guy's got 50,000 people and $23.5 billion and can't deliver a transportation system that is modern, that is efficient, that is safe, that is reliable.</p><p>The only person that seems to have got his or her luggage on time late last year was Sam Britton at the Department of Energy and it wasn't his luggage. He was stealing it from other people. So, look, I think this is part and parcel of the Biden Administration, Jesse where they don't tell you the truth. They don't inform you. We didn't know what was going on until we got to the gate. How is there not an alert? If somebody uses the wrong word, we get an alert right away. There is no alert till we actually add our gate. And then of course, no good answers even including tonight. Is it a cyber- attack? Is it Russia? Is it antiquated? So, we need - that air traffic control system was built for 100,000 annual flights a year, we have about a billion now.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, if you don't get your luggage stolen, you can't take off on time. Kellyanne Conway, I'm glad you made it though. No delay is on PRIMETIME. Thank you.</p><p>CONWAY: Never. Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Up next, a man who's been on the inside of Mexico's deadliest drug cartel.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>WATTERS: That's what Mexico looks like right now. Cartels are waging war all over the place. Migrants flooding in. The drugs, it's crazy. What's our president doing? Well, he is wrapping up the three amigo summit yesterday, cutting deals on climate change. So, what about fentanyl? Well, Joe only mentioned it twice and here's what he said about the cartels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Right now, the cartels make a lot of money which they use for drug trafficking as well. People go through -- may make it through jungles and a long journey to the -- to the -- to the border, and many are victimized not only in terms of what they have to pay but victimized physically in other ways. And so, we're trying to make it easier for people to get here, opening up the capacity to get here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So, Joe's plan to stop the cartels is an app that makes it easier for migrants to come to America. Maybe it's me but that doesn't really feel like that's enough because cartel violence is out of control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER ZEIHAN, GEOPOLITICAL ANALYST: Jalisco New Generation, they are led by a former Mexican military officer who thinks that rather than don't (BLEEP) where you sleep so that the people is on your side. Whenever you move into a town you shoot it up. You do kick over the lady. You do take her purse. You make the people scared of you. That's the point of this.</p><p>All of the other cartels control the access points to the United States. But Jalisco New Generation now is challenging every single one of them trying to breakthrough. And if they do and they bring their business acumen, if you will, north of the border, they're going to start killing white chicks named Sheila in Phoenix.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: But as violent as the cartels are, it's their product that's deadly. Fentanyl, far and away number one killer of U.S. adults. Investigative journalist Lewis saw a fentanyl lab firsthand when he went inside the Sinaloa cartel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUIS CHAPARRO, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: I met a man who was introduced as one of the most prepared cooks inside the Sinaloa cartel. The house was almost in complete darkness and he had several packages of M30s on the wooden table.</p><p>UNKNOWN (through translation): We changed from heroin to fentanyl because of the profitability with a small quantity of fentanyl we can do a lot.</p><p>CHAPARRO: When the time came to pour the fentanyl powder into the mix of acetone, blue colorant and some other stuff, the cook asked me to get as far back as I could to avoid an overdose. It turns out, the helper was just recently out from the hospital after accidently having inhaled some of the powder while cooking. He immediately passed out and was in coma.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Journalist and producer Luis Chaparro is with us now. So, do you agree, Luis, with our friend Peter Zeihan who was on Rogan who says that the cartels are coming to America?</p><p>CHAPARRO: Hey, Jesse. What I do think and do know is that cartels already operate in the U.S. They have managed to get strong links in the U.S. with the usual U.S. citizens. So, they are operating inside the U.S.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah. I'm just worried about the violence that we're seeing on the screen and the kidnappings and some of the bloodthirsty tactics. I do not want to see that in the United States. So, what is the United States government doing if anything about the cartels and are we working with Mexican drug cartels?</p><p>CHAPARRO: I don't think the U.S. is actually doing anything to stop this from happening, but maybe probably allowing more guns to go into Mexico to even make it worse. And, I mean, that's a tough question because I know that for a fact the CIA has been collaborating with drug cartels without them very probably not even knowing they are being part of a covert operation.</p><p>WATTERS: Ooh. So, we have covert ops down there and the cartels have no idea they are being manipulated. What is it like inside one of these drug labs?</p><p>CHAPARRO: Well, these drug labs in Sinaloa are pretty much small set-ups inside regular houses on nice neighborhoods, like the one we're seeing right now on screen, but they can't produce millions and millions of dollars of blue pills who are basically fake Percocet's filled with fentanyl.</p><p>WATTERS: Now, Donald Trump wanted to knock out some of these cartel labs with missile strikes or drone strikes. Do you think that would be effective?</p><p>CHAPARRO: I really don't think so. I think this is an issue that needs to be addressed from a policy or not from an attack or a drug, you know, like policy in both sides of the border.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Well, as you know, most of the appetite for these drugs is coming from Gutfeld. So, I'm going to get Gutfeld to go straight and maybe that could solve the cartel violence. Listen, you are a brave man. Thanks for joining us and keep up the good work.</p><p>CHAPARRO: Thank you very much, Jesse. Thanks a lot.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought liberals wanted to save the whales. It turns out they're killing them.</p><p>WATTERS: The whole state of California is in the middle of one of the worst rain storms on record. And one thing's for sure, celebrities are the hardest hit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELLEN DEGENERES, COMEDIAN: Be nicer to mother nature. Mother nature is not happy with us. (Inaudible). Stay safe, everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Did you hear that? It's raining because mother nature is angry. And you don't like it when mother nature gets angry. That's what primitive people did for centuries, you know, throw something into a volcano to appease the weather gods? But the fact none of these celebrities consider is the climate is doing better than we think.</p><p>That hole in the ozone layer everybody was so worried about, it's set to be entirely healed in just a few years. And the Great Barrier Reef which we were told was going to die is now making a comeback. See, we're not going extinct. We can do this people.</p><p>The good news is bad news for Democrats because they can't make money off it. You can't save the climate if the climate doesn't need saving. The problem is sometimes these projects do more harm than good, just look at the whales. The last month, six whales have all washed up dead on the Jersey Shore.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: This is what happens when you start surveying. Surveying for ocean wind projects (inaudible) absolutely destroying our area.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Did they O.D. on fentanyl? Were they whacked by whoever got mini Madoff's cohorts? Something unusual is happening to these whales. Maybe this has something to do with it. New jersey is actively preparing to build massive wind farms right off the coast. And the whales are paying the price probably.</p><p>These experts are -- so these projects are killing these whales and they haven't even broken ground yet. I mean, they're just doings surveys. This whale was actually buried in Atlantic City. But believe me, it's a whole lot better than how we used to do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: It had been so long since a whale had washed up in Lane County. Nobody could remember how to get rid of one. So, dynamite it was. Some 20 cases or a half ton of it. The hope was that the long-dead Pacific gray whale would be almost disintegrated by the blast and that any small pieces still around after the explosion would be taken care of by seagulls and other scavengers.</p><p>Well, I'm confident that it will work. The only thing is we're not sure just exactly how much explosives it will take to disintegrate this.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Not only are these windmills killing the whales, they are eyesores. And PRIMETIME is hearing these babies have enough raw power to knock Chris Christie right off his chair at the beach. Mike Davis is an ocean advocate and member of the New Jersey group Protect Our Coast.</p><p>Mike, we're hearing these things are going to be a thousand feet tall. You're going to be able to see them. I think we have an artistic rendition of what they are going to look like at the Jersey Shore, if you guys can put that up on the screen.</p><p>I mean, you're not going to be basking into the beautiful New Jersey coast. You're going to be able to see these monsters as you're slathering on sunscreen. What are the effects going to be?</p><p>MIKE DAVIS, PROTECT OUR COAST NJ: Well, yeah. I think, Jesse, thanks for having me on, first of all and thanks for your coverage of this story. It's an important one. And we're down here in Atlantic City right where they buried that whale on Monday or Sunday after it washed up on Saturday.</p><p>The harms with these projects and the costs are limitless and it's really hard to find any benefits at all. We're looking -- it's not a good idea, I don't think, in anybody's mind to pave the ocean floor from Massachusetts out around Long Island, all the way down the Jersey coast to Carolina. I mean, pave the ocean floor and then embed 90-storey wind turbines off the coast.</p><p>Like you said, they'll be visible but the aesthetics is the least of it. You know what, there is no reason to kill whole species of protected animals to do that. As you mentioned, we had -- we've had six whales. Six protected whales wash up in a month. The industrial wind companies are out there pounding the sea bed with sonar, with geothermal and geo technical sonar that confuses the whales.</p><p>They operate on the same frequency as the whales and it separates the moms from the baby whales. The whales can wander into ship traffic and, you know, here we are. Six have washed up in a month's period of time. Your producer sent me a release from Governor Murphy talking today about the wind port they are building and how important it was.</p><p>We signed another client. I think they are Norwegian. They might be Danish. I'm not sure -- as a tenant in a wind port in (inaudible) which is on the other side of the state. Where is the announcement about the investigation for these six whales that washed up dead over the last month? Thirty-three days, it's unprecedented.</p><p>So, there needs to be an investigation. There needs to be a ceasing of operations out there in the ocean. And it needs to be a stopping of the permitting and of the solicitation of new power and new lease sales in the Atlantic until we find some answers.</p><p>And if we find the answers that say this is harmful, which it clearly is, common sense would tell you that's what killed these whales. That's the only thing going on out there right now. We've had, you know, commercial fishing and we've had recreational fishing going on for generations if not centuries here.</p><p>WATTERS: yeah.</p><p>DAVIS: And, you know, now we are doing this and we have dead whales washing up.</p><p>WATTERS: I know. Well, we're going to talk to Governor Murphy about this and, you know, if you're watching at home, contact the governor, contact his office. See if we can slow this thing down because, you know, kidding around, a little bit about the eyesore, I mean, this thing is just running roughshod over marine life and it's no good off the Jersey Shore. Thank you very much.</p><p>DAVIS: Correct.</p><p>WATTERS: Mike, stay warm out there and keep up the good work.</p><p>DAVIS: Thanks, Jesse. And thanks for your attention to this matter.</p><p>WATTERS: It turns out, New York City's migrants don't like our cooking.</p><p>WATTERS: When you are a guest in somebody's home, you live by their rules. You don't take your shoes off at the door or, you know. You have to do it. You have to stick to their curfew. Most importantly, you eat what they serve you no matter how bad the food is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEVY CHASE, ACTOR: Look at that.</p><p>MIRIAM FLYNN, ACTOR: Sorry.</p><p>RANDY QUAID, ACTOR: Why you crying?</p><p>FLYNN: I told you we put it in too early.</p><p>CHASE: It's just a little dry. It's fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: The New York City's new migrant population doesn't seem to be getting the memo. Since the shelters are full, illegals are being housed in fancy hotels like this one called ""The Row."" It's right over here in Time Square. Room back there, it's like $500. Some of the migrants seem to be enjoying themselves. This is a picture of one of the rooms, trashed after a World Cup party.</p><p>The NYPD says the hotels become a hot bed for drugs, fights, domestic violence since the migrants started staying there in October. And even worse, they hate our cooking. Tax payers buying the migrant's meals and they're just throwing the food out. Here are some garbage bags full of full perfectly good sandwiches. They just toss them out instead of eating the sandwiches we're paying for.</p><p>They're cooking their own dinners on hot plates, which is a fire hazard. I mean, we know nutrition here in the state isn't really the healthiest, but not even a little gratitude. Jimmy Failla is a Fox Across America host who joins us now.</p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, FOX NEWS HOST: Nailed it. Congrats.</p><p>WATTERS: Not Failla, Failla.</p><p>FAILLA: I lost 20 bucks to Allison (ph) right there. The box landing on that one.</p><p>WATTERS: They are not eating our sandwiches.</p><p>FAILLA: I know. It's insane. First of all, just answer this honestly. Did you have me on to tell me it's okay to throw back food from time to time? Is that what this is?</p><p>WATTERS: This is an intervention.</p><p>FAILLA: Everybody here on the country needs to understand, if you're shopping for a hotel in like a liberal city, Airbnb actually means border and Biden. It doesn't mean what you used to with meaning. This is insane. Like if you wanted to talk in a practical level, not even the fact that they're sending back the food.</p><p>The fact that they're even in a hotel. We live in New York; we have thousands of homeless veterans. So, if you fought for this country, you're on the streets, but if you snuck in, you're in the suites. That doesn't (inaudible).</p><p>WATTERS: $500, Jimmy. DO you spend $500 on hotels? That's like on the high end of (inaudible).</p><p>FAILLA: I mean, when I was younger, I'd pay that for the woman to meet me for the -- stick with me Watters. Come on, it's a family program. No, it's ridiculous, dude! And if you look at the rooms, they are wrecked. They're trashing the rooms.</p><p>WATTERS: It's like they're rockstars.</p><p>FAILLA: But again, to your point of your intro, who are these finicky migrants? They don't want to talk about like the rules of a guest. I want the rules your home.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah. They're like looking to somebody like, oh, does this have mayo? Oh, this has mayo.</p><p>FAILLA: Like, you're telling me migrants are now yelping the hospitality? Like, no, I don't get relocated there.</p><p>WATTERS: Should we be giving them tacos, something culturally appropriate?</p><p>FAILLA: I think that's the argument here. But the point is, if you broke the law to get into the country, like, you have renounced rights, yeah. I didn't get a second dinner at my house and I was there legally. Come on, man</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Jimmy, maybe you can burn something down with a hot plate with a $500 in that hotel. You've done worse. Thank you so much.</p><p>And so, a lot of you have been texting me about last night's window or lack thereof. And here is Bethany from St. Paul, Minnesota. ""I was disappointed in last night's ""Watters Window."" You can't promise me something that juicy and then withhold it. Unless you're Adam Schiff. Who by the way had nothing.""</p><p>Well, call me pencil neck because I had nothing yesterday. And it's an inside joke because I usually don't have a window and I come up with on the spot. And the producers are in my ear doing like, what's your window, 90 seconds to the window. And I have nothing that I have to share with the audience.</p><p>So, half that stuff is on the fly and last time I faked it. I faked a window. How many windows have I faked? I can't tell you. Let's do some texts. Carolyn from Connecticut, ""Why hasn't the DOJ leaked the photo yet with Biden's files laying on the floor?"" Why haven't we got that spread out classified document shot we got from Mar-a-Lago? I'm waiting.</p><p>Skip from Pittsburgh, ""I wonder if that steak house next to the Biden Center has gas stoves?"" Charlie Palmers? For sure. Tim from Utah, ""I heard the planes couldn't take off because there were potholes on the tarmac."" Damn it, Pete. Fix those potholes. Briget from Veil, Colorado, ""It's 2023, Jesse. Women can certainly fly planes and carry boxes.""</p><p>They can fly planes. Would I ask a woman to help me move? Probably not, not because I'm a misogynist but for the other reason. Josh from Knoxville, Tennessee, ""Happy Monday!"" Oh, that French woman has no idea what day of the week it is. Scott from Bradenton, Florida, ""Jesse, tomato is both a fruit and the vegetable. You can trust me. My family has been growing them for almost 100 years.""</p><p>Look, it's a -- it's bi. Tomatoes are bi? I didn't know you could do that. Paul from Wyoming, ""Jesse, would you ever consider being a guest on Gutfeld?"" Has been a guest on ""GUTFELD!."" Subbed for "" GUTFELD!"" as a host. But he tapes the show right at the right time that I do this show. And it is the best that I don't have to do that damn show anymore. Much talk there. I'm Watters. This is my world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:identifier

ESEA, the federal government’s largest investment in education, was intended to promote equal access to educational opportunities. It has been reauthorized multiple times, including most recently in 2015 as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). For three decades before the passage of ESSA, education policy had gradually, albeit unevenly, become more centralized, with a push for higher (and common) standards, testing, performance-based accountability, and mandatory interventions in low-performing schools (L. D. Fusarelli &amp; Fusarelli, 2015). This push culminated in the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which represented the most substantial extension of federal power into virtually all aspects of schooling. Amidst bipartisan backlash against federal overreach and micromanagement, ESSA reversed the trend toward centralization, loosened federal oversight, and provided states and local education agencies (LEAs) substantial flexibility in redesigning systems, supports, and interventions tailored to their specific contexts.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">The purpose of this study is to examine states’ efforts to implement ESSA, with a focus on how states’ efforts impact the provision of equitable educational opportunities for all children. In doing so, we explore the following research questions:</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">How do states interpret and implement equity-related provisions of ESSA?</p><p>How have states altered implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA due to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p><p>We define equity as each individual receiving what they need in order to be successful (Radd et al., 2021). Based on the literature about state plans, for this study, we identify equity-related provisions of ESSA as the parts of the legislation that have the potential to result in individual students receiving the resources and supports they need to succeed in school. At a minimum, these resources and supports include provisions to ensure equal access to quality teachers and curriculum, multiple accountability metrics, continued annual testing of student performance by subgroup, greater fiscal transparency, and support for struggling schools.</p><p>We begin by examining preliminary research on ESSA, highlighting key provisions of the legislation including guardrails to ensure equity, as well as reporting the concerns of civil rights groups who fear that local control may exacerbate existing inequities. Using a qualitative case study approach, we provide an overview of implementation efforts and highlight states that are making significant equity-based strides as well as those that are lagging behind. Although passed in 2015, the law did not go into effect until 2017, and implementation was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as pandemic restrictions have loosened and students have returned to school, efforts to fully implement ESSA have gained steam. This study analyzes those efforts, with particular attention paid to how relaxed federal oversight may impact states’ efforts to enhance equity.</p><h>Overview of Literature</h><p>When President Obama signed ESSA into law in 2015, the federal government substantively reversed nearly three decades of gradual centralization of education policy (Saultz et al., 2017), what Meyer (1983) earlier termed fragmented centralization. Originally limited to providing supplemental funding to at-risk students, the federal role gradually evolved to one of greater oversight, accountability, and control (McGuinn, 2005). As Wong (2020) notes, “Historically, equity has been a key justification for federal involvement in K-12 education” (p. 426). Under NCLB, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) ensured that states complied with mandates by auditing state policies and requiring changes where policies did not align with the legislation (Weiss &amp; McGuinn, 2017, p. 4). Eventually, this increased involvement led to backlash among state and federal officials. In reference to restricting the federal role, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tennessee) stated, “You had Washington running 80,000 schools in 42 states. We got rid of all that” (Alexander, 2015). ESSA was touted, at least inside the beltline, as federal retrenchment and a return to state and local control.</p><h>Equity Guardrails</h><p>Although much has been written about the devolution of the federal role in education under ESSA, the law itself contains several provisions to ensure and perhaps enhance equity. These provisions include the continuance of annual testing in mathematics and language arts in Grades 3 through 8, and once at the high school level, a mandate for 95% student participation in testing, reporting of performance by subgroup, and state intervention in low-performing schools (McGuinn, 2016). According to Edgerton (2019), ESSA moved from the strict metrics of NCLB while maintaining a focus on historically underserved subgroups, such as English learners (ELs) and students with disabilities. For example, ESSA permits only 1% of students with disabilities to take alternative standardized assessments (the previous threshold under NCLB was 5%) (Edgerton, 2019). However, its continued emphasis on identity categories (class, race, gender, etc.) obscures attention to the intersectionality of these categories, for example, the disproportionate disciplinary actions leveled against Black girls (Evans-Winters et al., 2018).</p><p>Preliminary evidence of state ESSA plans indicates a movement away from student proficiency as the sole indicator of performance toward models including measures of student growth (35 states), although some states such as California permit districts to set their own performance goals and “do not specify how to weight growth, achievement, and other measures” (Edgerton, 2019, p. 15). Edgerton notes that ESSA encourages states to provide more targeted assistance to schools in need of improvement. El Moussaoui (2017) believes that ESSA will have a positive impact on minority and low-income students through its emphasis on state and local flexibility and innovation, which will allow states and districts to tailor intervention to their specific needs.</p><p>ESSA requires states to explicitly address equity concerns, such as funding disparities, in their plans (L. D. Fusarelli &amp; Ayscue, 2019). The law is supposed to highlight per school spending and resources, and expose any inequities therein, as well as incentivize districts to fund schools based on student need (Cook-Harvey et al., 2016). A recent example is the Trump administration’s loosening of federal requirements in the “supplement not supplant” rule, giving districts more flexibility in allocating Title I funding under ESSA than they had under NCLB (Wong, 2020, p. 430). Public reporting of resource inequities through fiscal transparency may encourage states and LEAs to redress those inequities. Also, states can now define teacher effectiveness on their own and develop plans for more equitable distribution of effective teachers (subject, of course, to numerous limitations including collective bargaining agreements) (Saultz et al., 2017). Knight (2019) analyzed demographic, school-level, and district-level data from the U.S. Office for Civil Rights, the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Education Comparable Wage Index and determined that teachers with the least experience are often placed in schools with the highest needs, serving larger populations of low-income and minority students (Knight, 2019).</p><p>In a report for the Learning Policy Institute, Cook-Harvey et al. (2016) identified four areas in which the law could create more equitable school systems: (1) development of higher-order thinking skills, (2) use of multiple measures to assess school performance and student progress, (3) promotion of resource equity through fiscal transparency by including actual per pupil spending on school report cards, and (4) equity-oriented, evidence-based practices for school improvement. Jochim (2016) identified three significant opportunities for state education agencies (SEAs) to improve schooling under ESSA: (1) flexibility in creating more useful assessments, (2) improved accountability systems, and (3) crafting a smarter approach to school turnaround. The researcher notes that the success of ESSA “will largely depend on how—and how much—states take advantage of their newfound flexibility” (p. 11).</p><p>The extent to which SEAs have the ability and desire to promote equity depends, in part, on how they define it. In an analysis of equity principles in all 52 approved state ESSA plans, Chu (2019) found that almost all state plans addressed equitable access to resources, such as funding and effective educators, but fewer than half addressed equity in outcomes and very few included explicit definitions of equity. Because most states focus their ESSA plans on equitable access, their role is limited to resource allocation and provision of effective educators (Chu, 2019); few, if any, are concerned with how equity is operationalized in the classroom, such as through culturally and linguistically sustaining pedagogy, leaving such decisions to LEAs. However, almost half the state plans mention the need to recruit educators of color and develop culturally responsive teachers (Chu, 2019).</p><h>Equity Concerns</h><p>Historically, tension has existed among the competing values of excellence, equity, efficiency, and choice, manifested in various calls for either centralization or decentralization. Egalite et al. (2017) note that “one of the major concerns of civil rights advocates is that the promise of decentralization offered in ESSA will lead to greater inequity in schooling” (p. 764) (see also Gerson, 2016). States can now set their own proficiency goals and create their own definitions of low-performing schools, which could dramatically impact the number of schools that are identified as low performing and in need of improvement and intervention (Duff &amp; Wohlstetter, 2019).</p><p>The actions of states after passage of NCLB, wherein several manipulated “their accountability systems by lowering their standards, making their tests easier, and/or decreasing their proficiency cut scores,” suggest that such concerns are warranted (Weiss &amp; McGuinn, 2017, p. 5). A March 2016 letter from members of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights to then-Secretary John King urged consistent oversight of ESSA implementation, pointing out the “long history of state and local decisions shortchanging vulnerable students” and the need “to ensure that the implementation of ESSA eliminates, not perpetuates, persistent inequities in our nation’s public education system.” Other civil rights groups have expressed similar concerns (Saultz et al., 2017).</p><p>ESSA allows states to customize their accountability systems, leading to greater variability among states. McGuinn (2016) asserts that accountability provisions represent the most significant change from NCLB, particularly regarding how states identify underperforming schools and what and when they need to do something about them. Although continued emphasis is placed on student performance by subgroup, states set their own timelines for subgroup improvement, which vary considerably, are long-term and distal, and thus may not convey urgency for improvement (Morita-Mullaney &amp; Singh, 2021). Wong (2020) observes, “Given the [Trump] administration’s deference, states have exhibited significant differences in their plans for meeting ESSA requirements on accountability, use of evidence-based school improvement strategies, and commitment to equity” (p. 434). Eighty percent of states failed to provide disaggregated performance data for at least one subgroup of students and approximately 40% did not provide disaggregated data by gender (Wong, 2020). Wong notes that “most states chose simply to ignore federal feedback in finalizing their plans and still received formal approval from the U.S. Department of Education” (p. 434). This finding is consistent with a political discourse analysis by Duff and Wohlstetter (2019), who found that no punitive or corrective actions were taken by the federal government against states that ignored or defied federal feedback, even when they appeared to be in noncompliance with the law. Wong concludes that “flexibility also appears to have diminished the incentive for states to take on a more active role in addressing equity issues” (p. 437).</p><p>One generally unquestioned takeaway from the passage of ESSA is reduction in federal oversight and compliance monitoring of state accountability and improvement efforts (McGuinn, 2016). Weiss and McGuinn (2016) expect that this flexibility will lead to widely divergent levels of commitment to reform, more diverse approaches to reform, and varying levels of success. For example, although ESSA emphasizes a well-rounded education, it is left up to states to define what that means. In their analysis of college and career readiness (CCR) standards in Illinois, Malin et al. (2017) found distinct differences in the vision of what constitutes CCR at the state and federal levels and concluded that such flexibility “portends wide variation in emphasis toward, and accountability for, long-standing equity issues” (p. 810). Further, in their analysis of all 52 approved state ESSA plans, Hackmann et al. (2019) found that most states identified CCR as part of their school quality or student success (SQSS) indicators in their accountability systems, but very few developed plans to address inequities, instead adopting a colorblind approach to address CCR for <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">all</emphasis> students rather than focusing on subgroups of students.</p><h>Variation in Interpretation</h><p>Unlike the “one-size-fits-all” approach of NCLB, ESSA recognizes that contextual factors play a role in how policies are interpreted and implemented at the state level (Egalite et al., 2017). Several factors influence how SEAs approach compliance with a law like ESSA, including politics, local control, and the number of districts in the state (Dahill-Brown, 2019), as well as SEA capacity and state demographics. States are influenced by politics at the federal level—for example, the election of a Republican Congress and president as ESSA plans were drafted and approved—as well as state and local politics. The governance structure dictates decision-making power and influence and may be susceptible to political changes. Four models of education governance are in use by 40 states and determine if the state school chief and state board are elected or appointed and by whom; 10 states and DC use some combination of other models (Fulton, 2011). Political will, particularly state-level partisanship, influences implementation of federal policy (Dahill-Brown &amp; Lavery, 2012).</p><p>Furthermore, if states are beholden to local control, and decision-making is mostly in the hands of the district, then whether the state is fragmented into many smaller districts or consolidated into larger districts dictates the SEA’s capacity for oversight (Dahill-Brown, 2019). Capacity, emanating from resources and knowledge, also influences an SEA’s ability to implement federal policy (Dahill-Brown &amp; Lavery, 2012). The SEA may also be aware of its own limited capacity when it comes to school improvement, which can influence the turnaround models it chooses. VanGronigen and Meyers (2019) found that only five states manage their school turnaround without assistance from external providers, suggesting that most states solicit some kind of support in their school improvement efforts.</p><p>Demographics also determine who can be involved in policymaking and to what extent. For example, a state with a larger number of Native American students is going to be able to reach out to tribal entities during the drafting process, while a state with few Native students cannot (Dahill-Brown, 2019). Given the explicit focus in ESSA on the education of ELs, states are also influenced by the immigration landscape when crafting policy. In both new and established immigrant destinations, states must attend to the needs of the EL student population, which causes SEAs to either depart from or approach equity, such as supporting bilingual education over English-only policies (Callahan et al., 2020). Using the context of state education policy involving ELs, Sampson (2019) argues that restrictive, symbolic, or exclusionary policies can have negative impacts on students. As such, it is important that SEAs not only understand and take into account the context of their state, but also that they pursue programs and policies tailored to that context.</p><p>In sum, extant research is divided regarding whether states’ efforts to implement ESSA are likely to create a more equitable educational environment, maintain existing inequities, or make the situation worse, particularly for students living in poverty and for students of color. Through analysis of publicly available documents and interviews with key policy makers, this study seeks to expand existing research by examining states’ continuing efforts to implement equity-related provisions of ESSA amidst a pandemic.</p><h>Methods</h><p>This qualitative case study examines the interpretation and implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA. The case study approach is appropriate because it allows us to provide an in-depth description of a current process within a bounded period of time (Yin, 2018). More specifically, we use an embedded single-case study design, which is appropriate for studying a single case with subunits (Yin, 2018). In this study, our case is defined as the process of interpreting and implementing equity-related provisions of ESSA across the country before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this case, we selected four states, which are embedded units.</p><h>Data Collection</h><p>Consistent with case study research, data collection involved identifying relevant documents and conducting individual interviews. Document analysis (Bowen, 2009) is appropriate given the wide variety of approaches states took to implementing ESSA, especially in light of the pandemic. We collected documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We consulted a range of sources, including websites specific to ESSA as well as state education websites and media outlets. We used primary sources (13%), including letters and press releases from federal and state departments of education, and secondary sources (87%), such as media coverage of state actions related to ESSA. We consulted state, local, and national media. For secondary sources, we included informative documents but excluded opinionated ones, since we are interested in what states <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">are</emphasis> doing rather than what they <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">should be</emphasis> doing. The earliest document was dated January 2018, when most (but not all) state ESSA plans had been approved. Our last document was dated April 2021, when many states were beginning to lift COVID-19 restrictions and many school districts were beginning to offer the option of returning to in-person schooling. However, states and districts were still in the midst of responding to the impacts of the pandemic in April 2021 when our data collection concluded. In total, we collected 136 documents, with at least one document from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>To identify a sample of states that would serve as embedded units within our larger case study, we sought maximum variation along two dimensions. First, we selected states with a range of equity-focused provisions based on our findings from document analysis and the National Urban League’s (2019) equity ratings of the 37 state plans that had been approved by the U.S. Department of Education at the time of their analysis. The National Urban League’s ratings include the designations of “excellent,” “sufficient,” and “poor.” We purposefully selected 12 states that would provide maximum variation along these two dimensions. While we sought participation from leaders in all 12 states, ultimately, participants from four states—North Carolina, Kentucky, Vermont, and Oklahoma—agreed to participate. Oklahoma and Kentucky were rated excellent, North Carolina was sufficient, and Vermont was not included in the National Urban League’s equity ratings. We also sought regional variation. These states are located in the Southwest (Oklahoma), Southeast (Kentucky and North Carolina), and New England (Vermont).</p><p>To identify interview participants from each state, we contacted current and former state chiefs to request their participation. We used snowball sampling to identify other participants who would be appropriate for our study. Participants from these four states included current and former state chiefs, senior state department of education officials overseeing school support, accountability, and federal programs, and knowledgeable experts involved in developing and implementing states’ ESSA plans. Ultimately, we had 17 participants from four states (Table 1). To provide confidentiality, participant roles are discussed in general terms and pseudonyms are used for all participants.</p><h>Table 1.</h><p>Participants.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=""3"" rowsep=""0"" xml:id=""tgroup_1""><colspec colname=""col1"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""160""/><colspec colname=""col2"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""264""/><colspec colname=""col3"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""192""/><thead><row><entry colname=""col1"">Pseudonym</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Role</entry><entry colname=""col3"">State</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Anderson</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Former chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Hall</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Former chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Harris</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Former chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Davis</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Jones</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Thomas</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Wilson</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Ms. Taylor</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department staff</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Miller</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Knowledgeable expert</entry><entry colname=""col3"">North Carolina</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Adams</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Kentucky</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Johnson</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Former chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Kentucky</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Walker</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Kentucky</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Smith</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Deputy chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Oklahoma</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Moore</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Oklahoma</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Williams</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Oklahoma</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Martin</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Chief</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Vermont</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Dr. Cooper</entry><entry colname=""col2"">Department leader</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Vermont</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews that lasted approximately 1 hour. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Questions focused on perceptions of ESSA and equity, how state ESSA plans address equity, implementation of equity-related provisions, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on equity-related provisions of the plan. Interview data was triangulated with data from documents and used to provide a more in-depth understanding of the implementation of ESSA plans in four states.</p><h>Data Analysis</h><p>We used inductive analysis to allow codes to emerge from our data. We began by having each member of the research team individually analyze the same three documents, which generated 12 codes. We repeated this process two more times to construct our codebook and establish intercoder reliability. Ultimately, we generated 37 codes, which included, for example, accountability, data, interagency collaboration, school support, testing, and waivers. In total, we coded 136 documents, sorted by pre- and post-COVID onset as well as by state. We used the same coding scheme to analyze our interview data. We combined our codes into 15 broader categories, including, for example, support for student subgroups and COVID as opportunity. Finally, we examined the relationships among our categories to develop four themes (Saldaña, 2013), which we describe below in our findings, about the interpretation and implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA. Throughout our analysis, we sought disconfirming evidence by cross-referencing information from various sources. To strengthen the credibility of our findings, we conducted member checking with our participants.</p><h>Limitations</h><p>Although we systematically collected and analyzed documents related to implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA, it is possible that we did not fully capture all aspects of all states’ early implementation efforts. Despite this limitation, we believe our analysis provides an accurate representation of early implementation efforts. We attempted to include vignettes of states identified by the National Urban League as “poor” regarding equity, but no such states agreed to participate. Although we lack detailed vignettes of such states, our documents provide data about implementation efforts in those states. Similarly, while we were successful in obtaining some regional variation among the four states, not all regions of the country are represented in our vignettes. Finally, due to the timing of data collection, which occurred as SEAs were in the midst of actively responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, potential participants consistently and understandably explained the need to prioritize their work with LEAs and schools rather than participate in research interviews. Therefore, it was difficult to secure interviews, and the number of interview participants from our four selected states is not balanced. As North Carolinians, we were able to use our professional networks to connect with more participants in our state than in others. Because of this limitation, it is possible that our findings do not fully capture the interpretation and implementation efforts in each of the four states. To address this limitation, we triangulated our interview data with documents.</p><h>Findings</h><p>Rather than relying exclusively on our interpretations of what the equity-related provisions of ESSA are and how ESSA could advance equity, we asked participants to share their perceptions of how ESSA is related to equity. Participants consistently referred to aspects of their accountability systems. Therefore, many of our findings are related to promoting equity through accountability. To address our research questions regarding how states interpret and implement equity-related provisions of ESSA as well as how states have altered implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we identified four central themes. First, states vary widely in their interpretation and implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA. Utilizing the flexibility provided in ESSA to develop their accountability plans, which many participants identified as being a key way in which they address equity, states adopted different accountability measures, some of which enhance equity and others that do little to address equity concerns. Second, for many states, new report card requirements proved problematic regarding logistics but ultimately provided greater transparency, particularly around resource equity. Third, early implementation of accountability plans and the provision of support for low-performing schools also varied widely by state, with some states advancing equity and others struggling to do so. Finally, states took different approaches to addressing inequities during the pandemic. After describing how each of these themes played out across the 50 states, we provide vignettes to illustrate these themes in four states.</p><h>Equity-Related Provisions in Accountability Plans</h><p>ESSA provides for numerous accountability indicators, with some required and others that allow flexibility. All states must report student achievement and growth as well as EL proficiency. States need to include one other academic measure for elementary and middle schools, and high schools must report graduation rates. In addition, states must include a nonacademic indicator that measures SQSS. Although accountability systems can be used to promote equity by highlighting and then addressing disparities among students’ opportunities and outcomes, prior research demonstrates that high-stakes test-based accountability systems can undermine equity (Darling-Hammond 2007; Menken 2006). Therefore, the SQSS indicator could be particularly important for measuring additional non-test-based aspects of the schooling experience in ways that will lead to greater equity. For this indicator, some states choose to report college and career readiness (CCR), chronic absenteeism, school climate, the suspension rate, or the achievement gap.</p><p>ESSA allows states to decide how much weight to give each component in their accountability system. The states that weight each indicator are listed in Table 2. However, states could also use some of these measures to identify areas of improvement without adding weight. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia use CCR as an accountability indicator, 36 along with the District of Columbia identify chronic absenteeism (missing 10% or more of the school year), and 35 include extended-year graduation rates (for example, calculating 5- and 6-year cohort rates along with the 4-year rate). States calculate college readiness in different ways, including scores on SAT, ACT, AP, and IB exams or completion of dual enrollment credits, and they measure career readiness based on certification completion such as career and technical education (CTE) or the Seal of Biliteracy (Kostyo et al., 2018).</p><h>Table 2.</h><p>Accountability Indicators.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=""3"" rowsep=""0"" xml:id=""tgroup_2""><colspec colname=""col1"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""200""/><colspec colname=""col2"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""288""/><colspec colname=""col3"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""128""/><thead><row><entry colname=""col1"">Indicator</entry><entry colname=""col2"">State</entry><entry colname=""col3"">Number of states</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=""col1"">School climate</entry><entry colname=""col2"">NM, NV, ID, ND, IA, IL, SC, MD</entry><entry colname=""col3"">8</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Achievement gap</entry><entry colname=""col2"">NH, FL, MS, GA, SC, KY, OH, SD, KS, NV, UT, WY, NM</entry><entry colname=""col3"">13</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Chronic absenteeism</entry><entry colname=""col2"">WA, OR, CA, NV, AZ, NM, CO, MT, SD, NE, OK, AR, MO, MN, WI, MI, IL, IN, OH, KY, TN, AL, GA, WV, VA, MD, DC, PA, DE, NJ, NY, CT, MA, RI, ME, AK, HI</entry><entry colname=""col3"">36 and DC</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">Extended year graduation rates</entry><entry colname=""col2"">WA, OR, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO, NE, OK, ND, MN, IA, WI, MI, IL, IN, OH, KY, AR, LA, AL, GA, WV, PA, MD, DE, NJ, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI, ME, AK</entry><entry colname=""col3"">35</entry></row><row><entry colname=""col1"">College/career readiness</entry><entry colname=""col2"">WA, OR, CA, NV, UT, ID, MT, WY, AZ, NM, TX, NE, OK, ND, SD, MI, IL, IN, OH, KY, AR, LA, TN, MS, AL, GA, FL, NC, SC, WV, PA, DC, MD, DE, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI</entry><entry colname=""col3"">39 and DC</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=""it"">Note</emphasis>. This information compiled from Alliance for Excellent Education (2018) and Kostyo et al. (2018).</p><p>Chronic absenteeism as an indicator of school quality has prompted states to address the issue differently. What was once referred to as “truancy,” and relegated to the court system, is now seen as an opportunity to address student needs. Connecticut and Pennsylvania track attendance and provide incentives for chronically absent students (Goldstein, 2020; Zahn, 2018). During the pandemic, as schools moved to a virtual platform, some school leaders began asking if they were just looking for presence or if engagement was more important. Rather than simply asking if the student was present or not, districts in Indiana explained that they were more interested in creating student-teacher connections and ensuring that students had what they needed to be successful in virtual learning (Kirkman, 2020).</p><p>School climate is an indicator that conveys whether students and staff feel safe and experience a sense of belonging. Increasing recognition of the importance of school climate has led eight states to include this indicator (Kostyo et al., 2018). States that include this indicator typically design a survey that measures elements of climate, such as students’ access to social-emotional learning. In Maryland, schools survey students and staff on four dimensions: relationships, environment, community, and safety (McCann et al., 2021). Schools use the survey results to determine areas of need in programming and professional development. Even states that do not include school climate as an indicator in their plans have signaled interest in developing students’ social-emotional learning, especially in light of the pandemic.</p><p>The use of suspension as a disciplinary measure decreases student achievement so some states include the suspension rate to flag schools needing improvement. Only California, Rhode Island, and West Virginia factor the suspension rate into their ratings.</p><p>As opposed to aggregated measures of proficiency and growth, the achievement gap refers to the gap in performance between certain subgroups of students and the whole. Attention to closing these gaps may enhance equity for student subgroups. Thirteen states include this indicator.</p><p>Several states include new indicators of school quality. For example, some states include arts education: Illinois will add an indicator that counts for 5% of a school’s grade starting in 2022–2023, and Connecticut awards 50 points in its high school rating system for arts access and participation. Connecticut and Vermont give weight to physical education in school ratings. The District of Columbia, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Michigan include an indicator for “well-rounded education,” which can refer to course offerings in “computer science, music, career and technical education, health, and physcial education” among others (United States Department of Education, 2016, p. 19) .</p><p>States also determine how to report subgroups (Table 3), which became a cause for some concern. Subgroup performance is one way that schools are identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) or targeted support and improvement (TSI). A higher <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-size may lead to the exclusion of a group of students from identification for services, while a lower threshold for subgroup inclusion means that more students could be identified and provided with needed services. Some states wanted to aggregate students into “supergroups” that could include a larger number of subgroups but would potentially mask the unique needs of those groups (Ushomirsky et al., 2017). States could choose how to weight subgroup performance, and many chose not to factor subgroups into the final score, which may allow a school to receive, for example, an A grade even when certain subgroups are underperforming (Ushomirsky et al., 2017). However, a state could equally weight the performance of subgroups with the performance of all students, as is the case in Minnesota (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2018).</p><h>Table 3.</h><p>Subgroup <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-Size.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=""5"" rowsep=""0"" xml:id=""tgroup_3""><colspec colname=""col1"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""128""/><colspec colname=""col2"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""112""/><colspec colname=""col3"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""144""/><colspec colname=""col4"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""88""/><colspec colname=""col5"" colsep=""0"" colwidth=""128""/><thead><row><entry colname=""col1"">10</entry><entry colname=""col2"">15</entry><entry colname=""col3"">20</entry><entry colname=""col4"">25</entry><entry colname=""col5"">30</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=""col1"">AK, DC, FL, KY, LA, ME, MD, MS, MT, NE, NH,<sup>a</sup> NV,<sup>b</sup> ND, OK, SD, UT, WY</entry><entry colname=""col2"">AR, DE, GA, OH</entry><entry colname=""col3"">AL, AZ, CT, CO, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, MA, MN, NJ, NM, OR, PA, RI, SC, WA, WV, WI</entry><entry colname=""col4"">NV,<sup>b</sup>TX, VT</entry><entry colname=""col5"">CA, KS, MI, MO, NY, NC, TN, VA</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><h>a</h><p>New Hampshire reports an <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-size of 11 students.</p><h>b</h><p>Nevada uses an <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-size of 10 for school ratings and reporting and an <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-size of 25 to identify schools for support.</p><h>Uneven Implementation of Report Card Requirements</h><p>Accountability metrics are reported to the public through school report cards. However, many states have experienced problems with new report card requirements due to delayed data and data quality. In states where report cards are fully and accurately released, data revealing per pupil funding at the school level allows for greater scrutiny of resource equity.</p><p>As of March 2019, Arizona and Kentucky were the only states that had made federal report cards public. In all other states, data was delayed. Vermont, for example, was 9 months late on releasing school-level test scores from 2018 and included only academic indicators, not personalization, school climate, staffing, and spending, as required by the state’s ESSA plan (Duffort, 2019). Oklahoma was 18 months behind in identifying its first cohort of schools for support and improvement due to delays in constructing a new data management system.</p><p>A few states have experienced problems with data quality. Kentucky’s financial data has been criticized as being not very useful because it only breaks spending into “personnel” and “non-personnel,” without identifying teacher salaries or other spending avenues. Furthermore, Kentucky lumps together state and local spending, making it impossible for taxpayers to determine their contribution to local schools. Kentucky’s first attempt at reporting school funding also contained some incorrect numbers, leading to the conclusion that the state fell “way short of what is needed” (Waters, 2020). Similarly, Mississippi’s data on attendance and CTE enrollment has been inaccurate: The state auditor pointed to “too much room for human error” in attendance reporting, which might negatively affect school funding that is based on attendance (White, 2020).</p><p>In some states, recent report cards have included complete and accurate information on per pupil funding at the school level, which was not required prior to ESSA. Such data has revealed discrepancies in funding among schools in many states, including Alabama, Missouri, and Wisconsin. In some instances, these disparities may be promoting equity because schools with large shares of high-needs students need more funding to meet students’ needs, as is the case in Alabama (Crain, 2019). In other cases, high-wealth schools may be able to generate more funding, which could exacerbate inequities among schools. Providing this data through state report cards allows for greater transparency and the opportunity to address resource equity more effectively (Benzschawel, 2020).</p><p>During the pandemic, many state report cards did not include testing data because tests were suspended during the 2019–2020 school year. In South Carolina, for example, report cards did not include assessment data but instead included information about the state’s other accountability metrics such as safety, finance, and classroom environment (Bean, 2020).</p><h>Variation in Implementation of Accountability Systems and Support for Low-Performing Schools</h><p>Many states have faced similar challenges in implementing their newly modified accountability systems and providing support for low-performing schools. However, just as there was great variability in the design of state plans, the early implementation of equity-related provisions also has varied widely by state.</p><p>In some instances, federal and state requirements conflicted. For example, dual accountability systems have created confusion and complications, in clear violation of federal law. In 2018, without input from stakeholders during a lame duck session, Michigan lawmakers passed a new state A-F reporting system that conflicted with federal law, in part because alternative education systems were omitted from the state system even though ESSA requires that all schools be included in a single accountability system (Chambers, 2019). North Carolina identifies two different sets of schools for support through federal and state systems. North Carolina officials shared that inconsistencies, and sometimes conflicts, in federal and state accountability systems can confuse the public and hinder the capacity of SEAs to provide support for school improvement.</p><p>An analysis of early implementation across 10 states by the Alliance for Excellent Education (2020) found significant variation in how well states are serving vulnerable students and closing the achievement gap. Some states such as Florida identified nearly 70% of their schools for either CSI or TSI, while others such as Connecticut identified fewer than 5%. Michigan failed to identify 80% of schools in the bottom 5% in its accountability system, while Washington identified all of its low-performing schools for support. These discrepancies indicate state divergence in support for low-performing schools and have important equity implications as states fully implement ESSA.</p><p>Unlike NCLB, which required certain corrective actions and school improvement strategies to support low-performing schools, ESSA allows states to develop their own plans and timelines for supporting such schools. Therefore, variation also exists in how states are providing support to schools identified as CSI and TSI. SEAs often conduct needs assessments to identify the supports that would be most effective for schools identified as CSI and TSI. In Iowa, federal funds devoted to CSI and TSI schools are used for professional development, site visits, and frequent check-ins to make sure schools are on track to improvement (Maki, 2021). Nevada is moving away from an Achievement School District, which would take over low-performing schools, and working instead to help schools try new evidence-based practices that may lead to turnaround (Valley, 2019). The recognition that identified schools are often rural prompted Georgia to offer Rural Resource Grants to support struggling rural schools (Georgia Department of Education, 2019). In these instances, rather than fear of state takeover, schools identified for improvement are receiving support.</p><p>However, lack of clarity around this process has been problematic for some school leaders whose schools were identified as CSI or TSI. In Minnesota, school leaders were unsure of what it meant to be identified as needing support and improvement or what state support would be offered (Hinrichs, 2018). While the process sometimes lacks clarity, the identification of CSI and TSI has led states to develop plans for supporting their low-performing schools.</p><h>Addressing Inequities During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h><p>The move to remote learning presented many challenges for schools throughout the country. Students who typically had one or two meals a day at school needed to be fed. Students needed access to devices to be able to participate in online learning, which for some districts meant distributing these devices. Students also needed access to the internet, another challenge especially in rural areas without sufficient broadband. In some cases, state plans already addressed these concerns and states utilized existing structures when the pandemic hit. For example, Oklahoma’s plan addresses nutrition so they were able to provide meals not only to students but also to families during the pandemic. In other cases, these issues had long been in discussion but were omitted from ESSA plans. With no existing plan to address these inequities, many states had difficulty adapting to the new challenges. Often, local districts took responsibility for addressing these needs. Just as the pandemic highlighted these needs for states, the federal government paid attention too, providing multiple rounds of funding from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund, which was designed to alleviate inequities.</p><p>Even with those hurdles cleared, schools worried about the effect of remote learning on mental health for both students and teachers as well as the potential for learning loss. School districts in California responded to mental health concerns by ensuring that students had access to counselors and social workers, and that teachers could provide social-emotional support. Chicago schools prepared to provide trauma-informed care through support teams and additional funding (Kunichoff, 2021). In Colorado, results from a needs assessment indicated that teacher mental health concerns ranked alongside student concerns (Breunlin, 2021).</p><p>Learning loss was a concern among educators and parents. Furthermore, concerns arose over having students come into school to take exams during the pandemic, along with potential issues with taking exams remotely. States responded by implementing different approaches to testing and accountability. In spring 2020, states allowed schools to cancel end-of-year tests completely, meaning that data on student growth is unavailable for that time period. When the Biden administration clarified that such waivers would not be available again for spring 2021 (Rosenblum, 2021), states either tried to minimize the impact of testing on students, or welcomed the opportunity to measure what learning had occurred through a standardized assessment.</p><p>Initially, some states indicated a preference for locally designed assessments, with Georgia and South Carolina requesting a waiver from mandated testing similar to the waiver that all states had received the previous spring. However, ED’s first move under the Biden administration made its stance clear: States would not receive blanket waivers again and, barring mitigating circumstances, would be required to administer statewide standardized assessments (Rosenblum, 2021). Only the District of Columbia was relieved completely from testing, as 88% of students were still in remote learning at the end of the year. New York and Georgia uncoupled their test results from graduation or grade promotion requirements and were not required to weight the results on school report cards (Amin, 2021; Downey, 2020). Colorado received a rare waiver from ED to administer its mathematics assessments to students in fourth, sixth, and eighth grades, and its reading/language arts assessments to students in third, fifth, and seventh grades, rather than giving both exams to all students in Grades 3 through 8 (Blad, 2021). Many states also sought to alleviate concerns over how students would take the test. Texas opened alternative testing sites to permit greater social distancing, and Georgia offered evening testing. Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington extended the testing window into the fall, while California shortened its exam and extended the window. To bolster validity, states supplemented summative assessments with formative assessments. For example, Georgia provided a formative assessment tool at no cost to all its districts (Downey, 2020).</p><p>Findings of the document analysis led to the above themes, namely that in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the approach to equity-related provisions in ESSA plans was varied, and there was uneven implementation of report cards as well as variation in accountability systems, leading to variegated support for low-performing schools. The fourth theme addressed how states handled inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was ongoing at the time of writing. In the following four vignettes, we describe these themes in North Carolina, Kentucky, Vermont, and Oklahoma.</p><h>North Carolina</h><p>Officials in North Carolina were optimistic that the flexibility offered through ESSA would improve equity through the provision of targeted assistance and support. Dr. Jones, a department leader in the N.C. Department of Public Instruction, commented, “We are ‘boots on the ground,’ working with those schools, and trying to figure out what kinds of strategies need to be implemented to ensure that all subgroups are successful.” The state provides support through a regional model with a program administrator overseeing each of eight regions “to provide a continuum of services for districts.” State officials repeatedly referred to the flexibility under ESSA to consolidate funds to best meet students’ needs, unlike NCLB and its predecessors, which placed tighter restrictions on categorical spending and by so doing created silos within SEAs. Dr. Davis, a senior SEA official, stated, “I think the flexibility is a good thing. I think equity is about making sure everybody involved [has] the support that they need in order to serve their population” as opposed to the “hard-core mandates” of NCLB.</p><p>The flexibility to modify and improve the state accountability system by incorporating more measures of school performance was viewed as an equity-based improvement by some participants. Dr. Hall, a former chief, believes that ESSA will advance equity through: (1) the flexibility to create an improved accountability system, (2) less prescriptive mandates (“the authority to move away from the ‘all or nothing’ of No Child Left Behind”), and (3) the required focus on teacher assignment. Dr. Hall noted that ESSA elevates the role of SEAs and allows them to serve “as a bully pulpit for equity.” This former chief believes that many of the equity concerns expressed by various groups fearing a return to state control are overblown, stating, “On a scale of one to ten, I would say that that’s about a three, with ten being the worst” because ESSA still requires public reporting of school performance and actually expands performance reporting with its requirements for reporting on the distribution of teachers.</p><p>Both current and former SEA officials commented that lack of staffing due to repeated budget cuts constrains the capacity of the agency to provide support to schools in need of improvement. In 2017, when ESSA went into effect, the SEA experienced a Reduction in Force (RIF); another RIF occurred a year later. Dr. Davis commented that it “drastically changed the services we could provide . . . so all of those personnel that we had to actually go into schools—we call them instructional coaches and school transformation coaches—they were cut.” Dr. Wilson, another SEA official, agreed, stating, “It’s hard to scale up efforts when you don’t have staff. I think it’s hard to make a difference at the impact we need with some of our lowest performing schools without having capacity to really be there and to work with them over time.” Dr. Hall lamented that rapid turnover among state chiefs and staff produced a lack of continuity, which can hinder consistent efforts at promoting equity. That said, renewed attention to equity appears to be a focus of both the SEA and the State Board of Education (SBE): The new state superintendent created an equity office and the SBE included equity as a major component of its strategic plan.</p><p>Participants acknowledged that the pandemic brought ESSA implementation to a standstill, since nearly everyone’s focus shifted to responding to the ever-changing conditions of the pandemic. However, participants recognized that the pandemic starkly exposed inequities in the existing delivery system, particularly with respect to access to broadband internet and the key role played by schools in partially remediating food insecurity. While state officials recognized that these issues already existed, the pandemic “just laid them bare.”</p><h>Kentucky</h><p>While officials in North Carolina appreciated the increased flexibility of ESSA and used it to implement new supports, the sentiment in Kentucky was different. In reflecting on Kentucky’s ESSA plan, Dr. Adams, the state chief, explained, “There has been a real sense of, ‘If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Let’s keep giving them the same thing that passed last time.’” In addition, a former chief, Dr. Johnson, explained that the lack of regulations and inconsistencies in ED’s interpretations of the legislation led to less innovative efforts to promote equity. He stated, “States tended to go safe.” While his perspective is that “the flexibility was overstated” because “ESSA is still primarily a test-based accountability system,” he acknowledged that “there’s greater flexibility to think about how kids are performing in some of the ‘quote, unquote’ non-academic measures.” To promote equity, Kentucky included the achievement gap as an accountability measure as well as multiple measures of CCR. In addition, Dr. Walker, a senior SEA official, highlighted the allocation of funding to enhance equity. She emphasized the importance of ESSA’s balance between funding that supports school-wide programs broadly and funding that targets specific student populations that need additional support. Although the plan was rated “excellent” regarding equity, Dr. Johnson acknowledged, “We could have done more. I think that would be the sentiment of quite a few chiefs around the country.”</p><p>Early implementation of the equity-related provisions of Kentucky’s plan was challenging for several reasons. First, the accountability system is written into state law, which has advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage, Dr. Johnson explained, is that “when you’re talking about stuff that is in the legislature, it goes through a political process. It’s not necessarily the result of folks sitting down and figuring out what’s best for kids and what’s best for schools.” Regarding logistical challenges, he continued, When there’s disagreement between . . . what the legislature ultimately decides and what U.S. ED decides was the intent of the legislation, rather than the department being able to turn on a dime and make those adjustments, it can require, not just having to go back to the state board of education to revise regulation, but having to go back to the state legislature to revise policy.</p><p>The definition of TSI is one such example where the state’s legislation was in conflict with the federal law and had to be revised.</p><p>Another challenge related to TSI arose because the state’s definition of TSI led to many schools being designated due to their achievement gaps. Dr. Johnson explained, As you might imagine, superintendents don’t like that very much. The big pushback was [that] we need to change the law so that not nearly as many schools are identified as TSI. And you need to change this achievement gap thing so that not as many schools are designated as having gaps.</p><p>Through negotiations with the General Assembly and the Superintendents Association, a compromise was reached that resulted in “fewer schools being designated as TSI, and some changes that led to some recalculation in the achievement gap indicator.” The identification of CSI and TSI schools can lead to the state providing increased support, so the suggestion that Kentucky backed off from TSI designation could limit equitable resources and support for students in those schools.</p><p>Finally, the capacity of Kentucky’s state department to fully implement the plan was limited. Dr. Johnson explained, Because of decreased state funding, I saw a shift in what we were able to do as a department of education, versus what [the department] was able to do 10 years prior. It was just a much smaller agency with a much smaller footprint.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kentucky experienced challenges related to adhering to testing requirements, for which Kentucky received a waiver, and tracking attendance. For example, it was especially difficult to locate students who were homeless during the pandemic. Dr. Walker emphasized, It’s during these times of crisis that it becomes even more important to follow the law the best you can. . . . Before, school meals were important, of course, but now, even more. It’s important to find those kids and get them their academic work so they can participate because this is the time when they’re really going to fall through the cracks.</p><p>To help address some of the challenges associated with the pandemic, Dr. Walker explained that ESSER funds were well aligned with ESSA and helped to address inequities. Although no longer chief during the pandemic, Dr. Johnson expressed concern that COVID will set any progress we were making toward greater equity back significantly because, to put it bluntly, it gives a new excuse. The reality is, and it’s well documented, that we had incredible equity challenges in schools pre-COVID. But with COVID, now everybody kind of gets a blank slate. It’s like, ‘What were we supposed to do? There’s COVID’.</p><p>Conversely, Dr. Adams stated that equity “is a central value for us.” Although not part of the state’s ESSA plan or directly in response to COVID, a new Division of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging was established in 2020 within the Office of Teaching and Learning in Kentucky’s Department of Education, with the goal of building capacity and addressing equity. Concurrently, in the wake of the murders of George Floyd and Kentucky’s Breonna Taylor, Kentucky’s Board of Education passed a resolution “affirming its commitment to racial equity.” According to Dr. Adams, “Remarkable capacity building [has occurred] in two years” through the creation of a five-person team to support school districts, and Kentucky may develop a revised state plan that is better aligned with their current strategic direction. However, Dr. Adams explained, “That invites the U.S. Department of Education scrutinizing it more, which is not something that we really relish.”</p><h>Vermont</h><p>Vermont, an SEA with even fewer staff than North Carolina or Kentucky, expressed a lack of capacity. In addition to the low number of employees, the passage of ESSA and the writing of Vermont’s plan came at a time of transition, when state legislation had redesignated the education chief from an elected position to an appointed position. In order to complete the plan before the gubernatorial transition, the state chief worked mainly with other members of the agency to write the plan, while also receiving some stakeholder input from school districts. Dr. Cooper, a department leader in the Vermont Agency of Education who participated in the initial drafting of the plan, described the stakeholder involvement: We had a group of folks from the field who were serving as a sounding board. . . . At one point, we counted over 500 different people in the state. . . . As a percentage of our state, it was a pretty significant group.</p><p>From these initial conversations, stakeholders then provided input on what should be included in the plan: “[We] worked with superintendents, worked with principals, others in the field to say, ‘Here’s the thing that we’re trying to find out. Which one of these indicators is the one that is the best to address that?’” In this way, the state narrowed the number of indicators down to eight.</p><p>The agency took the opportunity to include many SQSS indicators; however, the state chief, Dr. Martin, regarded ESSA as an activity in compliance. In his view, the state plan is not a beginning but a continuation of the equity work that was already being implemented in Vermont, including a continuous improvement framework, an equalized funding system, and flexible pathways to student learning. He stated, “We have a political problem, then we have educational problems. This is a political problem; it’s not really about education or improving outcomes.” He added that ESSA is “not the primary vehicle by which we would achieve equity.” Dr. Cooper concurred that ESSA was a continuation of the state’s equity work: We wanted to use the law . . . not to punish and shame schools, but to draw attention to where there are equity gaps. That’s why we made that really intentional use of the term <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">equity supports</emphasis> for those schools.</p><p>Dr. Cooper believed their plan “asks schools to focus on where those gaps are and to make a serious intentional plan to address the reason why those gaps exist, why they persist.”</p><p>The plan did provide an opportunity to create an equity index of aggregated subgroups and a new way to visualize data in the report card, but Dr. Martin believes it requires “someone with an inside perspective to make sense of those indicators” and is not sustainable: “We’re a very small state and we’ve built a monster that we can’t operate or pay for in the future.” Some miscalculations in the original plan prompted the agency to draft an amendment that would simplify their indicators and “keep it within the scale of our capacity and . . . operations as a state.” The amendment would approach ESSA requirements “from a doability standpoint,” creating a data model that balances student achievement and growth, economic efficiency, and a perception of the learning environment. This amendment was in preparation before the pandemic, but according to Dr. Martin, “We were hearing from other states, ‘Be careful about submitting an amendment; it opens a can of worms.’ You’re not sure what the response would be from the U.S. Department of Education.” However, now that the department is under a new Secretary, Vermont will submit an amendment to its plan.</p><p>According to Dr. Martin, the pandemic unveiled inequities similar to those that other states faced, with online learning being a particular concern. Regardless of how the pandemic changes education, he said it is important to attend to equity issues, because “it’s not too hard to imagine schools—physical schools, in-person learning—becoming only for the poor kids who need free meals at schools and the wealthy kids being educated someplace else.” The state required schools to write a COVID recovery plan that identified challenges in the areas of academics, social-emotional wellness, and student engagement. The logic, Dr. Cooper said, was “not that one was better than the other, more important than the other, it’s that all three of them work in concert with each other.” The SEA plans to provide supports to address the challenges that schools identify.</p><h>Oklahoma</h><p>While Vermont did not receive a rating, Oklahoma was rated “excellent” by the National Urban League, and the SEA clearly took ESSA as an opportunity to advance equity. Dr. Smith, a deputy chief who co-authored the state plan, explained their process of stakeholder engagement, which involved “not just educators, but parents and families, community nonprofits, tribal entities, [and] legislators” as well as “a superintendent advisory, a teacher advisory, and a student advisory. We were very intentional about getting and hearing student voices.” She noted that ESSA presented an opportunity to pursue grant funding for early childhood education, as well as ensure equitable resource funding and distribution. Dr. Moore, a department leader in the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE), noted the value in using indicators other than academics to assess schools. Dr. Williams, another OSDE department leader, appreciated the chance to provide support for struggling schools, what she referred to as a “coaching, improvement, ‘boots on the ground’ model,” a stark contrast to the “compliance model” required by NCLB.</p><p>Oklahoma was noteworthy for its smaller subgroup <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">n</emphasis>-size and priority subgroups of economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, ELs, and race and ethnicity groupings, which Dr. Smith celebrated as avoiding “double and maybe even triple counting” students. However, Dr. Moore described a pitfall of this system: The distribution of [scores for] students who are White and have a disability is roughly equivalent to the distribution of [scores for] Black students with no disability. [For] Black students <emphasis typeStyle=""it"">with</emphasis> a disability, that distribution is shifted even further to the left.</p><p>This system could mask inequity for students who fall into more than one category, so he would like to improve the system to “highlight inequity, help us work towards equity even further, by being able to display and accommodate that nuance.”</p><p>Oklahoma has faced chronic funding shortages for the last 20 years. Because of increased funding and flexibility of allocation, COVID actually expanded the capacity of the SEA and LEAs to provide resources to students, including nutrition, internet, and devices. Dr. Williams explained that the pandemic also helped states address underfunding because the allowables are so wide open. . . . So when we think about equity and children attending schools that might be falling apart, or that don’t have ventilation, we’re able to fix those things, and those things will remain for our students.</p><p>Oklahoma is a local control state, which can limit the SEA’s ability to manage districts’ choices. According to Dr. Williams, this approach makes them even more reliant on good leadership, a necessity for advancing equity: “A good leader will address equity naturally. A manager probably won’t. And the difference between that leadership and that manager is pretty stark.” Along with local control, the equity conversation in Oklahoma was limited by its political leanings. As Dr. Williams noted, “We are an incredibly conservative state. How are we going to maneuver around that, to get these conversations going?” As difficult as promoting equity for all students is, it is further complicated by the politics surrounding such efforts.</p><h>Summary of Vignettes</h><p>The vignettes of these four states illustrate the variation in their interpretations and implementation of equity-related provisions of ESSA. Kentucky, North Carolina, and Vermont approached ESSA with a compliance mentality. They included efforts to promote equity; however, uncertainty about ED’s response to state plans led to their reluctance to innovate or to amend their plans. In contrast, Oklahoma viewed ESSA as an opportunity to ensure equdity and to support struggling schools. All four states underscored the difficulty of implementing their plans due to limited capacity and funding shortages. Kentucky, North Carolina, and Oklahoma highlighted the significance of the increased funding provided to states due to COVID, the flexibility it allows, and the possibility of using it to promote equity. Participants in all four states noted the impact of politics on their state plans, and in Kentucky, conflict between state and federal systems created challenges for early implementation. Having begun implementation, both Kentucky and Vermont expressed the need to file amendments due either to political pressure or to limited capacity to fully implement their plans. While all four states indicated desires to promote equity, they expressed clear limitations in their abilities to do so.</p><h>Discussion</h><p>Although ESEA began as a piece of civil rights legislation, our findings reveal that states’ interpretations and implementation of ESSA provisions can either promote or hinder equity. We find that state plans include a range of equity-related provisions, which are often related to identifying inequities through accountability systems and providing support to schools identified as CSI and TSI schools. Prior research documents the many ways in which high-stakes test-based accountability systems can undermine equity. These practices include, for example, a focus on low-level skills and a narrowed curriculum that primarily covers tested subjects, particularly in low-performing schools with large shares of students of color and ELs (Darling-Hammond, 2007; Menken, 2006; Nichols &amp; Berliner, 2007). Acknowledging these serious and inequitable outcomes, our data demonstrates the ways in which states do and do not use their accountability systems and other provisions of the law to enhance equity.</p><p>Without regulatory guidance and with uncertainty about what ED would approve, many states sought to adhere to the legislation and, as Dr. Johnson of Kentucky acknowledged, “could have done more.” SEAs differ considerably in “their ability to provide professional development, curricula, and other assistance” (Edgerton, 2019, p. 16; Jochim, 2016) and are often guided by a compliance-driven mentality (C. G. Brown et al., 2011). This has been particularly evident in efforts to turn around low-performing schools (VanGronigen &amp; Meyers, 2019). VanGronigen and Meyers wonder whether many SEAs will have the capacity to manage oversight and leadership of school improvement efforts, particularly when faced with “an increasing caseload of low-performing schools” (p. 441). Similarly, we find that capacity among states varies, with several states highlighting the difficulty of supporting CSI and TSI schools due to decreased budgets and smaller staff. Former Undersecretary of Education Eugene Hickok’s (2003) comments about NCLB seem particularly pertinent to ESSA: The law made it “more difficult to close one’s eyes to persistent underperformance by students and schools” (p. 22). Under ESSA, how difficult it is to close one’s eyes to persistent underperformance largely rests with individual states (L. D. Fusarelli &amp; Ayscue, 2019). As the current study suggests, some states are more proactive in addressing equity while others may avert their eyes.</p><p>One likely outcome of ESSA is that states will devolve decision-making power to the district level, which would contrast sharply with the 1990s movement toward more centralized control at the state level (B. C. Fusarelli &amp; Cooper, 2009), effectively punting responsibility for equity and school improvement to the local level. Sampson and Horsford (2017) comment that this may not be a bad outcome. In their study of community advocacy in three school districts in the Mountain West, school board members were able to analyze data, identify inequities, and make decisions to address those inequities in their districts. In their examination of CCR standards in Illinois, Malin et al. (2017) conclude that decentralization of power to districts under ESSA “may affect educational equity in ways that advantage and disadvantage” (p. 810). Based on our analysis, results among states seem to be mixed regarding attention to equity concerns.</p><p>Desimone et al. (2019) assert that ESSA marks a return to local control over standards and curriculum, and that “states are being less prescriptive in their policies surrounding the standards and are including fewer or less forceful rewards and sanctions” (p. 167). Consistent with this assertion, our findings demonstrate various ways in which some SEAs are striving to promote equity and support low-performing schools through data dashboards, individualized needs assessments, and subsequent support services. While Desimone et al. (2019) believe this approach might be more successful than previous, more heavy-handed federal and state reform efforts, they caution that local control presents its own challenges, including district capacity to support schools, particularly in under-resourced districts. Our study shows that, in some cases, without strong federal oversight, some states have relaxed their own monitoring and oversight of disparities, such as staffing inequities in the highest need schools. Drawing upon surveys, interviews, and site visits regarding implementation of ESSA, Edgerton (2019) concurs, stating, “We cannot exclude the possibility that less federal- and state-driven accountability will result in less attention paid to the neediest districts” (p. 17). The state response to COVID-19 was encouraging in many cases, as the pandemic required schools to provide online resources, including broadband internet and devices, and provided increased funding to do so. However, it remains to be seen if this attention and concern will carry into the future.</p><h>Implications</h><p>Given the shift of authority back to the state and district levels, the importance of building capacity at these levels cannot be overstated. As noted earlier, SEAs differ considerably in their capacity to facilitate school improvement and support students who have the greatest needs. Building capacity and having effective equity-focused leadership at the state level would create opportunities for states to substantially improve their school systems. Failure to do so would leave SEAs in an all-too-familiar position of being primarily “check the box” bureaucratic institutions that provide little support for improvement. Further, in many small, rural districts, teachers, and administrators wear many hats and lack the capacity to engage in systemic improvement. To effectively implement ESSA and create more equitable school systems, state and district leaders will need to work collaboratively to identify needed areas of support, build capacity and provide targeted support, and ensure that the equity provisions contained in ESSA are fully implemented, monitored, and executed with fidelity.</p><p>ESSA presents researchers with an opportunity to re-engage with the politics of education at the state and local levels. A dearth of research exists on SEAs (C. G. Brown et al., 2011), which play a significant role in implementing ESSA and in facilitating systemic school improvement. SEAs differ in organization, management, staffing, and expenditures (Hanna, 2014), although Brown and other researchers found that staffing and funding data on SEAs is remarkably difficult to obtain. The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), in conjunction with Policy Studies Associates, conducted a survey of SEA efforts to implement ESSA and support school improvement. Seventy-one percent of respondents reported that SEA capacity to assist LEAs with comprehensive and targeted support and improvement was a moderate or major challenge. A slightly higher percentage (76%) identified “insufficient LEA capacity to collect, analyze, or use data as a moderate or major challenge” (Council of Chief State School Officer [CCSSO], 2019, p. 38). More research is needed on capacity building at the state and local levels to better understand these challenges.</p><p>As states diverge in equity-based strategies in implementing ESSA, more comparative state-level research is needed to explain these differences, including demographic and political trends (Callahan et al., 2020). Given their importance under ESSA, SEAs merit much more detailed attention. More research on district-level implementation and school improvement also needs to be conducted, given that many SEAs may punt reform to the local level. In particular, additional research is needed to investigate how SEAs and districts promote equity for ESSA’s newly identified subgroups and students who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.</p><p>In their analysis of SEA websites, VanGronigen and Meyers (2019) observed that states’ implementation of ESSA has already produced divergent paths toward accountability, assessment, and school turnaround. Preliminary evidence suggests that this increased state autonomy will magnify “the already fragmented nature of America’s education system, which is essentially 50 systems working [more or less] in parallel” (Duff &amp; Wohlstetter, 2019, p. 306). Our study demonstrates that the ability to promote equity through ESSA largely depends on the design and implementation of state plans, resulting in wide variation among states regarding political will and capacity to promote equitable educational opportunities and outcomes for students across the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><link service=""ATTACHMENT""><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=""object-key""/><keyValue value=""10117708959048221130994""/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=""componentseq"" value=""1""/><parameter name=""object-type"" value=""215""/><parameter name=""object-smi"" value=""61903""/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Abram S.,   (2019, November 14).

Trade 'China Isn't Cheating on Trade' [Peter Beinart, The Atlantic[1]]. 'From Elizabeth Warren, who earlier this year claimed that China has 'weaponized its economy[2],' to Marco Rubio, who last year tweeted that the Chinese aim to 'steal ...eat their way to world dominance[3],' leading Democrats and Republicans [including Trump, of course] describe China's economic practices as uniquely malevolent and getting worse. In fact, neither accusation is true. Beijing's economic policies are actually quite typical of a country at its stage of development. </p><p>Like many regimes in the developing world, Beijing fears the 'middle-income trap,' in which rising wages undermine its advantage as a center of low-cost manufacturing before it develops the capacity to produce higher-value goods. China worries that unless it moves from assembling iPhones to inventing them, economic growth will stagnate and popular unrest will follow. China therefore erects tariffs to protect industries it hopes will help it make that leap. So did the United States when it was industrializing.' And: '[Complaints] dominate Beltway discourse not because the evidence underlying them is particularly strong. It isn't. They have come to dominate Beltway discourse because Democrats and Republicans both believe that Trump's anti-China message helped him win Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and that the path to the presidency runs through those states again in 2020.' •Blowback from de-industrializing the 'Rust Belt' Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 2020Buttigieg (D)(1): 'The Complexities of the Black Vote' [Charles Blow, New York Times[4]]. 'In a way, I think that you could make a case that there are two black Americas among the people descended of the enslaved in this country: The sons and daughters of the Great Migration and the sons and daughters of the people who stayed in the South. One difference is religiosity. While black people in general are more religious than the overall population, black people in the South are also appreciably more religious than black people in other parts of the country, according to Gallup data. This religiosity translates into a form of social conservatism.' • Blow is, I think, treading delicately around California's Proposition 8[5]: 'Based on National Eelction Pool (NEP) estimates, 70 percent of blacks cast their ballots in favor of Proposition 8 [i.e., against gay marriage] while 49% of white, 53% of Latinos, 49% of Asians, and 51% of those from another racial/ethnic identity supported a ban on gay marriage.' • The seeming paradox can be resolved if the liberal Democrat Establishment regards Buttigieg as a catspaw, with their ultimate goal preventing Sanders from winning 50% + 1 of the delegates, and a brokered convention.

'Two days after removing wooden pallets that the homeless were using for beds under the Main Street viaduct, the city was still letting people camp there Wednesday. Shortly after the city destroyed the pallets Monday morning, people returned and set up new encampments with cardboard boxes, bedding and assorted possessions. Mayor Pete Buttigieg doesn't want that happening either, and he said his administration's attorneys were researching whether Indiana's public nuisance law authorizes the city to prohibit the encampments altogether.. John Shafer, founder of the nonprofit Michiana Five For the Homeless, which secured the pallets from an Elkhart food pantry and brought them to the viaduct, has called their confiscation and destruction by the city 'shameful.' Buttigieg said the city didn't think it was taking anyone's 'possessions,' as Shafer has said. 'People have different ideas about being helpful,' Buttigieg said. 'The pallets symbolize, in some ways, a real concern we have about people who are well-intentioned but can be doing more harm than good.'' Buttigieg (D)(4): 'Buttigieg says he doesn't support boycotts of companies over political donations' [CNN[9]]. 'South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg cautioned against boycotts of companies like Chick-fil-A because of their political giving in an interview on Wednesday, arguing that it leads people to 'sometimes slip into a sort of virtue signaling in some cases where we're not really being consistent.' The comment — which comes a day after Buttigieg, who is gay, said he doesn't support Chick-fil-A's politics but supports its chicken — is significant because of past controversy surrounding Chick-fil-A. The fast food company's president Dan Cathy said in 2012 that the company was supportive of 'the biblical definition of the family unit'=; and that society was 'inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage.' As a result, many groups boycotted the chain.' •People have different ideas about being helpful. Moulton (D): 'Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton joins 2020 presidential race' [Des Moines Register[10]].

'It's time for the generation that fought in Iraq to take over for the generation that sent us there.' He's called health care 'a right every American must be guaranteed,' pushed to toughen gun laws, was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, has championed a federal 'Green Corps' modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, and has called for an end to the Electoral College.

She would pay for it with revenue generated by her proposed increase in taxes for America's most wealthy families and corporations, which the campaign estimates to be $2.75 trillion over 10 years. In addition to eliminating undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities, she would expand federal grants to help students with nontuition expenses and create a $50 billion fund to support historically black colleges and universities. She would eliminate up to $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of less than $100,000; borrowers who make between $100,000 and $250,000 would have a portion of their debt forgiven.' • Kudos to Warren because she's in there punching on policy.

'Assessing the Democratic presidential primary at this point is a nearly impossible task. With around 15 serious candidates who have declared or formed an exploratory committee, and with another handful seriously looking at joining the race, the slate is very much in flux. Like the Republican primary in 2016, small changes in the polling position of candidates can translate to a large change in their position relative to one another, which in turn incentivizes rising candidates to stay in. So rather than, say, power-ranking the candidates - how does one really decide how to rank John Hickenlooper versus Jay Inslee? - I will look at them through the lens of 'buy' versus 'sell'.' • Fun methodology!

'Jane McAlevey on How To Organize for Power' [Current Affairs[31]]. McAlevey: 'I'm not critical of mobilization, I'm very clear that we need plenty of mobilization. It's just, I'm critical when that's all we do. The difference between the two—and this is sort of the essential reason why we have to do both, not just one—mobilizing is essentially when we just spend all of our time talking to people who already agree with us. It's getting more effective at the technology of turnout. It's calling up a protest, and 300 people show up the first time, and you say 'Wow, that wasn't what we thought,' and you double down, and you do way better social media, and you use every single piece of technology you can, and you get 4,000 out the next time. And that's a huge jump, and you feel great. The problem is that your organization is more like 100,000, and so you're still only turning out a teeny fraction, and even worse, you're not actually engaging anyone or expanding your base. So, what organizing is, by contrast, if I just use that example: If your base is 100,000, organizing is an explicit strategy to go from 100,000 to 1,000,000 and to make it simple, realistic, with a plan. In organizing, we're consciously, every single day, doing what we call 'base expansion.'' • If Sanders is organizing, and not mobilizing His staff and he are in for quite a ride.

Tech: 'The Dark Side of Fitness Tracking' [Medium[42]]. '[F]or many people, donning a health-focused device each day isn't necessarily a good thing. Research suggests that even if you don't ditch your tracker after the first few months[43], it can be difficult to develop a healthy, effective relationship with the device that's monitoring your calories, steps, and minutes of sleep. In one study[44], published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, overweight participants who wore fitness trackers each day lost less weight than those who didn't. In another[45], people who wore them for a full year were no healthier than they'd been at the start of the study. On the other end of the spectrum, users can become too obsessed with the data their devices are collecting, leading them to self-diagnose problems that don't exist[46]; they can get so invested in their stats that it drains any enjoyment[47] from previously pleasant activities; and, in some cases, fitness trackers can even exacerbate disordered eating behaviors[48]' Transportation: 'Union Pacific Corp.'s precision railroading plan is triggering a major shift in the carrier's investment plans. The freight carrier has halted construction of a sprawling $550 million facility in Brazos, Texas, and closed two other so-called hump yards as the railroad embraces an operating strategy that calls for fewer, longer trains' [Wall Street Journal[49]]. 'The Union Pacific's Brazos facility was the single largest capital project in the 156-year-old railroad's history and was meant to help with the expected shipping demand in the region. The changes at Union Pacific already appear to be bearing fruit: The railroad's first-quarter profit rose 6% thanks to lower operating expenses that offset lost revenue from severe weather that hit its operations.'

And: '[The information and communications technology (ICT)] still contributes to about 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is still twice that of civil aviation. What is worse, its contribution is growing more quickly than that of civil aviation.' 'What lies beneath: Robert Macfarlane travels 'Underland'' [Guardian[51]]. 'In the summer of 2010, I made the first notes towards a book called Underland, about burial and unburial, deep time and journeys into darkness, which would eventually take almost a decade to write. It was hard, that summer, not to think of the underland, for three extraordinary stories were unfolding, dominating global news for months: the Deepwater Horizon[52] disaster, the entrapment of 33 Chilean miners beneath the Atacama desert[53], and the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull[54] volcano.' • Damn, one more book to read. This article has a fascinating perspective, and it's well worth a read. I quoted this paragraph to memoriaize the Deepwater Horizon disaster; I still remember the live videos from the ocean floor 'Was There a Civilization On Earth Before Humans?' [The Atlantic[55]]. 'When it comes to direct evidence of an industrial civilization—things like cities, factories, and roads—the geologic record doesn't go back past what's called the Quaternary period 2.6 million years ago. For example, the oldest large-scale stretch of ancient surface lies in the Negev Desert. It's 'just' 1.8 million years old And, if we're going back this far, we're not talking about human civilizations anymore. So, could researchers find clear evidence that an ancient species built a relatively short-lived industrial civilization long before our own? Perhaps, for example, some early mammal rose briefly to civilization building during the Paleocene epoch about 60 million years ago. Fifty-six million years ago, Earth passed through the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). During the PETM, the planet's average temperature climbed as high as 15 degrees Fahrenheit above what we experience today. It was a world almost without ice, as typical summer temperatures at the poles reached close to a balmy 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Looking at the isotopic record from the PETM, scientists see both carbon and oxygen isotope ratios spiking in exactly the way we expect to see in the Anthropocene record.' • It's always been my secret theory that civilization killed the dinosaurs. No evidence, though!s 'Southern Ocean diatoms: small, yet mighty!' [oceanbites[56]]. 'The organic carbon produced by the phytoplankton helps fuel the carbon cycle by either: 1) being eaten by zooplankton, a type of larger planktonic organism 2) sinking out to the deep ocean after dying or 3) contracting a marine virus that causes the cellular content (organic carbon) to leak out. The contribution that phytoplankton make to the carbon pump differs between ocean regions as the types and abundance of phytoplankton vary. Phytoplankton species vary between the different regions of the ocean depending on specific environmental conditions, such as light, nutrients or temperature.' ''Pointless' rare knee bone makes evolutionary comeback in humans' [Sky News[57]]. 'The fabella, described as the 'appendix of the skeleton', is buried in a tendon behind the knee and acted as a kneecap in Old World monkeys. It can cause pain and discomfort and was once rare in humans - but a new study has shown it is becoming more common. Scientists from Imperial College London (ICL) examined 21,000 knee studies from 27 countries spanning 150 years. Between 1918 and 2018, the number of people with a fabella increased more than threefold. In 1918, just 11.2% of the world population had one, but by 2018 the percentage had risen to 39%.' • Evolution in historical time. Amazing. 'A highway runs through it' [Grist[58]]. 'Progressives like Chris Sensenig now see freeway removal as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redress the wrongs of the past and make cities radically greener. For nearly a decade, the urban designer has been thinking seriously about what Oakland would look like without I-980. And the more he thought about it — the more he collected old ma 's and pictures of the landscape before the highway — the more excited he became. He joined up with other like-minded people to form ConnectOakland[59], a small organization dedicated to envisioning a neighborhood free of I-980. 'The key thing is that this is public land,' Sensenig said. 'Public land is for the public good. We should be seeking to maximize the public good, not just accepting whatever happens to already be there.' • But the local politics are interesting; apparently, when I-980 was put through, the community was involved, so they are invested in a way that, say, the North End of Boston was not with the horrid 'Central Artery.' MMT 'The left should resist the siren song of 'modern monetary theory'' [Heather Boushey, WaPo[60]]. 'But to me, as someone who shares some of the policy goals of MMT advocates, it seems crazy to give up on taxes as an important source of revenue for vital social programs — to define taxes as, in a sense, irrelevant to government spending — at a time when the public, finally, seems to have an appetite for universal health care, wealth taxes and similar ambitious policies. At such a moment, why embrace a theory that has never been tested on a significant scale? To shift toward an economic theory that sees taxes as largely irrelevant to government spending is economically and politically unwise.' •'Heather Boushey is the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.'

Federal regulators are focused on commercial claims that CBD has beneficial health effects, for which there's no conclusive evidence. Meanwhile, retailers claim the additive can help with chronic pain or anxiety, but again, there's no evidence. Then there's the unanswered question, as the FDA noted earlier this year, of whether there are negative long-term effects from CBD use. None of this has gotten in the way of clever marketing aimed at consumers who don't know—or care—about the latest scientific study.' • Amazingly, Bloomberg does not expand the CBD acronym; it refers to cannabidiol, 'the second-most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis[64]' (after THC, with which I am familiar) but non-intoxicating.

This is the second straight year that migration to the state was negative, and it's a trend that is speeding up. Every year since 2014, net migration has fallen. Besides births, the main reason California's population hasn't already started falling has been international migration into the state. Every year since 2011, net domestic migration has been negative—i.e., more people leave California than move in from other states. But from 2011 to 2016, the number of international migrants moving into California was larger than the number of locals who were moving out.' • Hmm. 'Lawyer files $5-million claim, saying L.A.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Readers, politics is a little light because I spent too much time on Boeing. I'll add a bit more shortly. -lambert UPDATE All done! Trade 'Exclusive: China's huge Airbus order padded by old or incomplete deals - sources' [Reuters[1]]. 'A landmark order from China for 300 Airbus jets signed during a state visit last week was bolstered by repeat announcements of dozens of existing deals and advance approval for deals that have yet to be struck, two people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>Echoing an umbrella order for 300 Boeing jets awarded during a visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump in 2017, the headline figure for the new 'framework order' for European jets was partly driven by political considerations, the people said.' • Film at 11! Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 2020Biden: '2020 presidential election: Joe Biden advisers smell a conspiracy' [Axios[2]]. 'Joe Biden advisers believe coverage of allegations of inappropriate behavior is being stoked by rival Democrats — a dynamic that could actually fire up the vice president at a time when others see success as increasingly improbable. Why it matters: Several around Biden think advisers to Bernie Sanders are at least partly behind the anti-Biden campaign. One prominent backer thinks Biden will run, and 'is ready to kill Bernie.' I got this text last night from a source close to Biden: 'VP directed staff this evening to reach out to supporters and donors with a simple message — full steam ahead.'' • If you read the quote carefully, you can see that Biden might have any number of reasons to 'kill Bernie.' Festival of Buttigieg today: Buttigieg (D) (1): 'Buttigieg Says Flooding in the Midwest Is Not Big Deal, Just a Small Fraction of Year's Rainfall' [CEPR[3]]. 'That is not quite what he said, but it is pretty much in the same spirit as what Buttigieg said about trade and jobs, according to the Washington Post. The post told readers: 'Buttigieg has said six times as many jobs were lost because of automation as trade from 2000 to 2010.' This is more or less right in the same way that Nebraska will get far more rain over the course of 2019 than the rain that caused the recent flooding. And, the assertion makes about as much sense in the context of the floods as in the context of jobs lost to imports.' • Looks like Mayor Pete is trying to drive in Yang's lane? Buttigieg (D) (2): 'After Gaza slaughter, Buttigieg praised Israeli security responses as 'moving' and faulted Democrats for easy judgment' [Mondoweiss[4]]. 'Buttigieg is a quick study; and what leaps out from these remarks is how completely the Rhodes Scholar imbibed the official pro-Israel version of events, and showed contempt for Palestinian understanding. There is no sense in Buttigieg's remarks that Israel is a militarized, rightwing country that adores Donald Trump and that is led by a strongman and that answers resistance to the existing order with overwhelming force that international human rights organizations said at the time of his remarks were likely war crimes. Buttigieg did not meet with AIPAC last week; but we can expect Buttigieg to take a centrist pro-Israel position in opposition to the Democratic base, which is highly critical of Israel.' Buttigieg (D) (3): 'Have You Heard? Pete Buttigieg Is Really Smart' [Jacobin[5]]. 'For the upper professional-managerial class (PMC), guys like this represent a dreamy ideal of human supremacy. That's because for them, all of life is an Ivy League application. Well-rounded 'smartness' is everything, even in the wake of recent news that this is not necessarily what elite college admissions are based upon. As a result, BOOTedgedge has been the focus of a media frenzy, despite polling far behind Sanders and Biden (even 538 is skeptical[6] of his recent much-ballyhooed jump in Iowa). CNN's Chris Cillizza finds his resum 'remarkable.'[7] Some call him 'bookish.' Queerty.com exults that he 'represents the best and brightest of our country[8].' A New Republic headline uses the word 'Genius[9].'' • 'Best and brightest[10]' without irony? Really? And, as usual, see Thomas Frank on 'smart.'[11] Buttigieg (D) (4): 'South Bend mayoral candidate says her code violations will help a push for 'equal protection'' [South Bend Tribune[12]]. '[Common Council Member Regina Williams-Preston] claims the city targeted her and her husband's properties, and those of their neighbors, with 'aggressive code enforcement' to further two goals: Mayor Pete Buttigieg's pledge to address 1,000 vacant and abandoned homes in 1,000 days, and the West Side Main Streets Plan, which calls for revitalizing the neighborhoods between Western Avenue and Lincoln Way West In light of her mayoral campaign, Williams-Preston sought to frame the discussion more broadly than her case, saying the city's aggressive code enforcement — a revitalization 'tool' in which the city gradually buys up and consolidates properties to give or sell cheaply to developers — ended up hurting many African-Americans during the 1000 Homes initiative. She argues that many of the owners were local African-Americans who had inherited dilapidated houses from their parents and wanted to fix them up but couldn't afford to.' • Hmm. Second story on Black 'intergenerational wealth' I've seen in the last week. Gravel (D): We are in the midst of a crisis of the everyday: people do not have access to healthcare, housing, or clean water; we devote trillions to unending wars in places most couldn't identify; the people's will is an afterthought. Don't be afraid to say it: this country is broken! — Mike Gravel (@MikeGravel) April 2, 2019[13]Sanders (D) (1): This should cause a liberal Democrat extracranial splatterfest: INBOX: FOX News to host Town Hall with Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders pic.twitter.com/kLw7NiOBrk[14]; - Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) April 3, 2019[15]Sanders (D) (2): 'Takeaways from the first 2020 presidential fundraising numbers' [CNN[16]]. 'As expected, Sanders set the early pace in fundraising, with more than $18 million raised from 525,000 individual contributors who gave, on average, $20 Sanders has a massive existing list from his 2016 campaign, and in that race, demonstrated his appeal in the online giving world. (He raised an unbelievable $228 million for his primary against Hillary Clinton, a number that still boggles the mind.) Still, just because Sanders' number isn't surprising, it also shouldn't be taken for granted. Sanders' fundraising ability — and the fact that he rarely if ever holds fundraisers to collect cash — is a major advantage for his campaign as we move forward into the rest of this year and into 2020 when voters start voting.' • I like the Sanders' average contribution has dropped. It means the 90% are donating. Sanders (D) (3): 'Sanders launches mega volunteer program' [Politico[17]]. 'Bernie Sanders' campaign will unveil a slate of top hires and kickoff events Wednesday — the latest sign that he plans to harness his record-breaking grassroots army earlier and more strategically than he did during his first run for the White House. More than 1 million people have signed up to volunteer for his campaign, aides said, and the Sanders team will ask them Wednesday to host house parties across the country on April 27, a date that will double as the official launch of Sanders' 2020 organizing program.' • Looks like [lambert preens] I was right: There are three carefully assembled strategic assets for the Sanders campaign: From 2016, the list (not available to other Democrats); from 2018, the media empire (not available to other Democrats); and for 2020, the canvassing operation (not available to other Democrats). Expect continued volatility as liberal Democrat power brokers and media assets discover they don't have the power they are accustomed to having. Trump: 'Trump says Biden accusations are work of Dem 'socialists'' [Politico[18]]. 'President Donald Trump said Tuesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is 'being taken care of pretty well by the socialists,' suggesting that a recent wave of criticism of the potential 2020 presidential candidate is the product of attacks hatched by his own party's left wing.' • Liberal Democrats agree! (Personally, I think Putin planted the clips in the C-SPAN video library.) Warren: 'Elizabeth Warren: Corporate executives must face jail time for overseeing massive scams' [WaPo[19]]. 'we should enact the Ending Too Big To Jail Act, which I introduced last year. That bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks accountable for scams by requiring them to certify that they conducted a 'due diligence' inquiry and found that no illegal conduct was occurring on their watch. This would force executives to look for wrongdoing or face prosecution for filing false certifications with the government. The proposal would also create a permanent and well-funded unit dedicated to investigating financial crimes.' • That's the stuff to give the troops! Although oddly, or not, Warren focuses on Wells-Fargo, and not not on Holder and Obama's miserable record of non-prosecution after the Crash. 'Black leaders blast Dem war on super PACs' [Politico[20]]. 'In a letter obtained by POLITICO, The Collective PAC — which helps elect black candidates to office — asked major liberal groups like Indivisible and Democracy for America to stop calling for Democratic presidential contenders to distance themselves from single-candidate super PACs. Such groups play an important role in electing candidates of color, they argued, especially in primaries, when the Democratic establishment has often overlooked black contenders and left it to outside donors to bolster their campaigns.'RussiaGate'List: Attorney General William Barr Summarizes Famous Broadway Musicals - McSweeney's Internet Tendency' [McSweeney's Internet Tendency[21]]. 'Little Shop of Horrors: 'Man feeds plant.'Realignment and Legitimacy'How a Petty Tyrant Turned a Functional DSA Branch into a Church' [Benjamin Studebaker[22]]. 'In the beginning, Pittsburgh was a great branch. As recently as six months ago, there were 1,000 dues-paying members. There were four elected officials in Pittsburgh who had won with the aid of the branch's endorsement and hard work, and the branch was running a wide array of issue-based campaigns in the city on labor, housing, and more. The success of the branch in the 2017 elections led many more candidates to seek its support in 2018. Everything was looking up. Today the chapter's membership is decimated. Only around 50 members attended the February 2019 general meeting.' • Due to 'the clique.' More: 'I admit to feeling a certain degree of sympathy. These [the clique] are clearly deeply alienated people who have been forced to retreat into political organising to find the meaning and community they cannot get outside it. Capitalism regularly creates miserable people, and miserable people lack the psychological resources to put the needs of the community or the movement ahead of their own. They are themselves emotionally under-resourced, and we cannot expect people with this much pain inside them to protect others from their pain.' • My first thought was to be reminded of the problem (unrealized (unrealizable?) opportunity) the homeless posed for Occupy. My second thought was to reread the piece and note that the head of the clique was 'previously expelled from the Israeli Communist Party for 'internal subversion.'' Or, in LeCarrs world, so they say. This is an excellent piece of reporting, well worth read. An absolutely horrifying anecdote of the Obama administration. Thread: For the fourth time, I've come across a Democrat involved in stimulus negotiations in 2008-2009 saying some version of 'we could have done nothing and let things get worse, like FDR did.' FDR didn't do that. You guys should own your own mistakes. - Eric Rauchway (@rauchway) March 29, 2019[23]Chris Arnade returns, and very good thing, too (via Brindle): (Open twitter, clear throat) 1. So many people dying from drugs it keeps going up it is an absolute national disgrace. It isn't just a white thing, or a rural thing — it is happening in communities of every race in every place - Chris Arnade (@Chris_arnade) April 2, 2019[24]'Nancy Pelosi Believes in Nothing' [Jacob Bachrach, Truthout[25]]. 'There is a curious void at the heart of Democratic politics. It isn't necessary to believe in some absurd, magical notion of willpower to note that at its highest level, the party seems to lack an essential, motivating will. Instead, it views itself as something more akin to a professional membership organization that has a convention in a nice hotel every few years. They are not so much an emperor without clothes—that grand, ridiculous figure for the delusions of power—as they are clothes without an emperor; a lot of nice fabric blown away in a breeze and borne aloft on someone else's hot air.' • Taking office but not taking power.Stats Watch ADP Employment Report, March 2019: 'ADP estimates that private payroll growth in Friday's employment report for March will rise', but below consensus [Econoday[26]]. '[A] sharp upward revision to February in Friday's data is a possibility,' as this month. And but: 'This month the rate of ADPs private employment year-over-year growth is on the low side of the tight range seen over this year. However, the rolling average of the year-over-year rate of growth remains unchanged for the last 7 months. Last month's employment numbers were revised upward' [Econintersect[27]]. 'ADP employment has not been a good predictor of BLS non-farm private job growth.' And: 'Below the consensus forecast' [Calculated Risk[28]]. Institute For Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Index, March 2019: 'Forecasters were leaning the right way but just not enough as ISM's non-manufacturing index moderated more than expected' [Econoday[29]]. 'Volatility like this is not the norm for this composite index where monthly change is usually muted. But backlogs and employment are offsets to exports and inventories. Altogether and despite the swing lower for the headline index, this report is probably consistent with stable and healthy conditions for the bulk of the U.S. economy which may or may not have slowed at quarter end.' • The future lies ahead! And: 'This suggests slower expansion in March than in February' [Calculated Risk[30]]. PMI Services Index, March 2019: '[A] solid pick-up in composite activity' [Econoday[31]]. 'The report describes order growth as solid including for exports, something that underscores what remains strong foreign demand for U.S. services. Yet business confidence isn't improving, slipping now to its least optimistic showing since December 2017. On the price front, the results are softening with pressure in costs and traction for selling prices easing.' MBA Mortgage Applications, week of March 29, 2019: 'The big drop in mortgage rates isn't going unnoticed by homeowners who filed refinancing applications in droves' [Econoday[32]]. And: 'Now that mortgage rates have fallen more than 50 bps from the highs last year, a number of recent buyers are able to refinance' [Calculated Risk[33]]. 'According to the MBA, purchase activity is up 10% year-over-year.' Commodities: 'A Key to the Arctic's Oil Riches Lies Hidden in Ohio' [New York Times[34]]. The deck: 'The findings of a test well drilled in Alaska three decades ago have been a closely guarded secret. We found answers in a Cleveland courthouse.' • Spoiler alert: It's a dry hole. Commodities: 'The Biggest Saudi Oil Field Is Fading Faster Than Anyone Guessed' [Bloomberg[35]]. 'Now the market finally knows: Ghawar in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest conventional oil field, can produce a lot less than almost anyone believed. When Saudi Aramco on Monday published its first ever profit figures since its nationalization nearly 40 years ago, it also lifted the veil of secrecy around its mega oil fields. The company's bond prospectus revealed that Ghawar is able to pump a maximum of 3.8 million barrels a day — well below the more than 5 million that had become conventional wisdom in the market.' • Oopsie.* * *Boeing 737 MAX: Manufacturing: 'Lithuanian man flies alone on commercial plane to Italy' [Associated Press[36]]. ' A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.. The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.' •I wonder why? Manufacturing: 'Between Two Boeing Crashes, Days of Silence and Mistrust' [New York Times[37]]. 'In the days after the crash, American aviation officials visiting Jakarta cast aspersions on their Indonesian counterparts, even as they refused to speak on the record: Which was more reliable? An airplane manufacturer that was one of the most respected companies in the United States, or a low-cost carrier with a long history of shocking safety lapses[38] operating in a country troubled by corruption and weak regulation?' • 'A country troubled by corruption and weak regulation.' Manfacturing: 'Whistleblowers in 737 Max Case Say FAA Was Lax in Inspector Training' [Bloomberg[39]]. ''Multiple whistleblowers' provided the committee with information alleging that 'numerous FAA employees, including those involved in the Aircraft Evaluation Group for the Boeing 737 MAX, had not received proper training and valid certifications,' Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said in a letter to the FAA's Acting Administrator Daniel Elwell Tuesday.' Manufacturing: 'U.S. Air Force Again Halts Delivery of Boeing's Tanker Over Debris' [Bloomberg[40]]. Amazing quotes: 'Elaborating on the trash left behind by workers, [Secretary Heather Wilson] told the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee later in the day that it was a 'manufacturing discipline' issue on the assembly line where 'we saw a breakdown.' 'If you drop a wrench you have to find a wrench,' she said. 'You have to wipe down surfaces so you don't have pieces of aluminum that over time get in the midst of things and cause serious problems.' The latest delivery halt was prompted after the service opened up some closed compartments, such as inside wings, and found flaws, she said without elaborating.' • Sounds like a demoralizes workforce, to me. I sure hope there aren't loose wrenches sliiding around inside the wings of civilian aircraft, because that would be bad. Manufacturing: 'Pontifications: I don't know what to make of this' [Leeham News[41]]. 'One can't help but think, a lot, about the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes and the facts that Boeing created the system, linked it to one sensor, not two, didn't tell the airlines pilots about it, didn't include it in pilot manuals, didn't have a safety alert system as standard equipment, initially blamed the Lion Air pilots and reportedly lobbied Donald Trump not to ground the airplanes.' •And self-certified the system too[42], let us remember. More: 'Four concurrent commercial airplane programs (the KC-46A being a hybrid between commercial and military) each had trouble. Two of their last four airplanes have been grounded by regulators. A third airplane had such poor quality control the customer stopped taking delivery. Three of the four were years late. What's going on here? Boeing resources were clearly stretched too thin. Billions of dollars were going out the door in cost overruns. Were bad management decisions made by the bean-counting McNerney regime? Was there something systemic happening? Or just a run of bad luck and bad timing?' • Good questions. Well worth a read. Manufacturing: 'Disaster and the Boeing CEO' [Crain's Chicago Business[43]]. 'Though [Boeing CEO Dennis] Muilenburg's career will be defined by the 737 Max, [Leeham's Scott] Hamilton and [Cowen's Cai von Rumohr] say the crisis is unlikely to end it. That would require a game-changing development, like federal prosecutors discovering that executives misled regulators about safety.* But [Erik Gordon of the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business], who views Muilenburg's performance in the hot seat less favorably, is less sure. He is particularly critical of Boeing's decision after the crashes to make standard on the Max a safety feature that was previously optional and cost extra. He argues that the move makes it appear as if safety were optional. 'It has negative PR consequences in the way that punching a guy in the face has PR problems: The real problem is that you punched someone,' Gordon says. 'Dennis' mistakes are glaring such that, if I were on the board, I would be holding side meetings saying, 'Do we have alternatives for a CEO?'** Ironically, the crisis Muilenburg faces is largely of McNerney's making. Decisions about the Max's design and budget, as well as to rush production to beat competition from Airbus, happened on McNerney's watch. The first Max test flight came seven months after Muilenburg became chief executive in 2015. By then, Hamilton says, the die was already cast.' • Yup. Boeing stumbled with the 787, but still kept moving forward, though off balance. Then, with the 737, it fell. NOTES * MCAS was self-certified by Boeing, and filed the tech doc with the FAA late. Perhaps that's what the criminal investigation is looking into. ** So, I'm not the only one.* * *Manufacturing: 'Daimler CEO: Boeing safety debate highlights challenge for autonomous tech' [Reuters[44]]. ''What is very important is the psychological dimension. If you look at what is happening with Boeing then you can imagine what happens when such a system has an incident,' Zetsche said, commenting on the motor industry's efforts to develop autonomous cars. Half of U.S. adults think self-driving vehicles are more dangerous than those driven by people, while two-thirds would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found this week. In the same poll, about 63 percent of respondents said they would not pay more to have a self-driving feature on their vehicle, and 41 percent of the rest said they would not pay more than $2,000.' • Don't worry. Silicon Valley will be programming ethics into the robot car AIs. Tech: 'Microsoft announces it will shut down ebook program and confiscate its customers' libraries' [Boing Boing[45]]. 'Microsoft has a DRM-locked ebook store that isn't making enough money, so they're shutting it down and taking away every book that every one of its customers acquired effective July 1. Customers will receive refunds. This puts the difference between DRM-locked media and unencumbered media into sharp contrast. I have bought a lot of MP3s over the years, thousands of them, and many of the retailers I purchased from are long gone, but I still have the MP3s. Likewise, I have bought many books from long-defunct booksellers and even defunct publishers, but I still own those books. When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didn't get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund.' • Well, that's why we need DRM, right? Tech: 'Toyota to allow free access to 24,000 hybrid and electric vehicle tech patents to boost market' [Japan Times[46]]. 'Toyota said it will offer around 23,740 patents related to electrification technology, with the grant period running from Wednesday to the end of 2030. Toyota also hopes that opening up its technology for motors and batteries, which are key components of electric and fuel-cell vehicles, will increase their supply and help it to cut costs in developing such vehicles. But it remains uncertain whether the use of Toyota patents will be as widespread as the carmaker hopes, observers said. Toyota said in January 2015 it will offer patents related to its fuel-cell vehicles but it has only led to a dozen contracts.' Tech: 'The ugliness of photorealism' [Wireframe[47]]. 'The issue of photorealism in games is a matter of personal taste, a question of aesthetics. I'd argue that what people are responding to is the technical mastery. That we've been conditioned to believe more polygons, more particles, newer more advanced shaders are what is crucial and amazing. Beauty can rise up out of ugliness. It is possible. But I can't help but find the reflexive need to fall over these massive commercial ventures and characterise them as 'beautiful' extremely distasteful. We should know better. Most, if not entirely all, game developers who work at triple-A studios don't enjoy many protections from abusive crunch practices: massive layoffs (as we've just seen at Activision Blizzard) to make earnings calls sound better, or the ability to petition for the kinds of bonuses or residuals they deserve from shipping a title that sells. We know that labour conditions in this industry suck because we know how quickly people burn out and leave.' Transport: 'Filling the Friendly Skies With Hot Air' [Bloomberg[48]]. 'In 2016, Lockheed Martin Corp. won a nearly $500 million order for as many as a dozen of its hybrid-electric LMH-1 airships (operational in 2020 or 2021) from a buyer who plans to lease their 20-tons of freight capacity to Arctic oil and gas companies. Leasing an airship is cheaper than building new roads across permafrost melting due to climate change, and roughly seven times cheaper per ton than using heavy-lift helicopters. As China and the rest of the world extend their search for raw materials into ever-more remote regions, airships are likely to become crucial links in logistics chains.' The Biosphere 'What can bees teach economists about how markets work?' [BBC[49]]. 'In the 1830s, a bee-rights movement emerged in the US, with the motto: 'Never kill a bee.'' • Time presses, and I can't summarize this article. But it's full of facts and interesting twists and well worth a read, especially for how Nobel [sic] Prize-winning economist James Meade used bees as an example of positive externalities, when he didn't know anything about bees! 'Fossil Fuel Industry, Corporate Lobbyists ...oliberal Economists Push Carbon Pricing Schemes to Attack Green New Deal' [Little Sis[50]]. 'Steven Rattner - the ex-Obama official, longtime private equity investor, and overseer of Michael Bloomberg's vast wealth - is the latest big name establishment figure to go after the Green New Deal.' • Here's a handy map of some of his connections:Whenever you hear one of these grifters use the word 'common sense,' check your valuables. 'Can we truly think about climate change at all?' [The Outline[51]]. The deck: 'Part one of a three-part series on how philosophy contends with our possible annihilation.' Not sure about this one, but I am pleased that the culture hasn't completely rotted. Here are the first paragraphs:In Butler's 2017 video installation, 'On Exactitude in Science,' is one of the most remarkable things I've seen in the last few months. The work consists of two screens. On the left plays Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out Of Balance, the 1982 stoner classic of slow motion and time lapse footage of cities and landscapes; complete with pulsing, shimmering Philip Glass soundtrack. On the right: Butler's shot-by-shot remake, in which he has — somehow, marvelously, painstakingly — reproduced the film in its entirety by modding Grand Theft Auto V. On paper, reproducing Koyannisqatsi in GTA form sounds like it would be an impressive technical feat — surely nothing more. But when you actually sit down and watch the thing, it turns out to be utterly spellbinding. For long stretches, it can be hard to remember which screen is which: Butler's land- and city-spaces are so unerringly accurate that I found myself checking left and right to keep my bearings, miming writing with my dominant hand to confirm. But then every now and then — and as the film develops, increasingly often — a human face will enter, and the difference becomes bluntly, laughably obvious. On the left, commuters walk briskly. People — builders, waitresses, fighter pilots — stand by machines, looking into the camera intently, often slightly uncomfortably. On the right, their doubles simply mill about, almost at random; their faces, at any rate generic, have nothing in them.Impressive. Do we have any philosophers in the readership who can venture into the piece for several more paragraphs?

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

The family did great; you all clean up well, you look good. So the game plan for today is to do our first round of 30-minute questioning. Each senator will have 30 minutes to interact with Judge Barrett. Then we will follow up with a second round of 20 minutes. That is what we have been doing in the committee since I have been here. I doubt--I know we won't get it all done today, but the goal is to get through the first 30 minute period today, then come back Wednesday and finish up, then we will go on about our business. So I will try to--I will make sure I stay within 30 minutes for sure, and if I can shorten it up, I will. </p><p>So let's get to it. You can start the clock. So you can relax a bit here to judge and take your mask off. So yesterday, we had a lot of discussion about the affordable healthcare act. What I'm going to try to do very briefly this morning is to demonstrate the difference between politics and judging. All of my colleagues, on the other side have very emotional pleas about Obamacare, charts of people with pre-existing conditions. I want to give you my side of the story about Obamacare. This is Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina talking. This is not a question directed at you. From my point of view, Obamacare has been a disaster for the stated state of South Carolina. </p><p>All of you over there want to impose Obamacare on South Carolina. We don't want it. We want something better. We want something different. You know what we want in South Carolina? South Carolina care, not Obamacare. Now why do we one thing? </p><p>Under the affordable care act, three states get 35 percent of the money, folks. Can you name them? I'll help you, California, New York, and Massachusetts. They're 22 percent of the population. Senator Feinstein is from California, Nancy Pelosi is from California, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Senate, is from New York, and Massachusetts is Elizabeth Warren. Now, why did they get 35 percent of the money when they are only 22 percent of the population? That's the way they designed the law; the more you spend, the more you get.  </p><p>What does it mean for the people of South Carolina? If you had a per patient--per patient formula where you got the same amount from the federal government to the state, whether you lived in Charleston, Columbia or San Francisco or New York City if you leveled that out, it would be almost $1 billion more for us in South Carolina. So to my friends over there, we're going to fight back; we want our money. If you're going to have money allocated for Obamacare, we're not going to sit back and quietly let you give 35 percent of it to three states.  </p><p>What else has happened without? Four rural hospitals have closed because the revenue streams are uncertain. 30 percent increase in premiums in South Carolina for those on Obamacare. I was on Obamacare for a few years before I got on TRICARE. My premiums went up 300 percent, my coverage was almost nonexistent, a $6000 deductible. So I want a better deal, and that is a political fight I'm in a campaign at home.  </p><p>If it were up to me, we would block grant this money, send it back to the states in a more fair allocation, and we would require pre-existing conditions to be covered as part of the block grant. We want sick people covered, but I've got an idea. I think South Carolina may be able to deal with diabetes better than and different than California. If you want good outcomes in medicine, you need innovation, and the best way to get innovation is to allow people to try different things to get better outcomes, so the debate on health care is consolidating all the power in Washington, have some bureaucrat you'll never meet running this program versus having it centered in the state where you live. </p><p>Under my proposal, South Carolina would get almost $1 billion more. The state of South Carolina would be in charge of administering Obamacare. They couldn't build football stadiums with the money. They'd have to spend it on healthcare. They'd have to cover pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>But if as a patient in South Carolina, you would have a voice you don't have today. If you didn't like what was happening to you on the healthcare front, you could go to local officials and complain. And the people you're complaining to live in your state. They send their family to the same hospital as you go. That's a structural difference. That's got nothing to do with this hearing. It's got everything to do with politics. We on this side do not believe Obamacare is the best way to provide quality healthcare over time. Our friends on the other side, this is a placeholder for single-payer healthcare. If you don't believe me, just ask them.  </p><p>So that's the fight going into 2020. Doesn't make them bad; it just makes them different. If it were up to me, bureaucrats would not be administering healthcare from Washington. People in South Carolina would be running healthcare. If it were up to me, we'd get more money under Obamacare than we do today. 35 percent would not go to three states. And sick people would be covered. So that's the political debate. We're involved in a campaign in South Carolina, and my fate will be left up to the people of South Carolina. So that's what Obamacare is all about.  </p><p>Now how do you play in here, Judge? There's a lawsuit involving the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court, and we'll talk about that in a bit. And the difference between analyzing a lawsuit and having a political argument is fundamentally different, and I hope to be able to demonstrate that over the course of the day. And I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle will not feel shy about telling my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why we think we have a better idea on healthcare.  </p><p>Now, the bottom line here, Judge, you said yesterday something that struck me, and I want the American people to understand what you meant. You said you are an originalist. Is that true? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: What does that mean in English?  </p><p>BARRETT: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>GRAHAM: Press the button. I mean, we all love Senator Lee, but in English. </p><p>BARRETT: In English, okay, so in English that means that I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: That meaning doesn't change over time, and it's not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it. </p><p>GRAHAM: So in other words, you're bound by the people who wrote it at the time they wrote it. That keeps you from substituting your judgment for theirs. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. </p><p>GRAHAM: All right. Justice Scalia, he was an originalist, right? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, he was. </p><p>GRAHAM: People say that you're a female Scalia. What would you say? </p><p>BARRETT: I would say that Justice Scalia was obviously a mentor, and as I said when I accepted the president's nomination, that his philosophy is mine, too. You know, he was a very eloquent defender of originalism, and that was also true of textualism, which is the way that I approach statutes and their interpretation, and similarly to what I just said about originalism, for textualism the judge approaches the text as it was written, with the meaning it had at the time and doesn't infuse their own meaning into it.  </p><p>But I want to be careful to say that if I'm confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett, and that's so because originalists don't always agree, and neither do textualists. Justices Scalia and Thomas disagreed often enough that my friend, Judge Amul Thapar, teaches a class called Scalia Versus Thomas. You know, it's not a mechanical exercise. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I'll wait till the movie comes out. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So the bottom line for me is there is a narrative building in this country, and again, you can stand down. This is just me speaking for me. Justice Ginsburg was an iconic figure in American history, just not the law. She was a trailblazer. She fought for better conditions for women throughout society. She was unashamedly progressive in her personal thought. She was devout to her faith. She worked for the ACLU. She was proudly pro-choice personally, but all of us on this side, apparently when they voted, accepted that she was highly qualified.  </p><p>What I want the American people to know, I think it's okay to be religiously conservative. I think it's okay to be personally pro-choice. </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: I think it's okay to live your life in a traditional, Catholic fashion and you still be qualified for the Supreme Court. So all the young conservative women out there, this hearing, to me, is about a place for you. I hope when this is all over that you--there will be a place for you at the table. There will be a place for you at the Supreme Court like there was for Judge Ginsburg.  </p><p>And to President Trump, I don't know if you're listening or not, by picking Judge Barrett, you have publicly said you find value in all of these characteristics. But beyond anything else, you find Judge Barrett to be highly qualified. I would say you're one of the greatest picks President Trump could have made. And from the conservative side of the aisle, you're one of the most qualified people of your generation.  </p><p>Let's talk about Brown v. Board of Education because I know Senator Blumenthal will. I'm going to talk about that. You said in writings it was a super-precedent. What did you mean? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, in my writings, so as a professor, I taught talked about the doctrine of stare decisis and super-precedent is not a doctrinal term that comes from the Supreme Court and I think maybe in political conversation or in newspapers, people use it different ways. But in my writing, I was using a framework that's been articulated by other scholars. And in that context, super-precedent means precedent that is so well established that it would be unthinkable that it would ever be overruled. And there are about six cases on this list that other scholars have identified. </p><p>GRAHAM: Let's talk about Brown and talk about why it would be unthinkable. First, let's talk about what's the process that would lead to it being overruled? What would have to happen? </p><p>BARRETT: For Brown to be overruled, you would have to have Congress or some state or local government-imposed segregation again. Open-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Okay, let's stop right there. If you want to make yourself famous by the end of the day, you can say we want to go back to segregation. I promise you, you'll be on every cable TV channel in America. I doubt if you'll go very far, but the point we're trying to make here is the court just can't wake up and say let's revisit Brown. It has to be a case in controversy, is that right? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, that's right.  </p><p>GRAHAM: So before a Brown decision could--you could review Brown, somebody out there would have to be dumb enough to pass a law saying let's go back to segregated schools. Is that fair to say? </p><p>BARRETT: That is fair to say. </p><p>GRAHAM: Do you see that happening anytime soon? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not see that happening anytime soon. </p><p>GRAHAM: Yeah, I don't either. So let's talk about the process in general. There's the Heller case. What's that about? </p><p>BARRETT: The Heller case is a case decided by the Supreme Court which held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Now, my friends on the left, some of them have a problem with Heller. Named may try to challenge the construct of Heller. If a state or local government passed a law in defiance of Heller, what would happen? </p><p>BARRETT: In defiance of Heller or in-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Well, that was challenged challenging the construct of Heller. </p><p>BARRETT: That challenged the construct of Heller, if it was a lower--if it was brought in a lower court, Heller binds. I mean, Heller is--lower courts always have to follow Supreme Court precedent. And so that law-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --And if the Supreme Court wanted to revisit Heller, what would they do? </p><p>BARRETT: If someone challenged Heller below, because a state or local government passed a law contradicting Heller, the Supreme Court would have to take that case once it was appealed all the way up. So the court would have to decide yes, we wanted to overrule a Heller and we have enough votes to grant cert and then do so.  </p><p>GRAHAM: So that's the way the process works? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. It would start because there was a law then there was a lawsuit then there was an appeal then the court granted cert and then the court decided the case. </p><p>GRAHAM: Is that true no matter what the issue is, whether it's gun, abortion, health care, campaign finance? Does that process hold true for everything? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, you always--not--judges can't just wake up one day and say I have an agenda. I like guns, I hate guns, I like abortion, I hate abortion and walk in like a royal queen and impose, you know, their will on the world. You have to wait for cases in controversies, which is the language of the contract constitution to wind their way through the process. </p><p>GRAHAM: All right. Well, Senator Sasse gave us a good civics lesson. I hope that's the basic lesson of the law here. So if a state said, you know, I don't think you should have over six bullets and somebody believed that violated the Second Amendment, there would be a lawsuit and the same process would work, right? </p><p>BARRETT: The same process would work. In that case, there would be--parties would have to sue the state who, you know, arguing that that law was unconstitutional. It would wind its way up. And if it got to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court decided to take it, a whole decision making process begins. You hear arguments from litigants on both sides. </p><p>[*]BARRETT: They (OFF-MIC) briefs. You talk to clerks as a judge. You talk your colleagues. Then you write an opinion. Opinions circulate and you get feedback from colleagues. So, it's a--it's an entire process. It's not something that a judge or justice would wake up and say, oh, we're hearing this case. I know what my vote's going to be.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, let's talk about the two Supreme Court cases regarding abortion. What are the two leading cases in America regarding abortion? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think most people think of Roe v. Wade. And Casey is the case after Roe that preserved Roe's central holding, but grounded it in a slightly different rationale. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, what is that rationale? </p><p>BARRETT: Rationale is that the state not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Unlike Brown, their--there are states challenging on the abortion front. There are states that are going to a fetal heartbeat bill. I have a bill, Judge, that would disallow abortion on demand at the--20 weeks, the fifth month of the pregnancy. We're one of seven nations in the entire world that allow abortion on demand and the--at the fifth month. </p><p>The construct of my bill is, because a child is capable of feeling pain in the fifth month, doctor's tell us to save the child's life you have to provide anesthesia if you operate because they can feel pain. The argument I'm making is if you have to provide anesthesia to say the child's life because they can feel pain, it must be a terrible death to be dismembered by an abortion. That's a theory to protect the unborn at the fifth month. If that litigation comes before you, will you listen to both sides? </p><p>BARRETT: Of course. I'll do that in every case. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, I think 14 states of already passed a version of what I've just described. So, there really is a debate in--in America still, unlike Brown v. Board of Education, about the rights of the unborn. That's just one example. </p><p>So, if there is a challenge coming from a state, if a state passes a law and it goes into court where people say this violates Casey, how do you decide that? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it would begin in the District Court, in a trial court. You know, the trial court would make a record. You know, the parties would litigate and fully develop that record in the trial court. Then it would go up to a Court of Appeals that review that record, looking for error.  </p><p>And then, again, it would be the same process. Someone would have to seek certiorari at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court would have to grant it. And then at that point, it would be the full judicial process. It would be briefs, oral argument, conversations with law clerks in chambers, consultation with colleagues, writing an opinion, really digging down into it. </p><p>It's not--is not just a vote. You all do that. You all have a policy and you cast a vote. The judicial process is different. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. So, when it comes to your personal views about this topic, do you own a gun? </p><p>BARRETT: We do own a gun. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. All right. Do you think you could fairly decide a case even though you own a gun? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: All right. You're a Catholic. </p><p>BARRETT: I am. </p><p>GRAHAM: I think we've established that  the tenets of your faith means a lot to you personally. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is true. </p><p>GRAHAM: You've chosen to raise your family in the Catholic faith. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That's true. </p><p>GRAHAM: Can you set aside whatever Catholic beliefs you have regarding any issue before you? </p><p>BARRETT: I can. I have done that in my time on the Seventh Circuit. If I stay in the Seventh Circuit, I'll continue to do that. If I'm confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will do that still. </p><p>GRAHAM: And I would dare say that there are personal views on the Supreme Court, and nobody questions whether our liberal friends can set aside their beliefs. There's no question--no reason to question yours, in my view. So, the bottom line here is that there is a process. You fill in the blanks whether it's about guns in Heller, abortion rights.  </p><p>Let's go to Citizens United. To my good friend Senator Whitehouse, me and you are going to come closer and closer about regulating money, because I don't know what's going on out there, but I can tell you there's a lot of money being raised in this campaign. I'd like to know where the hell some of its coming from. </p><p>But that's not your problem. Citizens United says what? </p><p>BARRETT: Citizens United extends the protection of the First Amendment to corporations who are engaged in political speech. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, Congress wanted to revisit that and the--and somebody challenged it in--under Citizens United that Congress went too far, what would you do? How would the process work? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it would be the same process I've been describing. The first, somebody would have to challenge that law in a case, somebody presumably who wanted to spend the money in a political campaign. It would wind its way up and, you know, judges would decide it after briefs and oral argument and consultation with colleagues and the process of opinion writing. </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: Same-sex marriage, what is the case that established same-sex marriage as the law of the land? </p><p>BARRETT: Obergefell. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. If there was a state who tried to outlaw same-sex marriage, there is litigation, would it follow the same process? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it would and one thing I have neglected to say before that's occurring to me now is that not only would someone have to challenge that statute and you know, somebody so if they--if they outlawed--if they outlawed same-sex marriage there would have to be a case challenging it, and for the Supreme Court to take it up, you would have to have lower courts going all along and saying we are going to flout Obergefell and the most likely result would be that lower courts who are bound by Obergefell would shut such a lawsuit down and it wouldn't make its way up to the Supreme Court but if it did it would be the same process I have described. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, let's turn now to Senator Hawley's favorite topic, substantive due process. As a legal theory, what am I talking about? Can you explain it for the country because if you can't, we are in trouble. I think I will have a hard time doing it. </p><p>BARRETT: So both the 14th and 15th amendments protect life or provide that the state cannot take life, liberty, or property without due process of law and that sounds like a procedural guarantee, but in Supreme Court precedent, it has a substantive component and so the substantive due process clause says that there are some liberties, some rights that people possess that the state can't take away or can't take away without a really good reason. So the right to use birth control, the right to an abortion are examples of the rights protected by substantive due process. </p><p>GRAHAM: These are judicially created rights not found in the document called the Constitution, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, the Supreme Court has grounded them in the Constitution (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>GRAHAM: But they are not written-- </p><p>BARRETT: They are not expressed. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. So is it fair to say there's a great debate in the law of about how far this should go in what limits should apply, if any? </p><p>BARRETT: That is fair to say. There's also a lot of debate and Supreme Court opinions. I am not aware of anybody proposing to throw it over entirely, but there is certainly a debate about how to define these rights and how far it should go. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, let's just say that you are in the camp or in the body is in the camp that substantive due process is a legal concept is on bounded it basically makes the Constitution no more certain than the five people interpreting it at any given time in the country whatever rights they think you have you get, whatever rights they want to take away from you they can it is a pretty nebulous legal concept that is sort of my view of it I'm not imposing my views on yours, but then there's a thing called precedent. Let's say you didn't like a case decided under substantive due process. You thought the whole concept was constitutionally in error. How does precedent play? </p><p>BARRETT: So precedent is the principle that cases that have been decided by the court before this one lands on the docket are presumptively controlling and so you know precedent comes from a concept called stare decisis, which is a shorthand for a longer Latin phrase that means standby the thing decided and do not disturb the call. </p><p>So precedent is a principle that you are not going to overrule something without good reason or oil up the law without justification for doing so. </p><p>GRAHAM: So you could say I--the underlying analysis that led to in the case just case I reject that analysis but I will now apply precedent to whether or not it should be reversed. Is that what you are telling us? </p><p>BARRETT: That is-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: --because precedent (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>GRAHAM: What are the factors with a judge look at in terms of overruling a precedent? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, of course, the inquiry begins because there's been some argument that the precedent was wrong, but that is not enough to justify and overruling. You also consider-- </p><p>GRAHAM: You could say structurally this case should constitutionally it was wrongly decided, but that doesn't in the debate, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: No, that's right. You have to look at reliance interest; you have to look whether the law or the facts-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Let's stop right quick. Reliance interest by who? </p><p>BARRETT: Reliance interest by those who have relied on the precedent so-- </p><p>GRAHAM: The people of the United States. </p><p>BARRETT: People of the United States have ordered their affairs around it. </p><p>GRAHAM: So the Heller case people have read line upon the second amendment being individual right, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Precedent yes, presumably so people have-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, abortion, it would be the right to have abortion that would be a reliance factor, right? </p><p>BARRETT: The court in Casey spent a lot of time describing the reliance of people on the right to an abortion. </p><p>GRAHAM: So what I want the public to know is that if you overrule a precedent of the court even if you think it was wrongly decided, there's a list of things you have to look at before you actually overrule the case. Is that a fair way of saying it? </p><p>BARRETT: That is a fair way of saying it. </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: Would you apply those factors if you ever found yourself in a position where you wanted to consider overruling? </p><p>BARRETT: Absolutely </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Have precedents of the court been overruled before? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: Can you give me an example? </p><p>BARRETT: Brown v. The Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson to get rid of the separate but equal doctrine. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, so recusal. My colleagues are asking you to recuse yourself from litigation around the Affordable Care Act. What's the precedent regarding the Affordable Care Act, if any? </p><p>BARRETT: The precedent that might--well-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Is there precedent on this issue? </p><p>BARRETT: There's not precedent on the issue that's coming up before the court. It's--it turns on a doctrine called severability, which was not an issue in either the two big Affordable Care Act cases. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, so the issue that was before the court was NFIB v. Sebelius. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That was the first about the constitutionality of the mandate. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, and I think Congress has zeroed out what the court called a tax, and the real issue now is, does it stand, and can it be severable? </p><p>BARRETT: Right. So the issue now is now that Congress has zeroed it out, is it--can it be called a tax, or is it now a penalty? And then the second issue is, if it is a penalty, can it be just cut out from the statute so that the rest of the statute, including protection for pre-existing conditions, stands. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, there are a lot smarter people than me suggest that severability would be a hard challenge for those who are opposing the law, but time will tell. Do you feel like you should recuse yourself from that case because you're being nominated by President Trump? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, recusal itself is a legal issue. You know, it--there is a statute, 28 USC 455, that governs when judges and justices have to recuse. There's precedent under that rule. Justice Ginsburg, in explaining the way recusal works, said that it's always up to the individual justice, but it always involves consultation with the colleagues, with the other eight justices. So that's not a question that I could answer in the abstract. </p><p>GRAHAM: So if you're appointed by Obama, that's no reason to accuse yourself in a case involving Obama policies. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, that would be a decision for each justice to make. </p><p>GRAHAM: Right. But if a justice had a--justice had a conflict with a particular policy issue, they helped draft it, that would be a consideration. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That would be a consideration. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, so when it comes to recusing yourself, you'll do what the Supreme Court requires of every justice? </p><p>BARRETT: I will. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay. Thank you very much. How does it feel to be nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, I've tried to be on a media blackout for the sake of my mental health, but you know, you can't keep yourself walled off from everything, and I'm aware of a lot of the caricatures that are floating around. So I think what I would like to say in response to that question is that, look, I've made distinct choices. I've decided to pursue a career and have a large family. I have a multiracial family. Our faith is important to us.  </p><p>All of those things are true, but they are my choices. And in my personal interactions with people--I mean, I have a life brimming with people who've made different choices, and I've never tried in my personal life to impose my choices on them. And the same is true professionally. I mean, I apply the law, and senator, I think I should say why I'm sitting in this seat in response to that question, too, why I have agreed to be here, because I don't think it's any secret to any of you or to the American people that this is a really difficult, some might say excruciating, process.  </p><p>And Jesse and I had a very brief amount of time to make a decision with momentous consequences for our family. We knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked. And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it because what sane person would go through that if there wasn't a benefit on the other side?  </p><p>And the benefit, I think, is that I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court in dispensing equal justice for all, and I'm not the only person who could do this job, but I was asked, and it would be difficult for anyone. So why should I say someone else should do the difficulty if the difficulty is the only reason to say no? I should serve my country, and my family is all in on that because they share my belief in the rule of law. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, thank you. I think a lot of people would say you've got to be sort of insane to run for the senate in this world, but good news for you, we all--we've all chosen kind of crazy stuff to do. I'd just end with this. I'm glad you said yes. I'm glad President Trump chose you. And really before the people of the United States is a very basic question. Is it okay to be religiously conservative? Is it okay to be pro-life in your personal life? And clearly it's okay to be progressive and be pro-choice and seek the--a seat on the Supreme Court. I think resoundingly yes.  </p><p>And here's why your nomination is so important to me. In my world, to be a young conservative woman is not an easy path to take. We have two women on this committee. They can talk about it better than I. So I want to thank President Trump for choosing you, and I will do everything I can to make sure that you have a seat at the table, and that table is the Supreme Court. And if anybody in the country, in my view, deserves to have a seat at the table based on the way they've lived their life and their capabilities in the law, it is you, Judge. God bless you. Thank you. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Chairman Graham. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge, it's wonderful to see you here, also with a family that I have been observing. They sit still, quiet. You've done a very good job. </p><p>BARRETT: I have eyes in the back of my head, so they know I'm watching. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: I was wondering if you might introduce us to them (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So I have my husband, Jesse, my son, JP, my daughter, Emma, my daughter, Juliet, my daughter, Tess, my daughter Vivian, and my son, Liam. And then behind them are my six siblings who are with me today. I'll start at the side right behind Vivian. It's my sister, Vivian, my sister, Eileen, my brother, Michael, my sister, Megan, and my sister, Amanda. And is Carrie in the room? And my sister, Carrie, is sitting right over there. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: You don't have a magic formula for how you do it and handle all the children, and your job, and your work, and your thought process, which is obviously excellent, do you? </p><p>BARRETT: It's improv. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Yes, yes. Well, let me begin with a question that the chairman touched on, and it's of a great--it's of great importance, I think, because it goes to a woman's fundamental right to make the most personal decisions about their own body. And as a college student in the 1950s, I saw what happened to young women who became pregnant at a time when abortion was not legal in this country. I went to Stanford. I saw the trips to Mexico. I saw young women try to hurt themselves, and it was really deeply, deeply concerning.  </p><p>During her confirmation hearing before this committee in 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked several questions about her views on whether the Constitution protects a woman's right to abortion. She unequivocally confirmed her view that the Constitution protects a woman's right to abortion, and she explained it like this, and I quote, the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It's a decision she must make for herself. When government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choice, end quote.  </p><p>At one point our former colleague, Orrin Hatch, then the ranking member of this committee, commended her for her being, quote, very forthright in talking about that, end quote. So I hope--and you have been thus far--be equally forthright with your answers. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Justice Scalia, as was said earlier, joined the dissent, which took the position, and I quote, we believe that Roe was wrongly decided and that it can and should be overruled, consistent with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases. Do you agree with Justice Scalia's view that Roe was wrongly decided? </p><p>BARRETT: So Senator, I do want to be forthright and answer every question so far as I can. I think on that question, you know, I'm going to invoke Justice Kagan's description, which I think is perfectly put. When she was in her confirmation hearing, she said that she was not going to grade precedent or give it a thumbs-up or thumbs down, and I think in an area where precedent continues to be pressed and litigated, as is true of Casey, it would be particularly--it would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that as a sitting judge.  </p><p>So if I express a view on a precedent one way or another, whether I say I love it or I hate it, it signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another in a pending case. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: So on something that is really a major cause with major effect on over half of the population of this country who are women, after all, it's--it's distressing not to get a straight answer. So let me try again. Do you agree with justice Scalia's view that Roe was wrongly decided? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I completely understand why you are asking the question, but again, I can't pre commit or say yes, I'm going in with some agenda because I'm not. I don't have any agenda. I have no agenda to try to overrule Casey. I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, what I'm--as a person, I don't know if you'll answer this one either. Do you agree with Justice Scalia's view that Roe can and should be overturned by the Supreme Court? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think my answer is the same because, you know, that's a case that's litigated. It could you know, its contours could come up again, in fact, do come up. You know, they came up last term before the court. So I think, you know, what the Casey standard is and that--just, it's a contentious issue, which is, I know one reason why it would be comforting to you to have an answer, but I can't express views on cases or pre commit to approaching a case any particular way. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, that makes it difficult for me and I think for other women also on this committee because this is that very important case and it effects a lot of people, millions and millions of women. And you could be a very important vote. And I had hoped you would say as a person, you've got a lovely family, you understand all the implications of family life, you should be very proud of that. I'm proud of you for that, but my position is a little different.  </p><p>You're going on the biggest court of this land with a problem out there that all women see one way or another in their life. And--not all, but certainly married women do and others too. And so the question comes what happens and will this justice support a law that has substantial precedent now? Would you commit yourself on whether you would or would not? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, what I will commit is that I will obey all the rules in stare decisis that if a question comes up before me about weather Casey or any other case should be overruled that I will follow the law stare decisis applying it as the court has articulated it, applying all the factors, reliance, work ability, being undermined by later facts and law, just all the standard factors. And I promise to do that for any issue that comes up, abortion or anything else. I will follow the law. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, I think that's expected and--well, I guess I've gone as far as I can. Let me go to another issue. This country is facing great gun violence. There's been a surge in gun sales during the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to more lives being needlessly lost.  </p><p>According to the Gun Violence arcave--Archive, excuse me, an independent research organization, there were 60 mass shootings in May alone. These shootings killed 40 people, they hurt 250 more. Also, there's been a troubling spike in gun sales. Americans bought approximately 2 million guns this past March. It's this second highest month ever for gun sales.  </p><p>That figure does not take into account all the gun sales that could not be completed because the purchaser failed a background test--check, excuse me, a number that has also skyrocketed. For example, this past March, the FBI's background check system blocked 23,692 sales, more than double the 9,500 sales blocked in March of 2019. Do you agree that federal, state, and local governments have a compelling interest in preventing a rise in gun violence, particularly during a pandemic? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, of course the constitutionality of any particular measure that would pass--that was passed by state or local governments or by this body would be subject to the same judicial process that I described with Senator Graham. What I will say as--because this is just descriptive of Heller, Heller leaves room for gun regulations. And that's why there has been a lot of litigation in the lower courts, which makes me constrained not to comment on the limits of it. But Heller does not make a right absolute by, you know, it says so in the opinion. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, let me ask one more question. In a recent dissenting opinion that you wrote, you said there was ""no question,"" that, ""Keeping guns out of the hands of those who are likely to misuse them,"" is ""a very strong governmental interest."" Do you stand by that statement? </p><p>BARRETT: So I don't--let's say, I can't remember precisely the words of Kanter, which is the case in which I dissented, which-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: --That's correct. Kanter v. Barr. </p><p>BARRETT: Kanter v. Barr. What I said in that opinion I stand by, which is that the original meaning of the Second Amendment, and I went through a lot of detailed history, in that case does support the idea that governments are free to keep guns out of the hands of the dangerous. So for example, the mentally ill, others who would be likely to misuse guns. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: So where--where does that leave you on Roe? The chairman asked him I thought a very good question. For many people and particularly for women, this is a fundamental question. We all have our moral values, we have our religions, we live by that. I respect you and your family for doing just that, but this is a very real problem out there and if you could be more specific in any way with respect how you would view your place on the court with respect to controlling weapons in this country. </p><p>BARRETT: I think what I can say is that my opinion and Kanter shows how I approach questions as a matter of judicial philosophy. I mean, I spent a lot of time on that opinion looking at the history of the Second Amendment and looking at the Supreme Court's cases. And so the way in which I would approach the review of gun regulation is in that same way, to look very carefully at the text, to look very carefully at what the original meaning was. That was the method that both the majority and dissent and Heller took. So I promise that I would come to that with an open mind applying the law as I could best determine it. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me move on. One of my constituents, Cristina Garcia (SP), was able to obtain insurance coverage and have surgery that saved her eyesight only before the Affordable Care Act. Her experience is not unique.  </p><p>Senator Tammy Baldwin has a constituent, Jimmy Anderson, in her home state of Wisconsin and she asked that this story be shared. Jimmy is a 34 year old and member of the Wisconsin state legislature. In 2010, a drunk driver hit the family's car as they were returning home from celebrating Jimmy's 24th birthday. Jimmy's mother, father, and little brother were killed in the accident. Jimmy was paralyzed from the waist down.  </p><p>His medical recovery was intense. As Jimmy has said, ""Doctors managed to patch me up with dozens of stitches and multiple surgeries and about a pound of steel on my spine."" But soon after, his insurance company told him he was nearing his lifetime maximums and he would have to pay for the rest of his health care expenses. As Jimmy explains, ""With hundreds of thousands of dollars still left to go, I don't know what I was going to do. I was scared. I was terrified. I was just a student. I didn't have that kind of money."" </p><p>Fortunately, a few days later, the insurance company sent him another letter. This one informed him that the provisions of the ACA had kicked in, which meant there were no longer lifetime maximums and his care would be covered. In Jimmy's own words, ""I was able to put my life back together and I credit the Affordable Care Act for that."" </p><p>[*]FEINSTEIN: Judge Barrett, how should the loss of ACA's protection against lifetime coverage caps, caps that can be used and coverage for life-saving care, factor into a court's consideration of the validity of the ACA? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, so far as I know, the case next week doesn't present that issue. It's not a challenge to pre-existing, existing--pre-existing conditions coverage or to the lifetime maximum you know, relief from a cap.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, what--what is your view? </p><p>BARRETT: Of how it should factor in the--I--let's see. I think that any issue that would arise under the Affordable Care Act or any other statute should be determined by the law, by looking at the text of the statute, by looking at precedent the same way that it would for anyone.  </p><p>And if there were policy differences or policy consequences, those are for this body. For the court, it's really a question of the hearing to the law and going with the law leads and leaving the policy decisions up to you. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: For me, my vote depends a lot on these responses because these are life or death questions for people. It's my understanding that you are critical of Justice Roberts for upholding the ACA, stating that he ""Pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute."" And in what way did justice--did the Chief Justice go beyond the ACA's plausible meaning? </p><p>BARRETT: So, I've written about this, and that description is consistent with the way the Chief Justice describes in his own majority. That was King v. Burwell, where the court had to decide whether the phrase established by a state also included exchanges that were established by the federal government.  </p><p>And the majority in that case acknowledge that treating the phrase established by a state as including exchanges established by the federal government was not the most natural reading. But for other reasons, other policy reasons and canons of interpretation, they chose to adopt the less natural reading. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: You see, for me, the case coming up, California v. Texas, puts a whole new weight on your nomination because the Affordable Care Act is now being so well accepted. I represent the largest state, as does Senator Harris, that we have, and there are just--over 10 million people depending on the activities under this act and that they be sustained. And so, there is really great concern about what your view is. That case is coming up. Can you give us at least your view? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, the issue in the case is coming up doesn't involve--it's not the same issue as the ones in NFIB v. Sibelius or King v. Burwell. It's a different issue. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well-- </p><p>BARRETT: --So-- </p><p>FEINSTEIN: --Then give us both. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, let's see. So, what I've said, which you quoted to me, was that I thought that the interpretation of the phrase established by a state was stretched when the court held that it was established by the federal government. That's not the issue in California v. Texas. The issue in California v. Texas is if--whether now that Congress has just completely, you know, zeroed out the mandate, whether it's a tax or penalty, and even if so, is it constitutional, and then even so is that fatal to the statute. </p><p>There is a doctrine called severability, which sounds like legalese. But what it means is is it okay with the statute, could you just pluck that part out and let the rest of the statute stand, or is that provision which has been zeroed out so critical to the statute that the whole statute falls? So, really the issue in the case is this doctrine of severability, and that's not something that I've ever talked about with respect to the Affordable Care Act. Honestly, I haven't written anything about severability that I know of at all. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: So, you have no thoughts on the subject? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it's a case that's on the court's docket. And the canons of judicial conduct, you know, would prohibit me from expressing a view. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay, I'll move on. On July 30th, 2020, President Trump made claims of voter fraud and suggested he wanted to delay the upcoming election. Does the Constitution give the president of the United States the authority to unilaterally delay in general election under any circumstances? Does federal law? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, if that question ever came before me, I would need to hear arguments from the litigants and read the briefs and consult with my law clerks and talk to my colleagues and go through the opinion writing process. So, you know, if--if I give off-the-cuff answers, then I would be basically a legal pundit. And I don't think we want judges to be legal pundits. I think we want judges to approach cases thoughtfully and with an open mind. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me try something else. In 2017, in a case called EEOC v. AutoZone, the Seventh Circuit issued--your circuit issued an opinion which permitted an employer to intentionally assign its employees to specific stores due to their race.  </p><p>The dissent in this opinion argued the decision permitted employers to legally establish separate but equal facilities, and argued, if upheld, this decision would be ""Contrary to the position that the Supreme Court has taken in analogous equal protection cases as far back as Brown v. The Board of Education."" </p><p>The case was appealed to the full panel of the seventh, and you sided, as I understand it, with the majority to deny a rehearing and let the opinion stand. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is correct, and I think I need to give a little context for what it means to vote to deny to rehear something En Banc. Our court, just like the Supreme Court in the certiorari process, doesn't take cases just because we think the panel got it wrong. There's a lot of deference to panels. And rule 35 of the, you know, Rules of Appellate Procedure constrains and limits the times in which we take the resources of the full court to rehear a case.  </p><p>So, I was not on that panel and I did not express a view on the merits. A vote to deny to hear something En Banc is, like a vote not to--to deny certiorari, not a vote that expresses a view on the merits. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay.  </p><p>BARRETT: It was a statutory case. It was not an equal protection case. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Let me ask you a question as a person. </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: If an employer can transfer an employee based solely on his or her race and that does not constitute a materially adverse employment action because it was purely lateral job transfer, please explain what factors must be present for a policy based on race to violate Brown v. The Board's prohibition of separate but equal.  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, to my knowledge, Brown wasn't at issue in the majority opinion. It turned on statutory language in Title VII. But again, I didn't express a view on the merits, and so I can't comment on whether I think that the panel majority got that right or got that wrong. You know, that's an issue that may well come before me even in the Seventh Circuit. Some may press for its overruling and I may be on a panel that has to decide whether that precedent was wrong. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, let me ask you, as a person do you have a general belief? </p><p>BARRETT: As a person, I have a general relief that racism is abhorrent. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: That racism is what? </p><p>BARRETT: Abhorrent. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, I think that's--that's--I think we would all agree with that. </p><p>So, how should a lower court in the seventh determine when race-based policies could constitute a materially adverse employment action? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I'm not aware of cases presenting the exact same facts as that of AutoZone. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: I'm just you for your view. </p><p>BARRETT: You know, I know that the material adverse consequence was the standard at issue in that case. I have to confess that I would need to look at the statute and the precedent to--well, even if I had a specific hypothetical in front of me, I couldn't really say without looking at the statute and the precedent what factors are involved because I wasn't on that panel and haven't decided a similar case. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me go to another issue. </p><p>[*]FEINSTEIN: The issue of LGBT equality is very personal for me. I spent two decades as a counties supervisor and mayor of a city. I watched firsthand as the LGBT community fought for legal recognition of their lives, their relationships, their personal dignity. I--I was there before the law, so I saw in San Francisco what was happening. I want to speak briefly about one couple, Dell Martin and Phyllis Lyon(SP), who I met in the 1970s. They were vibrant members of San Francisco's community. </p><p>I was president of the board of supervisors. They worked with me to pass a citywide ordinance in 1978 that provided critical protection against discrimination in employment, housing public accommodations. At that time, this was one of the strongest protections for the gay community in the entire nation. We have come a long way since then, and I think we should never go back. </p><p>In June 2008, 58 years after they met, my two friends were finally able to marry when the California Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples cannot be denied the fundamental right to marry. Dell died two months later. Before--because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, Phyllis once denied Social Security survivor benefits even though her spouse had paid into this basic safety net for her entire working life. </p><p>Phil had to  rely on the help of friends and fellow activist. In 2013 as you probably know, because you know so much about this U.S. v Windsor, the Supreme Court struck DOMA down. Two years later, in Obergefell v Hodges the Supreme Court recognized that the fundamental right to marry could not be denied to LGBT Americans. Both decisions were decided by a 5-4 margin. Justice Ginsburg was in the majority, Justice Scalia dissented in both cases. </p><p>Now you said in your acceptance speech for this nomination that Justice Scalia's philosophy is your philosophy. Do you agree with this particular point of Justice Scalia's view that the U.S. Constitution does not afford gave people the fundamental right to marry? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Feinstein, as I said to Senator Graham at the outset, if I were confirmed, you would be getting Justice Barrett, not Justice Scalia, so I don't think that anybody should assume that just because Justice Scalia decided a decision in a certain way that I would too but I'm not going to express a view on whether I agree or disagree with Justice Scalia for the same reasons that I have been giving. </p><p>Now Justice Ginsburg, with her characteristic pickiness, used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing no hints, no previews, no forecast. That had been the practice of nominees before her what everybody calls it the Ginsburg rule because she stated it so concisely and it has been the practice of every nominee since, so I can't, and I'm sorry to not be able to--to embrace or disavow Justice Scalia's position but I really can't do that on any point of law. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Well, that's really too bad because it's rather a fundamental point for large numbers of people I think in this country. I understand you don't want to answer these questions directly but the great--you identify yourself with a justice that you like him would be a consistent vote to roll back hard-fought freedoms and protections for the LGBT community and what I was hoping you would say is that this would be a point of difference where those freedoms would be respected, and you haven't said that. </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I have no agenda, and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. You know, like racism, some I think discrimination is abhorrent. On the questions of law, however, I just because I'm a sitting judge and because you can't answer questions without going through the judicial process can't give answers to those very specific questions. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Grassley? </p><p>GRASSLEY: Judge, I welcome you again, and you can rest for a minute because I've got some things to say to my colleagues, but more importantly, so people around the country understand what is going on here. First of all, for your family and friends, I am sure they are very proud and they ought to be. I think everybody recognizes your sharp intellect, a deep understanding of, and even great reverence for the Constitution. Your legal experience and public service are impressive. Your dedication to mentoring young students and women in the legal profession ought to be admired by everybody. In all respects, you are exceptionally qualified to be a justice. </p><p>Many groups and individuals have written in strong support, so I guess now that the chairman is gone, I'm going to ask as--as the next one ranking I have got some letters from 21 state lieutenant governors and from 20 secretaries of state that I want to put in the record at this point. Before I question, I have a few points to make. </p><p>Yesterday my Democrat colleague spoke about their concern that you judge wouldn't uphold certain laws, including the affordable care act and that you would strip Americans of their health care rights and those protections that come with it. These opponents said that Republicans just want to confirm you so that you quote will carry their policies for word meaning Republican policies forward on the Supreme Court, but this only shows Democrats fundamentally misunderstand what judges are supposed to do. </p><p>A judge is supposed to interpret laws in an impartial manner consistent with the Constitution. Republicans aren't interested in seeing judges quote-unquote carry their policies forward. Republicans want judges to interpret the law and the Constitution, not make law. We want judges that won't impose their policies and personal preferences in their decision-making, plain and simple. Policymaking is not the proper role of the judicial branch. That role is reserved for legislative and executive branches. As the judge said, the political branches elected by and accountable to the people because you have got a lifetime appointment, and if you do lawmaking, we can't vote you out of office. Lawmaking is our job. If people don't like what we do, they can vote us out of office. </p><p>Some other points on the affordable care act. The Democrats continue to miss referees centaur claim to know Barrett's view on affordable care and access to health care. In fact, they made it their entire game plan yesterday, and I suppose today we will see it again, but we should dispense with the total section the Democrats are peddling. Apparently, her technical concerns Chief Justice Roberts legal reasoning in the Obama decision disqualifies her. </p><p>Democrats are painting the judge as heartless and on a mission to scrap the health care law. Frankly, that's absurd. Not only is Judge Barrett, a mother of seven, she has children with pre-existing medical challenges of her own. No one on this committee or anyone has any right to suggest that she doesn't care about access to health care or protection for the vulnerable. Now getting back to the technical concerns of about Roberts' Affordable Care Act opinion, first and I have got four points along this line, her comments dealt with Robert statutory interpretation of just one provision of the law. </p><p>That provision is no longer even in the fact. In 2017 Congress zeroed out the so-called tax, the tax connected with the individual mandate. The question before the court this fall are entirely separate. </p><p>[*]GRASSLEY: She never ruled on the Affordable Care Act nor commented on how she would vote, meaning the judge, how she would vote. So it's pointless to speculate, but we're going to get a lot of speculation during this election season, just two and a half weeks before the election.  </p><p>Now a second point. Lawyers and legal academics often consider a court reasoning, even when they have no disagreement with the outcome of the case. For instance, the New York Times recently reported Ginsberg, before joining the Supreme Court, quote, wasn't really fond of Roe v. Wade. She didn't like how it was structured, end of quote. I don't blame--or don't know why Democrats have a different standard for you, Judge Barrett.  </p><p>Now a third point. It's blatantly inconsistent for the left to use this line of attack. We all know that President Obama said that the ACA legislative mandate was not a tax. Even liberal Jeffrey Toobin said Roberts' argument was, quote, not a persuasive one, end of quote. So Judge Barrett's analysis of Roberts' legal reasoning is well inside the mainstream.  </p><p>Now a fourth point, more inconsistency. The same Democrats vilify Judge Barrett as a threat to those with pre-existing conditions. Well, it seems that those same people just filibustered the COVID relief bill that would have protected pre-existing conditions. They are the ones that blocked the COVID relief legislation. Republicans stood ready to move forward with that bill, and remain ready. It seems to me it's the other side who really playing politics with healthcare during a pandemic.  </p><p>The truth is Judge Barrett already said, quote, ""A judge must apply the law as written,"" end of quote. She further commented, quote, ""To decide cases according to the rule of law, beginning to end,"" end of quote. That's what we should all look for judges to do.  </p><p>Now, for my first question. When Justice Scalia came to my office before his confirmation--and I think I brought this up with every nominee to the Supreme Court by Republican or Democrat nominees. I don't think I brought up in my private conversation with you, but I always bring up, what's your attitude about legislative history? </p><p>BARRETT: Um-- </p><p>GRASSLEY: Let me ask my question first. </p><p>BARRETT: Oh, sorry. </p><p>GRASSLEY: I'm sorry. </p><p>BARRETT: I thought that was it. </p><p>GRASSLEY: I think you probably know, Judge, how important it is. I want to know how important legislative history is to you. When is it appropriate to look to legislative history to interpret the statute, and are there some circumstances when, more appropriate than other? And I'd like to also give a--your view on legislative history compared to what I heard from Scalia 35 years ago. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So I'm very comfortable talking about the use of legislative history because that's a matter of interpretive philosophy. What governs, of course, is the text of the statute. So you know, the legislative history can never supersede the text, and it should never substitute for the text of the statute. </p><p>Justice Scalia, as was well known, you know, railed against the use of legislative history, and I think it was because at the time that Justice Scalia went on to the DC Circuit before he was on the Supreme Court, the use of legislative history had really kind of gotten out of control, and many courts, you know, were saying things--Justice Scalia in his book quotes this line from a brief--you know, the legislative history being unclear, we turn to that other reliable guide in statutory interpretation, the statute.  </p><p>And that has things backwards. And so I think Justice Scalia really tried to clean that up and say listen, the priority is the text. When the text answers the question, you don't go to legislative history. And there is some pragmatic reasons to be careful about doing so. You know, legislative history can be long. There's a famous quotation from Judge Leventhal that legislative history is like going to a cocktail party and picking out your friends. It can be easy to manipulate because there might be something in there for everyone.  </p><p>So as a general rule, I don't look to legislative history when I'm deciding cases. I wouldn't say that it would never be relevant. Even Justice Scalia himself said that there could be instances, for example, if you were trying to determine whether a term used in a statute how it was used, if it had a technical meaning, or how it was understood, that that might be an appropriate time to consult legislative history. Or Justice Scalia himself consulted it when he was trying to determine whether there had been an error in the way the statute was drafted. He looked to legislative history to see whether what seemed unthinkable actually was unthinkable. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Now I'd like to go to a specific case. I'd like to go to United States v. Uriarte, which involved the interpretation of section 403 of the FIRST STEP Act, which you know I had a big part along with Senator Lee and Senator Durbin in getting that passed in 2018. This is the most significant criminal justice legislation in a generation. Our criminal justice system can't just punish and deter. It must also rehabilitate and promote successful reentry into society. The FIRST STEP Act accomplished these goals through prison and sentencing reform. It was well known that the goal of the FIRST STEP Act was to make smart and cost-effective changes to the criminal code and to reduce risk of recidivism.  </p><p>So I want to ask you about your dissent in this case. The issue was whether the sentencing reform provision of the FIRST STEP Act applied to a defendant whose sentence had been vacated. Here the defendant had been convicted but not resentenced at the time of the FIRST STEP Act becoming law. The majority opinion cited the plain meaning of the FIRST STEP Act in congressional intent in finding that section 403 would apply to a defendant with a vacated sentence. Your dissent, as I understand it, argued among other things that congressional intent shouldn't be heavily relied on since, quote, every statute requires a resolution of competing policy interest, end of quote.  </p><p>President Trump signed the FIRST STEP Act into law only two years ago. So wouldn't re-referencing congressional intent be accessible and relevant? And then another question, why did you find the majority relying on legislative history unpersuasive? </p><p>BARRETT: So we did, the majority--it was a very, very difficult case. It was voted on En Banc by our full court, and the quote from my dissent that you're pointing to was actually that we had a dispute about what the plaintext of the statute required. And so that portion of my dissent that you just read was saying that I thought that the majority had permitted the policy goals of the act to supersede the text, and in dissent, I argued that the text drew the line after someone had been sentenced.  </p><p>So if someone had already been sentenced on the date of the FIRST STEP Act's passage, and the relevant language was, you know, if a sentence had already been imposed, I thought with my dissenting colleagues--and this was consistent with the approach the Third Circuit had already taken--that that meant if the person had already been through sentencing, you know, this case involved a resentencing, and resentencing can happen years after, and so it didn't seem to my dissenting colleagues and I, that looking in the statute, that the plain language of the text supported the majority's approach to it. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Now I think on my next question on the same case--you may have just partially answered it, but let me go ahead with my lead in and then also a question. Both the majority and your dissent in the case reviewed 403 of the act under plain reading of the text. As an author and leader in this law's passage I'd like to discuss how a plain reading of the statute could lead to varying outcomes. The section in question contemplates when a sentence has been imposed on a defendant. According to the text of the statute and relevant case law, a defendant's sentence, if vacated, creates a clean slate. That means defendant is placed in the same position as if he had never been sentenced. But your dissent comes to the opposite conclusion on whether a sentence has been imposed.  </p><p>Note that I agree with you that the laws need to be read and interpreted literally. So my question is this. How could we come to different conclusions?  </p><p>[*]BARRETT: Well, that language, you know, that it--it only--that it did not apply to defendants on whom sentence is had already been imposed, my dissenting colleagues and I said, well, the language is sentences. It doesn't say, you know, invalid sentences and one could certainly say if asked if someone had been sentenced, yes, he was sentenced, but that sentence was later vacated.  </p><p>And you're right that the majority relied heavily on this clean slate principle, but in my review of the law, this clean slate principle wasn't really present because, you know, the Sentencing Reform Act, for example and structs district courts applying the guidelines at sentencing to apply those that were in effect on the date of the original sentencing. So I thought that the clean slate principle they were pushing a little too hard on it.  </p><p>And then, you know, there's certainly unfairness, you know, the FIRST STEP Act, it's--its policy is clearly to bring justice to sentencing. But whenever you draw a line of who gets the benefit of a law, this is especially acutely true in the sentencing era--in the sentencing area. It's very difficult and, you know, some people ran on either side of the line will not get the benefit of the law wherever you draw it.  </p><p>So for example, in this case, Mr. Uriarte had a codefendant named Sparkman. His case came up right beyond--together. They had been tried together and initially sentence together, but Uriarte's appeal took longer to resolve or his resentencing took longer because of a lot of delays. So there was unfairness there too on the majorities approach because Uriarte, despite the fact that he was more culpable than Sparkman, wound up with a sentence that was, like, 15 years less. </p><p>GRASSLEY: That's the end of my questioning on that, but let me make a comment before I go to my next question. My position has always been that legislative history can be instructive with respect to the intent of the statute, so judges should not completely disregard it. Certainly, I acknowledge that the legislative branch can be more careful about drafting laws. But I also think that judges should pay attention to congressional intent as set forth in the history wind there might be a dispute about how to interpret the statute.  </p><p>Justice Ginsburg at her hearing, quote--and you've discussed this a little bit already, but I think it deserves emphasis because you're going to go through a lot of this business of maybe not being--and I know legitimately not being able to comment on a perspective case. So she said, ""A judge sworn to decide impartiality can offer no forecast, no hints for what would show not only disregard for the specifics of this particular case. It would display disdain for the entire judicial process.""  </p><p>Obviously, we all know--end of quote. We all know that that's the Ginsburg standard. The underlying reason for this rule is that making promises or giving hints on how a judge would rule in a case undermines the very independence of our system. But you're going to be asked about your personal views as you just have been on various topics and how you might correctly decide.  </p><p>Of course, you know the judicial nominees should never promise their future votes in--on the bench in exchange for the president's nomination or a senator's support. You'd be showing the opposite of independence. So my question, so I ask you, do you agree with the Ginsburg standard that it goes to the question of judicial branches independence for legislative history? And all you've got to do is say yes because I've heard you talk about it. </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. I agree that Ginsberg rule reinforces judicial independence. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Yeah. Now here's something that a lot of people suspicion, so I want to ask you, have you made any promises or guarantees to anyone about how you might rule on a case or issue that might come before you if you are confirmed to the Supreme Court? </p><p>BARRETT: I want to be very, very clear about this, Senator Grassley. The answer is no. And I submitted a questionnaire to this committee in which I said no. No one ever talked about any case with me. No one on the executive branch side of it, and that's one reason, you know, one reason you asked that question I think as a committee is that you don't--you want to know that no nominee has made any pre commitments.  </p><p>And so just as I didn't make any pre commitments and was not asked to make any commitments on the executive branch side, I can't make any pre commitments to this body either. It would be inconsistent with judicial independence.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: Now, I know the answer to my last question, and Mr. Chairman, I'm going to reserve the rest of my time. The Democrats claim that you're being put on the Supreme Court so you can vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Is that your agenda if confirmed? Is your goal repealing the Affordable Care Act? Have you committed to the president or anyone else that you will vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act if confirmed by--to the court? </p><p>BARRETT: Absolutely not. I was never asked. And if I had have been, that would have been a short conversation.  </p><p>GRASSLEY: I think that your record shows that you'll be a faithful judge that takes each case seriously and approach each case in an unbiased way rather than with the policy agenda in mind. Is it fair--we can reserve our time? </p><p>GRAHAM: Absolutely. </p><p>GRASSLEY: Okay. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Leahy. </p><p>FEINSTEIN: Chairman, letters for the record. </p><p>GRAHAM: We'll introduce-- </p><p>LEAHY: --Okay-- </p><p>GRAHAM: --Introduce letters by Senator Feinstein will be introduced into the record without objection. Senator Leahy, are you with us? </p><p>LEAHY: I--I think I am. Do you hear me there? </p><p>GRAHAM: Yes, sir. Let's see if we can get you up on the screen here. There you go. The floor is yours. </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you. Thank you very much. And judge, I was watching as you introduced your family. Thank you for doing that. It's obvious your family is very important to you, as they should be. I know my wife and I have been married for 58 years and our children and our grandchildren are the most important things in our life. And I was pleased to see you introduce the family.  </p><p>Now, as a senator, of course, another important part of my life is referring to and representing the people of Vermont. And let me let me talk to you about some of the things I've been hearing from Vermonters. And you have to understand in Vermont, Vermonters just walk up to you at the grocery store or coming out of church or whatever and perfectly happy to express their views. And they were concerned about what the Republican's Affordable Care Act lawsuit on November 10th would mean for them. Do you know how many Americans have obtained insurance through the Affordable Care Act? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not. </p><p>LEAHY: It's more than 20 million. And do you know how many children under the age of 26 are able to stay on their parents' insurance because of the Affordable Care Act? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not.  </p><p>LEAHY: It's 2.3 million. And do you know how many Americans are covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not. </p><p>LEAHY: It's a little more than 15 million. I look at that because I look at the people calling me from Vermont. I think of Alex Johnson. She's a single mother. She's a childhood cancer survivor. She works as a nanny in South Burlington, Vermont. She relies on Medicaid for doctors visits, for blood drawings or other testing. All that done to make sure her leukemia stays in remission.  </p><p>She tells me she stays--she stays awake at night worrying about losing Medicaid. Now, if the Republicans are successful in what they are trying to do on November 10th, then Alex and actually 60,600 of their Vermonters enrolled in Medicaid expansion are going to be left behind. And con--and if you contract COVID-19, that's seen as a preexisting condition. Do you know how many--approximately how many million Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and survived? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not. </p><p>LEAHY: It's more than 7,700,000. Those are people who are now considered to have a preexisting condition. And one of the most common preexisting conditions is diabetes. The CDC estimates that 34 million Americans, that's about 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes. They showed that the ACA's Medicaid expansion is the single most important factor for expanding access to affordable insulin.  </p><p>Leslie, a Vermont--Vermonter diagnosed with late onset type one diabetes at the age of 25. For years, she has depended on Medicaid to keep her alive and out of bankruptcy. </p><p>[*]LEAHY: Now, President Trump recently claimed he's made insulin as cheap as water. I wish he had told the truth in that. We all know it's not. Leslie now has insurance to pay for insulin. And without this insurance, do you know how much--because unlike what the president says, insulin is not as cheap as water. Do you have an idea how much Leslie's out-of-pocket expenses for insulin would increase? </p><p>BARRETT: No, I do not. </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you. And I wouldn't expect you to. There's no reason why you should. But Leslie's costs would more than triple, would go up by $11,215 a year. That's in a state where the per capita income is $33,000. </p><p>So, I'm not suggesting that you're callous or indifferent to the consequences if the Affordable Care Act is overturned. You know that these are real cases, and I think you're a sympathetic person. But I do believe that the president selected you because he wanted somebody with your philosophy and he had a reason for it. </p><p>Now, some are going to pretend that it's a mystery, and that's what some of my colleagues have, what a Justice Barrett would do when the Supreme Court takes up the latest attack on the ACA. President Trump has made it crystal clear and he's promised that his nominees would overturn the ACA. It's even in the official Republican Party platform. And when he said--of the case to be argued next month, he said we want to terminate healthcare under Obamacare, the ACA. And with that--within hours of nominating you, he again repeated his hope that the ACA would be overturned. </p><p>I know I mentioned my friend the chairman, Senator Graham, knows the president as well as anyone here. He goes golfing with him. He spends a lot of time with him. And I think Chairman Graham knows that the president would not repeatedly promise the American people that his judges will overturn the ACA if he didn't mean it. And I think Senator Graham would have to agree that the president is confident Judge Barrett would side with him on November 10th. That's not necessarily a question for either one of you, but of course the chairman has a opportunity to respond on his time if he wants. </p><p>But I think we know the president is confident. And there's not been an issue in the last decade that's animated Republicans in Congress more than their zeal to overturn the Affordable Care Act. In fact, I counted up the other day and I was surprised at the answer. Do you know, Judge Barrett, that Republicans in Congress have voted to repeal or gut the ACA more than 70 times, 7-0, times in the last 10 years? And when they failed, they turned to the court. Do you know how many Republicans on this committee have joined amicus briefs urging courts overturn the ACA in NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell? </p><p>BARRETT: How many Republicans had voted? Was that the question? </p><p>LEAHY: No, no, do--do you know how many Republicans in this committee have joined in amicus briefs urging the court to overturn-- </p><p>BARRETT: --I-- </p><p>LEAHY: --The ACA? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't. I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing Senator Leahy. Is there a way for the volume to be turned up? </p><p>GRAHAM: Yes, ma'am.  </p><p>LEAHY: I am sorry for that.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Let's--it's on our end, Senator Leahy. That's okay. You can repeat the question and-- </p><p>LEAHY: --Well, how is it coming through now? </p><p>GRAHAM: Very good. </p><p>BARRETT: Very well. Thank you.  </p><p>LEAHY: And as you know, I've--I've stayed away simply because I don't think it is safe for you or anybody else to be there. </p><p>But my question is do you know how many times Republicans on the committee you're sitting before have joined amicus briefs urging courts to overturn the Affordable Care Act? </p><p>BARRETT: I do not, no.  </p><p>LEAHY: It's at least nine by my count. In fact, they have already weighed in on the November 10 case. Two weeks ago, the Senate voted on whether to side with the president--with President Trump in Texas v. California, and 11 of the 12 senators on this committee sided with the Trump administration and asked to kill the ACA. </p><p>Now, I understand that you will not share your views on Texas v. California. I know you looked at Judicial Canon 3(A)6 in your concern that commenting making future litigants that appear before you an indication of which way you'd vote. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, that is correct. </p><p>LEAHY: Okay. Now, my--my concern--my--my--my concern is that you've already given a theory indication. Every time you weighed in, it hasn't even been close. You repeatedly disagreed with Chief Justice Roberts. From what you've said, you clearly believe the statute is unconstitutional. The president has made very clear he expects you--you to decide with him. </p><p>And let me tell you another area where he expects you to decide with him it. He expects you to decide with him in an election dispute. He says he needs a ninth justice because he has--is counting on the court to look at the ballots, and he says the election will be rigged. The recusal statute, 28 USC 455, requires recusal where impartiality might reasonably be questioned. </p><p>Now, when the president declares he needed this nomination to secure his reelection and then the nominee is rammed through the Senate in record time during the middle of an election, some are going to question that nominee's impartiality. Would you--to protect confidence in both you and the court, would you commit to recuse yourself from any dispute that arises out of the 2020 presidential election? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Leahy, I want to begin by making two very important points, and they have to do with the ACA and within the election dispute that may or may not arise. I have had no conversation with the president or any of his staff on how I might rule in that case. It would be a gross violation of judicial independence for me to make any such commitment or for me to be asked about that case and how I would rule. </p><p>I also think it would be a complete violation of the independence of the judiciary for anyone to put a justice on the court as a means of obtaining a particular result. And that's why, as I was mentioning I think to Senator Grassley, that the questionnaire that I fill out for this committee makes clear that I have made no pre-commitments to anyone about how I would decide a case. That's out of respect for Article 3 and its designation of the judiciary as a coequal and independent branch of government.  </p><p>On the recusal question-- </p><p>LEAHY: --Well, I--you know, I--and I might say that you gave a similar answer when I talked with you and Mr. Cipollone. I--I had a question, of course, because one of the members of our--of the Judiciary Committee said that he would not support you unless he had a commitment that you would vote that way on-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Vote on the election-- </p><p>LEAHY: --On--on another case, Roe v. Wade.  </p><p>BARRETT: Hmm.  </p><p>LEAHY: And I understand what you're saying is, notwithstanding what a member of this committee said, you have not made that commitment to anybody. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Leahy, let me be clear. I have made no commitment to anyone, not in the Senate, not over the White House, about how I would decide any case. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, that--and the reason I ask is we also have the question of appearance. Now, Judge Joan Larsen of the Sixth Circuit sat next to you during your 2017 hearing. She was confronted with this issue as a judge on the Michigan Supreme Court in 2016. Then President-elect Trump challenged a ballot recount. Judge Larsen was on his short list for the Supreme Court of the time. She found that being on the shortlist was a conflict and it required her recusal. </p><p>[*]LEAHY: You were actually--you were also on the shortlist then you were actually chosen. Now he's not the president-elect, he's the president, and then the president makes a similar thing as he did judge (INAUDIBLE) looked at he is counting on you to deliver him the election. Judge Larsen said that was a conflict for her and would have to recuse. You did not find his comments a conflict for you, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Leahy, I am not familiar with Judge Larsen's decision, but she clearly made it once it was presented to her in the context of an actual case where she had to weigh her obligations under 28 USC 455. If presented to me, I would like judge--like Judge Larsen applied that statute, and I recently read a description by Justice Ginsburg of the process that Supreme Court justices go through in deciding whether to recuse and it involves not only reading the statute, looking at the precedent, consulting counsel if necessary but the crucial last step is that while it is always the decision of an individual justice, it always happens after consultation with the full court so I can't offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, I think that what I worry about as I have said over and over again that if the courts are politicized from the Supreme Court down through other courts and (INAUDIBLE) cases (INAUDIBLE) federal courts, I have always assumed that judges are totally impartial no matter what the president had nominated, but this president has not been subtle in that he expects his nominee to decide with him in election dispute. I am thinking of the creditability of our federal courts, and I would hope you would at least consider that. </p><p>The president has said he needs a ninth justice because he is counting on the court to look at the ballots in case he loses because that would--if he lost, that meant the Democrats had rigged the election. The recusal statute, as you know as well as anyone 28 USC 455, requires a justice recuse themselves in any proceeding in which impartiality can reasonably be questioned. You know whether you like it or not and I suspect you probably do not, the president has placed both you and the Supreme Court in the worst of positions and so let me ask you a different type of question. I assume you agree with me that it is critical for Americans to have confidence in the Supreme Court, is that true? </p><p>BARRETT: That is true, and I agree with your earlier statement that the courts should not be politicized. </p><p>LEAHY: Thank you and I have voted for an awful lot of Republican and--and Democratic nominated justices I did, of course for Chief Justice Roberts (INAUDIBLE) I wanted to keep the Supreme Court and other courts out of politics but when the president repeatedly declares he needs his nominee as a way of securing his reelection and that nominee is they ran through the Senate in the middle of that election you can see the nominees' impartiality might be questioned so my--my request in protecting the confidence of both you and the court are you able to commit to recuse yourself from disputes that arise out of the 2020 presidential election? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Leahy, I commit to you to fully and faithfully of applying the law of recusal and part of that law is to consider any appearance questions, and I will apply the factors that other justices have before me in determining whether the circumstances require my recusal or not but I can't offer legal conclusion right now about the outcome of the decision I would reach. </p><p>LEAHY: Which is sort of boilerplate response on recusal's. So let me ask you another question. You laid out the case for blocking President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland for two months during an election year. You have argued in part that Justice Scalia was the staunchest conservative on the court, and Justice Scalia and I were personal friends. I had voted for him, and I agree with you on that. </p><p>You claim that the moderate and eminently qualified Judge Garland would dramatically flip the balance of the court, and you said it was not a lateral move that's your--your quote it was not a lateral move. So now you are nominated to replace Justice Ginsburg, perhaps the staunchest champion for civil rights of the court. You claim that the philosophy of Justice Scalia as your own, of course, he was the opposite side of Justice Ginsburg and countless civil rights cases. Would you say that replacing Justice Ginsburg by yourself is not a lateral move like you had urged when you supported the blocking of President Obama's nominee Judge Garland? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Leahy, I want to be very clear. I think that's not quite what I said in the interview. It was an interview that I gave shortly after Justice Scalia's death, and at that time, both sides of the aisle were arguing that precedent supported their decision and I said why I had not done the research myself. My understanding of these statistics was that neither side could claim precedent that this was a decision that was the political branches to make and I didn't say which way they should go. I simply said it was the Senate's call. I didn't advocate or publicly support the blockade of Justice--Judge Garland's nomination as you are suggesting. </p><p>LEAHY: You--that is not what I am suggesting. You said it was a lateral--it would not be a lateral move. </p><p>BARRETT: What I was suggesting is that it was unsurprising that there was resistance as a political matter to that nomination because it would change the balance of the court. That is kind of just a-- </p><p>LEAHY: (INAUDIBLE) surprised resistance and surprise there's so many at that time Republican members of the judiciary committee who had stated publicly before the vacancy that they thought Merrick Garland would be a good person to have on the court and somebody could appeal to both conservatives, liberals, and moderates but-- </p><p>BARRETT: I have full respect for Judge Garland. </p><p>LEAHY: I beg your pardon? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm sorry, I missed the first part. Are they right to say--could you repeat the question? </p><p>LEAHY: No, it was not a question. I was just saying that we had many members of our committee a number of Republicans to prior to the vacancy had been saying Merrick Garland would be a good person for President Obama to nominate because he--he could appeal to moderates, conservatives and liberals and then, of course, their response was well, we can't have a--we can't have a nominee confirmed by one party that is in control of the Senate and nominated by a president of another party (INAUDIBLE) side pointed out I was here when Democrats control the Senate, and President Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy in an election year Democrats confirmed him but let me go to another area. </p><p>A three-judge panel of the seventh circuit struck down three provisions of an Indiana law restricting reproductive rights. The state of Indiana requested En Banc review of just one of the provisions, the fetal tissue disposition provision. The (INAUDIBLE) whether to review the case leaving intact the panel decision to strike down the law. You joined Judge Easterbrook in his dissent, but then the docent went out of its way to address a separate provision, not before the court, the so-called reason than. Your dissent called a called a eugenics statute. Judge Barrett, the issue before your court was a narrow one. </p><p>[*]LEAHY: Why didn't you limit your dissent to the one issue the state of Indiana was asking you to review? </p><p>BARRETT: So we dissenters from that denial (INAUDIBLE) hearing En Banc, first of all, dissented, as you say, on the fetal remains disposition portion, which the Supreme Court wound up summarily reversing the panel. On the eugenics portion of the bill, it is true that the state of Indiana did not seek En Banc rehearing on that, but we had many other states enter the case as amici, urging us to take that claim up. And what Judge Easterbrook's dissent did was explain why he actually thought it was an open question but one best left to the Supreme Court. And we didn't reach any conclusion with respect to it. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, and your, whatever position you took would not have changed the final decision of the court. Now in 2006 you signed an open letter. It was published in the South Bend Tribune. You, on one side the advertisement described the legacy of Roe v. Wade as barbaric. On the other side, which you signed, you stated that you opposed abortion on demand. Defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. And I have certainly voted for some judges who take that position. But (INAUDIBLE) not mentioned in the letter, the organization that led the effort believes that In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, is equivalent to manslaughter and should be prosecuted. Do you agree with them that IVF is tantamount to manslaughter? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, the statement that I signed, as you said, simply said we--I signed it on the way out of church. It was consistent with the views of my church. And it simply said we support the right to life from conception to natural death. It took no position on IVF. </p><p>LEAHY: No, I understand that. And as I said, I voted for judges who take the same position you do. But I'm asking, do you agree with the St. Joseph County Right to Life that sponsored the ad that IVF is tantamount to manslaughter? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, I signed the statement that you and I have just discussed, and you're right that the St. Joseph County Right to Life ran an ad on the next page, but I didn't--I don't even think the IVF view that you're expressing was on that page, but regardless, I've never expressed a view on it, and for the reasons that I've already stated, I can't take policy positions or express my personal views before the committee because my personal views don't have anything to do with how I would decide cases, and I don't want anybody to be unclear about that. </p><p>LEAHY: Let me talk about some of the positions you have taken. Before you can became a judge you were paid by the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, for five lectures. You gave them on originalism at the Blackstone Legal Fellowship. Now, I recall some--being asked about some of their controversies. Were you aware of ADF's decades-long efforts to re-criminalize homosexuality? </p><p>BARRETT: I am not aware of those efforts, no. </p><p>LEAHY: Okay, (INAUDIBLE) the reading materials they had for the program that you lectured to five--several times spoke of that. In fact, they had filed a brief in Lawrence v. Texas, supporting--in support of state laws punishing private homosexual activity. They celebrated when India restored a law punishing sodomy to 10 years in prison. Now I don't--whether you believe that being gay is right or wrong is irrelevant to me, but my concern is what you--you work with an organization working to criminalize people for loving a person that they are in love with. So that's what--that's what worried me. </p><p>BARRETT: Did you want--I wasn't sure if you wanted me to answer that. You know, my-- </p><p>LEAHY: Go ahead. Go ahead. </p><p>BARRETT: My experience with the Blackstone program at which I spoke was a wonderful one. It gathers, you know, best and brightest Christian law students from around the country. And as you said, I gave a one-hour lecture on originalism. I didn't read all of the material that the students were given to read. That had nothing to do with my lecture. I enjoyed teaching the students about what my specialty was, which is constitutional law, and nothing about any of my interactions with anyone involved in the Blackstone program were ever indicative of any kind of discrimination on the basis of anything. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, as you know, same-sex marriage, for example, and Senator Feinstein mentioned this at the beginning, is legal--it's certainly legal in my state, has been for some time. Do you feel that should be a crime? </p><p>BARRETT: Same-sex marriage? </p><p>LEAHY: Yes. </p><p>BARRETT: Obergefell clearly says that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. </p><p>LEAHY: And you agree with that stare decisis?  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, for the reasons that I've already said, I'm not going to, as Justin Kagan put it, give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to any particular precedent. It's precedent of the Supreme Court that gives same sex couples the right to marry. </p><p>LEAHY: Well, you mentioned Justice Kagan. She once wrote an opinion that it's not enough that five justices believe a precedent is wrong. Reversing course demands a special justification over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided. Do you agree with that? </p><p>BARRETT: I do agree with that. The doctrine of stare decisis itself requires that. </p><p>LEAHY: Having relied on stare decisis in many of my arguments before Courts of Appeals, I thank you for your answer. Chief Justice Roberts (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Leahy, I don't mean to interrupt. I know you don't have a clock in front of you, but we're about a little over a minute over, so if you-- </p><p>LEAHY: I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I do not have a clock before me. </p><p>GRAHAM: No, I understand. I totally understand. </p><p>LEAHY: I appreciate it, and I will look forward to the next round of questioning.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. We will make sure that happens. Very briefly, before I go to Senator Cornyn, Senator Leahy mentioned my time with the president. I think probably all of us on this side were consulted by the president regarding how to fill the opening. He gave me a list of--a small list of names, all women. You were on it. I was enthusiastic about everybody. Very enthusiastic about your nomination by the president. Play a lot of golf with the president, I guess. I've enjoyed it. We talk about a lot on the golf course, some policy, killing Soleimani, we talked about that. That was an interesting discussion. I promise you, I have never talked about severability with the president. Senator Cornyn. </p><p>CORNYN: Speak for yourself. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Good morning, Your Honor. </p><p>BARRETT: Good morning, Senator Cornyn. </p><p>CORNYN: You know, most of us have multiple notebooks, and notes, and books and things like that in front of us. Can you hold up what you've been referring to in answering our questions? Is there anything on it? </p><p>BARRETT: Letterhead that says United States Senate. </p><p>CORNYN: That's impressive. Well, Judge, the best I can understand the objections to your nomination are not to your qualifications, your experience or training, but it's that you have or will violate your oath of office. I find that terribly insulting. They suggest that you can't be unbiased in deciding a case you haven't even participated in yet. I find that insulting, as well.  </p><p>You know, almost as--maybe almost as pernicious as attacking somebody for their faith and suggesting that that disqualifies them from holding a public office is the attack that's being made on judicial independence, something that Chief Justice Rehnquist, among others, observed the crown jewels of the American Constitution and the American system. But I want to just take a little walk down memory lane here.  </p><p>You know, there are a lot of--a lot of people who guessed how judges would actually rule on cases and almost always, they've been spectacularly wrong. I was struck by--by just a couple. Harry Truman said, ""Whenever you put a man,"" and that--he's talking about a man, but a man or woman on the Supreme Court, ""He ceases to be your friend."" He said some more colorful things too.  </p><p>But Theodore Roosevelt said about Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., he said I could carve out--out of a banana a judge with more backbone than that. And as I think about people like Harry Blackmun nominated by Richard Nixon who wrote Roe v. Wade, as I think about Warren Burger, you know, they were called the Minnesota Twins, and obviously overtime, they became sort of polar opposites on the court. I think about the attacks on Neil Gorsuch for his unwillingness to make a previous--a prior commitment on LGBT issues. He wrote the Bostock case extending title seven of the Civil Rights Act to gay or transgender individuals. Obviously, those predictions were wrong.  </p><p>And then, since we're talking about the ACA, it's the ACA versus ACB, I guess, Chief Justice Roberts was the one who wrote the opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act, as you know. So I would just say that all of these predictions about how judges under our independent judiciary will make decisions are just pure speculation. But I think they are worse than speculation. I think they're propaganda in order to try to make a political point. So judge, you're not willing to make a deal? </p><p>BARRETT: No, Senator. I'm not willing to make a deal. Not with the committee, not with the president, not with anyone. I'm independent. </p><p>CORNYN: I just would like to hear maybe some of your thoughts on--in the Obergefell case, which established, as you said, a constitutional right to same sex marriage, part of that decision struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, I believe so. </p><p>CORNYN: That was a bill that Joe Biden voted for. </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know.  </p><p>CORNYN: Well, I do. </p><p>BARRETT: Okay. </p><p>CORNYN: Joe--Joe Biden voted for it. Pat Leahy and Bill Clinton signed it into law. Can you just--I'm not asking you to give me the details, but just sort of differentiate for everybody listening what the approach of a legislator is in voting for piece of legislation as opposed to the role of a judge in interpreting the constitutionality of a--of a piece of legislation? Are they the same or are they different?  </p><p>BARRETT: They're quite different. A judge isn't expressing a policy view. You know, I tell my students in constitutional law that newspapers do courts a disservice when, you know, they say things like, you know, court favors same sex marriage or, you know, just giving the headline without showing any of the reasoning that goes into it because courts are not just expressing a policy preference. They are digging in, they are looking at that precedent, they are looking at the constitution, and even when the result cuts against policy preferences, judges are obliged to follow them. I suspect that this body doesn't cast votes that conflict with their policy preferences. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, that's right. And the difference between us and you is you don't run for election. </p><p>BARRETT: That's right. </p><p>CORNYN: You don't run on a platform. You don't say if I'm confirmed, I'm going to do this or that. You don't do that, do you? </p><p>BARRETT: It would be wholly, wildly inappropriate for me to do so. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, your mentor, Justice Scalia said something back in 2005 that I find intriguing but reassuring. He said if you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong. Do you agree with that? And if you do, could you, would you explain what you mean? </p><p>BARRETT: I do agree with that. And that, you know, has been my experience on the 7th circuit so far. It's your job to pass the statutes. It's your job to choose policy. And then, it's my job to interpret those laws and apply them to effects of particular cases. And they don't always lead me to results that I would reach if I were, you know, queen of the world and I could say you win, you lose, or this is how I want it to be. Because I just don't have the power by fiat to impose my policy preferences or choose the result I prefer. That's just not my role. I've got to go with what you guys have chosen. </p><p>CORNYN: Well, why in the world would the American people surrender their right to govern themselves through their elected representatives and through the constitution and nine people who don't even run for election and who served for life? Why in the world would--should the American people do that? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think part of the rationale for courts adhering to the rule of law and for judges taking great care to avoid imposing their policy preferences is that it's inconsistent with democracy. Nobody wants to live in accord with the law of Amy. I'm sure my children don't even want to do that. So I can't, as a judge, get up on the bench and say you're going to live by my policy preferences because I have life tenure and you can't kick me out if you don't like them. </p><p>CORNYN: Well thankfully, under the constitution, even if the Supreme Court strikes down a statute, Congress can come back and revisit that topic and do so in a way that doesn't violate the constitution as determined by the court. And ultimately, it doesn't happen--happen very often in our history, but ultimately, we can amend the constitution itself, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is correct. </p><p>CORNYN: So the basis of legitimacy of governmental power is consent of the government. Do you agree with that? </p><p>BARRETT: I do agree with that. </p><p>CORNYN: Not what nine people in black robes, the high nine on the Potomac, I think there sometimes called, at the decisions they make. Those are--that's not the final word in our form of government, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: We are a law--a government of laws, not of men.  </p><p>CORNYN: Well, Judge Barrett, I'm almost through, but I can't pass up the opportunity to ask you a question about the Establishment Clause. I did with Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch as well. It's born out of my frustration.  </p><p>One of the couple of times I had a chance as attorney general of Texas to argue before the Supreme Court, I argued in a case called Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe. This was about a commonplace practice where before football games in Texas, students would volunteer to offer invocation or an inspirational poem or saying or something like that. The ACLU sued the school district and obviously made its way all the way to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>And I'm not going to ask you your opinion on the outcome of the case, but what troubles me the most--what troubled me the most about that experience is when the Supreme Court struck down or held that practice unconstitutional and in violation of the Establishment Clause, Chief Justice Rehnquist said the Constitution requires neutrality for religion. That the courts approach speaks of hostility toward religion. Could you just talk a little bit about the Establishment Clause generally with--not in regard to any particular set of facts, but sort of what the--what the courts overtime have tried to do to--to enforce the mandate of the Constitution?  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Cornyn, when I interviewed for my job with Justice Scalia, he asked what area of the courts precedent that I thought, you know, needed to be better organized or that sort of thing. And off the cuff, I said well, gosh, the 1st amendment and he said well, what do you mean? And I fell down a rabbit hole of trying to explain without success because it is a very complicated area of the law, how one might see one's way through the thicket of balancing the Establishment Clause against the Free Exercise Clause.  </p><p>It's a notoriously different, difficult area the law. And to the extent that, you know, there is tension in the courts cases, and I'm giving you know better answer, I assure you, than I did to Justice Scalia that day, it's been something that the court has struggled with, you know, for decades to try to come to a sensible way to apply both of those clauses.  </p><p>CORNYN: Well, I wish you well. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>CORNYN: Mr. Chairman, I'm going to reserve the rest of my time.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Cornyn. For planning purposes, if it's okay with the committee, we'll have Senator Durban, Senator Lee. We'll break for about a half hour for lunch and come back with Senator Whitehouse. Is that okay? </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: Are you okay with that? Do you need a break? </p><p>BARRETT: No, that's fine.  </p><p>DURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And--and thank you, Judge Barrett, and your family for being here with us today for this marathon of questioning. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Durbin. </p><p>DURBIN: Appreciate it. I would like to respond to two of my colleagues quickly before ask a few questions of you. How a--who came up with this notion, this insulting notion that you might violate your oath? Where could this idea have come from?  </p><p>Could it have come from the White House? Could it have come from the president's tweets of what he expects a Supreme Court nominee to do politically for him? That's what comes from. That's where it originated.  </p><p>And you have said very clearly to me without equivocation you are not going to be influenced by President Trump's importuning or the importuning of this committee or anyone else, which is what we expect you to say. But this notion that this whole idea of your being used for political purposes is a Democratic creation, read the tweets and you have plenty to work with. Read the tweets. </p><p>The second things I would like to say is I'm not going to spend a lot of time defending the Affordable Care Act, although I think it's the most important single vote I've cast as a member of Congress, period. But I will say that when the chairman opened up on it and said what he did, I was puzzled. The three states get 35 percent of the money? How can that possibly be true? </p><p>Well, it turns out because those states decided to extend Medicaid coverage to the people who lived in the states and his did not. And as a consequence, fewer people in South Carolina have the protection of health insurance, and those that do are paying for their services and those that don't are not, which imperils hospitals and others in the process.  </p><p>So, I would say there is an explanation as to why some states are spending more. And incidentally, there was a Republican of your state, Indiana, by the name of Mike Pence who decided to break with other Republican governors and extend Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I think it was the right thing to do for Indiana, as it was for Illinois. But that's part of the reason. </p><p>Let me just say that the Affordable Care Act really is at the heart of this, as you can tell, on the Democratic side. We really believe the Supreme Court consideration of that case is going to--could literally change America for millions of people. I have with me today another group I'd like you to at least be aware of because they're pretty amazing people. </p><p>But this is the Williams family. They live in Naperville, not too far from a Chicago. Kathy and Les (SP) Williams have four sons, from left to right, Matt, Joey, Tommy, and Mikey. Matt, who is 27, was diagnosed with type I diabetes when he was 13. The other three Williams boys were all born with cystic fibrosis. Joey is 24. Mikey's 21. Sadly, Mikey's twin, Tommy, after this picture was taken passed away in January 2019 from complications. This is the last photo that was ever taken of their full family. </p><p>Here's what they wrote me. We cannot imagine having to go through losing another child. People with cystic fibrosis require daily medication, regular doctor visits, access to high-quality specialized care. That means people with pre-existing conditions like cystic fibrosis cannot be discriminated against. </p><p>The ACA's protections ensure a ban on annual and lifetime caps and enforce the requirement that insurers cover essential health benefits such as hospitalizations for mental health services. People with CF and other pre-existing conditions need adequate affordable healthcare to live longer, healthier lives.  </p><p>That's why we keep bringing this up, real people that we run into all the time. There's a chart here. I want to show it to you while we're at it. On the Republican side, there is some obvious controversy as to whether we're right or wrong, but there are an awful lot of people in each of the states represented by our Republican senators who have their healthcare and literally, in some cases, their lives hanging in the balance.  </p><p>In South Carolina, 242,000 people would lose their insurance coverage if the Affordable Care Act were eliminated. Two million living in that state have pre-existing conditions. You can imagine the list goes on. Thank you. </p><p>Here's what it comes down to. You've been unequivocal in being critical of the decisions both in NFIB-Sebelius and in King-Burwell. And we naturally draw the conclusion that there is going to be a third strike at--when it comes to Texas and California. You said it won't affect pre-existing conditions. If the petitioners have their way, there will not be an Affordable Care Act to protect pre-existing conditions on the severability question. </p><p>So, give us an insight of how you can be so unequivocal in opposing the majority decisions in NFIB-Sebelius and in King and Burwell but have an open mind when it comes to the future of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. Thank you for the question, Senator Durbin, because it gives me an opportunity to make my position clear. When I wrote, and--and this was as a law professor, about those decisions, I did critique the statutory interpretation of the majority opinions. And as I've mentioned before, my description of them was consistent with the way that Chief Justice Roberts described the statutory question. </p><p>But I think that your concern is that, because I critique the statutory reasoning, that I'm hostile to the ACA and that, because I'm hostile to the ACA, that I would decide a case a particular way. And I assure that I am not. I'm not hostile to the ACA. I'm not hostile to any statute that you pass. And the cases on which I commented, and we can talk in another time, I guess, about the context and distinctions between academic writing and judicial decision-making, but those were on entirely different issues. </p><p>So, to assume that because I critique the interpretation of the mandate or the phrase established by a state means that, on the entirely different legal question of severability, I would reach a particular result just assumes that I'm hostile. And that's not the case. I apply the law. I follow the law. You make policy. </p><p>DURBIN: So, let--let's talk about that for a moment from a different issue perspective. Bear with me for a couple questions. Have you seen the George Floyd video? </p><p>BARRETT: I have. </p><p>DURBIN: What impact did it have on you? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, as you might imagine, given that I have two black children, that was very, very personal for my family. Jesse was with the boys on a camping trip out in South Dakota, so I was there, and my 17-year-old daughter Vivian, who was adopted from Haiti. All of this was erupting. It was very difficult for her. We wept to together in my room, and then it was also difficult for my daughter Juliet, who's 10. I had to try to explain some of this to them. </p><p>I mean, my children to this point in their lives have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not yet experienced hatred or violence. And for Vivian, you know, to understand that there would be a risk to her brother or the sons and she might have one day of that kind of brutality has been an ongoing conversation. It's a difficult one for us, like it is for Americans all over the country. </p><p>DURBIN: And so, I'd like to ask you as an originalist, who obviously has a passion for history, I can't imagine that you can separate the two, to reflect on the history of this country. Where are we today when it comes to the issue of race?  </p><p>Some argue it's fine. Everything's fine and you don't have to even teach children about the history of slavery or discrimination. Others say there is implicit bias in so many aspects of American life that we have to be very candid about and address. Others go further and say, no, it's systemic racism that's built into America and we have to be much more pointed in our--our dressing it. How do you feel? </p><p>BARRETT: So, I think it is an entirely uncontroversial an obvious statement given, as we just talked about, the George Floyd video that racism persists in our country. As to putting my finger on the nature of the problem, you know, whether, as you say, it's just outright or systemic racism or how to tackle the--the issue of making it better, those things, you know, are policy questions. They're hotly contested policy contest--questions that have been in the news and discussed all summer. </p><p>So, while, you know, as I did share my personal experience, and very, you know, happy to discuss the--the reaction our family had to the George Floyd video, giving broader statements or making, you know, broader diagnoses about the problem of racism is kind of beyond what I am capable of doing as a judge. </p><p>DURBIN: Well, I--I would doubt that. I just don't believe you can be as passionate about originalism and the history behind language that we've had for decades if not centuries without having some thought about where we stand today. But I'm not going to press you on that. I'm going to take you to a case which I have read and reread, Kanter v. Barr. </p><p>[*]DURBIN: You know the case well because it's already been referred to and it--it clearly is a case where you had your day in court, you wrote the sole dissent, a 64-page case 37 pages were your dissents, so you gave to the court I assume a pretty full accounting of your thoughts on the subject and here is the way I understand the case. A fellow named Rickey Kanter from Mequon, Wisconsin invented some pads to put in a shoe to be sold to particularly older Americans under Medicare to relieve foot pain. And he designed them and submitted them to Medicare and didn't get the approval that he was looking for, but instead sold them and represented to many customers that they had been approved by Medicare, and so he was charged with fraud. </p><p>Now, this wasn't a matter of a casual misapplication of the law. When it was all said and done, Rickey Kanter of Mequon, Wisconsin, ended up spending over a year, a year today in federal prison paying somewhere near $300,000 in penalties and fines and $27 million in a civil settlement on this issue. So this was not a casual wrongdoing, this man was a swindler, and he was taking the federal government for a ride as well as other customers in misleading senior citizens about his product and paid a heavy price for it then he decided having left present that it's just fundamentally unfair that the law says that if you've been convicted of a felony, you can't own a firearm. </p><p>Now I don't know what his appetite is when it comes to firearms, whether it's a revolver or an AK-47 with a banana clip. I have no idea, but he went to court and said this is unfair. It was just mail fraud, and you are taking away my second amendment rights, so two out of three of your colleagues then basically said sorry, Rickey, you have forfeited your right to own a firearm because of your conviction of a felony. </p><p>You took a different approach, exactly the opposite approach, and went deep into history. I think the earliest citation I see here was 1662 to figure out just what was going on here and whether or not he had to have committed a violent felony to have forfeited this right to own a firearm. Have I stated the facts close to what you remember? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't remember the amount of the loss, some of those details, but yes, Rickey Kanter was convicted of selling fraudulent shoe inserts, and it was a felony. </p><p>DURBIN: $27 million settlement along the way, so I would like to take you into your thinking on this. When the Heller decision was handed down, Justice Scalia expressly said I'm not taking away the authority of government to impose limitations based on felonies, not violent felonies, felonies, and mental illness. He said as much in the Heller decision, and yet this man who was your inspiration as you have told us all you decided he was strong and that it had to be a violent felony. Can you explain why? </p><p>BARRETT: I can. So we have talked about precedent and in my court the seventh circuit there is precedent saying that that phrase doesn't control as you know my colleague Judge Frank Easterbrook said a number of times that judicial opinions are statutes and shouldn't be read as if they were, so Heller obviously wasn't about the scope of the right, you know its application to felons or those who are mentally ill, etc. so that passage was dicta it didn't fully dive down into it. </p><p>But what I did was apply Heller's methodology both Justice Scalia's majority opinion and Justice Stevens dissent, and used an originalist methodology to answer that question and I concluded that based on that history one couldn't take the right away simply because one was a felon, that there had to be a showing of dangerousness and I didn't rule out the possibility that the government might be able to make that showing about Rickey Kanter but I think we can all agree that we ought to be careful of saying that because someone is a felon they lose any of their individual rights. </p><p>DURBIN: I would like to get to that point that I would like to stick with this for just a moment more. </p><p>I am honored to represent the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. It's a great city, but it has great problems to and one of them is gun violence. On the average, we know in America, 100 Americans are killed every day by gunfire, 40,000 per year. In the city of Chicago, more than 3200 people have been shot just this year, 3200. </p><p>According to the city's gun trace report in 2017, the majority of illegally used or possessed firearms recovered in Chicago are traced back to states with less regulation over firearms such as Indiana and Mississippi. The 2017 report found that Indiana alone was the source of 21 percent of all Chicago's recovered crime guns. We know how it works where you live, you know how it works. There's a traffic between Chicago and Northern Indiana and Michigan going on constantly. Gun shows are held in Gary, Indiana, and other places, and when they are selling these firearms without background checks, unfortunately, these gang bangers and thugs fill up the trunks of their cars with firearms and head into the city of Chicago and kill everyone from infants to older people it's just it's a horrific situation. </p><p>Law enforcement is finding it trying to get Indiana to at least do background checks at these gun shows with limited success, and we are trying to apply the standards that you disqualify yourself from buying a firearm to felonies and mental illness and you want to take away part of that protection with your decision in this case because if you eliminate felonies and just confine it to violent felonies, you are opening up more opportunities for people to five firearms, are you not? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, you referred to gang members and thugs buying guns in Indiana and taking them across the border and certainly if they had felony convictions for doing the kinds of things that members of gangs and thugs do. Nothing in Kanter says that the government can't deprive them of firearms and nothing says in my opinion that the government can't deprive Rickey Kanter of having firearms. They simply had to make a showing of dangerousness before they did so, and nothing in the opinion opines at all on the legality of background checks and gun licensing. Those are all separate issues. </p><p>DURBIN: But the majority zeros in and says what you have just said is totally impractical that we are going to go case-by-case and the side well, what kind of felonies and what kind of person and then they go on to produce evidence I can read the numbers here, but you know them well because you wrote the dissent where the likelihood of committing a violent felony after being convicted of a felony is pretty dramatic, and they are saying to us don't let us--don't force us to make a case by case. We want to make it by category. It's the only practical way to deal with the thousands, if not millions, of people who are buying firearms. You are aware of the fact that even those who are so-called not violent felons quote only felons like Rickey Kanter have a propensity to commit violent felonies in the future, are you not? </p><p>BARRETT: There was no evidence of that in the case, and we on courts, for example, the Armed Career Criminal Act that is a federal statute have to make judgments categorically all of the time about what count as crimes of violence, so I don't think that's beyond the pen of courts in any area to identify which felonies are violent and you know which felonies are not. </p><p>DURBIN: So let's-- </p><p>BARRETT: But fell-- </p><p>DURBIN: Excuse me, but I want to address that issue. Let's go to page 21 of the opinion than what the court said, the majority of the court. Most felon they quoted Yancey most felons are nonviolent, but someone with felony conviction on his record is more likely van a non-felon to engage in illegal and nonviolent gun use. </p><p>For example, one study this goes on to say 210,886 nonviolent offenders found that one out of five were rearrested for a violent crime within three years, so the evidence is there. It--it is, therefore, the court to consider and you ignored it. </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I didn't ignore it. As I recall that evidence in the studies were unclear it--and let say, I can't remember as I'm sitting here the details of all of the statistics, but I did consider it, and I recall saying something in the opinion about the reliability of those studies because they didn't say whether someone had been convicted of a nonviolent crime but had later been convicted of a violent crime as well I mean felonies cover a broad range of things including selling pigs without a license in some states, redeeming too many bottle caps in Michigan. I mean so felonies now cover broad swaths of conduct, not all of which seems indicative of whether someone is likely to abuse a firearm. </p><p>DURBIN: So let's--let me take you, I'm not going to go so far back in history but I--I'm going to take you back in history for a moment and note that when that second amendment was written, and you did the analysis of it, we were talking about the likelihood that a person could purchase a muzzle loading musket. </p><p>We are now talking about virtual military weapons that can kill hundreds of innocent people. It is a much different circumstance. Maybe an originalist pins all their thinking to that musket, but I've got to bring into the 21st century, and the 21st century has people being killed in the streets of Chicago because of the proliferation of deadly firearms.  </p><p>But let me bring it closer to home and tie up the George Floyd question with where I'm headed. There's also a question as whether the commission of a felony disqualifies you from voting in America. And the history on that is pretty clear. In an article of the American Journal of Sociology found many felony voting bans were passed in the late 1860s and 1870s when implementation of the 15th amendment and its extension of voting rights to African Americans were ardently contested. It still goes on today with voter suppression, but we know that in reconstruction, in the Jim Crow era, in Black Code era, that was used. A felony conviction was used to disqualify African Americans from voting in the South and many other places.  </p><p>The Sentencing Project today has found that more than 6 million Americans can't vote because of a felony conviction, and one out of every 13 black Americans have lost their voting rights. The reason I raise that is that in your dissent you said disqualifying a person from voting because of a simple--simple--because of a felony is okay, but when it comes to the possession of firearms, wait a minute, we're talking about the individual right of a Second Amendment. What we're talking about in voting is a civic right, a community right, however you define it. I don't get it. So you're saying that a felony should not disqualify Rickey from buying an AK-47, but using a felony conviction in someone's past to deny them the right to vote is all right? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, what I said was that the Constitution contemplates that states have the freedom to deprive felons of the right to vote. It's expressed in the Constitutional text. But I expressed no view on whether that was a good idea, whether states should do that, and I didn't explore in that opinion because it was completely irrelevant to it, what limits, if any, there might be on a state's ability to curtail felon voting rights. </p><p>DURBIN: Did you not distinguish the second amendment right from the right to vote, calling one an individual right under the Constitution and the other a civic right? </p><p>BARRETT: That's consistent with the language in the historical context, the way the briefs described it, and it was part of the dispute in Heller of whether the Second Amendment was an individual right or a civic one that was possessed collectively for the sake of the common good. And everybody was treating voting as one of the civic rights. </p><p>DURBIN: Well, I will just tell you that the conclusion of this is hard to swallow. The notion that Mr. Kanter, after all that he did, should not be even slowed down when he's on his way to buy a firearm, my goodness, it's just a felony. It's not a violent felony that he had committed. And then to turn around on the other hand and say well, but when it comes to taking away a person's right to vote, that's the civic duty. It's something that we could countenance. That is really goes back to the original George Floyd question.  </p><p>That was thinking in the 19th century that resulted in voter suppression and taking away the right to vote from millions of African Americans across this country. And it still continues to this day. I just don't see it. I think the right to vote should be given at least as much respect as any Second Amendment right. Do you? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that voting is a fundamental right, and I fear that you might be taking my statement in Kanter out of context. What I said in that opinion was distinguishing between--it was a descriptive statement of the state of the court's case law comparing it to felon--stripping felons of Second Amendment rights. I expressed no view about whether--what the constitutional limits of that might be or whether the law should change with respect to felon voting rights, and obviously that's a contested issue in some states that are considering it right now. And I have no view on that. And it wasn't the subject of Kanter. </p><p>DURBIN: It may not have been--it wasn't the subject of the case; that's for sure. But in your writings you raised this. It was part of your dissent, discussing the right to vote and felony conviction eliminating it. I'm afraid it's inescapable. You've got to be prepared to answer this kind of question. I read it and I thought I can't imagine that she's saying this, but I'm afraid I was left with a suggestion you might, which brings me to the conclusion here. We hear over and over from the other side of the aisle we don't want any activist judges. </p><p>We want judges who are going to go back to the original document and literally take it word for word, put it in historical context and don't get in the way of making laws. We make the laws. You're a judge. You stay away from them. </p><p>And yet, when we look at this case the notion of what disqualifies you from buying a firearm was being rewritten by the dissenting judge in saying when we say felony, we just mean violent felony. Well, the word violent isn't in there, but you found it, or at least found reference to it. It's not the only time this has happened. In Citizens United and its progeny, Republican-appointed justices struck down bipartisan campaign finance reform to unleash a flood of dark money into our political system. Part of that flood is paying for the ad campaign promoting your nomination for the Supreme Court.  </p><p>I know you've said you've gone radio silent in following the media. I don't blame you. I do the same thing politically. But I can just tell you I've seen them. They are beautiful, expensive ads boosting your nomination for the Supreme Court from organizations we've never heard of, spending millions of dollars to make sure you get on the Supreme Court. Citizens United opened the door for that, and in Shelby County, conservative justices gutted the Voting Rights Act to unleash a wave of voter suppression across the country. Going back to the George Floyd moment, unfortunately a lot of it's for racial purposes. And this is an example, two or three examples that I've given here, of activist judges rewriting the law, abolishing the law. </p><p>People have to get real. As I said to you on our phone conversation, I don't think you put the facts here and the law here and nine justices come to the same conclusion. Cases are 5-4, 6-3, 7-2, unanimous. People see things differently based on their backgrounds, their values, their experience. And I think it's simplistic to think this is a robotic performance once we put a judge on the bench, they just go back, read the Constitution and rule. It's not that simple, and I think you've acknowledged that by saying even originalists disagree with one another. Is that true? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, law is hard, and it's complicated, and people who approach it from different jurisprudential perspectives will sometimes reach different results. I mean, I think that's hard to deny because, as you say, every vote from the Supreme Court isn't unanimous, and sometimes it is but cases don't get to the Supreme Court unless the circuits disagree among themselves, so it's hard. But to the extent, Senator Durbin, that you're suggesting that I have some sort of agenda on felon voting rights, or guns, or campaign finance or anything else, I can assure you and the whole committee that I do not. </p><p>DURBIN: I didn't say that, and I wouldn't say that. But I will say that you come, if you're successful in this pursuit, you come to the Supreme Court with life experiences. You come to the Supreme Court having read a lot, I'm sure, and drawn some conclusions in your own mind about certain things and certain issues. Everyone on the court has that same background. They bring something to it that is just not generic; it's individual. And that's the point I'm making. There's an individualism to this. The class of originalists on the Supreme Court are not all going to vote the same in every case. And I think merely saying originalism does not absolve you or us from observing the obvious. There are going to be differences. I thank--would you like to say something? I don't want to cut you off. </p><p>BARRETT: No, that's okay. </p><p>DURBIN: Okay, thank you very much.  </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Durbin. We'll go to Senator Lee, and after that we'll take a 30-minute lunch break and start back with Senator Whitehouse. Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two letters for the record that I'd like to have admitted. They offered by former law clerks of Judge Barrett's. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>LEE: I'd encourage all of my colleagues to read them. They're outstanding and provide great insight into Judge Barrett's immense qualifications. Judge Barrett, moments ago we went through a rather interesting set of exchanges. One of my colleagues, I hope I misunderstood him, seems to have suggested that it's a political talking point for you to decline to indicate how you would rule on a particular case or a particular type of case. To the extent that that's what any colleague has suggested, I'd remind that colleague that it's just wildly incorrect. It's wildly incorrect with canons of judicial ethics, with federal law, with the statement laid out by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her own confirmation proceedings before this very body in this very room nearly 30 years ago.  </p><p>It is imperative that you uphold those standards, and I applaud you for doing so. And I think on no planet is it appropriate for anybody to suggest that that's a political talking point for you to say I'm not going to indicate how I'm going to rule in a particular case. Justice Ginsburg did, in fact, say it well, and some of this has been quoted today. I'm going to quote it again just for good measure. She said judges in our system are bound to decide concrete cases, not abstract issues. A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints. For that would show not only disregard for the specifics of a particular case. It would display disdain for the entire judicial process.  </p><p>Similarly, because you are considering my capacity for independent judging, my personal views on how I would vote on a publicly debated issue were I in your shoes, were I a legislator, are not what you will be closely examining.  </p><p>That's what she said. She said it well. It was true in 1993, and it remains true today. </p><p>[*]LEE: I want to turn next to a line of questioning that you just finished, that you just completed. I, too, have read the Kanter case, and I am thrilled that we've got a jurist who is willing, when looking at somebody whose constitutional rights are about to be taken away, thrilled to have a jurist who is willing to consider a pre deprivation review for that individual. Is it unusual, judge Barrett, to consider someone's constitutional rights on an individualized basis before having a specifically enumerated constitutionally protected right removed? </p><p>BARRETT: That would be very, very unusual.  </p><p>LEE: Be very, very unusual. And it would be unwise, would it not? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think what I could say to that, just to be careful about how much law I'm analyzing is that the 14th Amendment due process clause certainly guarantees to each individual due process before liberty is taken away. </p><p>LEE: I also appreciated the thorough analysis that you undertook, making clear that our--our rights in this area don't just date back a few decades. They don't just date back to the 60s. They don't date just back to the 1780s or the 1760s. They date back at least to the 1660s. I mean, they go way, way back. There's a lot of history that went into what became the Second Amendment.  </p><p>There were conflicts. This involved not just partisan conflicts, but conflicts between the king and subjects. And not just between the king and subjects in the abstract, but very often it was between Protestants and Catholics. Sometimes it was Catholics who weren't trusted with guns. Sometimes it was Protestants who weren't trusted with guns. But there was a lot of violence that went into that and that led to our adoption of that amendment.  </p><p>I appreciated your historical analysis of this. Your willingness to be thorough, to make sure that when someone is constitutionally protected rights are taken into account. You're going to do your homework. You're going to do your homework even if it's hard. You're going to do it even if you've got colleagues who aren't willing to go there. That's what judicial leadership is. Judicial leadership involves willingness to stand alone.  </p><p>Judge Barrett, one of the things that came out to me as I read your opinion and they Kanter case is that your commitment to textualism and originalism are in fact real. They are not feign. This is the kind of thing you can't fake. This isn't something you make up at the last minute.  </p><p>And yes, I agree with Senator Durbin. Being a textualist and originalist doesn't guarantee a particular result, or particular outcome in any particular case. But it does indicate a style, a preference. Tell me why it text realism and originalism are important to you. </p><p>BARRETT: Because I think that both statutes and the constitution or law. They derive their Democratic legitimacy from the fact that they have been enacted in the case of statutes by the people people's representatives or in the case of the constitution, through the constitution making process. And I, as a judge, have an obligation to respect and enforce only that law that the people themselves have embraced.  </p><p>As I was saying earlier, it's not the law of Amy. It's the law of the American people and I think originalism and textualism to me boiled down to that, to a commitment to the rule of law to not disturbing or disturbing changing or updating or, you know, adjusting in line with my own policy preferences what that law requires.  </p><p>LEE: And is it--is it the subjective motivation, the subjective intent of an individual lawmaker or drafter of a constant constitutional provision that we're looking at or is it original public meaning? And if so, what's the difference between those two? </p><p>BARRETT: Its original public meeting meaning, not the subjective intent of any particular drafter. So one thing I have told my students in constitutional law is that the question is not what would James Madison do. We don't--we're not--we are not controlled by how James Madison perceived any particular problem.  </p><p>That's because the law is what the people understand it to become it not what goes on in any individual legislatures--legislator's mind. It's, I respect you greatly, Senator Lee, but what you think in your mind rather than what passes through both Houses and is signed by the president, that's with the law. Not any private intentions you have.  </p><p>LEE: So regardless of--of what--let's say I--I pass bill XYZ and I'm the sponsor of it and I take it down to the floor and I say here's bill XYZ and here's what I think about it. Here's what I intend to do with it. And I put that statement into the legislative record. What, if any, impact should that statement have on the meaning of law XYZ once it becomes law? </p><p>BARRETT: Nothing. You've got to get it into the law itself if you want it to be law. Legislative history is not what goes to the process of bicameralism and resentment. </p><p>LEE: Regardless of how passionately and persuasively I make that point in whatever glorious speech I give in support of bill XYZ, it doesn't make a darn bit of difference, does it? </p><p>BARRETT: It doesn't. I'm sure the speech would be glorious, but I assume the point you make probably would be made by the advocates in the case too. And so in that respect, you are functioning as an advocate when you make the glorious statement, but not speaking with the voice of the lawmaker because no individual does. It's the full body that speaks.  </p><p>LEE: I want to speak next about the Affordable Care Act. We've seen posters going up over and over and over again. We've seen them yesterday, we seen them today. We've seen a lot of compelling stories about people whose lives have been marked by difficult things that they've endured. They've involved touching and heartwarming stories.  </p><p>I continue to doubt the relevance of things like that here, especially insofar as they're being used to suggest that your confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States has anything to do with their health care. Tell me why you think that any individual Americans health care status is or is not tied to your confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. </p><p>BARRETT: It is not tied to my nomination to the Supreme Court of the United--United States. I have said repeatedly under oath that I had no conversations with anyone in the White House about that case and I'm not sure to the extent there's a suggestion that I have an agenda that I want to strike down people's protection for preexisting conditions, that's just not true. I've never taken that position and as I've also said repeatedly, any policy preferences that I have don't matter anyway. They are irrelevant. So making that law, coming out with the contours of the ACA, that's your job. </p><p>LEE: It is our job. It is the job of policy making branches of government. It's the job of whatever combination of state and federal lawmakers and other policy makers have. A judge is not a policy maker. When Congress passes a law, Congress is in charge of making sure that that law works insofar as that doesn't work or the law ends up being stricken down. It's our job to replace it with something that does work, whether constitutionally or otherwise in all respects. That's our job, not yours.  </p><p>You made some comments a few years ago, comments with which I wholeheartedly agree. Raising a criticism with Chief Justice Roberts and his majority decision in NFIB v. Sebelius. That decision, and don't worry, I'm not going to ask you to--to weigh in on this, you made those comments at the time and they are not relevant to me now. But I set this up for reasons I'll explain in a moment.  </p><p>He re wrote the Affordable Care Act not just once, but twice in substantive ways. In order to save that law from an otherwise inevitable finding of unconstitutionality because that law, as written by this Congress was in fact in constitutional in two material respects at issue NFIB v. Sebelius. Blatantly unconstitutional. He effectively acknowledged that the law as written couldn't pass constitutional muster. And so he rewrote it not just once, but twice in order to save it.  </p><p>That's water under the bridge. That happened. It's inexcusable that he did that. He misused the judicial authority. That case has absolutely nothing to do with California v. Texas. It has absolutely nothing to do with the question of sever ability in that case. Would it be fair to say that my very strong opinions that I've just expressed do not indicate how I would feel, how I would lean were I a jurist in California v. Texas? </p><p>BARRETT: I think you're correct, Senator Lee, that the question, the legal issue is entirely different in California versus Texas. Severability is its own independent doctrine and has nothing to do with the statutory interpretation questions presented in Sebelius.  </p><p>LEE: In many circumstances in this country, we see emotionally charged issues that boil--that boil for a long time that can't always be resolved. Not everybody is going to agree on everything. Not everybody is going to agree uncertain hot button social issues that result, in some cases, from just basic differences in how people view life and how people view their place in the universe. </p><p>Areas where it manifested itself is in the area of abortion. People view life and when it begins differently. Some of that is informed by religious beliefs, some of it is informed just by people's common sense approach to what they think the law ought to say and what it ought not to say. </p><p>Disputes regarding when life begins and disputes regarding abortion didn't begin with Roe v Wade. What did change with Roe v. Wade however was the federalization and the grasping of the issue and the taking it beyond the realm of political debate within the federal judiciary such that elected lawmakers were no longer in a position to be the primary drivers of policy. </p><p>As a result over the last few decades we have had all kinds of questions that have been put into uncertainty. You've got uncertainty by people at the state level who want to make their own decisions about certain things around of abortion and though they can't prohibit it entirely you know that that there is the son do burden standard that has to be addressed. Nobody is completely sure in advance what that means and so they work around it and there are discussions that arise regarding health and safety qualifications for abortion clinics, how close an abortion clinic needs to be to an accredited hospital, how it needs to be staffed, what the sanitation verticals are. </p><p>Then you have got more recently some states passing laws saying look, there's abundant medical science showing that in unborn human can feel and respond to pain as early as I don't know, 10 or 12 gestational weeks but certainly by 20 weeks and so by 20 weeks we are going to adopt a different set of legal procedures for an abortion as a result of that because if this is a human that everybody agrees can feel and respond to pain we have to handle that differently. All of those things, the legitimacy of those laws are thrown into the federal courts yet again all because those were made federal issues. </p><p>I want to be very clear you would have the impression from watching debates in circumstances like this one and in protest outside the Supreme Court of the United States you would have the impression that if Roe v. Wade didn't exist that all of the sudden abortion would immediately become illegal in every state in America. That assumes a lot of facts not in evidence. In fact that assumes a lot of things contrary to evidence. It is not--simply not the case that the fate of healthcare in America turns on whether or not someone is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States nor is it a fact to suggest that the availability of an abortion or lack thereof is contingent upon anyone's confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. </p><p>The fact that we have this debate and the fact that it has become as protracted, as personal, as ugly as it has could I suspect be traced to the fact that we have tried to take a debatable matter beyond debate and we have tried to take it outside the political branches of government where people can elect their individual representatives and have laws respecting and reflecting the views of their respective communities. We are a country of what, 330 million Americans? It is really, really difficult to have those 330 million Americans reflected in nine members of the Supreme Court. </p><p>It is still really hard to have them reflected in 100 senators and 435 representatives. That is doable especially when those people are elected. They stand for election every couple of years in the case of the house every six years, in the case of the Senate. Doesn't happen that way in the Supreme Court of the United States. So to my colleagues the other side of the aisle who are fear mongering on this causing people to worry and lose sleep over this, fund raising over this, fund raising over threats that people are going to lose their health care, fundraising over threats that people are going to be dying in the streets because the lack of availability of this order that medical procedure, I would ask have we created a monster? Have we ourselves through our own in action, through our own voluntary cessation of authority the to a non-legislative nonpolitical branch have we created the very set of untenable social circumstances that are causing people to protest outside of a nonpolitical entity. </p><p>I think we have to ask ourselves that question from time to time. </p><p>Life is in fact valuable. It is not a religious statement to make that observation. In fact it's the foundation of basically all of our laws not just in this country, not just in countries with Christian origins but in basically every country that has ever existed anywhere in the world. The purpose of government is to protect life, that is what it's about. If we can't agree on the fact that it is reasonable people ought to be able to have some say at least at some limit, at least at some point beyond the moment when an unborn human can feel and respond to pain something is wrong with us if we are going to leave those things perpetually in the hands of the unelected. It might be really convenient for political fundraising within Congress. It's not good for the United States of America. It's not good for a constitutionally limited government. That's not good for our individual liberties. </p><p>Judge Barrett, Alexander Hamilton was prescient in a number of areas. He had some crazy ideas, he did some crazy things. He was also freaking brilliant. I think he foresaw certain aspects of our lives when he described the differences between the branches of government and Federalist 78. In Federalist 78 said that the legislative branch, Congress being a political branch, a branch whose job it is to make policy, to make law must possess with will and that what is possessed of a judicial branch is not will but judgment. </p><p>He then went on to explain that it's really important to maintain that--back clear distinction between will and judgment lest you have a judicial branch consisting of people who are not elected by the people, not accountable to the people at regular intervals and to serve basically for the rest of their lives so long as they are on good behavior. You can't have them exercising will because it's not their job. What do you think he meant? What's the difference between will and judgment? </p><p>BARRETT: I think will is the imposition of policy preferences as happens in the making of law. Judgment is evaluating that law for its consistency with the Constitution for example or to give another example to interpret what that law means but it certainly is not the imposition of policy preferences. A judge who approaches a case as an opportunity for an exercise of will has acted--has betrayed her judicial duty. </p><p>LEE: How does she know when she's reached that point? </p><p>BARRETT: So I think it requires disciplined judicial decision-making so you approach the text, you treated as a text, you treat it as law. You know I have described originalism and textualism so I won't belabor that point but I will say that one practice that I have, one check that I put on myself to make sure that I'm not biased is that when I write an opinion I tried to read it from the perspective of the losing parties so that any sympathy that I might feel for the particular result that I reach, I tried to make the sympathy run the other way to see if it will still hold and also to see like you know I would be disappointed in this outcome if it was my child whose sentence or criminal conviction or civil loss whatever it is is on the line, but would I still think it was a well reasoned opinion and that is the test that I use for myself. </p><p>I think discipline is required but I take it very, very seriously. </p><p>LEE: As we have had this conversation today one of the arguments that's been made by some of my colleagues refer to activism and has accused if I understood the argument correctly some textual list originalist jurist as having engaged in activism. Now I want to be clear, I'm one who doesn't believe that there is anything worse about an activist judge than a pacifist judge, meaning I think it's every bit as bad to be a pacifist, that is, for example, to let stand an invalid unconstitutional law as if it were valid and constitutional. It's every bit as bad to do that as it is to invalidate as unconstitutional something that is, in fact, not unconstitutional. You agree with me that both of those are equally instances of bad judging? </p><p>BARRETT: They are both instances, as you've posed them, of not following the law, not following the Constitution, or not correctly interpreting a statute. </p><p>LEE: Of the same token, a judge who fails to grant a meritorious dispositive motion and a judge who grants a non meritorious dispositive motion, they've both probably done an equally bad thing. Is that right? </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. </p><p>LEE: Does the Constitution say anything about the size of the Supreme Court? </p><p>BARRETT: The Constitution does not. That is a question left open to Congress. It's my understanding that it's been nine for about 150 years, but that's as a matter of statute, not constitutional requirement. </p><p>LEE: It's statutory. It's a statutory decision, one that's stood for more than a century and a half. It's a decision, nonetheless, that has some bearing, could have some bearing on constitutional issues, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Insofar as there would be more decision makers on the court? </p><p>LEE: Yeah, if we abandoned the long-standing historical practice and tradition of having nine justices, could that have an impact on the way the three branches of government interact with each other? </p><p>BARRETT: Possibly, but it's difficult for me to imagine what specific constitutional question you're asking. And of course, if there were one, I couldn't opine on it. </p><p>LEE: Of course, of course. There are strong reasons, I believe, why over the last more than a century and a half we've left that number at nine. As you point out, there's nothing in the Constitution that requires it. We could come up with any number we wanted. There does have to be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as we choose to create, but it doesn't specify the number of seats that could be on there. There are nonetheless good, prudential reasons, reasons having to do with respect for the separation of powers between the three branches of government, reasons that have over the last 150-plus years left us to leave that number at nine.  </p><p>The last time, as far as I can tell, that there was any serious effort to move the number above nine was in the fall of 1936 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt got tired of the so-called Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, a few members of the Supreme Court who were consistently voting against his agenda, and sometimes joined by one or more other members of the Supreme Court. He got particularly tired of this, and so he proposed packing the court. And let me explain what I mean by packing the court here. What I mean when I refer to this is increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and doing so, by statute, with the intent of altering the composition of the court for short-term political gain. That's what FDR wanted to do.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that he had an overwhelming super-majority in both houses of Congress, fortunately FDR's idea he pushed in the fall of 1936 didn't make it anywhere. It didn't gain progress. It met enough opposition even with both houses of Congress being overwhelmingly controlled by his political party that it stalled quite mercifully, and it's remained ever since then at nine justices. I think it would have been a colossal mistake.  </p><p>Joe Biden himself as a U.S. senator, as a member of this body, in a proceeding of this committee in 1983, gave a rousing speech that I recommend to all talking about that very thing, acknowledging that the Constitution doesn't require it, but our respect for the separation of powers really ought to lead to us sticking to the number nine. Don't pack the court.  </p><p>In recent days I've seen some in the media and some in this body try to redefine what it means to pack the court. Some have suggested, well, court packing takes various forms, and it can mean confirming a lot of people all at once. Some have defined it so as to suggest that it consists of doing that which the Trump administration and the Republican Senate have been doing over the last 3.5 years, which is filling vacancies as they have arisen and doing so with textualist, originalist judges. This may not be something that some like, but this is not court packing.  </p><p>Court packing is itself manipulative. It's something that has great danger to do immense political and constitutional harm to our system of government in part because it would set up a one-way ratchet. Once you create a position and confirm someone to that position, absent death, retirement or impeachment and removal, that position remains in place. </p><p>So if, for example, a future Congress and White House were to decide to get together and to pack the court and increase the number, say, to 11, and let's say it's Democrats who do that, and we've got Joe Biden now as a presidential candidate who is refusing to say whether he would do it. There's a reason he's not saying whether he would do it. There's only one reason why you refuse to answer that question. It's you're wanting to be able to do it, but you don't want to take the heat for the fact that you're thinking about doing it right now.  </p><p>So if they do that, where does it lead? Well, it inevitably leads to the point where the next time Republicans have control of both houses of Congress and the White House they'd increase it, as well. You'd end up increasing it incrementally. Before long, it looks like the Senate in Star Wars where you've got hundreds of people on there. I don't know what the total number would be, but you increase it at all, you change the number at all, you do so for partisan political purposes at all, you delegitimize the court, and you can't delegitimize the court without fundamentally threatening and eroding and impairing some of our most valued liberties.  </p><p>You can't do that without inevitably threatening things like religious freedom, things like free speech, things that are themselves often unpopular but are protected by the Constitution precisely because they are unpopular. And yes, in that respect, the Constitution is sometimes counter democratic. Sometimes it can be described as fundamentally undemocratic. In fact, it's the whole reason to have a Constitution is to protect us from the impulse of a majority that might be bent on harming a few in the name of the many. </p><p>That's why the law is so important. That's why the position for which you are being considered is so essential. That's why we've got to do our job to make sure that the only people who get the job for which you've been nominated fit the bill. You, Judge Barrett, are someone in whom I have immense confidence, immense trust. And I look forward to voting to confirming you for that very position. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thanks, Senator Lee. We'll take--let's come back at 12:45. We'll start with Senator Whitehouse. We have 15 senators left. If everybody takes the 30 minutes, that's 7 and a half hours. We'll take a break for dinner tonight sometime later on, and a short break. Are you doing okay? </p><p>BARRETT: Mm-hm. </p><p>GRAHAM: Three hours of that, right. So we'll come back at 12:45, and right now we're on schedule to be here until 9:00, but we'll do whatever the committee wants. We're in recess until 12:45. </p><p>[*](RECESS) </p><p>GRAHAM: The hearing will come to order. Senator Whitehouse? </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Chairman. Judge Barrett, you can take a bit of a breather on your return to the committee because what I want to do is go through with the people who are watching this now the conversation that you and I had when we spoke on the telephone. You were kind enough to hear out a presentation that I made, and I intend to ask some questions in that area, but it doesn't make sense to ask questions if I haven't laid the predicate, particularly for viewers who are watching this. </p><p>So I guess the reason that I want to do this is because people who are watching this need to understand that this small hearing room and the little TV box that you are looking at, the little screen that you are looking at are a little bit like the frame of--of a puppet theater and if you only look at what's going on in the puppet theater and you're not going to understand the whole story, you are not going to understand the real dynamic what is going on here and you are certainly not going to understand forces outside of this room who are pulling strings and pushing sticks and causing the puppet theater to react. </p><p>So first, let me say why do I think outside forces are here pulling strings? Well, part of it is behavior. We have colleagues here who supported you, this nominee before there was a nominee. That's a little unusual. </p><p>We have the political ram job that we have already complained of driving this process through at breakneck speed in the middle of a pandemic while the Senate is closed for safety reasons and while we are doing nothing about the COVID epidemic around us. We have some very awkward 180s from colleagues. Mr. Chairman, you figure in this. Our leader said back when it was Garland versus Gorsuch matter, of course, of course, the American people should have a say in the court's direction. Of course, of course, said Mitch McConnell. That's long gone. </p><p>Senator Grassley said the American people shouldn't be denied a voice. That's long gone. Senator Cruz said you don't do this in an election year. That's long gone. And our chairman made his famous hold the tape promise if an opening comes in the last year of(PH) President Trump's term will wait until the next election. That's gone too. </p><p>So there is a lot of hard to explain hypocrisy and rush taking place right now, and my experience around politics is that when you find hypocrisy in the daylight, look for power in the shadows. Now people say well, what does all this matter? This is a political parlor game; it's no big deal. Well, there are some pretty high stakes here that we have been talking about here on--on our side, and I will tell you three of them right here. </p><p>Roe v. Wade, Obergefell, and the Obamacare cases. Here's the GOP platform, the Republican platform, the platform of my colleagues on the other side of this I'll say that a Republican president will appoint judges who will reverse Roe, Obergefell, and the Obamacare cases. So if you have a family member with an interest in some autonomy over their body under Roe v. Wade, the ability to have a marriage, have friends, have a niece or a daughter or a son marry someone of their same-sex they have--you have got a steak and if you are one of the millions and millions of Americans who depend on the affordable care act you have got a stake. </p><p>It's not just the platform. Over and over again, let's start by talking about the Affordable Care Act. Here is the president talking about this litigation that we are gearing up this nominee for for November 10. In this litigation, he said we want to terminate healthcare under Obamacare. </p><p>That is the president's statement, so when we react to that, don't act as if we are making this stuff up. This is what President Trump said. This is what your party platform says reverse the Obamacare cases. Senator after senator, including many in this committee, filed briefs saying that the Affordable Care Act should be thrown out by courts. Why is it surprising for us to be concerned that you want this nominee to do what you want nominees to do? </p><p>One quick stop on NFIB v. Sebelius because a lot of this has to do with money. This is an interesting comparison. National Federation of Independent Businesses, until it filed the NFIB v. Sebelius case, had its biggest donation ever of $21,000. In the year that it went to work on the Affordable Care Act, ten wealthy donors gave $10 million. Somebody deserves a thank you. </p><p>So let's go on to Roe v. Wade. Same thing. Same thing. The president has said that reversing Roe v. Wade will happen automatically because he is putting pro-life justices on the court. Why would we not take him at his word? The Republican Party platform says it will reverse Roe. </p><p>Why would we not comment on that and take you at your word? Senators here, including Senator Hawley, have said I will vote only for nominees who acknowledge that Roe v. Wade is wrongly decided and their pledge to vote for this nominee. Do the math. That's a really simple equation to run. </p><p>The Republican brief in June Medical said Roe should be overruled, so don't act surprised when we ask questions about whether that's what you are up to hear and finally out in the ad world that you have spared yourself wisely Judge Barrett, the Susan B Anthony Foundation is running advertisements right now saying that you are set, you are set to give our pro-life country a court that(PH) it deserves. </p><p>Here is the ad with the voiceover. She said--she said and then Roe, Obamacare cases and Obergefell, gay marriages. National Organization for Marriage, the big group that opposes same-sex marriage, says in this proceeding, all our issues are at stake. The Republican platform says it wants to reverse Obergefell, and the Republican brief filed in the case said same-sex relationships don't fall within any constitutional protection, so when we say the stakes are high on this, it's because you have said the stakes are high on this. You have said that is what you want to do. So how are people going about doing it? What is the scheme here? </p><p>Let me start with this one. In all cases, there's big anonymous money behind various lanes of activity. One lane of activity is through the conduit of the Federalist Society. It is managed by a guy--was managed by a guy named Leonard Leo, and it has taken over the selection of judicial nominees. How do we know that to be the case? Because Trump has said so over and over again. His White House counsel said so. So we have an anonymously funded group controlling judicial selection run by this guy Leonard Leo. </p><p>Then in another lane, we have again anonymous funders running through something called the Judicial Crisis Network, which is run by Carrie Severino, and it is doing PR and campaign ads for Republican judicial nominees. It got $17 million--single $17 million donation in the Garland-Gorsuch contest, it got another single $17 million donation to support Kavanaugh. </p><p>[*]WHITEHOUSE: Somebody, perhaps the same person, spent $35 million to influence the United States Supreme Court. Tell me that's good. And then over here you have a whole array of legal groups, also funded by dark money, which have a different role. They bring cases to the court. They don't wind their way to the court, Your Honor, they get shoved to the court to by these legal groups, many of which ask to lose below so they can get quickly to the court to get their business done there. And then they turn up in a chorus, an orchestrated chorus of amici.  </p><p>Now I've had a chance to have a look at this. And I was in a case, actually, as an amicus myself, the Consumer Financial Protection Board case. And in that case there were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 amicus briefs filed, and every single one of them was a group funded by something called Donors Trust. </p><p>Donors Trust is a gigantic identity-scrubbing device for the right wing so that it says Donors Trust is the donor without whoever the real donor is. It doesn't have a business. It doesn't have a business plan. It doesn't do anything. It's just an identity scrubber.  </p><p>And this group here, the Bradley Foundation, funded 8 out of the 11 briefs. That seems weird to me when you have amicus briefs coming in little flotillas that are funded by the same groups but nominally separate in the court. </p><p>So I actually attached this to my brief as an appendix. Center for Media and Democracy saw it, and they did better work. They went on to say which foundations funded the brief writers in that CFPB case. Here is the Bradley Foundation for $5.6 million to those groups. Here's Donors Trust, $23 million to those brief writing groups. The grand total across all the donor groups was $68 million to the group that were filing amicus briefs, pretending that they were different groups. </p><p>And it's not just in the Consumer Financial Protection Board case. You might say well that was just a one-off. Here's Janus, the anti-labor case that had a long trail through the court, through Friedrichs, and through Knox, and through other decisions. </p><p>And SourceWatch and ProPublica did some work about this. Here's Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. And here's the Bradley Foundation. And they totaled giving $45 million to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 groups that filed amicus briefs, pretending to be different groups, and both of the lawyer groups in the case, funded by Donors Trust, funded by Bradley Foundation in Janus.  </p><p>This is happening over and over and over again, and it goes beyond just the briefs. It goes beyond just the amicus presentations. The Federalist Society, remember this group that is acting as the conduit and that Donald Trump has said is doing his judicial selection? They're getting money from the same foundations, from Donors Trust, $16.7 million and the Bradley Foundation, $1.37 million. From the same group of foundations total, $33 million.  </p><p>So you can start to look at these, and you can start to tie them together. The legal groups, all the same funders over and over again, bringing the cases and providing us orchestrated, orchestrated chorus of amici. Then the same group also funds the Federalist Society over here. The Washington Post wrote a big expose about this, and that made Leonard Leo a little hot, a little bit like a burned agent. So he had to jump out. And he went off to go do anonymously-funded voter suppression work. Guess who jumped in to take over the selection process in this case for Judge Barrett? Carrie Severino made the hop. So once again, ties right in together.  </p><p>So Center for Media and Democracy did a little bit more research. Here's a Bradley Foundation memo that they've published. The Bradley Foundation is reviewing a grant application asking for money for this orchestrated amicus process, and what do they say in the staff recommendation? It is important to orchestrate--their word, not mine--important to orchestrate high-caliber amicus efforts before the court. </p><p>They also note that Bradley has done previous philanthropic investments in the actual underlying legal actions. So Bradley is funding--what do they call--philanthropically investing in, the underlying legal action and then giving money to groups to show up in the orchestrated chorus of amici. That can't be good. </p><p>And it goes on because they also found this email. This email comes from an individual at the Bradley Foundation, and it asks our friend, Leonard Leo, who used to run the selection process, is there a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to which Bradley could direct any support of the two Supreme Court amicus projects other than Donors Trust? I don't know why they wanted to avoid the reliable identity scrubber Donors Trust, but for some reason they did.  </p><p>So Leonard Leo writes back on Federalist Society address--so don't tell me that it isn't Federal Society business--on Federal Society--on his address he writes back, yes, send it to the Judicial Education Project, which could take and allocate the money. And guess who works for the Judicial Education Project? Carrie Severino, who also helped select this nominee running the Trump Federalist Society selection process.  </p><p>So the connections abound. In the Washington Post article, they point out that the Judicial Crisis Network's office is on the same hallway in the same building as the Federalist Society, and when they sent their reporter to talk to somebody at the Judicial Crisis Network, somebody from the Federalist Society came down to let them up. This more and more looks like it's not three schemes, but it's one scheme with the same funders selecting judges, funding campaigns for the judges and then showing up in court in these orchestrated amicus flotillas to tell the judges what to do. </p><p>On the Judicial Crisis Network you've got the Leonard Leo connection, obviously. She hopped in to take over for him with the Federalist Society. You've got the campaigns that I've talked about where they take $17 million contributions. That's a big check to write, $17 million, to campaign for Supreme Court nominees. No idea who that is or what they got for it. You've got briefs that she wrote. The Republican senators filed briefs in that NFIB case signed by Ms. Severino. </p><p>The woman who helped choose this nominee has written briefs for Republican senators attacking the ACA. Don't say the ACA is not an issue here. And by the way, the Judicial Crisis Network funds the Republican attorneys general. It funds RAGA, the Republican Attorney Generals Association, and it funds individual Republican attorneys general. And guess who the plaintiffs are in the Affordable Care Act case? Republican attorneys general. </p><p>Trump joined them because he didn't want to defend, so he's in with the Republican attorneys general, but here's the Judicial Crisis Network campaigning for Supreme Court nominees, writing briefs for senators against the Affordable Care Act, supporting the Republicans who are bringing this case, and leading the selection process for this nominee. </p><p>Here is the page off the brief. Here is where they are. Mitch McConnell, and on through the list, Senator Collins, Senator Cornyn, Senator Hoeven, Senator--who's still here? Marco Rubio. It's a huge assortment of Republican senators who Carrie Severino wrote a brief for against--against, against, the Affordable Care Act. So this is a, to me, pretty big deal. I've never seen this around any court that I've ever been involved with where there's this much dark money and this much influence being used.  </p><p>Here's how the Washington Post summed it up. This is a conservative activist behind-the-scenes campaign to remake the nation's courts, and it's a $250 million dark money operation. $250 million is a lot of money to spend if you're not getting anything for it. So that raises the question, what are they getting for it? Well, I showed the slide earlier on the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>And on Obergefell and on Roe v. Wade, that's where they lost. But with another judge, that could change. That's where the contest is. That's where The Republican Party platform tells us to look at how they want judges to rule, to reverse Roe, to reverse the Obamacare case cases and to reverse Obergefell and take away gay marriage. That is their stated objective and plan. Why not take them at their word? </p><p>But there is another piece of it, and that is not what's ahead of us, but what's behind us. What's behind us is now 80 cases, Mr. Chairman, 80 cases under Chief Justice Roberts that have these characteristics. One, they were decided five to four by a bare majority. Two, the five to four majority was partisan in the sense that not one Democrat--Democratic appointee joined the five. I refer to that group as the ""Roberts five."" </p><p>It changes a little bit as--with Justice Scalia's death, for instance, but there's been a steady ""Roberts five"" that has delivered now 80 of these decisions. And the last characteristic of them is that there is an identifiable Republican donor interest in those cases and in every single case, that donor interest won. It was an 80, 5 to 4 partisan route ransacking.  </p><p>And it's important to look at where those cases went because they're not about big, public issues like getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, undoing Roe v. Wade, and undoing same sex marriage. They're about power. And if you look at those 80 decisions, they fall into four categories over and over and over again. One, unlimited and dark money and politics. Citizens United is the famous one, but it's continued since with McCutcheon and we've got one coming up now. Always the five for unlimited money in politics. Never protecting against money dark money in politics, despite the fact that they said it was going to be transparent.  </p><p>And who wins when you allow unlimited dark money in politics? A very small group. The ones who have unlimited money to spend and emotive to spend it in politics. They win. Everybody else loses. And if you're looking at who might be behind this, let's talk about people with unlimited money to spend and a motive to do it. We'll see how that goes.  </p><p>Next, knock the civil jury down. Whittle it down to a nub. The civil jury was in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, in our darn Declaration of Independence, but it's annoying to big corporate powers because you can swagger your way as a big corporate power through Congress. You can go and tell the president you put money into to elect what to do. He will put your stooges at the EPA. It's all great until you get to the civil jury because they have an application, as you know, Judge Barrett, they have an obligation under the law to be fair to both parties irrespective of their size.  </p><p>You can't bribe them. You're not allowed to. It's a crime to tamper with the jury. It's standard practice to tamper with Congress. And they make decisions based on the law. If you're used to being the boss and swaggering your way around the political side, you don't want to be answerable before a jury. And so one after another, these 80, 5 to 4 decisions have knocked down, whittled away at the civil jury, a Great American institution.  </p><p>Third--first was unlimited dark money, second was demean and diminish the civil jury, third is weaken regulatory agencies. A lot of this money, I'm convinced, is polluter money. The Koch Industries is a polluter, the fossil fuel industries is a polluter. Who else would be putting buckets of money into this and wanting to hide who they are behind donors trust or other schemes?  </p><p>And what are--if you're a big polluter, what do you want? You want weak regulatory agencies. You want ones that you can box up and run over to Congress and get your friends to fix things for you in Congress. Over and over and over again, these decisions are targeted at regulatory agencies to weaken their independence and weaken their strength. And if you're a big polluter, a weak regulatory agency is your idea of a good day.  </p><p>And the last thing is in politics. In voting. Why on earth the court made the decision, a factual decision, not something appellate courts are ordinarily supposed to make, as I understand it, Judge Barrett, the factual decision that new nobody needed to worry about minority voters in preclearance states being discriminated against or that legislators would try to knock back their ability to vote, these five made that finding in Shelby County against bipartisan legislation from both houses of Congress hugely passed on no factual record.  </p><p>They just decided that that was a problem that was over on no record with no basis because it got them to the result that we then saw. What followed? State after state after state passed voter suppression laws. One so badly targeting African Americans that two courts said it was surgically, surgically tailored to get after minority voters.  </p><p>And gerrymandering, the other great control. Bulk gerrymandering where you go into a state, like the red map project did in Ohio and Pennsylvania and you pack Democrats so tightly into a few districts that other all the others become Republican majority districts. And in those states, you send a delegation to Congress that has a huge majority of Republican members like 13 to 5, as I recall in a state where the five, the party of the five actually won the popular vote.  </p><p>You've sent a delegation to Congress that is out of step with the popular vote of that state and court after court figured out how to solve that at-- the Supreme Court said no. 5 to 4 again. No. We're not going to take an interest in that question. In all these areas where it's about political power for big special interests and people who want to fund campaigns and people who want to get their way through politics without actually showing up, doing it behind donors trust and other groups, doing it through these schemes over and over and over again, you see the same thing.  </p><p>80 decisions, Judge Barrett. 80 decisions. And 80 to 0 sweep. I don't--I don't think you've tried cases, but some cases, the issue is bias and discrimination. And if you were making a bias case as a trial lawyer--Lindsey Graham is a hell of a good trial lawyer. If he wanted to make a bias case--Dick Durbin is a hell of a good trial lawyer. If they wanted to make a bias case and they could show an 80 to 0 pattern, A, that's admissible, and B, I'd love to make that argument to the jury. I'd be really hard pressed to be the lawyer saying no, 80 to 0 is just a bunch of flukes.  </p><p>All five-four. All partisan, oh this way. So something is not right around the court. And dark money has a lot to do with it. Special interests have a lot to do with it. Donors trust and whoever is hiding behind donors trust has a lot to do with it and the Bradley Foundation orchestrating its (INAUDIBLE) over at the court has a lot to do with it.  </p><p>So I thank you, Judge Barrett, for listening to me now a second time and I think this gives you a chance for you and I to tee up an interesting conversation tomorrow. And I think my colleagues for hearing me out. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Cruz. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Mr. Chairman, can I put three letters in unanimous consent? </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Barrett, welcome. Congratulations on being nominated. Congratulations on enduring the confirmation proceedings. And I think it is a particularly good thing we've made it through what I guess you would call the top of the lineup of the questioning and some of the smartest and, and frankly, most effective questioners on the Democratic side, and I think it speaks volumes that collectively, they've had very few questions for you.  </p><p>And virtually none calling into question your credentials, which are impeccable, your record, and what I think is--has been at an extraordinary life you've led. </p><p>[*]CRUZ: So that--that should be the source of great satisfaction in terms of the scholarly record and judicial record that you've spent a lifetime building. I want to start by asking you a question. Why is--the First Amendment's protection of religious liberty, why--why is that important? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think it's broadly viewed that the framers protected--and ratifiers protected the free exercise of religion because, you know, for reasons that we all know from history of persecuted religious minorities fleeing to the United States, that--enshrining that protection, you know, it was one of the Bill of Rights because it was considered so fundamental. </p><p>CRUZ: And why--why does that matter to Americans? What difference does it--that make in--in anybody's life?  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think all of the Bill of Rights, each and every one of them, is important to Americans because we value the Constitution, including religious liberty. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, how about the free speech protections in the First Amendment? Why--why are those important? </p><p>BARRETT: So that minority viewpoints can't be squashed, so that it's not just the majority that can speak popular views. You--you know, I--you don't really need the First Amendment if what you're saying is something that everybody wants to hear. You need it when people are trying to silence you. </p><p>CRUZ: And how about the Second Amendment? Why is the right to keep and bear arms important? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, you know, we talked about Heller earlier this morning. And, you know, what Heller tells us is that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms for self-defense. </p><p>CRUZ: Oh, I think all of those rights, and I agree with you, the entire Bill of Rights is incredibly important to Americans. I also think what is really striking about this hearing today and also yesterday is that Senate Democrats are not defending what I think is really a--a radical agenda that they have when it comes to the Bill of Rights. </p><p>And the topics they're discussing today have little bearing to the rights that are really at issue and in jeopardy at the Supreme Court. And so, let's take a few minutes to--to--to go through them up. First of all, we've had some discussion of Roe v. Wade. You have declined to give an opinion on a matter that might be pending before the court.  </p><p>That is, of course, the same answer that every single sitting justice has given when he or she was sitting in the same chair you are. It is mandated by the judicial canons of ethics. Whether one is a nominee of a Democratic president or a Republican president, that has been the answer that has been given to this committee for decades. </p><p>But I do think it is interesting that our Democratic colleagues, number one, don't discuss what would actually happen if there came a day in which Roe v. Wade were overruled, which is namely that it would not suddenly become the case that abortion was illegal, but rather it would revert to the status of the law as it's been for nearly 200 years of our nations history, which is that the question of the permissibility of abortion is a question for elected legislatures at the state levels and at the federal level. </p><p>And it is difficult to dispute that there are great many jurisdictions, including jurisdictions like California and New York who, even if Roe v. Wade were no longer the law of the land, their elected legislatures would almost certainly continue unrestricted access to abortion with virtually no--no limitations. </p><p>What I find interesting though, is that our Democratic colleagues do not discuss what is readily--really the radical position of the most liberal justices on the Supreme Court, which is that no restrictions whatsoever are permissible when it comes to abortion.  </p><p>Yesterday one of the Democratic senators made reference to the case Gonzales v. Carhart. I'm quite familiar with that case, and I represented Texas and a number of other states as amici in that case. That case concerned the constitutionality of the federal ban on partial-birth abortions. That was legislation that passed Congress, was signed into law that made the really gruesome practice of partial-birth abortion illegal. </p><p>Overwhelming majority of Americans believe partial-birth abortion should be prohibited, even those who identify as pro-choice. A significant percentage of Americans don't want to see that gruesome practice allowed. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4 in Carhart v. Gonzales, upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortion.  </p><p>That means there were four justices ready to strike it down, ready to conclude that you can't ban on partial-birth abortion, that you can't ban late-term abortion. And by the way, the restrictions that are question include parental consent laws, parental notification laws. </p><p>None of our Democratic colleagues want to talk about the justices they want to see on the court would strike down every single reasonable restriction on unlimited abortion on demand that the vast majority of Americans support. </p><p>How about free speech? Well, we've heard quite a bit about free speech. The senator from Rhode Island just gave a long presentation complete with lots of charts. I'll say a couple of things on free speech. First of all, our Democratic colleagues, when they address the issue of so-called dark money in campaign-finance contributions, are often deeply, deeply hypocritical and don't address the actual facts that exist. </p><p>Here's some facts. Of the top 20 organizations spending money for political speech in the year 2016, 14 of them gave virtually all of their money to Democrats, and another three split the money evenly. So, only three of the top 20 gave money to Republicans. What did that mean in practice? That meant the top 20 super PAC donors contributed $422 million to Democrats in $189 million to Republicans. </p><p>Those who give these impassioned speeches against dark money don't mention that their site is funded by dark money with a massive differential. The senator from Rhode Island talked about big corporate powers without acknowledging that the contributions from the Fortune 500 in this presidential election overwhelmingly favor Joe Biden and the Democrats, without acknowledging that the contribution from Wall Street in this election overwhelming favor Joe Biden and the Democrats. </p><p>It's an awful lot of rhetoric about power, but it gets even more interesting when you look at Supreme Court nominations. We just heard an attack on the Federalist Society, a group that I've been a member of for over 25 years. I joined as a law student. It's a group that brings conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists together to have robust discussions about the Constitution and about the law. </p><p>What's interesting is nowhere in the senator of Rhode Island's remarks was any reference to a company called Arabella Advisors, which is a for-profit entity that manages nonprofits, including the Sixteen Thirty Fund and the New Venture fund. Now, what on earth are those? Those sound like awfully dark and can--confusing names. </p><p>Well, according to the Wall Street Journal this Sunday, in the years 2017 in 2018, those entities reported $987.5 million in revenue. That's nearly $1 billion. We heard a lot of thundering indignation at what was described as $250 million of expenditures. In this case you got $1 billion. The senator of Rhode Island said that that much money, much of which is dark money that we don't know who contributed it, he asked what are they getting for it. </p><p>And by the way, one of the things they're getting for it is a group called Demand Justice, a project of those entities, spent $5 million opposing Justice Brett Kavanaugh and has just launched a seven-figure ad buy opposing your con--confirmation.  </p><p>So, all of the great umbrage about the corporate interests are spending dark money is wildly in conflict with the actual facts that the corporate interests that are spending dark money are funding the Democrats by a factor of 3 to 1 or greater, a fact that doesn't ever seem to be acknowledged. </p><p>But not only that, what was Citizens United about? Yeah, it's interesting most people at home, they--they've heard about Citizens United. They know it makes Democrats very, very upset. But they don't actually know what the case is about. </p><p>[*]CRUZ: Citizens United concerned whether or not it was legal to make a movie criticizing a politician, specifically Citizens United is a small nonprofit organization based here in DC that made a movie that was critical of Hillary Clinton and the Obama Justice Department took the position that it could find, it could punish Citizens United for daring to make a movie critical of a politician. </p><p>The case went all of the way to the U.S. Supreme Court at the oral argument, there was a moment that was truly chilling. Justice Sam Alito asked me Obama Justice Department is that your position under your theory of the case that the federal government can ban books, and the Obama Justice Department responded yes. Yes, it is our position that if the books criticize a political candidate, a politician, the federal government can ban books. </p><p>As far as I am concerned, that is a terrifying view of the first amendment. Citizens United was decided 5-4. By a narrow 5-4 majority, the Supreme Court concluded the First Amendment did not allow the federal government to punish you for making a movie critical of a politician and likewise that the federal government couldn't ban books. Four justices dissented, four justices were willing to say the federal government can ban books and--can ban movies and presumably could ban books as well. </p><p>When Hillary Clinton was running for president, she explicitly promised every justice she nominated to the court would pledge to overturn Citizens United. By the way, Hillary Clinton said she was done man of her nominees, something you have rightly said that this administration has not demanded of view, which is a commitment on any case as to how you will roll. Democrats have shown no compunction in expecting their nominees to make a promise. Here is how I'm going to vote on a pending case, judicial ethics be damned. </p><p>Or how about the Second Amendment? We have heard some reference to the Heller decision. senator from Connecticut yesterday talked about reasonable gun-control and gun safety provisions. </p><p>Well, that, of course, was not what was that taken the Heller decision. Number one, the majority decision in Heller, Justice Scalia's opinion acknowledges reasonable provisions, things like prohibitions on felons and possession are permissible. </p><p>Your opinion in the Kanter decision likewise acknowledged that restrictions preventing dangerous criminals from receiving firearms are entirely consistent and permissible under the Second Amendment, but the issue in Heller was much more fundamental. It was whether at these Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms at all. </p><p>The vote in Heller was 5-4 by a vote of five-for the majority struck down the District of Columbia's total prohibitions on owning and operative firearm in the District of Columbia. </p><p>The argument of the four dissenters was not what our Democratic colleagues talk about here. It wasn't some reasonable gun control provisions are okay. That was not the argument of the dissenters. That question we can actually have a reasonable debate on, reasonable minds can differ on what the appropriate line should be, what are reasonable laws they are, but that was not what was at issue at Heller. The position of the four dissenters was the Second Amendment protection, no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever but merely a quote collective right of the militia witches fancy lawyer talk for a nonexistent right. </p><p>Four justices would have ruled that way, one vote away. The consequences of the court concluding that there is no individual right under the First Amendment would mean you and I and every American watching this would lose your Second Amendment right. It would mean the federal government, the state government, the city could ban guns entirely, could make it a criminal offense for any one of us to own a firearm, and no individual American would have any judicially cognizable right to challenge that. </p><p>That is a radical reading of the Constitution. That is effectively erasing the Second Amendment from the bill of rights, and Hillary Clinton likewise promised in 2016 that every justice she nominated would commit to voting to overturn Heller. They were big on litmus test and Joe Biden, although he refuses to answer just about anything about whether or not he's going to pack the court, he did tell the American people the voters don't deserve to know whether he's going to pack the court. Truly a statement of disrespect and contempt for the voters, unusual in our political process. </p><p>One vote away from the Second Amendment being erased from the Bill of Rights. None of our Democratic colleagues admit that that is their agenda, and yet those are the justices that Democratic presidential nominees are promising they will appoint, justices who will take away your right to criticize politicians, justices who well allows censorship, justices who will allow movies and books to be banned, justices who will erase the second amendment from the Bill of Rights. </p><p>And how about religious liberty? Religious liberty is an issue near and dear to a great many of us. The right of every American to live according to your faith, according to your conscience, whatever that faith may be. </p><p>Religious liberty is fundamentally about diverse city, it's about respecting diverse city that whatever your faith tradition might be, the government is not going to trample on it. Religious liberty cases over and over again have been decided 5-4. </p><p>The case of Van Orden v. Perry, a case I litigated, dealt with the 10 Commandments monument that stands on the state Capitol grounds. It's been there since 1961 in Texas, an individual plaintiff, an atheist, a homeless man filed a lawsuit seeking to tear down the 10 Commandments. The case went all of the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was decided 5-4, four justices were willing to say enough fact send in the bulldozers and tear down that monument because you can't gaze on the image of the 10 Commandments on public land. </p><p>Another case, the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial. This was a memorial directed to the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. It's a loan white Latin cross simple and bear in the middle of the desert. </p><p>I have been there on Sunrise Rock where it stands. The ACLU filed a lawsuit saying you cannot gaze on the image of a cross on public land and the ACLU one in the District Court. They won in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal court ordered that's memorial to be covered up with a burlap sack with the chain on the bottom and then a plywood box. </p><p>When the case went to think is the court, I represented 3 million veterans pro bono for free defending that Veterans Memorial. We won 5-4, and there were four justices prepared to say tower all tear down the Veterans Memorial and under the reasoning that they put forth, they were not far away from saying bring out the chisels and remove the crosses and the stars of David on the tombstones of the men and women that gave their lives at Arlington Cemetery defending this nation. That is a radical view, and we are one vote away. </p><p>That is (INAUDIBLE) the Little Sisters of the Poor are a Catholic convent who devote their lives to caring for the sick, caring for the needy, caring for the elderly. And, the Obama administration litigate--litigated against the Little Sisters of the Poor, seeking to fine them in order to force them to pay for abortion inducing drugs, among others. It's truly a stunning situation when you have the federal government litigating against nuns. </p><p>Supreme Court decided the Hobby Lobby case, another case routinely denounced by Senate Democrats. The Hobby Lobby case concluded that the federal government could not permissibly force a Christian business to violate their faith. It reflected the religious liberty traditions of our country that you can live according to your faith without the government trampling on it. </p><p>You know what this body did, I'm sorry to say? Senate Democrats introduced legislation to gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Religious Freedom Restoration Act, when it passes this body, passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy, all voted for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Democratic President Bill Clinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and yet in the wake of the Hobby Lobby decision, this body voted on legislation to just gut the protections for religious liberty and I'm sorry to say, every single Senate Democrat voted to do so. Not a single one, zero, would defend religious liberty. </p><p>Joe Biden has already pledged, if he is elected, he plans to initiate again the attack on the Little Sisters of the Poor. You know, it's interesting. Folks in the press like to talk about Pope Francis and I'm some issues, Pope Francis has been vocal when it comes to the environment, when it comes to issues concerning immigration. The Pope has been vocal on issues that our Democratic colleagues like and agree with. </p><p>The press is happy to amplify those views. Somehow missing from that amplification is acknowledgment that when the Pope came to the United States and Washington, he went and visited the Little Sisters of the Poor. Here in DC, he went to their home here in DC and the Vatican explained he did so because he wanted to highlight their cause, that the federal government shouldn't be persecuting nuns for living according to their faith. </p><p>That's what's at stake in these nominations. And, you won't hear any of that from the Senate Democrats on this committee. That's why their base is so angry at your nomination, Judge Barrett, because they don't believe you are going to join the radical efforts to erase those fundamental rights from the Bill of Rights. </p><p>I believe that issue, preserving the Constitution, preserving the Bill of Rights, our fundamental liberties, I believe is the most important issue facing the country in the November elections. And, I think for those of us who value those rights, we should take solace in the fact that not a single Democrat is willing even to acknowledge the radical sweep of their agenda, much less defend it. </p><p>They know it's wildly unpopular and look, right at the heart of this is a decision many democrats have made to abandon democracy. You see, most policies, policies like Obamacare, policies like healthcare, most policies under our constitutional system are meant to be decided by democratically elected legislatures. Why? So they can be accountable to the people. So if the voters disagree, they can throw the bums out. </p><p>But, too many Democrats have decided today that democracy is too complicated. It's too hard to actually convince your fellow Americans of the merits of your position. It's much easier just to give it to the courts, find five lawyers in black robes and let them decree the policy outcome you want, which makes your radical base happy, presumably makes the millions, if not billions, in dark money being spent for Democrats happy, without actually having to justify it to the American people. </p><p>Judge Barrett, I'm not going to ask you to respond to any of that. But, I do want to shift to a different topic, which is a bit more about you personally, your background. </p><p>Judge Barrett, do you speak any foreign languages </p><p>BARRETT: Once upon a time, I could speak French, but I have fallen woefully out of practice, so please don't ask me to do that right now. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CRUZ: You can be assured of that because my--I had two years of high school French and--and I suspect yours remains much better than mine. How about music? Do you play any instruments? </p><p>BARRETT: The piano. </p><p>CRUZ: Do you? How long have you played the piano? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I played the piano growing up for ten years and now, most of my piano playing consists of playing my children's songs for them and supervising their own piano practice. I look forward, one day when I have more time, to be able to choose some of my own music. </p><p>CRUZ: Now, do--do the kids do piano lessons as well? </p><p>BARRETT: The kids do piano lessons. Some of the older ones who are in high school have gotten so busy with sports and those things that they've stopped. But, the younger children do. </p><p>CRUZ: Our girls are 9 and 12 and we have--they both do piano lessons and I will say at least in our household, it is less than voluntary. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know, one of the things Heidi and I have found, particularly the last six months during COVID, which has been an extraordinary crisis, is just with two kids at home, that doing distance learning when schools were shut down was really hard for us with two children. For you and your husband, you--you've got seven kids. </p><p>How--how did--how did y'all manage through the lockdowns and distance learning? What was that like in--in the Barrett household? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it was a challenging time, as it was for every American. Our oldest daughter, Emma, who's in college, moved home at that point because she's at Notre Dame. It closed. So, Emma obviously could manage her own e-learning and our high school aged children, Tess and Vivian, could too. But, Jesse and I just tried to take a divide and conquer approach for the younger four and yeah, it was quite challenging I assure you. </p><p>CRUZ: One part of your story that I find particularly remarkable and that I admire is the decision you made to adopt two children. You and your husband had five biological children. You adopted two more. Both of your adopted children are from Haiti. </p><p>Haiti is a country that has some of the most crushing poverty in the world. My brother in law is a missionary in Haiti and--and actually, Heidi and the girls just got back from Haiti a couple weeks ago. </p><p>I'm just curious if you would share with this committee and with the American people, what led you and your husband to make the decision to adopt? It's--it's, I think, one of the most loving and--and compassionate decisions any family can make. </p><p>BARRETT: When Jesse and I were engaged, we met another couple who had adopted, in this instance, it was a couple who had adopted a child with special needs and then we also met another couple who had adopted a few children internationally. And, we decided at that point while we were engaged that at some point in the future, we wanted to do that ourselves. </p><p>And, I guess we had imagined initially that we would have whatever biological kids that we had decided to have and then adopt at the end. But, after we had our first daughter, Emma, we thought, ""Well, why wait?"" So, I was expecting Tess when we went and got Vivian. So, she and Tess function--we call them our fraternal twins. They're in the same grade. </p><p>And, it really has enriched our family immeasurably and once we had adopted Vivian at that point, then we made the decision that we definitely wanted to adopt again, and so several years later, John Peter entered our family. </p><p>CRUZ: So, your children have been wonderfully well behaved. I think you're an amazing role model for little girls. What advice would you give little girls? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, what I'm saying is not designed--my brother now has left--I was just thinking of what my dad told me before the spelling bee about anything boys can do, girls can do better. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And, since my sons are sitting behind me, I'll also say but boys are great too. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Welcome again, Judge. Since I have the draw to always follow Senator Cruz, I did want to make one thing clear, after listening to that for a half hour, that Joe Biden is Catholic and he is a man of faith. </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: And, then I want to turn to something else and that is that we need a reset here in my mind for the people at home, a bit of a reality check that this isn't normal right now. We have to understand that what people are dealing with, that 7.7 million people have gotten this virus, that 214,000 Americans have died. And for people watching at home and wondering what we're all doing in this room right now and maybe you're home because you lost your job or maybe you got your kids crawling all over your account right now, maybe you're trying to teach your first grader how to do a mute button to go to school or maybe or maybe you've got a small business that you had to close down or that struggling, we should be doing something else right now. We shouldn't be doing this.  </p><p>We should be passing coronavirus relief like the House just did, which was a significant bill that would have been a big help. And I think people have to know that right now, whether you're Democrat, independent, or Republican I started. And that's why I started out yesterday by telling people but they need to vote. </p><p>Number, some of my colleagues throughout this hearing on the other side have been kind of portraying the job that the adjudges before judge is before us on--as being some kind of ivory tower exercise. I think one of my friends called it--related that you'll be dealing with the Dormant Commerce Clause. Well, I'm sure that might be true, but we also know that this is the highest court in the land, that the decisions of this court have a real impact on people. </p><p>And I appreciate it, judge, that you said that you didn't want to be a queen. I actually wouldn't mind being a queen around here, truth be known. I wouldn't mind doing yet. Kind of a benevolent queen in making decisions so we could get things done. But you said you wouldn't let your views influence you and the like, but the truth is, the Supreme Court rulings, they rule people's lives. </p><p>They decide if people can get married. They decide what schools they can go to. They decide if they could even have access to contraception. All of these things matter. So I want to make that clear.  </p><p>And the third reset here that I think we need to have is that hearing is not normal. It is a sham. It is a rush to put in a justice. The last time that we had a vacancy so close to an election was when Abraham Lincoln was president, and he made the wise decision to wait until after the election. The last time we loss to justice so close to an election. That's what he did.  </p><p>Today, we are 21 days from the election. People are voting. Millions of people have already cast their ballots. And I go to the words of Senator McConnell the last time we had a situation in an election year. He said the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.  </p><p>That set the precedent that so many of you have embraced. Or at least you did a few years ago, and that is that in an election year, the people choose the president and then the president dominates the justice.  </p><p>So why is this happening? Well, that's a good question. This guy. Our president. He's the one that decided to plop a Supreme Court nomination in the middle of an election when people's health care is on the line with the case before the court on November 10th. So let's see what he said about the Supreme Court.  </p><p>Well, one of President Trump's campaign promises in 2015 was that his judicial appointments will do the right thing on Obamacare. You can see it right here. And in fact, judge, just one day after you were nominated, this is like a few weeks ago, he said, also on Twitter, that it would be a ""big win"" if the Supreme Court strikes down the health law. So judge, my first question, do you think we should take the president at his word when he says his nominee will do the right thing and overturn the Affordable Care Act?  </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, I can't really speak to what the president has said on Twitter. He hasn't said any of that to me. And what I can tell you, as I have told your colleagues earlier today is that no one has elicited from me any commitment in a case or even brought up a commitment in a case. I'm 100 percent committed to judicial independence from political pressure.  </p><p>So whatever people's, you know, party platforms maybe or campaign promises maybe, the reason why judges have lifetime tenure is to insulate them from those pressures. So I take my oath seriously to follow the law and, you know, I have not pre committed nor would I pre commit to decide a case any particular way. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. And I think this life tenure, this idea that you have just for everyone out there, a job for life, makes this even more important for us to consider where you might be. And I know you have not said how you would rule on this case that's coming up right after the election where the president had said it would be a big win if the Supreme Court strikes down the law. </p><p>But you have directly criticized Justice Roberts in an article in my own state, and one of the Minnesota Law School journals. It was in 2017. It was the same year you became a judge. And when Roberts writes the opinion to uphold the Affordable Care Act, you said he ""pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute."" Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, I just want to clarify, is this the constitutional commentary a publication that you and I discussed (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Yes, it is. In fact, it is. But it's still University of Minnesota. Yes. </p><p>BARRETT: No--okay, I just wanted to be sure because I hadn't published in the Minnesota-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Again, did you ask that question? Did you say that, that he pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute? </p><p>BARRETT: One thing I want to clarify is you said that I criticized, you know, Chief Justice Roberts, and I don't attack people, just ideas.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: So that was just designed to--to make a comment about his reasoning in that case, which I, as I've said before, is consistent with the way the majority opinion characterized it, as the less plausible reading of the statute. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay, so you didn't agree with his reasoning in the case that upheld the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>BARRETT: What I said, and with was this King v. Burwell or NFIB v. Sebelius? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: That was NFIB v. Sebelius. I'll get to King v. Burwell in a second.  </p><p>BARRETT: What I said with respect to NFIB v. Sebelius is that the interpretation that the majority adopted construing the mandate to be a tax rather than a penalty was not the most natural reading of the statute. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --But it was still the reading that Justice Roberts got to. Now, you also criticized, as you pointed out by bringing up King v. Burwell, another case where the court ruled in favor of the health law. This was in a 2015 National Public Radio interview.  </p><p>And you acknowledged that the result of people being able to keep their subsidies under the Affordable Care Act was a--would help millions of Americans. Yet, you praised the dissent by Justice Scalia saying the dissent had ""The better of the legal argument."" Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I did say that. Yes. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So then would you--have ruled the same way and voted with Justice Scalia? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Klobuchar, one of the plus sides or the upsides of being an academic is that you can speak for yourself, that a professor professes and can opine, but it's very different than the judicial decision making process. </p><p>So it's difficult for me to say how I would have decided that case. If I had to go through the whole process of judicial decision-making that I was describing this morning, now having been a judge for three years, I can say I appreciate greatly the distinctions between academic writing or academic speaking and judicial decision-making such that a judge might look at an academic and say easy for you to say because you're not on a multi member court. </p><p>You're not constrained by stare decisis. You don't have real parties in front of you consulting with litigants, consulting with your clerks. It's just a different process. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I'm just--I view that's one so interesting Lee because you were commenting on the public policy result, which you and to my colleagues on the Republican side have said this shouldn't be above public policy and you said okay, that's okay. </p><p>But then you were really clear on your legal outcome in terms of your view of who side you were on. You were on Scalia's side. And of course, that was outside to not uphold the Affordable Care Act, which would have been--kicked millions of people off their health care in effect because they would have lost their subsidies.  </p><p>And I just see this as interesting because of this kind of dichotomy they're trying to make between policy and legal. And my view is that legal decisions affect policy. I mean, I'm looking at people in my state that will deal with this and the Affordable Care Act is struck down. Elijah from Saint Paul who was born with cerebral palsy. </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: Because of the Affordable Care Act, he is now 16 and is a proud Boy Scout; Casey, whose brother lives in Alexandria and whose chronic kidney failure and he needs a transplant, without the ACA that it be that; or Burnett from the suburbs of St. Paul, whose daughter has multiple sclerosis depends on benefits under the ACA; Liliana of Fridley, who has a 21-year-old son with autism and needs her children to be able to stay on our insurance until she's 26; Melanie, a senior from Duluth, who is being treated for over in cancer and needs access to the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>So, my point is that these are real world situations. And so, I get that you're not saying how you rule on these cases. So, what does that leave us with here to try to figure out what kind of judge you would be? </p><p>I was thinking last night, when I was growing up we would go to Northern Minnesota. And we didn't have a cabin but we had friends that did, and we would go on these walks in the woods with my mom. And she loved it to show all the tracks on that path, whether they were deer tracks, and she'd have us figure out what they were, or elk or maybe even a bear. And we would follow these tracks down that path. And you'd always think is there going to be a deer around the corner that we're going to see, and very rarely was the one. </p><p>But we would follow the tracks. And so, when I look at your record, I just keep following the tracks. That's what I've got to do. And so, when I follow the tracks, this is what I see. You consider Justice Scalia, one of the most conservative judges in the history of the Supreme Court, as your mentor. You criticized the decision written by Justice Roberts upholding the Affordable Care Act. That is, to me, one big track. Even if you didn't consider yourself criticizing him personally, you criticized the reasoning. </p><p>You then said in another case about the Affordable Care Act that you would--that you liked the legal reasoning, that he had the better legal argument, that Justice Scalia had the better legal argument. You have signed your name to a public statement featured in an ad, a paid ad, that called for an end to what they called--the ad called the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade, which ran on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision. </p><p>You disagreed with long-standing precedent on gun safety, which said that felons shouldn't be able to get guns, something that was pretty important to me when I had my old job in law enforcement. This is something that Senator Durbin asked you about. You suggested that you agree with the dissent in the marriage equality case, Obergefell, that it wasn't the role of the court to decide that same-sex couples had the right to be married. I think this was an election you gave where you said the dissent's view was that a--wasn't for the court to decide. They--people could lobby in state legislatures. </p><p>And all this takes me to one point as I follow those tracks down that path. And it takes me to this point where I believe, and I think the American people have to understand, that you would be the polar opposite of Justice Ginsburg. She and Justice Scalia were friends, yes, but she never embraced his legal philosophy. </p><p>So, that is what concerns me and I want to turn to an area that--where I think Justice Ginsburg, who see we are considering you for, was truly a hero. And that was the area of voting rights and that was the area of elections. I think that--what did the president say here? He said September 23rd, 2020, I think this, you need the election, will end up in the Supreme Court. And I think it's very important that we have nine justices. I don't think how much clear we can be. </p><p>And as I said yesterday, I do not for a minute concede that this election is going to end up in the Supreme Court because people are voting in droves as we speak. But that is what is on the mind of the man who nominated you for this job. </p><p>Then he said on September 29th of 2020, I think I'm counting on them, he meant the court, to look at the ballots, definitely. So, I know you said earlier in questions from Senator Leahy that you are not going to commit to whether or not you are going to recuse yourself for any--any kind of an election case. But I do want to point out that, as the president has said these things and as he has nominated you, that people are voting right now. </p><p>They are voting, as I said, in droves. Do you know how many states where people are voting right now, judge? I think one of my colleagues said it. </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It's more than 40 states. People are voting right now as we speak. I think something like 9 million votes have been cast. Do you think it is faithful to our Democratic principles to fill a Supreme Court vacancy this close to an election when people are still voting? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, I think that is a question for the political branches. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. That's--that's your right to answer in that way. Beyond this immediate election, I want to turn to the Supreme Court's critical role when it comes to the right to vote, this area where Justice Ginsburg was such a champion. </p><p>Senator Durbin went over your dissent at length in Kanter v. Barr, where you drew a distinction between individual rights and civic rights. And you wrote that historically felons it should be disqualified from exercising certain rights like the right to vote and to serve on juries. </p><p>So, my question is this--actually, this next line, where you said these rights belong only to virtuous citizens. What does that mean? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I would need to look at the article to clarify. But as I'm sitting here, I don't think I said felons should lose voting rights. I think when I was talking about is that-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Could-- </p><p>BARRETT: --14th Amendment-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Um-hmm-- </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, that--that it's-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --But it wasn't an article, just to be clear, right? This was--this is your dissent.  </p><p>BARRETT: Oh, my--sorry, my dissent.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yeah. I think it's your dissent in Kanter-- </p><p>BARRETT: --In Kanter-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --V-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Yes, you're right.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And it says felons could be disqualified from exercising certain rights like the rights to vote and serve on juries. But apart from that clause, you said these rights belong only to virtuous citizens. That's what I'm trying to understand, what that means. </p><p>BARRETT: So, the argument in the case, those who were challenging Heller and those who were arguing on the side of the government in the Kanter case, is that the seventh--the Second Amendment is a civic right. And that is how the Supreme Court itself frames the debate, as a distinction between civic rights and individual rights with voting being a civic right. And in literature, you know, in the historical literature, that was--which was at play in the case. That was drawn-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay. But how would you define the word virtuous? Because it doesn't appear in the Constitution. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, this-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I'm just trying to know what that means because we're--we have--we're living in a time where a lot of people are having their voting rights taken away from them. So, what's virtuous? </p><p>BARRETT: Okay. Well, senator, I want to be clear that that is not an opinion designed to denigrate the right to vote, which is fundamental. The distinction between civic and individual rights is one that's present in the court's decisions and it has to do with kind of a jurisprudential view of what rights are.  </p><p>And the virtuous citizenry idea is a historical and jurisprudential one. It certainly does not mean that I think that anybody gets a measure of virtue on whether they're good or not and whether they're allowed to vote. That's not what I-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay-- </p><p>BARRETT: --said.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Now, let me ask you this in a different way because now let's go to the real world here. So, in Justice Ginsburg's dissent in Shelby, where a 5-4 court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, she described the right to vote as a fundamental right in our democratic system. And I assume you agree with this because you just said that. Not--let's not go to her dissent. You agree with the concept that is fundamental right because you just said-- </p><p>BARRETT: --As I just said, yeah, the court has repeatedly, repeatedly said it was fundamental. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So, she also wrote in her dissent that the Constitution uses the words right to vote in five separate places, the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments. Each of these amendments--this is still her talking, not me. Each of these amendments contains the same broad empowerment of Congress to enact appropriate legislation to enforce the protected right. </p><p>The implication is unmistakable. Under our constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead rein in making the right to vote equally real for all U.S. citizens. Do you agree with Justice Ginsburg's conclusion that the Constitution clearly empowers Congress to protect the right to vote? </p><p>[*]BARRETT: Well, senator, that would be eliciting an opinion from me on whether the dissent or the majority was right in Shelby County, and I can't express the view on that as I had said because it would be inconsistent with the judicial rule. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So here's my problem, so you go out of your way in the case that Dick Durbin was discussing to make this distinction between voting rights and gun rights, but now you won't say whether or not you agree with Ginsburg and so my view is just based again following those tracks on this case that you are most likely with the majority, but I know you are not going to answer this but what I do want you to know is this, and this is where it gets interesting because of what Justice Ginsburg predicted in that dissent. </p><p>According to the Brennan Center, over 20 states send back case came out that withdrew, that took away part of the protections from the voting rights act. Over 20 states have now made more restrictive voting laws than they did before that case. Doesn't that suggest to you that Justice Ginsburg had the better of the argument when she wrote that throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet? </p><p>Do you think that that is true, and I mean it seems to me that the proof is in the pudding, right? Basically, this rainstorm that she said would come has come with all of these states, including a number of them that my colleagues over there REP breeze sent have enacted stricter laws. Has that happened? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, I want to clarify you said I was answering Senator Durbin's questions about the second amendment but refusing to answer yours and so I just wanted to clarify that I have written Kanter v. Barr and so that is why I was talking about it, but since I didn't write Shelby I can't really talk about it so anything bad I have written about or talked about I would be happy to answer your questions. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: All right. But again, it just seems to me you out of your way on that case, and this is a case that is so real for so many people right now and that while you can say it's a fundamental right, the issue is that this case and the voting rights act are so key and let me just say why. </p><p>We are talking about the entire foundation of our democracy here. For centuries Americans have fought and died to protect the right to vote and so what matters is not just what you say about its being fundamental. It's what you do. States like South Carolina, Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee have policies that make it harder for people to vote, and it's a real-world thing before the Supreme Court. </p><p>In fact, back in May when voters in Wisconsin were standing in line in the middle of a pandemic and homemade mask, in garbage bags in the middle of a rainstorm just to exercise their right to vote, 70 of them got COVID because we didn't know enough about it back then because the president hadn't told us what he knew and we didn't know enough to protect those voters, so it ends up at the Supreme Court. </p><p>What did Justice Ginsburg do? When the Republican-appointed majority on the court ruled that voters in Wisconsin could not have more time to get their ballots and during the pandemic, she called them out in her dissent, and her blueprint for the future and she said the majority opinion boggled the mind. So what boggles my mind well, two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the South Carolina report requirement that mail-in ballots must have witnessed signatures in the middle of a pandemic. You have to go and get a witness. </p><p>In Texas, Republicans have argued that the pandemic wasn't a good enough reason to let people under age 65 vote by mail despite the fact that over 42,000 Americans under 65 have died from COVID and the governor is right now is forcing that state to have only one ballot box per county including in Harris County where there are 4.7 million people and for those of you that thought a judge took care of it a few days ago he did but then yesterday three Trump-appointed judges came in and reverse that so we are back to one ballot box for people to drop their ballots off in a county of 4.7 million people. </p><p>In Tennessee, Republicans have tried to prevent ballot drop boxes. I know we had the secretary of State as one of our witnesses at a Rules Committee hearing and may have argued in court that COVID-19 is not a valid excuse to vote by mail. </p><p>In North Carolina, the Supreme Court struck down a core component of the Voting Rights Act. What happened? Well, states like North Carolina passed laws that were so egregious to make it harder to vote that the Fourth Circuit struck down their law and noted that it targeted African-Americans with almost surgical precision. </p><p>So that is what the stakes are, and that is why not having Justice Ginsburg on the court right now is so frightening to so many Americans out there, and that is why we are asking you these questions about voting. </p><p>So let me turn to another election question, gerrymandering. In 2015 Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Arizona State Legislature for the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission holding that it was constitutional for the people of Arizona to amend the State Constitution to establish an and independent redistricting commission. Because of this case and Justice Ginsburg opinion, many argue now that Arizona has fairer electoral maps. The decision was 5-4. Here is your example, and now Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy are no longer on the court. My question is this, must state legislatures by their own states Constitution when exercising their authority under the Elections Clause? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, that would be eliciting an opinion from me about whether I agreed or disagreed with the result in that case. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Is it constitutional for voters to amend a state constitution to establish specific processes for elections like the voters in Arizona did to stop gerrymandering? </p><p>BARRETT: Again, you are asking me for a view on that particular case, and Justice Ginsburg herself gave the most famous articulation of the principle that constrains me from doing so, which is no hence, forecast, or previews so I can't express a view on precedent or on how I would decide in a question that was provoked by the application of that precedent to a later case. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Last week a contractor from outside of my state of Minnesota started recruiting poll watchers with special forces experience to protect polling locations in my state. This was clearer voter intimidation. Similar efforts are going on around the country as solicited by President Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud, something that, by the way, many Republican leaders, including Michael Steele, the former head of the Republican Party, including Tom Ridge, including Governor Casey, including (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>So as a result of his claims, people are trying to get poll watchers, special forces people to go to the polls. Judge Barrett, under federal law, is at the legal to intimidate voters at the polls? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, I can't characterize the facts in a hypothetical situation, and I can apply the law to a hypothetical set of facts. I can only decide cases as they come to me litigated by parties on a full record after Foley engaging precedent, talking to colleagues, writing an opinion, and so I can't answer questions like that. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Well, I'll make--all make it easier. 18 USC 594 outlaws in the one who intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other purpose for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote. This is a law that has been on the books for decades. Do you think a reasonable person would feel intimidated by the president--presence of armed civilian groups at the polls? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, you know that is eliciting I'm not sure I would say it is eliciting legal opinion from me because the reasonable person standard as you know is one, and then the law or just an opinion as a citizen, but it's not something really that's appropriate for me to comment on. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Here's one that I think is, selection of election--electoral college electors. You know that each state does laws that dictate how electoral college electors are selected. Judge Barrett, in 1932 the Supreme Court in Smiley v. Holm a case involving my state, ruled that the Minnesota state legislature could not change election rules unilaterally. Do you agree that the unanimous opinion in Smiley v Holm which has never been questioned by any other Supreme Court case, is settled law? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I will say two things about that. First of all, I was not aware of that case, so you have taught me something. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: But secondly, I can comment on the precedent, give thumbs up or thumbs down in Justice Kagan's words. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Well, why don't we end there with precedent? I think that's a good way to end here. </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: So you wrote in your 2013 Texas Law Review article that you tend to agree with the view that when a justice is best understanding of the Constitution conflicts with Supreme Court precedent or case law, it is quote more legitimate for her to follow her preferred view rather than apply the precedent, and I want to run through a few examples. </p><p>So, Brown v. Board of Education, as we know, that holds that the 14th Amendment prohibits states from segregating schools on the basis of race. So, is that precedent-- </p><p>BARRETT: Yes-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --that can't be overruled. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, that is precedent and as I think I said in that same article, it's super precedent. People consider it to be on that very small list of things that are so widely established and agreed upon by everyone. Calls for its overruling simply don't exist. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Well, you also separately acknowledged that in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court's controlling opinion talked about the reliance interest on Roe v. Wade, which it treated in that case a super precedent. Is Roe a super precedent? </p><p>BARRETT: How would you define super precedent? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I--I actually--I might have thought someday I'd be sitting in that chair. I'm not. I'm up here, so I'm asking you. </p><p>BARRETT: Okay, well people use super precedent differently. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay-- </p><p>BARRETT: The way that it's used in the scholarship and the way that I was using it in the article that you're reading from was to define cases that are so well-settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling. </p><p>And, I'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category and scholars across the spectrum say that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled. But, descriptively, it does mean that it's not a case that everyone has accepted and doesn't call for its overruling. I don't think I-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Okay, so here's what--here's what's interesting to me. You said that Brown is--and I know my time is running out--is a super precedent. That's something the Supreme Court has not even said, but you have said that. </p><p>So, if you say that, why won't you say that about Roe v. Wade, a case that the court's controlling opinion in that Planned Parenthood v. Casey case has described as a super precedent? That's what I'm trying to figure out. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, I can just give you the same answer that I just did. I'm using a term in that article that is from the scholarly literature. It's actually one that was developed by scholars who are, you know, certainly not conservative scholars who take a more progressive approach to the Constitution. And, again, you know, as--as Richard Fallon from Harvard said, Roe is not a super precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased, but that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled. </p><p>It just means that it doesn't fall on the small handful of cases, like Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. the Board that no one questions anymore. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Is the United States v. Virginia Military, is that super precedent? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Klobuchar, if you continue to ask questions about super precedents that aren't on the list of the super precedents that I discussed in the article that are well acknowledged in the constitutional law literature, every time you ask the question, I'll have to say that I can't grade it. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Well, I am then left with looking at the tracks of your record and where it leads the American people, and I think it leads us to a place that's going to have severe repercussions for them. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Sasse. </p><p>SASSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, welcome back. I--I mean this as good news but it might not feel like it. After me, you're half done for today. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I'm 11th of 22. Mr. Chairman, before I begin my questioning, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to admit into the record a letter from Allen Guelzo, the historian at Princeton, who has written a letter to the committee in response to some--some of Senator Harris's claims about the history of Supreme Court vacancies going back to the Civil War. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>SASSE: Thank you. Judge, you have said that the meaning of law doesn't change with time and you've said that's very important. Can you unpack for us why it's so important that the meaning of a law doesn't change with time? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure, because the law stays the same until it is lawfully changed, and if we're talking about a law that has been enacted by the people's representatives, you know, or gone through the process of constitutional amendment or constitutional ratification, it must go through the lawfully prescribed process before it's changed. </p><p>So, Article 5 from the context of the Constitution or bicameralism and presentment in the context of statutes, and it's not up to judges to short circuit that process by updating the law. That's--that's your job. </p><p>SASSE: But, laws clearly are written in a context and then the things, the circumstances to which those laws have applied would change. Does the-- </p><p>BARRETT: --True-- </p><p>SASSE: --Fourth Amendment have nothing to say about cell phones? Unreasonable search and seizure was obviously not written in a time when they had imagined mobile technological devices that addicted our kids. </p><p>BARRETT: --Right-- </p><p>SASSE: Does the Fourth Amendment have nothing to say about cell phones? </p><p>BARRETT: No, the Fourth Amendment--so, the Constitution, one reason why it's the longest lasting written Constitution in the world, it's because it's written at a level of generality that's specific enough to protect rights but general enough to be lasting so that, you know, when you're talking about the constable banging at your door in, you know, 1791 as a search or seizure, now we can apply it, as the court did in Carpenter v. United States to cell phones. </p><p>So, the Fourth Amendment is a principle. You know, it protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but it doesn't catalog the instances in which an unreasonable search or seizure could take place. So, you take that principle and then you apply it to modern technology, like cell phones or, you know, what if technological advances enable someone with superman x-ray vision to simply see in your house, you know, is that--so there's no need to knock on the door and go in. Well, I think that could still be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment. </p><p>SASSE: So, I think this is a useful place to explain to the American people again what originalism is and why it's a mistake to view it as a Republican position. I think that originalism is a part of a jurisprudential debate. </p><p>It's not a part of a policy continuum between Republicans and Democrats. I think it's something that is useful for everybody who believes that three branches of government have two that are political and one that is not. </p><p>So, maybe it's useful to just kind of back up and say, when you define yourself as an originalist, what does that mean? And, then how is it going to relate to that distinction between the principles that are timeless but the applications that are clearly going to change by circumstance? </p><p>BARRETT: Right. So, originalism means that you treat the Constitution as law because it commits these texts to writing and in interpreting that law, you interpret it in accord with the meaning that people would have understood it to have at the time that it was ratified. And, the reason that you do that is because otherwise--well, as I said, the law stays the same until it's lawfully changed. Otherwise, judges would be in the constitutional convention business of updating the law rather than allowing the people to take control of that. </p><p>Now, in the case of the Constitution, as I said with the Fourth Amendment, many of its principles are more general. Unreasonable searches and seizures, you know, free speech, those are things that have to be identified or fleshed out or applied over time. So, the fact that there wasn't, you know, the internet or computers or blogs in 1791 doesn't mean that the First Amendment's free speech clause couldn't apply to those things now. </p><p>It enshrines a principle and we understand the principle as it was at the time. But, then it's capable of being applied to new circumstances. </p><p>SASSE: So, when--when you define yourself as an originalist, what are the other schools of thought that are adjacent to it? And, how do you think about the debates among those with other people that are now with you on the--the 7th Circuit, for instance? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. Well, Senator Sasse, I think one thing that's worth pointing out is that in the Academy, in any event, where I've spent a large portion of my career, originalism is not necessarily a conservative idea. There is a whole school of thought and so originalists are now a very diverse lot and there is a school of originalism that's more of a progressive originalism and is very committed to keeping the Constitution's meaning, just interpreting texts the way all originalists do, to say that it was--has the meaning that it had at the time that it was ratified, but they tend to read it at a higher level of generality. </p><p>So, all originalists don't necessarily agree. And, in fact, there's an advocacy group called the Constitutional--Constitution Accountability Center, which has routinely filed briefs in the Supreme Court that calls itself--you know, it--it writes briefs in support of originalism but taking it from a more progressive standpoint. </p><p>So, I don't think it's--I think probably people think, ""Oh, it's only conservatives who are originalists."" But, actually, it's a more widely accepted view than that. </p><p>I think that if you think about different strains of approaching constitutional text, originalism is one. All judges and justices take account of history and the original meaning. It's just that some weight it differently, whereas originalists would give it dispositive weight when it's discernable. </p><p>Other approaches to constitutional interpretation may take a more pragmatic view and say, in some instances, ""Well, that may have been the historical meaning, but that's an uncomfortable fit for current circumstances, so we will tweak it a little bit to adjust it to fit these circumstances, that situation."" </p><p>[*]BARRETT: Sometimes, it's called living constitutionalism--Constitution can evolve and it can change over time. Sometimes it's called, like, a more pragmatic constitutionalism. </p><p>SASSE: So I just--I want to make sure we--we establish this effect clearly together because one of the things that I think is really unhelpful for the American people when they see hearings like this over the last 20 years is there is an assumption that those of us who've advocated for you over the course of the last 3 years must be doing it because we know something about your policy views and we've seen the Beautiful Mind conspiracy theory charts, for instance, that this is about specific outcomes that people want.  </p><p>What I want is to have a judge who doesn't want to take away the job of the legislator that's--the legislature that's accountable to the people. What I want is to be sure that the two political branches that are accountable to the people because they can hire and fire us are the places where policy decisions are made. So what you're saying is in the legal Academy, there are people who agree with you on originalism as a broad philosophical school and yet would come out very different places on the outcomes of particular policy decisions. </p><p>BARRETT: That is what I'm saying. </p><p>SASSE: So on the Notre Dame Law faculty, when you were up for the vacancy on the 7th Circuit three years ago, the Notre Dame Law faculty, as I understand, the letter that we got from them here had people unanimously recommend you across a faculty. And I would assume there's a pretty wide view of policy on the Notre Dame Law faculty. </p><p>BARRETT: There is. </p><p>SASSE: And so people can affirm that you know what the job of a judge is. You have the judicial temperament and modesty and humility about the calling and they're comfortable with you even though they don't think they might agree with every policy view that you have before you put on your robe. </p><p>BARRETT: I--I hope that is what people think of me because that's what I've always striven to do and certainly in my time as a judge I--my job--my boss is the rule of law, not imposing my policy preferences. </p><p>SASSE: So can you tell us what the black robe is about? What why do judges in our system where robes? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, judges in our system wear black robes and they started wearing black robes actually because Chief Justice John Marshall started the practice. In the beginning, justices used to wear colorful robes that identified them with the schools that they graduated from. And John Marshall and his at his investiture decided to wear--decided to wear a simple black robe. Pretty soon, the other justices followed suit and now, all judges do it.  </p><p>And I think the black robe shows that justice is blind. We all address the same and I think it shows that once we put it on, we are standing united symbolically, speaking in the name of the law. Not speaking of our--speaking for ourselves as individuals.  </p><p>SASSE: Thank you. You, in your questioning from Chairman Graham this morning talked a little bit about the process of judicial decision-making and you started with four steps and then added a fifth and then I think added a sixth sense. Because it turns out being a reactive branches really reactive. Can you explain what it means that the judiciary, the Article Three branch is reactive? </p><p>BARRETT: So Article Three of the constitution says that courts can hear cases or controversies. So a judge can't walk in one day and say I feel like, you know, visiting the question of health care and telling people what I think. We can't even think about the law or how it would apply until litigants bring a real live case with real live parties and ate real life dispute before us.  </p><p>And the material that we have to--to decide that dispute is what comes from you. It's the statutes that you pass. We don't get to come up with the policies and see our wishes become part of the United States code. So we react to the little ones who bring cases before us and we apply the laws that you make. </p><p>SASSE: And what are the steps inside those Article Three courts before it would ever get to a situation where the Supreme Court here's cases? What--what is unique about the Supreme Court? </p><p>BARRETT: So the Supreme Court, obviously sits atop the federal hierarchy of the judiciary and the Supreme Court--so my court now, the 7th Circuit, every time someone loses in the district courts, which are the trial courts, they can appeal and we take every single appeal that comes.  </p><p>The Supreme Court group works differently. The Supreme Court takes cases when it needs to. Most frequently, the reason it takes them is to resolve a division among the courts of appeal or the state supreme courts. The Supreme Court gets about 8000 petitions a year and they hear about 80 cases a year. So it's a discretionary what cases to take. </p><p>SASSE: So it's reactive--is a reactive branch and it's after a process where there's a statute. It's been challenged, there are active cases, and then it works its way up to the court. But when the justice is declined to take a case, what are they saying? Are they they're saying, you know you don't matter and you don't have a right to appeal? What are they saying to the litigants in a case when they declined to grant cert? </p><p>BARRETT: They're not expressing any view on the merits. They were simply saying this isn't a case that we're going to put on our docket for certiorari because the court has obviously limited time and limited resources and so it selects the cases where it's resolving a division, for example, and the courts are some other question in which--of national importance on which the Supreme Court needs to step in. </p><p>SASSE: There has been a lot of discussion in some of the questioning early this morning implicitly about standing. Can you just explain what standing is so that the American people understand it? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. So this dovetails with your question about the judiciary being a reactive branch. So as I said, the Constitution gives the courts, the federal courts the power only to decide actual live cases and controversies. </p><p>So not only can we wake up one morning and volunteer our views because the Constitution prohibits us from giving what are called advisory opinions, we can't just dispense advice or give our views on the law, which is one reason why I'm not able to answer some of the questions being asked today.  </p><p>A litigant can't get us to give an advisory opinion or elicit a view unless the litigant actually has a real case. So you, Senator Sasse, couldn't walk into court and file lawsuit and just ask me to give my advice on one--whether some particular statute was constitutional. I can only decide that question if there's an actual dispute about it. </p><p>SASSE: You mentioned living constitutionalism a little bit ago. I think Chief Justice Warren had a much broader view of standing than some of the folks that have influenced your thinking and writing. Can you walk us through a little bit of the history of the court's view of standing over the last few decades? </p><p>BARRETT: So are you thinking about how broadly, like, when a plaintiff has suffered an injury or that's a concrete injury? </p><p>SASSE: Right. </p><p>BARRETT: So--so Senator Sasse, if--if you came into court and you were objecting to a particular statute and you didn't like a particular statute, you would have to actually suffer what's called a concrete injury. </p><p>So the Supreme Court, a few times ago in a case called Spokeo said that a plaintiff lacks a concrete injury if the harm isn't--let's see, to use words the American people might understand, palpable. </p><p>Like, it can't just be a procedural injury or something that didn't actually have real consequences or real effect on the litigant. I think that the dispute about standing, you know, or the difficult thing in deciding questions of standing and the Spokeo opinion lays this out, is deciding when an injury is concrete and courts can hear it or when that injury is more abstract and designed to elicit an advisory opinion from the court. </p><p>SASSE: You said in your opening comments yesterday that it is not the responsibility of the courts to right every wrong in society. I want to ask you a question about it, but first, can you just remind us what your view is there? Why did you say that? </p><p>BARRETT: So I think probably what I was getting at there, though I have to say, Senator Sasse, so much has happened since I gave the opening statement yesterday, courts, because they are reactive, can't reach out to right wrongs that don't come to them in the case--in the situation of a case or controversy and then even if they come to courts in the situation of a case or controversy that a court can legitimately decide, we're not free to just resolve it like Solomon in the way that we think is wisest. </p><p>So we are only free to address wrongs and decide cases in accordance with democratically elected law. So the policy making is yours to do and it is only if you have enacted policies that enable us to right a wrong that we can do so.  </p><p>SASSE: So you still said though that you view it as some of your responsibility on the 7th Circuit to write every opinion, every judgment from the standpoint of the losing party. Explain to us why you would take that perspective of wanting the losing party to understand the law and the argument. </p><p>BARRETT: So I just write the opinion as I would write the opinion. And then after I write the opinion, I read it from the perspective of the losing party because I wanted to make sure that, like I said earlier, it is a check on me to make sure that if I try to put my emotions or my preferences on the other side that I can see that it's been a balance just strictly driven by legal analysis. I also want to make sure that the language in it is very respectful to the party who will ultimately be disappointed. I don't know if--is that responsive to-- </p><p>SASSE: --Yeah, because I--why I wanted to ask this is because I'm--I'm in my fifth year here, a little over five years, and I'm on my fourth year on this committee and pretty much--you're the third Supreme Court nominee to come before the committee during that time and we've had dozens of appellate court nominees. </p><p>And I've been amazed how many times the argument is American people, be really, really scared. The person sitting before us obviously hates people and wants them--wants sick people to die and not have health care coverage.  </p><p>That's--that sort of an argument that's routine around here. It's been focus grouped, obviously as a good way to demonize nominees to the court and hopefully drive outcomes in elections, I guess. I don't understand it. I think it's terribly destructive of the civic health, and yet, I think about it from the standpoint of thoughtful, well-meaning Nebraska Democrats who hear that and they know I have a different policy view than they might on getting to portability and health care so people can keep their health insurance across job and geographic change because that's actually what's driving uninsurance in America over the last few decades. It's not primarily health status. It's not primarily preexisting conditions or socioeconomics. </p><p>[*]SASSE: The number one driver of un-insurance in American public life is that we change jobs a lot more frequently than we used to. And so I have a different policy solution of how we would get to portability and health care than a lot of my Democratic colleagues, but those are policy disputes about a modern economy where people move around a lot both geographically and in terms of employer-sponsored health insurance relationships. </p><p>Those contracts are not really the things that a nominee coming before the court is supposed to opine on because I don't have any idea what your views are on healthcare but I know that it's not really the job of a judge to reflect on those things and so I want to be sure that folks who hear this hearing and at the end of the process they can have trust that you are not a person who really wishes secretly you could be the queen of all healthcare and decide all of these issues and so when you write your opinion. </p><p>It seems to me that one of the really humble things that you are doing is you are saying in every case that's come before me on the 7th Circuit, I want to write this opinion from the standpoint of the losing party to understand what was the question before the court today and how did the court rule on that specific narrow thing because ultimately I think you would believe given your jurisprudential tradition and given your view of judicial modesty and humility and your Scalia mentorship my guess is there are times when you rule in cases where you go home at night and you take off your robe and you think the outcome is not the outcome you wish had been the case. </p><p>But it wasn't your job to ultimately decide all policy in American life it was to decide the specific question before you and it seems to me the humble empathetic way that you write those opinions is really important. </p><p>It's also it should be in the interest of public trust and American people who might listen to a lot of the demagoguery that he implies that really you are just secretly a policy actor. It should be pretty comforting to them that except for probably Justice Breyer, you have written more than I think than anybody who is currently on the court so people can actually know your jurisprudential views and how you are going to approach cases when you get on the court because you have written a ton. </p><p>There is a reason why the Notre Dame faculty, regardless of their policy positions, wrote a letter to this committee universally recommending you. There's a reason why year after year on the Notre Dame Law faculty, you were professor of the year because students, regardless of their policy views, thought you were really good at explaining what the job of a judge is and what the purpose of Article 3 in our constitutional system is and as somebody who worries a lot about institutional trust and a lot of the attacks that we see on the court. </p><p>All lot of the attempts we see in this language about potentially court-packing if--if we would go to 11 or 13 or 15 or you know a Venezuelans style 47 person court over the next couple of election cycles that undermining and delegitimizing of the courts should have as its antidote the fact that you have written a ton about what you think the job of a judges and people can actually understand it and I would hope that that is some of what this hearing would try to unpack. </p><p>I am nearly out of time, and I think the chairman is going to take away my--my slot so I--I want to ask one final thing. Tell us about the Scalia-Ginsberg friendship and the impact that it made on you. </p><p>BARRETT: So JusticeScalia famously when the vacancy came up I think it was Justice White's seat that JusticeGinsburg filled but when the vacancy came open during the Clinton administration, JusticeScalia recommended her even though they had been together on the DC circuit, that is where they got to know each other and he knew that she had a different jurisprudential approach and you know a lot has been said in the weeks since JusticeGinsburg died of about that friendship because I think it speaks so well to both of their characters that despite the fact that they had such great differences and they could fight with the pen they--when they were socializing, when they were outside of the opinion writing world they had (INAUDIBLE) and affection for one another and that is how I have tried to live my life with you know I have friends who disagree with me vehemently about all kinds of things. </p><p>But I--I think that it is dehumanizing if we reduce people to the political or policy differences that we might have with one another. </p><p>SASSE: Thank you, and congrats on being half done. </p><p>GRAHAM: Well, for the record, I really enjoyed listening to use Senator Sasse. I think you make a lot of sense, and you explain the system very well. You don't have to be a lawyer to understand what the law is all about. I think you get it very much so. Senator Coons? </p><p>COONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Judge Barrett, to you and your family welcome. I guess I'm on the downside if you are halfway through. If I might just at my opening Mr. Chairman I will submit two letters for the record if I might, one from the SEIU on behalf of the 2 million members of the service employees international union and one on behalf of a national constellation of disability rights groups-- </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>COONS: --concerns. So Judge Barrett, if I might, the calendar behind me makes clear something about the context that we are in because I think folks watching this at home, despite the wonderful efforts that a number of my colleagues have made to make this accessible, may have difficulty understanding exactly why we are here and why under these circumstances and why we keep bringing up the Affordable Care Act so let me try and walk that through. </p><p>These aren't normal times, as you all know, most of us are wearing masks. There are a number of members of this committee and the Senate who have been infected by COVID as our president has, and that has resulted in the Senate being closed this week an hour not being able to proceed. </p><p>We are in the middle of a pandemic, and we are just three weeks from an election, a presidential election in which folks are voting in more than 40 states, millions of votes have already been cast, stand just a week after that election, the Supreme Court is going to hear a case that could take away healthcare protections for more than half of all Americans, so this is not an abstract academic argument, in is one that will have real-life consequences. </p><p>Destroying the essential protections of the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted just more than a decade, would have a real impact on a majority of all Americans. </p><p>It prevents insurance companies from discriminating against the more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like diabetes or heart disease. It dramatically expanded Medicaid, and it provides coverage for kids on their parents' insurance up to the age of 26, I should say young adults and perhaps most importantly, since a lot of what we've been talking about is the legacy of JusticeGinsburg and her lifelong commitment to gender equity. </p><p>It also prevents insurance companies the Affordable Care Act does from discriminating against women just for being women. It may be hard to imagine now that more than a decade ago, before the ACA, pregnancy was treated as a pre-existing condition, and women were routinely charged more than men just because insurance companies could. </p><p>So, President Trump, he said over and over again that he is determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that he is determined to overthrow it, and there's two things all of us are waiting for. One is his detailed health plan, the other is his taxes, and I don't expect either one of them in the next three weeks. </p><p>He president try to do it here in Congress in fact, I think by one count, my colleagues have voted 70 times to overturn the ACA, and many in this chamber, many members of this committee, members like Senator Cornyn and Lee and others have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court asking for the law to be struck down. So now on the eve of the election, I believe President Trump is making a last gasp attempt to get the Supreme Court to do it for him. </p><p>He can't do it through the democratic process, he can't do administratively, he is going to try do it with one more challenge, and as you well know, Judge it was upheld eight years ago in a 5 to 4 decision with Chief Justice Roberts wrote a critical, decisive piece of the majority opinion but JusticeScalia for whom you clerked, your mentor whose broad philosophy you embraced dissented, he thought it was unconstitutional and voted to strike down the entirety of the law. </p><p>You wrote an article in Constitutional Commentary in 2017 in which you were quite critical of Chief Justice Roberts decision, and so I want to ask you about that article, not as a matter of debating abstract academic principles but because I believe the outcome in this case, a week after the election may hang in the balance. </p><p>You wrote in that article, and I quote in NFIB v Sebelius, the case that upheld the ACA against a constitutional challenge, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. </p><p>I think those are fighting words as (INAUDIBLE) originalists and a textual list. You were referring to Chief Justice Roberts ruling that the individual mandate in the ACA is constitutional under Congress taxing powers ruling essential to upholding the law and protecting the health care of a majority of Americans, so just if you could--you think the chief justice's ruling, upholding the ACA was implausible and unsound? </p><p>BARRETT: Well Senator Coons, what I said in that article, which was a book review of someone else's book, was that the statutory interpretation, as I said earlier, as Chief Justice Roberts's own opinion said, was the less natural reading of the mandate, construing it as attacks rather than a penalty, that the statutory interpretation seemed, as you said, stretched beyond its plausible meaning. </p><p>But, NFIB v. Sebelius turned on the constitutional question, that was the statutory interpretation was the threshold question-- </p><p>COONS: --Right.-- </p><p>BARRETT: --and the constitutional question was not something that I ever opined on. And, the case next week--or the case that's coming down the pike in a few weeks, California v. Texas, I--I wouldn't say they're fighting words from the article that you read--read for me because the California v. Texas case involves a very different issue, this issue of severability. </p><p>And, for those to be fighting words, I think you would have to assume that my, you know, critique of the reasoning reflects a hostility to the act that would cause me to approach a case involving the ACA with hostility and looking for a way to take it down to deprive people of their coverage under the ACA because I didn't like it. </p><p>But, I can promise you that that is not my view. It's not my approach to the law. I have no hostility to the ACA or any other law, and that I will faithfully apply the law and nothing that I've said with respect to the ACA in print, in my law review articles actually bears on the severability question, so it's not indicative of how I might approach that question. </p><p>COONS: Let me go back to what I, perhaps too jokingly, referred to as fighting words. You're both textualists. You're both from the same general school of constitutional methodology, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: You mean JusticeScalia and me? </p><p>COONS: And, Chief Justice Roberts? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm not actually sure that Chief Justice Roberts has ever identified himself as a textualist. </p><p>COONS: So, to that point, in this article three years ago, you--you chastised Chief Justice Roberts for not being a textualist. You said, ""He has not proven himself to be a textualist and has been willing to depart from ostensibly clear text."" And, so you said in this article, and I'm quoting you, ""It is illegitimate for the court to distort either the Constitution or a statute to achieve what it deems a preferable result."" </p><p>So, this was the sort of outcomes oriented judicial crafting that has often been sharply criticized by your mentor, JusticeScalia, when criticizing the sort of living constitutionalists and as I read this, you are saying to Chief Justice Roberts, ""You're no textualist. You have overreached. You have delivered an implausible conclusion. And, frankly, I disagree with your upholding the constitutionality of this statute."" </p><p>That seems to me, again as a textualist here, a plain reading of your own writing. </p><p>BARRETT: Well Senator Coons, I want to make very, very clear, I think maybe this is--came up with Senator Klobuchar that I was not attacking or, you know, chastising Chief Justice Roberts at all for whom I have the greatest respect. I think this passage that you're talking about in this book review on Constitutional Commentary was maybe a couple paragraphs, maybe even one paragraph at the end, because it was a comment on Randy Barnett's book and a lot of his book dealt with the NFIB v. Sebelius as an example. </p><p>So, I was responding to that and the sentence that you read me about it's illegitimate for a court to twist language in pursuit of a policy goal, that is what I think. That's what I was telling Senator Sasse. I mean, I--I don't think it is the job of courts to pursue policy goals that the texts that you enact doesn't support. </p><p>COONS: So, to be clear, you're--you're specifically accusing the Chief Justice--or you're chastising might be the better word--the Chief Justice of distorting the statute and of upholding it when it should have been struck down. </p><p>BARRETT: No, I'm not--I was not. I said I was not chastising. All I was doing was expressing some--well, I mean, and as I've said several times, it's how the Chief Justice himself characterizes. It's not the most natural reading of that language and all I was doing was-- </p><p>COONS: --Well, if I might, Your Honor, I don't think the Chief Justice would agree with that characterization. He didn't describe his own opinion as not plausible. </p><p>BARRETT: He said less natural. </p><p>COONS: --Less natural-- </p><p>BARRETT: And, I thought it was implausible. </p><p>COONS: But, not unsound. </p><p>BARRETT: So, Senator Coons, I certainly would not and did not criticize or chastise the Chief Justice or impugn his integrity. It is true that Chief Justice Roberts and JusticeScalia took different approaches to the text in the Affordable Care Act case, which is something that's widely acknowledged. </p><p>COONS: I'm simply trying to make clear that I think your writing here in 2017 in Constitutional Commentary, yes the majority of it is a book review about a book that essentially talks about NFIB v. Sebelius and methodological questions. But, near the end, you are, I think, unmistakably clear in saying, ""I disagree with the Chief Justice's ruling, upholding the Affordable Care Act and I deem it implausible and unsound."" </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, as an academic, I did express a critique and I--you know, you've--you've quoted the language. You've pulled out those few sentences at the end. I guess I'm a little uncertain what it indicates, because as I've said, I have no hostility to the ACA and if a case came up before me, presenting a different question to the ACA, I would approach it with no bias or hostility. </p><p>I also have said at earlier points in this hearing that the exercise of being a commentator, an academic, is much different than the enterprise of judging and I didn't have to sit in Chief Justice Roberts's seat or JusticeScalia's seat when NFIB v. Sebelius was decided-- </p><p>COONS: --But, you will. If we follow the timeline laid out by my colleagues, you will sit in former JusticeGinsburg's seat and you will sit as a member of the court deciding a case that is very similar to the previous one in which the central issue before the court, believe it or not, somehow, will be the constitutionality of the mandate that's, in some ways, been the lynchpin of its being upheld previously. </p><p>And, NFIB v. Sebelius, that was the--the sort of key point was that at the end of the day, there were five justices who, for different reasons, concluded that they could uphold it in the case of the Chief Justice as a legitimate exercise of the taxing power. </p><p>You wrote--and this is the next sentence--that, ""Chief Justice Roberts, if he had treated the payment owed under the mandate as the statute did, as a penalty he would have had to invalidate it."" </p><p>So, I think you're unmistakably criticizing this decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act in a case that will be before you as a newly seated member of the Supreme Court if the majority continues with this race towards your confirmation. </p><p>It is the nerve center of the case. It--it--the entire future of the Affordable Care Act, I think, hinges on this question of whether or not you share review with the four who were in the minority at the time that this is something that cannot be upheld under any plausible reading of the statute. </p><p>Let me move on if I might, Judge Barrett. You're--you're not the only person who's criticized Chief Justice Roberts for his decision to uphold the ACA. President Trump criticized him for it sharply and repeatedly. </p><p>Soon after the NFIB decision first came out in 2012, he tweeted that ""JusticeRoberts turned on his principles with irrational reasoning in order to get loving press."" And, then later, ""Congratulations to John Roberts for making Americans hate the Supreme Court because of his BS."" </p><p>A few years later, while running for president, then candidate Trump said on Twitter--and I believe my colleague put--put this up earlier. ""If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing, unlike Bush's appointee, John Roberts, on Obamacare."" And, as recently as just two months ago, Vice President Pence described Chief Justice Roberts as, and I'm quoting, ""a disappointment to conservatives because of the Obamacare decision."" </p><p>In upholding the ACA, the Chief Justice was the one justice appointed by a Republican president who went against the political wishes of the party that appointed him. Why did you choose to single him out for criticism in that Constitutional Commentary article? </p><p>BARRETT: Well Senator Coons, I was writing about the majority opinion and Chief Justice Roberts was the author of the opinion. So, I was simply discussing what the five-justice majority adopted as its reasoning and I'd like to emphasize again that I was not attacking Chief Justice Roberts or impugning his character or anything of that sort. It was an academic critique. </p><p>And, I--I want to emphasize, you know, just given these--this line of questions that you're asking that, you know, I am standing before the committee today saying that I have the integrity to act consistently with my oath and apply the law as the law, to approach the ACA and every other statute without bias and I've not made any commitments or deals or anything like that. I'm--I'm not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act. I'm just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law. </p><p>[*]COONS: I think it is important that folks watching understanding that I believe our views are sincere and earnestly held. And I'm not trying to suggest that there was some secret deal with you and President Trump. </p><p>When you told me that when we spoke a week ago I've had no conversations about these cases with the president or his legal team, I believe you. I think you are a person who earnestly means that. And--and I do think it's important that you keep repeating that.  </p><p>But we cannot ignore the larger context that sits outside your--your nomination and this rushed process. I'm sure you have no ill will towards the Chief Justice and meant no disrespect to him as an individual. </p><p>We've talked repeatedly about the friendship between JusticeScalia and Justice Ginsberg, you know, I was long inspired by the friendship between Senators Biden and Senator McCain and they fought hammer and tongs, tooth and nail, disagreed with each other on foreign policy day in and day out. But then could still also spend time together with each other's families and respect each other afterwards.  </p><p>And to the point my colleague from Nebraska has made about civics versus politics--it is important for us to try and sustain these institutions that hold us together.  </p><p>BARRETT: And you and Senator Flake I think are another example of that.  </p><p>COONS: Indeed, as you well know we came to Notre Dame Law School just over a year ago to talk about working together even across significant differences. But the--the broader context that Senator Whitehouse went through in detail was as you are expressing opinions in an academic journal there is literally an army of lobbyists and lawyers and people donors and activists who are funneling new judges into our courts. </p><p>And I have sat here for four years and watched a whole procession of judges where without going on about this too much a dozen have been deemed unqualified to serve. This is not a comment on you. But the speed and the process and the disrespect for some of the critical traditions of this body in terms of the blue slip and go gets nominated and why has made it harder and harder to see the independence of the judicial branch.  </p><p>And in this piece that you wrote in 2017, you made, I think your position with regards to the Chief Justice and his opinion clear. Let me, if I could put up another poster that may make this a little sharper in a way that is the politician branch's not the Judicial Branch. </p><p>The Supreme Court is going to hear arguments, as I've said, in this case a week after the election. And most Americans are probably surprised to even hear about it. When I talked to a constituent, Carrie, who has a pre-existing condition she was surprised this was even in front of the court. She said, I thought that was settled. Carrie owns a small business. She has a daughter she's raising and before the ACA she had to spend $800 a month for insurance that she described as junk. Left her afraid of even going to the doctor's office or needing drugs. And because of the ACA she has been able to get better quality insurance that she can afford and she's got both type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.  </p><p>But the ACA guarantees she can't be denied insurance or made to pay higher premiums either because of her gender or because of these pre-existing conditions. She expressed to me, astonishment. Many of us are engaged and interested in this because we care about the Constitution, we care about Constitutional Law and the ways in which it impacts a majority of all Americans, frankly all Americans.  </p><p>Help me explain to her how is it that the Affordable Care Act settled eight years ago is back in front of the Supreme Court?  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, I spent some time with Senator Sasse talking about how a case winds its way up and it's because litigants chose to challenge the law again and you know, it went through the district court and the Fifth Circuit and now the Supreme Court has granted (INAUDIBLE) on it and is answering the question. </p><p>But as to the broader question which I think is a political one which is why are people fighting the Affordable Care Act, you have to ask the litigants. I don't', you know, I don't know why they are fighting the Affordable Care Act.  </p><p>COONS: Well, two things on that--yes, there are no advisory opinions as you said in your exchange with Senator Sasse and you have to have standing, the courts are reactive. But as Senator Whitehouse laid out there is a whole network of groups that fund and develop and present test cases over and over and over and this is an issue that will be before the court just a week after the election that is really not distinguishable from an NFIB v. Sebelius. They are centrally about the constitutionality of the mandate--whether it's a legitimate exercise of the taxing power.  </p><p>You don't get to the question of severability if you haven't already determined the question of constitutionality.  </p><p>BARRETT: But I think that the question of severability even if the now zeroed out mandate provision is a penalty it doesn't' affect the act at all if that position, if that provision can be severed out then the whole rest of the act would stand. </p><p>So I actually think that severability is sort of the you know, I think severability is one of the most important issues in the case. I don't think the question of characterizes tax--as a tax versus a penalty you know, NFIB v. Sebelius also is interpreting a different provision. It was one that wasn't zeroed out that actually had money attached to it.  </p><p>COONS: But if I could--this is the filing of the Department of Justice in the Supreme Court as you well know, the Justice Department is supposed to defend the constitutionality of federal laws if any reasonable defense can be made. </p><p>And the Trump Justice Department has sided with those advocates who are trying once again to strike the law down in the  courts when they couldn't' accomplish that here in fact, I'd argue that they are denying the will of the voters that clearly in 2018 in deciding control of the House on healthcare want this to stay.  </p><p>And the administration is arguing that this now toothless mandate which imposes on pay--no payment on anyone is unconstitutional and they are arguing the entire act must be struck down as a result. I, frankly, think the DOJ is embarrassed by this brief. </p><p>They rarely even talk about it. But it's in black and white in the quotes over my shoulder that the mandate is unconstitutional and must go and so the parts of the law that prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions that prevent discrimination against women, all of it must fall as a result.  </p><p>It seems to me that Americans who are watching deserve to understand that this is somehow back up in front of the court, the posture the administration is taking, the ways in which it really does follow some of the contours of NFIB v. Sebelius and the ways in which bluntly although I know you won't talk about this pending case what you said in that 2017 article what you wrote is highly relevant.  </p><p>Just as a preliminary point--the vote to uphold the ACA in NFIB v. Sebelius was five to four, correct?  </p><p>BARRETT: Yes.  </p><p>COONS: And Justice Ginsberg was in the majority and Justice Scalia in the minority.  </p><p>BARRETT: Yes.  </p><p>COONS: So if you were to replace Justice Ginsberg with someone who followed precisely Justice Scalia's analysis on the lynch pin question of constitutionality one could expect it would be overturned.  </p><p>BARRETT: No, Senator Coons, because if there were direct challenge to NFIB v. Sebelius there would be precedent on point and the law of stare decisis is a whole body of doctrine that binds judges itself. So no, I don't think one could assume that in a separate point in time that even Justice Scalia would necessarily decide the case the same way once there was precedent on the books.  </p><p>COONS: I agree, and I look forward to discussing that in some more detail tomorrow. I have just I think six minutes. Your views of precedent, Justice Scalia's views of precedent and the ways in which they may diverge I think are important and important for us to spend some time on.  </p><p>Let me just recap this point--for President Trump, for republican politicians the argument about tax and about whether or not the mandate is a tax is the gateway to knocking down the entire Affordable Care Act and that's also the line of attack being taken by the Department of Justice. </p><p>You've already said it's not plausible to interpret the mandate as a tax. You didn't think it was a tax when it was raising billions of dollars in revenue. You certainly, I think, are unlikely to believe it's a tax when it raises no revenue. And the thing that might distinguish it from NFIB v. Sebelius is reliance interests and precedent. </p><p>And when I have more time tomorrow we'll go through that. But I just wanted to connect some dots. That Trump has repeatedly vowed to get rid of the ACA, has campaigned on it, has criticized the Chief Justice, has said his nominees would do the right thing, his administration is in court right now arguing in a case that is to be heard in just four weeks that it should be invalidated and a person you've criticized Chief Roberts a person whose opinion, whose decision you have criticized, Justice Roberts means in many ways that you've signaled, I think.  </p><p>You were added to the Supreme Court shortlist after you wrote that article. And today, my Republican colleagues who themselves have promised to repeal the ACA are rushing through your nomination so you can be seated in time to hear this case. It--it concerns me </p><p>COONS: Gravely that that is the circumstances we are in. Let me ask one last line of questioning if I might get in the five minutes I have left. There's another subject on which President Trump has been, I think, unfortunately, very, very clear about what he hopes for from a Supreme Court nominee. </p><p>Just days after Judge Ginsberg passed, the president was ask why there was such a rush to fill her seat before the election, and he responded, and I quote we need nine justices, you need that with the millions of ballots that they and he meant the Democrats are sending it's a scam, it's a hoax, you are going to need nine justices. </p><p>The next day he told reporters again he double down, I think this, and he means the election from the context will end up in the supreme court. It's very important we must have nine justices. </p><p>Our President has also been asked whether he will commit to a peaceful transition if he loses the election. He has been asked directly and repeatedly, and instead of responding in the way, we would expect of any leader of the free world with a clear and simple yes. </p><p>He has tried to so confusion and distrust in the potential results, and so your honor, I am concerned that what President Trump once here couldn't be clearer that he is trying to rush this nomination ahead so you might cast a decision, a vote in his favor in the event of a disputed election and he's doing his level best to cast doubt on the legitimacy of an election in which literally millions of votes have already been cast most of them by mail. </p><p>I was very encouraged again to hear from you specifically, you have not had any conversation with him about this topic, and that is not what I am suggesting. In fact, you repeated promptly 28 USC 455. </p><p>You are quite familiar with the recusal statute and its considerations. But I think the problem and the core--the core issue in recusal is that any judge or justice should recuse themselves from a case in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. </p><p>Given what President Trump said, given the rushed context of this confirmation, will you commit to recusing herself from in a case arising from a dispute in the presidential election results three weeks from now? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Coons, thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this because I want to be very clear for the record and to all members of this committee that no matter what anyone else may think or expect, I have not committed to anyone or so much as signaled, I have never even written, I have been in a couple of opinions in the Seventh Circuit that have been around the edges of the election law. </p><p>But I haven't even written anything bad I think anybody could reasonably say this is how she might result of an election dispute and I would consider it might see I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people so that would be on the question of actual bias and you ask about the appearance of bias. </p><p>COONS: Correct. </p><p>BARRETT: And you are right that the statute does require a justice or a judge to recuse when there is an appearance of bias, and what I will commit to every member of this committee to the rest of the Senate and to the American people is that I will consider all factors that are relevant to that question, relevant to that question that requires recusal when there is an appearance of bias and they are is case law under the statute. </p><p>And as I referenced earlier in describing the recusal process of the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg said that it is always done with consultation of the other justices and so I promise you that if I were confirmed and if and election dispute arises you know both of which are ifs that I would very seriously undertake that process and I would consider every relevant factor. </p><p>I can't commit to you right now for the reasons that we have talked about before, but I do assure you of my integrity, and I do assure you that I would take that question very seriously. </p><p>COONS: Thank you your honor. Just on the question of consultation, the Chief Justice--former Chief Justice Rehnquist because this question came up in 2004 wrote a letter actually two members of this committee that there's no formal procedure for court review of a decision by a justice in individual cases it's just something Justice Ginsburg did say that there was a practice of consultation and I do think at the end of the day what matters is removing any potential conflict here ensuring that there is confidence in our election, in the Supreme Court and in its role is critical. </p><p>I have reached out to a number of my colleagues to implore them to step back from the timing of this confirmation, to consider the possible confluence of three different factors here and election, and ACA case and a rush timing in the middle of a pandemic and I would just urge them one more time to think seriously about stepping back from this timing of this confirmation. </p><p>That's not meant to impugn you or suggest that in some way, you have engaged in some inappropriate conversation. That is just the confluence of these events at this time at this place. This election will have enormous consequences. </p><p>I am troubled by what you have written about the Affordable Care Act. I am more concerned that the president has tried over and over and over to get rid of the ACA and that the American people have consistently said no and that the consequences for a majority of Americans who rely on the ACA in the middle of a pandemic would be significant and that the president has refused to embrace the American people's wishes and deliver some compelling alternative plan and instead has taken the panel back to the Supreme Court where it will be heard in just a month. </p><p>I think to reach out and to strike this critical statute down now would be the worst example of judicial activism which my colleagues say they don't want and which I hope will not happen, but I am gravely concerned by what I see. </p><p>Your Honor, I believe your views are sincere, but I also think you genuinely think the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. That is my reading, and you are entitled to that view but this body and the American people we shouldn't kid ourselves. </p><p>Bluntly if our president and the majority are able to swing the cord out of balance by replacing Justice Ginsburg by someone whose views may be significantly to the right, the health of a majority of Americans may well be in peril. Thank you, your honor. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Coons. Judge, if it's okay, we will do Senator Hawley's 30 minutes and take a break. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>GRAHAM: Is that okay with you? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, Senator Hawley, you are on deck. We will try to take a 15-minute break and just one observation there really a lot of good questions, good interchange, not one time has a senator and the judge talk over each other. I hope the American people understand that this is the way it should be. Senator Hawley? </p><p>HAWLEY: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I would like to begin by asking consent to enter two letters into the record supporting the judge's nomination. The first from the Family Research Council and the second from a group of state attorneys general, including the state attorney general of my home state of Missouri. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you very much. Judge, it's good to see you again. </p><p>BARRETT: (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>HAWLEY: I have been so impressed with your answers today it is really quite extraordinary. I look forward to visiting with you a little bit here. Can we just start on the topic of independents picking up where Senator Coons just was questioning you? I have heard my Democrat colleagues over and over again suggest that because I guess you clerked for Justice Scalia that you will automatically vote, however, he did, that you attribute his opinions to you, his decisions to you, his method to you. </p><p>Did Justice Scalia tell you what to do in your career? I mean, have you been in the habit in your life of doing exactly what Justice Scalia told you to do in your professional career? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Hawley, as I said earlier, if you confirm me you are getting Justice Barrett, not Justice Scalia. You know I share his method of interpreting the text, but you know I didn't agree with him in every case, even when I was clerking. I mean then he could tell her to do and even if I disagreed, I to go his way. But the fact that we share the same approach does not mean that we would always reach the same result. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you make up your own mind, don't you? </p><p>BARRETT: I do make up my own mind. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you have your own views. I think it's fair to say, is that accurate? </p><p>BARRETT: Indeed, I do. </p><p>HAWLEY: And you are a very accomplished jurist in your own right. Is that fair to say? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, it feels a little immodest to opine on that (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, I will say it is, and you are very accomplished, so I think this--this one-way attribution that everything that you must just be whatever Justice Scalia did you would automatically do I have to say frankly I think is a little bit demeaning. </p><p>Let me ask you about some other attacks that you have endured today. Now I noticed yesterday we were assured that you would not be attacked on the basis of your faith. I noticed that didn't last 24 hours, but I'm not surprised because, for 3 and a half years, we have heard consistent attacks from the Democrat side on nominees on the basis of their faith, including, of course, you Judge Barrett and we talked about this some yesterday. </p><p>Today, the second Democrat senator to speak questioned--criticized you for speaking to a Christian legal group that has a program, a summer program for Christian all students where you gave, I think a lecture once or twice on constitutional, statutory interpretation. </p><p>So let me just ask you about that. You have talked about your faith this has been well established. You accepted an invitation to speak to a group of Christian law students on the topic of your specialty. Tell us why you accepted the invitation. </p><p>[*]BARRETT: I had several other colleagues who had participated in the Blackstone Program lecturing, and I heard great things about it from them. We had a contingent --students from Notre Dame regularly attend this program and they were among our most engaged and smartest students. </p><p>And, I went and did it. The first time I did it, I really enjoyed it. The students were very, very engaged. So, I did it, I don't know, I might have done it four or five times each summer. I would go and just give a lecture on originalism that was one hour of the, you know--Blackstone is a summer long program. </p><p>So, I went and gave my one hour lecture at the beginning of it and I really thought it was--it was fun to talk about the Constitution to an engaged group of students is fun for someone who's a law professor. </p><p>HAWLEY: Are you aware of anything in the Constitution or our laws that say that it is a disqualification for office for a believer of a religious faith to--to go and lecture to law students of a similar faith in her area of expertise? </p><p>BARRETT: I certainly--let me see. I want to be careful that I'm not veering into answering hypothetical questions. But, I--I certainly didn't think there was anything wrong with my going to speak to a group of Christian law students about my expertise. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you this. Senator Leahy also raised a pledge, a statement that you signed regarding abortion. You told us--you told the committee in response to his question, you and your husband both signed--and I'm looking at the advertisement in question right here, the portion that you signed. You said that you signed it on your way out of church, if I remember correctly. </p><p>BARRETT: I did. That was almost 15 years ago. At the back of church, there was a table set up for people on their way out of mass to sign a statement, you know, validating their commitment to the position of the Catholic Church on life issues. The ad that was next to it, I don't recall seeing the ad at the time and in context looking at it, it looks to me like that was an ad by the St. Joseph County Right to Life group. </p><p>The statement that I signed, you know, it--it was, you know, affirming the protection of life from conception to natural death. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, you just--you--you just made reference to the fact, again, that it was--it was in church. Can you just--why would it have been in the--the back of church? I mean, why would signatures--why would this have been available to sign or not, as you so chose, in the back of church? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, because that is the position of the Catholic Church, you know, on--on abortion, though I--I feel like I should emphasize here as I emphasized to others asking me the question, that I do see as distinct my personal or moral religious views and my task of applying the law as a judge. </p><p>HAWLEY: So, is it safe to say following that distinction you just made, though, that the--that the signature that you lent--your husband also reflects your understanding of your church's teaching and--and your own personal views? I mean, that's what this says that you signed. </p><p>BARRETT: So, what I would like to say about that is I signed that almost 15 years ago in my personal capacity when I was still a private citizen and now, I am a public official. And, so while I was free to express my private views at that time, I don't feel like it is appropriate for me anymore because of the cannons of conduct to express in affirmative view at this point in time. But, what that statement plainly says is that when I signed that statement, that is what I was doing at that point as a private citizen. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, I'm not aware of--of any law or provision of the Constitution that says that if you are a member of the Catholic Church and adhere to the teachings of the Catholic Church or you have religious convictions in line with those of your church teaching, that you're therefore barred from office. Are you aware of any constitutional provision of that effect? </p><p>BARRETT: I would think that the Religious Test Clause would make it unconstitutional (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Well, let me just ask you about the test clause since you bring it up. Article 6 says no religious test shall ever be required in a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Can you just give us your sense, as a constitutional expert, scholar, and judge now of the significance of--of Article 6 for our constitutional scheme? </p><p>BARRETT: So, the Religious Test Clause prohibits this body and prohibits the--the government generally from disqualifying people from office because of their religious beliefs. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, it--it guarantees, does it not, the freedom of religion? I mean, it is a--Article 1--I'm sorry, Amendment 1, the First Amendment, will go on to talk explicitly and I want to ask you about that in a second, about religious liberty. But, Article 6 is significant in that it sets out that one cannot be--no American citizen can be kept out of office based on his or her belief. You don't have to go and get someone's approval, certainly not somebody in government, their approval over what you believe. Does it meet this test or not? Do they like it or not? </p><p>You don't have to get any sign off. In fact, any kind of sign offs are explicitly ruled out by the Constitution. Is that a fair characterization? </p><p>BARRETT: The Religious Test Clause makes plain that denomination or belief can't be a reason to disqualify someone. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, that is why I continue to say it is--it is vital that we underline in the Constitution that this--this test clause and that we insist that it be applied in the context of your confirmation, judge, and every nominee for every high office who comes before this committee. There are no religious tests for office and the attempt to smuggle them in, even in the midst of this committee's hearings to date, has--must be resisted on the basis of the Constitution itself. </p><p>Let me ask you about the First Amendment, about the free exercise of religion. That's, of course, how the First Amendment begins. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. </p><p>Tell me what you think this says about the--the place of religious observance in American life and its significance? Why is it--why is it protected like this in--in the First Amendment? What do you draw from that? </p><p>BARRETT: I mean, I think its presence in the--in the Bill of Rights, you know, like all of our rights, shows that it was one that the people, for generations beginning in 1791, considered central to being a free people. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, there's no indication from the Constitution that religious believers are second class citizens in any way, is there? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, the free exercise certainly suggests to the contrary. </p><p>HAWLEY: And, in fact, the Free Exercise Clause and the First Amendment suggest that--that the exercise of religion, worship, religious belief gets special protection. I mean, it's singled out here for--for protection, along with and immediately after speech, press, right of the people peacefully to assemble. Religion is given a special place, which the United States Supreme Court has recognized. </p><p>Let me just ask you about attempts to disfavor religious believers on the basis of faith. Is it your understanding, can a government, at any level--federal government, state government, municipality, whatever--can they treat religious believers differently? Can they single them out for disfavor versus a non-religious group? Is that permissible in our constitutional order? </p><p>BARRETT: Well Senator Hawley, that's a complicated question because, you know, there's a lot of doctrines surrounding that and there aren't bright lined rules, and so that question would come up in a case with facts and, you know, it would require the whole judicial decision making process. So, it's not a hypothetical that I can answer. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you about the--the court's decision, unanimous decision, in the Hosanna-Tabor case, which touches some of these questions in which the court there, it's a question about churches' ability, any house of worship, to hire and fire their ministers or those who perform religious functions, religious services. </p><p>And, in that unanimous decision, the court says that--that houses of worship are--are different, that they are unique, that they are--that they are given special protection under the First Amendment and that therefore, they must be accorded special status. </p><p>They--they have to have the ability, for instance, to hire and--and fire ministers, those who are going to perform religious functions. The state, the government cannot interfere with that. Do you--do you think--do you agree with the--the teaching of that case? I mean, do you--do you think that that--that that case remains good law and is a significant decision? </p><p>BARRETT: Well Senator Hawley, I think the way to that--answer that question is, again as I've said, I can't grade precedent, but I can talk about a precedent from my court. So, I was on a panel that decided a case called Grussgott, which applied Hosanna-Tabor to the situation of a Jewish school, which had fired a teacher and the teacher sued and the question was whether following Hosanna-Tabor, that school was entitled to treat her as a minister under the ministerial exemption recognized in Hosanna-Tabor. </p><p>And, my court, the panel that I was on, said that she was a minister and we, you know, took the factors in Hosanna-Tabor and said nothing was a bright line test. You look at the cluster because Hosanna-Tabor was designed to give religious institutions the freedom to hire and fire their ministers, you know, in this case, one of the Jewish faith, as consistent with their practice of their faith. </p><p>And, that view of ours in Grussgott was embraced by the Supreme Court last term in Our Lady of Guadalupe. </p><p>HAWLEY: I think it's--it's vital in the--in this time and this season, judge, where we're seeing many challenges to religious independence, many challenges to the ability of churches to conduct worship on equal terms with secular organizations, that the Supreme Court's unanimous decisions in this area, Hosanna-Tabor and others, the Trinity Lutheran case--which was not unanimous, but is a recent very important case as well--I will just say, for myself, that I think that the lines that the Supreme Court has drawn regarding the First Amendment, regarding the status of houses of worship, regarding the rights of religious believers, that now more fully enforced and that the line of cases that is now multi-years old that the Supreme Court has set out be followed and I--I certainly hope that you will respect and apply that precedent going forward. I don't have any reason to think that you won't. </p><p>Let me shift gears and ask about another attack that has been made on you today having to do with the Kanter case. The Kanter case we have heard about, Senator Durbin ask you about it at some length, Senator Klobuchar ask about it as well. The Kanter case first of all is--is a case about the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms is that right? </p><p>BARRETT: That is right. </p><p>HAWLEY: And it is a about whether or not someone who had been charged with and convicted or pled guilty to a felony could keep and bear arms under certain circumstances is that a fair summary? Now it is I have heard repeatedly from my Democratic colleagues that you write in your dissent, you dissented in this case you ride in your dissent that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right but the right to vote is not an individual right but maybe I'm reading a different opinion. That is not what you say in the opinion that I see. </p><p>Page 50 of your opinion or of--of the joint opinion your dissent you refer to civic rights, voting rights as civic rights and you say civic rights you to find them civic rights are individual rights. A moment later use say for example the right to vote is held by individuals so let's just set the record straight here. In this case you say that the right to vote is an individual right, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: And the distinction between a civic right and the Second Amendment has to do with the purposes of that right. First of all that's not a distinction you invented, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: You were replying to a both a chain of cases and also scholarship on this issue, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: That is correct and also the arguments the litigants made in the Kan--Kanter case itself. </p><p>HAWLEY: And--and this (INAUDIBLE) specific right it talks about what the right to vote and what it's civic purposes are. In other words it gives us a stake in our democracy, is that fair to say? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: But you never at any point say that the right to vote is somehow secondary or less than--less fundamental than any other right, is that fair to say? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, that is fair to say. I never said that. </p><p>HAWLEY: In fact, your whole point in this case which is a fundamental rights case doesn't have anything to do with voting rights, this is not a voting rights case is it, the Kanter case? </p><p>BARRETT: It does not. </p><p>HAWLEY: It has nothing to do with voting rights. Your whole point in this case a fundamental rights cases that you think that your colleagues on the Seventh Circuit actually constricted fundamental rights to narrowly that is the Supreme Court of the United States has said in Heller that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right, that is the Heller decision. You think in this case that your colleagues actually were constraining that fundamental right a little too narrowly and were shutting some people out of it. Is that fair to say? </p><p>BARRETT: We did disagree about the scope of the right. </p><p>HAWLEY: So just to make the record perfectly clear here the Supreme Court has said the United States Supreme Court has said over and over that voting, the right to vote is a fundamental right and I think you--you have a firm that and recognize today you have said that that is Supreme Court precedent. Am I right about that? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: And the Supreme Court has said repeatedly that they adhere to the one person one vote standard, these sort of baseline the touchtone--the keystone to that entire doctrine. Do I have that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Indeed that is correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: And nothing in your opinion challenges that are changes that are calls into question, critiques nothing, right? </p><p>BARRETT: Not one iota. </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay. I am glad that we are clear on that. Now as Senator Durbin said--as part of his line of questioning on this he suggested that I don't know perhaps that your opinion on this case somehow which has nothing to do with voting rights makes you friendly to what he characterized as attempts to deny people the right to vote on racial grounds. </p><p>He went on to say that we all come to--everybody, every judge, all of us who come to the law, every judge who comes to the bench comes to the bench and two cases with their own individual experience and viewpoint so let's just talk about that for just a second if we could when it comes to the--to the fraught but vital issue of race. In your own experience with that you and your husband are the parents of a multiracial family. </p><p>BARRETT: We are. </p><p>HAWLEY: Can you give us some sense just in your personal experience what that has been like for you and what that means to you, what your--what experience you bring to the bench because of your experience as a parent in this unique context? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think I could say how it has shaped me as a person has certainly you know whenever you have a life experience it makes you acutely aware in your interactions with other people you know it gives you empathy for them. </p><p>I mean the same is true of our having a son with a disability but I want to make very clear Senator Hawley that while my life experiences I think you know I hope have given me wisdom and compassion they don't dictate how I decide cases because you know as we discussed before and have discussed a couple of time sometimes you have to decide cases in ways where you don't like the result. </p><p>So while I hope that my family has made me a better person and my children definitely have given me new perspectives on life I still in applying law and deciding cases you know don't let those experiences dictate the outcome. </p><p>HAWLEY: You will follow the law wherever the law leads? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: Which I think is a good way to bring us back full circle to where we started about your own independence. You have cultivated I think it is fair to say over the course of your very distinguished career you have cultivated a reputation for original thinking, for independence, for I would say for courage and for toughness and you have never I--I see no evidence in your record that you have ever compromised, count out or bent your position to the whims of other people especially people in power based on what they wanted you to do you to do or told you to do. Is that fair to say? I mean have I missed something in your record? </p><p>BARRETT: No, I think that is fair to say. </p><p>HAWLEY: I admire the way in which you have answered these questions judge and your forthrightness on these issues and I look forward to talking with you more tomorrow and with that Mr. Chairman I yield back my time. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Hawley. We will reconvene in 20 minutes and we will go until about 6:30 and take a 30 minute break to have some dinner and come back and finish out round one today. So a 20 minute break. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>[*]GRAHAM: Hearing will come to order, Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being back, Your Honor, and thank you to your family as well. </p><p>I want to just begin by saying perhaps not surprisingly too, that I was really disappointed by your responses to a number of my colleagues, most recently to Senator Coons on the issue of whether you would participate in a decision involving the upcoming election if you are confirmed. I continue to believe that if you were to participate in a decision involving that election it would do enduring explosive damage to the Court. </p><p>I think you know it would be wrong. Not because of anything you've done. In fact, I'm not raising the issue of whether you've done any sort of deal or commitment because of what Donald Trump has done and my Republican colleagues. Because they have indelibly put at issue, your integrity through their statements, the president has said that he's putting you on the Court as a ninth justice so you can decide the election. </p><p>He's been very clear and transparent. And the American people are not dumb. They're watching and they're listening. And if you were to sit on this case if it goes to this Supreme Court the American people would lose faith and trust in the Court itself. It would be a dagger at the heart of the Court and our democracy if this election is decided by the Court rather than the American voters. So I wanted to begin by making that point and then go to again, the real people who are really in this room with us and who will be affected by you as a Justice. Yesterday, I introduced you to Connor Kurin you may recall, he's 10 years old. I was with him on his 10th birthday, September 27, he's a remarkable champion. He was diagnosed, as you may remember with Duchene's muscular dystrophy at age four. His parents were told to take him home and give him a good life because he would soon lose his ability to walk. Told his muscles would get so weak that he would eventually lose his ability to smile. And he's still smiling. </p><p>What lies behind that smile is untold pain, physical pain the anguish of going through the needles and the prodding and the treatments but for his family its also the anguish of wondering whether they'll be able to pay for treatment that has kept him alive. And whether he will be with them for all of life's milestones. </p><p>They sent me a letter that they asked me to share with you saying to you, Judge Barrett, please protect Connor. And, they wrote also for millions of other Americans, 135 million Americans many of them children just like Connor. But also, Christine Miller from Bloomfield, Connecticut, she was diagnosed with a thyroid condition. Her condition was only discovered because of the ACA which gave her affordable coverage for the first time in a long time using Connecticut's exchange--healthcare exchange. </p><p>And they wrote for people like Julia Lanzano in Cheshire, Connecticut. She suffered from headaches for years and she put off going to a doctor because she lacked insurance--so typical and common for people--put it off. When Julia finally saw a doctor without--still without insurance she learned she had a brain tumor and she was eligible for coverage under Connecticut's Medicaid expansion program which was created by the Affordable Care Act. In her words, ""It was a godsend."" </p><p>I raise these stories in part because as you know I'm sure, protection for people who suffer from pre-existing conditions is in fact, on the line in this case that will come to the Supreme Court only a week after the election. I want to be crystal clear because you stated to Senator Feinstein that and I'm going to quote, so far as I know the cases next week doesn't present that issue. It's not a challenge to preexisting--preexisting conditions coverage or to the extreme lifetime maximum relief from a cap. And, technically, you're right but it's a big but if the trial court is upheld and there is no severability the entire act goes down. </p><p>That is what the Trump administration is asking the Court to do. That's what the plaintiffs want done. Correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I gather that Senator Coons had shown the brief of the litigating position of the Department of Justice. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Right. I want to move onto </p><p>[*]BLUMENTHAL: another healthcare case and this one involves some of the letters that Senator Hawley was mentioning. And, I feel I need to raise them because Senator Hawley asked about them, so did Senator Leahy, and I want to just clarify what they mean. And, I want to make absolutely clear, I detest and oppose any religious test. I am not asking you any questions about your religious beliefs. </p><p>BARRETT: --Okay.-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I'm going to be asking some questions about your legal positions. So, in case I'm unclear in any of my questions, I want you to tell me. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You signed onto this 2006 open letter, sponsored by an organization then known as the St. Josephs County Right to Life, which was published in the South Bend Tribune. Is that the letter that Senator Hawley was mentioning? </p><p>BARRETT: I believe he--the statement that's on the left, I think Senator Hawley had read the language. I can't remember it verbatim, but it was something like, you know, we support the right to life from fertilization to natural deaths, yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The letter and ad referred to Roe v. Wade's legacy as ""barbaric."" Correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't think that that's part of the statement. I think that's part of the ad that appeared on the page next to it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: They appeared side by side, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I believe that it ran that way in the newspaper. I'm not sure that I ever saw it in the newspaper, but yes, that is my understanding-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --That's how it appeared, so they were side by side. </p><p>BARRETT: That's based--yes, based on--yeah. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And, the St. Josephs County Right to Life sponsored the letter that you signed? </p><p>BARRETT: I think the St. Joseph County Right to Life organization was the one who presented the statement that I signed at the back of church. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I want to give you an opportunity to clarify. You didn't disclose that letter when you were nominated to the Seventh Circuit in 2017, did you? </p><p>BARRETT: I did not, Senator Blumenthal, and I'm actually very glad that you brought that up because I just want to clarify for the record, number one, that I didn't have any recollection of that letter. I signed it almost--or statement. I signed it almost 15 years ago, quickly on my way out of church, and, you know, the questionnaire asks me for 30 years' worth of material and I've produced more than 1,800 pages. And, so I didn't recall it. </p><p>After it came to my attention, I did go back and look at the questionnaire and I actually don't think that particular statement is responsive to Question 12, which is I think the closest that it would come. I don't think it's responsive. But, in any event, it is part of the public, you know, record and I'm very happy to discuss it. But, it wasn't-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --It's--it's part of the public-- </p><p>BARRETT: --hiding the (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --record now and it's a letter. The questionnaire asks for letters. Have you disclosed it now? Have you provided it officially? </p><p>BARRETT: So, senator, as I said, I have supplemented my questionnaire with other material that came to light that I do think was responsive. That one--and I would be happy to answer questions if you want and questions for the record with more specific detail, but I did not understand that to be responsive to Question 12 I think it is. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well in fact, we know about it only because the Guardian made it public, I believe. Let me ask you about another letter--2013 letter. You signed on to this letter regarding Roe v. Wade. It was sponsored by the University Faculty for Life at Notre Dame. You remember that organization, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I do. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And, the letter described Roe v. Wade as--it's behind me--infamous and it stated that the signatories ""renew our call for the unborn to be protected in law."" Correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, I believe the full statement says--I'm testing my eyesight here--""Our full support for our university's commitment to the Right to Life"" because, you know, Notre Dame is a Catholic university and embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church on abortion. And, so as a faculty member and member of the University Faculty for Life, I signed that statement. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But, you didn't disclose that letter. </p><p>BARRETT: Again, senator, I produced 1,800 pages of material and all six prior nominees have had to supplement because they've overlooked things. Thirty years' worth of material is a lot to try to find and remember. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You disclosed it, in fact, just about three days ago, I believe, right? </p><p>BARRETT: Because that's when it was brought to my attention. I had no recollection of it and it surfaced in the press and so it came to my attention and then I supplemented. And, I did think it was responsive because it was a statement of an organization of which I was part and I belonged to the University Faculty for Life at the time. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: If this process maybe had been a little less rushed, you might have had more time to go back and recall some of these documents? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, as I said, all six prior nominees, or the most recent six, have had to supplement too. So, I don't think it really had anything to do with time. I think it has to do with the volume of material. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And, when you and I spoke when you appeared before this committee in connection with your 2017 nomination, I didn't have the benefit of any of these documents, although I asked you about right of privacy and the validity of Roe v. Wade, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I said on my SJQ when I was nominated to the Seventh Circuit and I said again now, I've produced all the material that I could find and I conducted searches to try to find things that I forgot and I didn't find that. I understand that someone had to manually go to Notre Dame and look through back archives. I--I didn't remember it and I couldn't find it. I assure you, I was not trying to hide it from you. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: So, judge--and I apologize for interrupting you. I'm-- </p><p>BARRETT: --No-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --pressed for time. </p><p>BARRETT: --Sure.-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Respectfully, I want to share another healthcare story with you. It's about Samantha. One night in January of 2017, Samantha went out with a few friends and coworkers. She woke up the next morning in a coworker's home, confused, scared, covered in blood. She had been raped. After she was raped, Samantha was in her words ""a zombie."" </p><p>She couldn't change clothes. She couldn't shower. She couldn't drink or think. She wanted this event to be erased from her memory. </p><p>Samantha's attacker also began stalking her and she was struggling with depression and PTSD. In March, Samantha took a pregnancy test and then another and another. They kept coming back with the same result: pregnant. After the horrible violence she faced, she simply couldn't process that she was now pregnant. </p><p>When Samantha shared her story with me, she said, ""I knew if I couldn't end this pregnancy, it would end me."" So, she decided to get an abortion. </p><p>Now, as you know, Judge, the landmark Roe v. Wade decision gave her that option. It gave women the right to decide for themselves whether and when to have a child. Roe didn't compel Samantha to get an abortion. It didn't tell her what she had to do, but it gave her that choice. </p><p>The question that I would like to ask you concerns your legal position. Does the Constitution protect Samantha's right to have an abortion? </p><p>BARRETT: Roe v. Wade clearly held that the Constitution protected a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. Casey upheld that central holding and spelled out in greater detail the test that the Court uses to consider the legality of abortion regulations. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Now I'm asking you this question because the group that sponsored the first letter, St. Josephs County Right to Life as it was then known states, ""abortion is never the right answer, even in cases of sexual assault or where the pregnant woman's life is in danger."" </p><p>And, the purpose of the letters that you signed seem to be a statement of legal position. But, you're saying that there is a constitutional right to an abortion? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, the statement that I signed from the St. Joseph County Right to Life didn't say anything about rape or incest or any of those things. It simply validated the teaching of my church </p><p>[*]BARRETT: on the sacredness of life from conception to natural death. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: What I hear you saying is in the Constitution there is that right. </p><p>BARRETT: I--you mean when I was talking about Roe and Casey a moment ago? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, Roe was correctly decided. You are agreeing that-- </p><p>BARRETT: What I said was that Roe held that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, that Casey reaffirmed that holding and indeed many cases after Casey have affirmed that holding again (INAUDIBLE) women's health for example, so I--I think we might be talking past each other because the statements that I signed were statements of my personal beliefs and not-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Not your personal belief, Your Honor, your legal position. Are you willing to say that Roe was correctly decided because that's really the essence of the question here? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, as I have said you know to others of your colleagues in response to questioning that it is inconsistent with the duties of a sitting judge and therefore has been the practice of every nominee that sat in the seat be for me to take positions on cases that the Court has decided in the past. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I think Samantha and a lot of rape survivors would be really deeply fearful about that answer because it provides no reassurance that you believe that Roe was correctly decided. </p><p>Let me talk about Tracy. I want to tell you about her because she again came to me, told me she was diagnosed with stage IV endometriosis and that it had caused an ongoing inability to have a healthy pregnancy, but as she said, she was quote one of the quote lucky ones. She had access to care and was able to receive treatment to assist in getting and staying pregnant, and I have encountered, maybe you have many members of the military, veterans who have sought similar kinds of treatment, some of them because they have suffered wounds of war. Tracy was scared when she saw the executive director of the St. Joseph County Right to Life recently stated, and I quote we would be supportive of criminalizing the discarding of frozen embryos or selective reduction through the IVF process. So Tracy wanted me to ask you, in fact, she asked me to pose this question. Is it your legal position that making IVF a crime would be constitutional? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, the statement that I signed as we discussed, you know, affirmed the belief of my church with respect to matters of life-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I--I'm not asking about what you signed it, I am asking about your present legal position-- </p><p>BARRETT: What--what I was-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Is--is making IVF a crime constitutional? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, your-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Sorry, go ahead. </p><p>BARRETT: Sorry, I was trying to answer, but you are quoting positions from the St. Joseph County Right to Life. I'm not a member of that organization, and so I'm not responsible for statements that they make. The statement that I signed said what you and I have discussed, and it said nothing further than that. And as for you know what policy position someone might take you know as I have said to your colleagues, I just it's not up to me to be in the business of expressing views, and I am happy to talk about views that I expressed when I was a private citizen, but now I may judge and so I cannot publicly express views. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Just to be absolutely clear, I am not asking about the St. Joseph County Right to Life for their positions, and I understand you may or may not disagree or agree with them, but your legal position IVF treatment and I'm not going to ask again just this last time, criminalizing it would it be constitutional? I think there is a clear answer. </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I have repeatedly says as has every nominee who sat in this seat that we can't answer questions in the abstract. That would have to be decided in the course of the judicial process with a--some legislature would actually have to do that, and then litigants would have to come to court. There would have to be briefs and arguments and consultation with colleagues and opinion writing in consideration of precedent so and off-the-cuff reaction to that would just circumvent the judicial process. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I am disappointed. I think Tracy would find that response somewhat chilling because she and thousands, maybe millions of women, potential parents would be horrified to think that IVF treatment could be made criminal, and I understand you are not answering the question, but I think she would be deeply fearful. </p><p>Do you think that it would be constitutional to make it a crime for doctors or healthcare providers to provide that care or abortion care? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, again, that's a hypothetical question and so as I said to give off-the-cuff responses about abstract issues and I should clarify to say it really doesn't matter if they are hard questions or easy questions it's just any questions that call for an abstract legal opinions are not ones that are appropriate for me to give either as a sitting judge or as a nominee those questions in my judicial role can't be answered only through the judicial process. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Just to be absolutely clear, there are millions of women like Samantha and Tracy and the veterans I mentioned who are terrified to think that their doctors and healthcare providers would be potentially in jail at risk of prosecution doctors who are exercising currently protected rights that Samantha says saved her life and I believe our healthcare providers are heroes particularly during the pandemic that I want to ask you one--one more question about these documents. </p><p>In the 2013 letter that you signed, there is the following statement we renew our call for the unborn to be protected in law, in law and welcomed in life. What does it mean for quote the unborn to be protected in law? Does that statement mean there is no valid constitutional protection for an abortion, and therefore Roe v. Wade should be overturned? </p><p>BARRETT: You know, I think that statement is an affirmation of life. You know it points out that we express our love and support for the mothers who bear them. Again, it was a statement validating the position of the Catholic University at which I worked in support for life and you know to support women in crisis pregnancies, to support babies so it's--it's really no more than the expression of a pro-life view. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I expect we will be talking more about this issue tomorrow. I want to move now to another topic. You and Senator Durbin and others talk to you about your dissent in Kanter v. Barr, and I think your approach here in effect usurps the legislatures appropriate role in making policy judgments in the case of Kanter, which by the way, you put first on the list of decisions that you thought were most important that you have written, is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't remember the order in which I listed them. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It was first. </p><p>BARRETT: I--I accept that. I just don't remember the order. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: I did list it. I remember listing it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Okay. But that decision seems to usurp the legislatures' role in deciding who should be permitted to have firearms and who should not because you decided the legislature was wrong to classify felons as not deserving of firearms. You decided it's a matter of policy that when they were not dangerous, they should have that right that's a policy or legislative judgment and I think it has huge ramifications for real people across the country and I want to tell you about one of them from Sandy Hook, Connecticut Natalie who is shown here with her brother Daniel. Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012, and Daniel was seven. I was there that day. I saw the parents after they had learned that they had lost 20 beautiful children and six great educators died as well. In the firehouse that day, there was unspeakable grief, and eight years later, Natalie says that grief remains with her, but Natalie, like Newtown, is resilient and strong, and her grief and trauma have spurred hope and action. She and many young people across the country are leading a movement to deal with the epidemic and scourge of gun violence in this country. What happened at Sandy Hook was not an isolated incident. There have been 236 other mass shootings in the last decade in the last ten years. Gun violence has taken more than 354,000 lives in rural communities, and urban communities all around the country, and I'm sure in Indiana and South Bend as well. Your opinion in Kanter goes further than Justice Scalia in Heller. In fact, you characterize it as kind of radical. It is, in effect, an outlier, and it is, in fact, radical. </p><p>BARRETT: Did I say it was radical in the opinion? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I think you said quote it sounds kind of radical to say felons can have firearms. That's a direct quote. </p><p>BARRETT: Oh, I didn't remember that particular language. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You can-- </p><p>BARRETT: I--I'm not--I'm not--I just don't recall it, but I'm not nitpicking about it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: We can look it up. </p><p>BARRETT: That--that's fine, senator. I--I don't think you are making it up, trust me. No, I--I will check it and look at that, but I know that's not the thrust of your question. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: It sounds kind of radical because it is radical. In fact, no courts of appeals except maybe the Seventh Circuit has adopted this reasoning. </p><p>BARRETT: The Third Circuit I think as a rule that's-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The Third Circuit. Any others? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know that it's come up and others-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I think I knew there was one circuit that did. I wasn't sure which one, but thank you. </p><p>BARRETT: (INAUDIBLE) my position was consistent with a Third Circuit en banc decision that had already been decided. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And cutting through all of the legalese and we have had quite a bit of it going back and forth what this approach does potential only is mean that Connecticut's gun safety provision that the people of Newtown, Christian and Michael Song(SP) on behalf of their son Ethan, who perish because of a gun that was not safely stored, they championed a measure called Ethan's Law. Commonsense measures that might have prevented the death of Shane Oliver, Janet Rice's son, who died on October 20, 2012. Shane was killed when he was 20 years old in Hartford. He died fighting for his will in Hartford little and measures like the emergency risk protection order Connecticut now has. 19 states have these laws. They have saved lives, and extreme risk protection order laws which help minimize risk might well be struck down under the reasoning of your--your dissent. </p><p>BARRETT: Respectfully, senator, my dissent would not reach even those issues. My dissent was about the narrow question about whether a felon who had sold fraudulent foot inserts could automatically be disqualified from his second amendment right simply on that basis. It said that guns can be kept out of the hands of the dangerous, and it didn't say anything about other gun safety or background check. Those are all issues that are being litigated across the country and were not an issue in Kanter. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But supplanting the legislators judgment about when dangerous people should be protected from themselves if they are potential suicides as Vick van Como(SP), a veteran in Iraq, found when his friend was going to take his life, the emergency risk protection order would have been available. Deciding what is dangerous, who is dangerous, when weapons should be taken away from them if the courts are going to supplant the judgments of legislators if judges are going to legislate from the bench that is the import of your reasoning in that dissent. It may not have dealt precisely with any of these particular laws, but the reasoning throws into doubt, it raises the risk to many of them, and folks who live in Connecticut are terrified of that prospect, at least many who have talked to me. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Sandy Hook was a tragedy so I--I express the deepest sympathy for those that have experience that lost their and elsewhere but Kanter, you know I--I hope you take some comfort from Kanter being a much narrower decision that doesn't have any effect on those sorts of laws. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Thank you, Judge. </p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Tillis? </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge Barrett. Mr. Chairman, before I get started, I would like unanimous consent to submit a letter from my primary care physician indicating that I've fully complied with CDC guidelines being cleared like 2,000 other North Carolinians yesterday, and I'm glad that they're healing. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>TILLIS: I'd also like to put forth three letters in support of Judge Barrett, including one from Devan Patel, a former student who speaks very highly of your academic priorities but also your compassion. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>TILLIS: Also I'd like to cover what Senator Blumenthal just did. I think we should go back--I believe you alluded to it, Judge Barrett, but Question 12a of the Committee Questionnaire asks for books, articles, reports, letters to the editor, editorial pieces or other published material you have written or edited. Is it fair to say that if you signed a petition, you did not write or edit any of the petitions you signed? </p><p>BARRETT: I did not write or edit that. </p><p>TILLIS: It also needs to be restated, I think you alluded to it, but over the last six justices confirmed by this committee, all of them have provided supplemental information, and in some cases after the actual hearing. So I appreciate your being forthcoming, that you've submitted 1800 pages of documents. Mr. Chairman, just going back, I also wanted to mention that as a part of my journey through my time in quarantine, I have enrolled in two studies so far. I'll be giving blood on Friday to enroll in another program at UNC Chapel Hill, and I'm scheduled to donate convalescent plasma. Because this is being aired, I hope that anyone who's recovered from COVID will do their part to try and heal this country from the health challenges that COVID has presented us with; I intend to do my part. </p><p>I also would like to say, I like to consider the Senate an essential business. And I believe that the Architect at the Capitol and our attending physicians here have taken great measures to make sure that we can safely come to work, and I would encourage anybody who works in the Senate to come to work. I would also go back to something that Senator Feinstein said earlier--and you're not going to have to answer this question. Senator Feinstein mentioned earlier that we've had a surge in applications for guns or purchases of guns. I wonder if a part of that is where we find our society right now. </p><p>We're seeing great cities burned and looted. In my highway patrol in North Carolina, 75 percent fewer applications to go into the troopers' academy, and record high request for retirement. We see that in New York; we see it across this country. I think people are afraid because many people, including people on this committee, are unwilling to condemn the acts of violence in public safety out there and condemn violence against law enforcement, which is rampant. I lost a--a sheriff's deputy just about a month ago, who was shot protecting a family. So, yes, Senator Feinstein, I suspect that gun purchases are up, but I suspect the root cause behind a lot of them have to do with people's personal safety. </p><p>To your family, I--I would encourage all your family members and your students who are mercifully--are your children who are your students, too, who are mercifully taking a break to treat social media like roadkill, just don't look at it, because if you do, you're going to regret it. I am going to also ask unanimous consent to put forth some articles or tweets from prominent people that I think kind of give you an idea of the guerilla tactics that are being used right now in the committee. This is sounding a whole lot like a lobbying session. It's almost as if you're being interviewed to become a U.S. senator so that you can decide policy, on the--on the Affordable Care Act and a number of other things that I'll get to. </p><p>But behind the curtains, we're seeing people say all kinds of things about you. One--one called you a ""white colonizer"" for actually adopting two Haitian children. We have another one calling you a ""handmaid in a--in a clown car,"" and I'm not going to--it will be submitted for the record, but the profanity used in there. Another one, that--that says, that, yeah, you're a good mom, but that doesn't qualify you as a judge. What qualifies you as a judge is being an extraordinary professor, an extraordinary student, and an extraordinary jurist. And I think that these people need to recognize, doing the bidding of this committee by attacking you outside of the committee is as bad as it's going to be in this chamber. </p><p>Now, I also want to talk about the discussion on Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act. The--Senator Feinstein, in I think the same two or three minutes, said that she wanted to--to protect Roe v. Wade but overturn Heller. Those seem to be incongruent, but I'll just leave that out there. They're asking you to basically legislate, I don't want you to do that. But when we talk about Roe v. Wade, the one thing that's conveniently missed about this discussion is something that I think that most of the American people are at odds with the position that every member of the Democratic Conference supports. </p><p>My--my granddaughter went to her two-month health check-up today. She weighed in at 10.1 pounds. And you can't see this picture, but I'm telling you, from this granddaddy's eyes, she's gorgeous. But she was born three weeks premature, and she only weighed a little over six pounds. She was discharged from the hospital within 36 hours. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to talk about broad strokes of Roe v. Wade, but they don't want to talk about their radical policy that would allow the right to take that child away that I just held in my arms two or three weeks ago, and eight weeks ago when she was three weeks--three weeks premature. </p><p>Judge Barrett, I believe--I have complete confidence in your integrity. I have complete confidence that you're going to go and you're going to be a great Justice. But I do want to ask a little bit about maybe your experience when you were working for--actually, I want to start when you were in--in school. Did you have--when you came in, you were obviously a brilliant student and you did your homework. We've heard professors attest to your--your intelligence and your performance in school. Did you ever go into a classroom where the professor was espousing one position, and you espousing in another one, and you ended up coming out with a different perspective? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>TILLIS: Yep. Did you ever change your professor's perspective? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm not sure about that. </p><p>TILLIS: Well, it's kind of an unfair balance. Okay, now fast-forward to when you were at clerk for Justice Scalia. I just saw an interview last week when I was in quarantine of Justice Briar talking about these mounds of--of documents that his clerks would provide to him, he'd quickly go through them. He said it's actually a fairly quick process to winnow out the ones where there's no dispute among--there's no split circuit, so he moved through it pretty quickly. I understand that Justice Scalia, at least in some sessions, would have a mix of clerks, they would be across the ideological spectrum. Was that the case when you were clerking for him? </p><p>BARRETT: I would say that not all four of us, he had four clerks, and we were not--we were not all of the same mind, there was a mix. </p><p>TILLIS: Were you--were there ever cases when you went before Justice Scalia and you--you--you thought that maybe he was leaning one way, where he actually listened to the arguments from the clerk, and modified his position, or was it like the professor discussion? </p><p>BARRETT: No, I think he definitely listened. I mean, we would go in before an argument when he was preparing, and he would pepper us with questions and go back and forth, he wanted to hear it from all sides. And so, no, he definitely--it was part of the give and take. Though, to be clear, he was the one with the commission, and he was the one who made the decisions. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you. The last thing I'm going to say, because I want to yield back more time to most other members, is, Mr. Chairman, you opened up this morning talking about the Affordable Care Act. I don't think there's anybody in the U.S. Senate that doesn't want to make sure that every single picture that we've seen here, that those folks have affordable healthcare and that they can be cared for. But what we have here in the Affordable Care Act is something that is so flawed that the majority of the Democratic candidates for--for president all raised their hand and said it needed to be replaced with something they call Medicare for All, which could be Medicare for none. </p><p>We know the broken promises of, if you like your doctor you could keep it, if you like your healthcare you could keep it. What we're not talking about are the thousands of people who were already forced off of their job healthcare, because employers changed hours, and now instead of working one full-time job, you've got to work two full-time jobs because the businesses can't afford it. We've got a fundamental problem here. We need to protect every one of them, but we also need to make sure that people who have a health plan under the Affordable Care Act can actually afford to use it. And to catastrophic situations, it's life-changing, and thank God that it's there for them. </p><p>But what about so many other people that only have it and will only use it if they have a catastrophic situation, because they can't afford the copays, they can't afford the underlying costs. We need to fix that. We shouldn't expect a Justice or the Supreme Court to fix it. That is our job. We should all show up here for work, and we should get that done, and we should also work on all the other things that this country is suffering from as a result of COVID. Thank you, Judge Barrett. I look forward to supporting your nomination. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Tillis. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate my objections to holding this nomination hearing instead of working to provide relief for the millions of Americans who are suffering during this pandemic. Three weeks ago, our country crossed a tragic milestone, we lost more than 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. That is more than the entire population of the island in Hawaii. More than the population of Tempe, Arizona; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Waco, Texas. I could go on. 200,000 American lives less. This is a photo of a memorial outside the White House where President Trump held a reckless super-spreader event two weeks ago to announce this Supreme Court nomination. </p><p>The memorial shows 20,000 empty chairs, one chair representing 10 American lives lost to COVID-19. And one of those chairs represents Veronica Guevara's grandfather who is pictured--who is pictured here with Veronica. Veronica, who is from Iowa, has experienced the painful impact of the Trump Administration's failure to address the pandemic. Her family is composed of essential workers who are working on the front lines of this pandemic. </p><p>Her mother, who worked at a fast food processing facility caught COVID-19 at work and was eventually hospitalized for seven days. Thankfully, her mother recovered, but then her grandparents got COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. And although her grandmother recovered sadly her grandfather didn't make it. </p><p>After experiencing all of this tragedy, Veronica shared quote, ""It is even more so insulting to see a Senate that is more concerned with rushing through a Supreme Court nominee rather than focusing on providing relief to all the hard working people that gave them their current leadership positions."" End quote. </p><p>Many Americans agree with Veronica. They are sitting at their kitchen tables wondering how they are gonna buy food, how they're gonna pay rent. Millions of them are out of--they--they don't have jobs. They are going to foodbanks for the first time in their lives. So rather than coming up with a bill that meets the needs of the urgency of this moment Republicans are just come--coming up with piecemeal bills. That's because we know that within your own caucus you can't agree on one bill that fit--fits the critical needs of this country. </p><p>In fact, there are at least 20 Republicans we heard who have said we're done, we're not doing any more to help the Americans who are suffering with COVID. So here we are, racing forward with this nomination while the rest of the country is wondering what the heck is the Senate doing, particularly the Senate Republicans. So I agree with all the people in our country who are asking what the heck. This is hypocritical. </p><p>This hearing shows the American public exactly what my Republican colleagues' priorities are, ramming through another ideologically driven justice to the Supreme Court instead of helping the people in our country suffering during this pandemic. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I have some letters of opposition to Judge Barrett's nomination to enter into the record. These are letters from Lambda Legal, the JapaneseAmerican Citizens League, and the National Asian Pacific American Wik--Women's Forum which was joined by 55 reproductive justice groups. I ask unanimous consent to enter these letters into the record. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>HIRONO: Judge Barrett, Chief Justice John Roberts has recognized that and I quote him, ""The judicial branch is not immune"" end quote from the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault and has taken steps to address this issue within the judiciary. As part of my responsibility as a member of this committee and indeed all of the committees on which I sit to ensure the fitness of nominees for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench or to any of the other positions for any of the committees on which they appear. </p><p>I ask each nominee these two questions and I will ask them of you. Since you became a legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? </p><p>BARRETT: No, Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct? </p><p>BARRETT: No, senator. </p><p>HIRONO: Judge Barrett, do you think it is appropriate for justices to consider real world impacts in their decision making as Justice Ginsburg noted in a number of his dissents? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, the doctrine of stare decisis is a good example of that because the factor reliance interests takes into account the real world impact, the way that people have ordered their affairs and relied on decisions. So there are contexts, yes, in which considering the impact is expressly part of the doctrine. </p><p>HIRONO: So you would say then that--you've been listening to all of us here yesterday as well as today talk about the real world impact of the striking down of the Affordable Care Act. And would all of those impacts be factors that would be important for you to consider should you be a Justice? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, to be clear I have the utmost empathy the stories--you know--that you have told including the story of Veronica's family are very moving. If I were a Justice the commitment that I would make to you and all people affected by the laws is that I would follow the law as you enacted it and I have no agenda. I would not be coming in with any agenda. I would do equal justice under the law for all and not try to thwart or--or disrupt in any way the policy choices that you and your colleagues have adopted. </p><p>HIRONO: So are you saying that the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the millions of people who rely upon it--that those who you would deem to be con--policy considerations that we should address? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I think that you choose the law and you've structured the Affordable Care Act. It's a complex, long statute. I think you set the policy. And then I think when a court has to interpret the statute or decide how it applies in a certain circumstance the court looks tradit--traditional legal materials--looks to the briefs. It listens to the real-world impact on the litigants who are before the court arguing the case. Because every case affects real litigants. Every case affects real people. </p><p>I said in my opening statement yesterday that--you know--when you pass statutes they're often named for the co-sponsors of the bill. But cases decided by all courts are typically named after the parties. They affect real people. </p><p>HIRONO: Judge Barrett, so are you saying that all of the stories that we brought forth yesterday and the millions of people who are relying on the Affordable Care Act can rely upon you that the--those impacts would be considered by you? That you would consider those to be legal arguments that you would consider? Because when you say that you are going to make a decision based on the law the real live stories that we've been talking about you would consider those to be part of the law? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Hirono, every case that becomes before a court because as I was saying earlier no case comes before a court unless it involves real live people who've had a real live dispute. And it is the job of a judge deciding every case to take into account the real word--real world consequences of the parties before it. </p><p>HIRONO: So does that mean that you would agree with Justice Ginsburg that the court should be taking into consideration the real life effect of the decisions that they make? Because she wrote a number of de--dissents saying that the majority did not consider the real world impacts of their decisions. So are you aligning yourself with Justice Ginsburg in terms of what you would consider real life impacts and they--effect it would have on your decision regarding the law? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, I don't know what context this--the particular context in which Justice Ginsburg was describing that. I think what I'm trying to align myself with is the law and that I will take into account all factors including real world impacts when the law makes them relevant. As it clearly does, for example, in the doctrine of stare decisis. </p><p>HIRONO: I'll get to your views of precedent in a moment. I'll give you a real life example of a--a--Justice Ginsburg. In Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Lilly Ledbetter worked at a Goodyear plant for 19 years as an area manager, a position held mostly by men. Lilly was paid less than all of her male counterparts. When she eventually realized this stark inequality she sued for pay discrimination and a jury agreed. </p><p>But the Supreme Court kicked Lilly's claim out of the Court for being too late. The conservative majority, including your mentor Justice Scalia, interpreted Title VII's 180-day limit--time limit to mean that Lilly had to have filed her claim within 180 days of when her salary was decided instead of accepting the commonsense approach of viewing her paychecks as an ongoing part of pay discrimination. </p><p>Justice Ginsburg strongly disagreed with her conservative colleagues' approach to the case. In her dissent she pointed out the many challenges women face in discovering pay disparities including how many </p><p>[*]HIRONO: companies keep salaries confidential. In a stinging review she said quote, the Court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination, end quote. In another case, in 2018, in Epic Systems, Corp. v. Lewis, employees who have been illegally underpaid joined together to see--to seek back pay in court. To block this effort their employers forced them to sign an arbitration agreement prohibiting collective actions--they actually had to sign these arbitration agreements in order to even have a job, keep their job. </p><p>So the Supreme Court's conservative majority including Justice Scalia sided with the company. They interpreted a general federal arbitration law to override two worker-protection laws instead of recognizing that the worker protection laws fall sensibly within the exceptions in the arbitration law. Meaning that the worker protection's laws should prevail. </p><p>Again, Justice Ginsberg strongly disagreed with the majority's approach to the case. In her dissent she pointed out that blocking joint lawsuits would deter most workers from seeking individuals unpaid--individual unpaid wage claims because of the cost of lawsuits and fear or retaliation. She warned the majority's decision would result in hurting vulnerable low-wage workers. Now those are the kinds of real-life impacts. The reality of women who are not paid the same as their male counterparts because of sex discrimination happening that she has no way of finding out about or of workers who are forced to sign an arbitration clause that overrides worker protection other worker protection laws. Those are the kind of real-world impacts. </p><p>So do you think Justice Ginsberg was wrong to consider real-world impacts in her decision making? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, both the case you know, you're talking about Lilly Ledbetter, both that case and Epic Systems are precedents of the Court and as I've said a number of times during the hearing I can't really comment or grade thumbs up or thumbs down as Justice Kagan would put it, prior precedence or say how I would have decided them. </p><p>HIRONO: They are, Judge Barrett, they are precedence of the Court that do not take into consideration the real-world factors at play here. And in fact, in the case of Epic Systems, the Court sided with the corporation as opposed to the workers who are trying to remedy a wrong. And in Lilly Ledbetter, she was totally out in the cold. So again, the Court did not--so they established precedent all right but it was a precedent that was not based on real-life impacts. So much as you sit here telling me that you would follow the law after all the law for example, the Affordable Care Act, that law embodies a policy that says we want as many people as possible to be covered under insurance and if the Affordable Care Act is struck down that policy, that law would be struck down. </p><p>So I know that there was some discussion about some distinction that you make about policy versus the law and I find that distinction to be a fiction because every law or most laws we pass are supposed to have real-world impacts--otherwise why should we pass a law? So the fact that you are not able to--I think it's pretty clear, let me rephrase that. You do consider Justice Scalia to be your mentor. That your judicial philosophy is in alignment with him and I think we all acknowledge that Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsberg were--were at pretty much opposite ends of the spectrum. </p><p>So since Justice Ginsberg made it a policy her approach was to look at the real-world impact, Justice Scalia's was not. So I'd say that when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, the real-world policy considerations that will not be taken into consideration by the conservative judge--judges would mean that 23 million people could lose their healthcare. That 123 million Americans with preexisting conditions could lose critical protections for their healthcare and more than 7 million Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 would probably be added to the group of people with preexisting conditions and millions of Americans would once again face lifetime limits on coverage for essential services. </p><p>That 8.7 million women would lose coverage for critical maternity care services and we know that black and native women are two to three times more likely to die than white women from pregnancy-related cases that Americans could lose coverage for essential health benefits like prescription drugs and mental health care, that young adults would no longer be able to stay on their parents health insurance plan until age 26 at a time when our country is dealing with massive job losses. </p><p>So in my view there--you have posed an artificial dis--distinction between policy considerations that left up to us and following the law because if your criticism of Justice Roberts' decision in upholding the Affordable Care Act, if that was something that he followed he would have struck down the Affordable Care Act. That is--that is your--if he followed your criticism of him in sustaining the Affordable Care Act, he would have struck it down. </p><p>So I would conclude that your approach is, in fact, not like that of Justice Ginsberg who did care about what would happen. Let me just tell you one story of a person who will be impacted in the real world if the Affordable Care Act is struck down. </p><p>And I know so many of my colleagues have already established that the president expects you to strike down the Affordable Care Act and you've already established that you've made no such commitments but clearly that is why this whole process is occurring so that you can be sitting on that court in time to hear the Affordable Care Act by the Supreme Court on November 10th. So one of the people who will be impacted is Elizabeth from Texas. She moved to Texas for a job and thought that she would have a stable income and healthcare coverage and all that changed when her hours decreased and she lost her health insurance. </p><p>Because she couldn't afford health insurance she couldn't get proper treatment for her asthma. She had to resort to using friend's expired inhalers and over-the-counter remedies that ACA allowed her to get health insurance again. The ACA also protect people with preexisting conditions like Jordan who I talked about yesterday and she has a very rare illness would require 500,000 per year just for her medication. And were it not for the Affordable Care Act she wouldn't be able to afford it I mean who can afford 500,000 a year to keep her going? </p><p>And also people like Kimberly--I talked about her yesterday. The ACA enabled her to get a mammogram which she wouldn't have been ale to get and that mammogram revealed that she had breast cancer and she got a mastectomy. So this--the real-life impacts on people like Elizabeth, Jordan and Kimberly where you say you will follow the law--it really leaves me wondering whether all of these real-life impacts are what you would call within the scope of a law that you would decide should you be confirmed. November 10th, you hear the case you will be deciding on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>And, by the way you noted that the issue in the Affordable Care Act was one of what was it that you said? </p><p>BARRETT: Severability. </p><p>HIRONO: Severability. But the other issue in the Affordable Care Act is the entire constitutionality of the law. Because the district court the issue was whether the district court in Texas was correct in deeming the entire law unconstitutional. So in fact, we are facing the entire law falling by the wayside. </p><p>Let me move on. So you've been also asked a lot of questions about whether or not you would overturn Roe v. Wade. Clearly, President Trump expects that you would do so because as he said, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on the Court that will happen meaning the--the reversal of Roe v. Wade will happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the Court. </p><p>And a number of us have mentioned as senator-- as far as Senator Hawley is concerned where he said I will only vote for those Supreme Court nominees who have explicitly acknowledged that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. And there is a whole quote I have from him but after you were nominated Senator Hawley made clear that you passed his litmus test. And he said, ""I think her record is awfully clear. I think that's one where she meets my standard of having evidence in the record."" And by the way, he had noted that he had expected this evidence in the record not from your post-nomination assurances to him. </p><p>So all your prior record he said you met his standards so we--we usually expect justices to uphold and apply longstanding precedent. So was the president wrong in concluding that you would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, again, I can't make any statements, no hints, forecasts, or previews as Justice Ginsberg put it about any case or any precedent. But I will (INAUDIBLE) to be neutral. So in saying that I couldn't opine on whether Obergefell was rightly decided or not. I was certainly not indicating disagreement with it. The point of not answering was to simply say I--it's inappropriate for me to say a response. And the second point was to say that I certainly didn't mean and--you know--would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community. So if I did I greatly apologize for that. I simply meant to be referring to Obergefell's holding with--with respect to same-sex marriage. </p><p>ERNST: Thank you for that. I appreciate the clarification and it goes back to the discussion that you had with Senator Sasse on the black robes. When you put that robe on you are neutral. Correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>ERNST: Yes. Thank you. So, I did want to go back because of the issue of Coronavirus has come up yet once again in the committee room. And I just wanted to--to make a point and clarify that the Senate GOP did bring up a relief bill a number of weeks ago. And in that bill there was a--a $300 boost in weekly unemployment insurance benefits. There was a--a second pass at Paycheck Protection Program for our small businesses. There was additional--$105 billion for K through 12 schools and colleges with new scholarship programs and $15 billion to help working parents find accessible childcare options. </p><p>There were supports for farmers and ranchers impacted by the pandemic. There was $31 billion for development and distribution of vaccines, drugs, and other medical supplies. $16 billion for testing and contract--contact tracing. There was loan forgiveness for the postal service. Liability protections for our schools and healthcare providers. And an expanded charitable deduction for contributions made during this pandemic. And many, many other things. It--it was a very, very good bill. It was what we could agree upon. </p><p>But I would note that Senate Democrats did block those provisions that would have gone to help families like Veronica and others in Iowa that are suffering from the pandemic and our--of course our greatest sympathies to those that have been impacted all across the United States. </p><p>So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the record there's three letters here for the commettee--committee and an op ed. A letter of support from 48 Christian women scholars, the second is a letter from a group of governors all across the country including our own Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds strongly supporting the nomination of Judge Barrett. The third is a record letter for--from Tracy Lovett who was with Judge Barrett while they both served on the SCOTUS clerk class of 1998. And then there's also an editorial by Derek Muller, a professor of law at the University of Iowa College of Law that appeared in the Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. </p><p>And this Professor had Judge Barrett as his evidence professor at Notre Dame Law School. And he does say she treated all law students from all backgrounds with dignity and respect. If I could have those entered into the record please. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>ERNST: Thank you. And Judge Barrett, I am pro-life. I am pro-life. And I see that judged by your faith and as has been aptly pointed out many times over by our colleagues across the aisle that--that you are pro-life. But once again can we reiterate your stance as a judge? </p><p>BARRETT: So as a judge my personal moral beliefs--which I have not that I can think of I--I am not expressing them publicly right now because now that I am a judge I can't sign statements like that one that I did 15 years ago. But my policy views, my moral convictions, my religious beliefs do not bear on how I decide cases. Nor should they. It would be--you know--an--it would be in conflict with my judicial oath. </p><p>ERNST: And I--I know that you consider yourself to be an originalist as you discussed earlier with Senator Sasse. And it seems that adhering to the original--originalist view would naturally lead a judge to carry out her constitutional duty of impartiality when applying the law. And adhering to this philosophy as a judge takes real courage. And the courage you have displayed thus far as a federal judge prompted a coalition of groups to send me a letter supporting your nomination. </p><p>Susan B. Anthony List lead this coalition letter that I would like to submit to the committee for the record. And I know this is going to make a number of members on the committee just very squeamish because they are a pro-life organization. But with this in mind I want to take a moment to read part of this letter. </p><p>Quote, ""Judge Barrett has proven herself to handle disputes impartially, approaching cases as a textualist and originalist who loves the Constitution. She is a jurist who rightly leaves politics to politicians and legislating to legislators."" And I'll quote further, ""Quite apart from whatever policy views she may have on the matter, Judge Barrett reasons to a proper result in each case before her. As a federal appellate judge appropriately following controlling precedent, in February 2019 she joined a panel decision upholding a law creating a buffer zone around abortion facilities."" </p><p>This buffer- or bubble-zone case being referred to is Price v. City of Chicago. Judge Barrett could you please give us an overview of the city ordinance that was challenged here and explain how precedent established by the Supreme Court's held decision influenced your reasoning of the case? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. I was on a panel. There was a challenge to a bubble-zone ordinance which essentially means--it--it was--how to describe it. It limited where abortion protestors could go to do sidewalk counseling or leafleting were the things that they identified as the--the activities they desired to undertake in the expression of speech outside of the abortion clinic. </p><p>The Supreme Court has a case called Hill v. Colorado and that case said that such bubble zones especially because this one in Chicago was nearly identical as I recall with the one that was at stake in Hill--said that they did not violate the first amendment. And so our panel--you know--at--we're bound by that precedent. Our panel applied that precedent. </p><p>And so as you say, that was a case involving abortion but my duty as a judge was to follow the governing law and that governing law in that case was Hill. </p><p>ERNST: Absolutely. And thank you for that clarification. And I think it was important to point that out because in that case using precedent it did favor that abortion clinic. Is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. That is correct. </p><p>ERNST: Thank you very much. So I would like to submit this for the record. Thank you. Now turning to a topic of agency rule making. Really sexy topic. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Something that we have--not something that we have talked about as of yet. But as I mentioned yesterday when Congress makes laws that overstep the Constitution it can be felt all across the state of Iowa whether it's in the streets of Council Bluffs, Iowa or in the farm fields over in Clinton County. But Congress isn't the only body capable of overstep. Executive agencies can be just as guilty as the--of this as we've seen in Iowa. </p><p>In 2018 as a judge on the seventh circuit you helped decide a Clean Water Act case, specifically Orchard Hill Building Co. v. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision found that the federal government did not provide enough evidence to justify its decision to deem 13 acres of Illinois wetlands as a water of the U.S.I'm very supportive of a less expansive definition of WOTUS and am encouraged by how you approached this decision. </p><p>Farmers in Iowa are also encouraged by this development. I believed then as I do now that the Obama Administration's Clean Water rule--or the WOTUS rule--was unconstitutional. But I also want to talk to you about agency rule making that I believe was constitutional, which is illustrated in a--a case that the tenth circuit court has recently ruled on. Specifically, Renewable Fuels Association v. EPA. At issue in this case were three exemptions the EPA granted to oil companies allowing them to avoid their obligations to </p><p>[*]ERNST: lend renewable fuel under the Clear Air Act's Renewable Fuels Standard. These oil-refinery exemptions which were not disclosed to the public were challenged by renewable fuel producers who said that they only found out about the waivers because of investigative news reports. The Tenth Circuit concluded in this case that the renewable fuels producers were insured by the EPA's exemptions and thus had standing to sue. The court also found that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in granting those petitions because the agency may only extend previously existing waivers. </p><p>In the case of these three refiners, there was nothing to extend because they had let their exemptions lapse. In other words, the three refineries had not received continuously-extended exemptions in the years preceding their petitions as required by the statute. However, in the wake of this Tenth Circuit decision, small refineries flooded the EPA with 67 petitions for retroactive waivers, some dating back as far as 2011, in an attempt to go back in time and establish a chain of continuously extended exemptions. </p><p>These oil companies have also appealed to the Tenth Circuit decision to or the Tenth Circuit decision to the Supreme Court. So while I'm not going to ask you to speak on all of this and what is going on, the--the problem here, bottom line, is that the EPA wasn't following the law. They took the law that Congress passed, they twisted it, and interpreted it for the benefit of oil producers, and that harmed our Iowa farmers. I know, again, you can't speak on how you would rule--rule on these cases, especially those that could be pending before the Supreme Court, but tell me, how do agencies--how should they interpret the laws that are passed by Congress? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think that the courts rule and reviewing the lawfulness of agency action, it's largely governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the way that agencies can do their business, and--and outlines what their authority can be. There's also a doctrine called ""Chevron"" which is named after a case. And many times, if we're talking about a Chevron issue, we're talking about an issue of statutory interpretation, and it sounds like that's mostly what you're thinking of--. </p><p>ERNST: --Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p><p>BARRETT: And an agency--you know, when a court reviews whether an agency has exceeded its lawful authority, it goes to the statute and you and Congress enact, and interprets that statute, it looks at the text, and tries to whether you've given--given the agency, given the EPA, in your example, leeway to adopt policies. And that leeway would be present if you had ambiguity in the statute that left the decision to the agency. But if the agency goes farther than the text of the statute permits, then it is the rule of a court to say that that action, you know, was in conflict with the statute, and therefore illegal. </p><p>ERNST: And what happens then if there is an actual question on the intent of the law? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, a statute in this context, in the context of a Chevron-type challenge to agencies--an agency's interpretation of it, you would interpret the statute in the same way that you would interpret any other statute. So as I was talking with Senator Sasse about earlier, my own approach to it would be contextualism. And so, in my approach to language, the intent of the statute is best expressed through the words, so looking at what the words would communicate to a skilled user of the language. </p><p>ERNST: Very good. Well, I appreciate it. We do have a little bit of time remaining, so, again, I just want to thank you, and I want to thank your family very much for lending their support to you through this process, it can be a bit grueling. But I do have to say, though, your temperament throughout the entire hearing has been truly commendable. So, thank you so much. I look forward to working with you further. And with that, Mr. Chair, I will reserve my time. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Ernst. Judge, are you okay to do two more? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>GRAHAM: So, Senator Booker, Senator Crapo, then we'll take a 20-minute or so break to grab a bite to eat and finish up. Senator Booker. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Your Honor. </p><p>BARRETT: Hi, senator. </p><p>BOOKER: So I spoke yesterday, and I appreciate the attention which you gave me, talking about how this is not a normal time, and I want to reiterate that one more time as cogently as I can, because this is something like we've just never seen before in the history of the United States. We're not just days away from Election Day, but people are actually voting right now. Close to a million people in my state have already voted, and about 10 million people have voted nationally. The only other time a Supreme Court nomination hearing happened this close to an election was--as you probably know, was under President Lincoln, who declined to offer a nomination before the election, but we are in the midst of an ongoing election right now, at a very contentious time in our democracy. </p><p>It's probably not normal also because people are already speaking in this election, and it seems like we are rushing through this process, when many of my colleagues on this committee said just four years ago, that we should not proceed to fill a vacancy that opened 269 days before an election. In the words of some of my colleagues, including the chairman, was to use our words against it, we would not do exactly what we're doing right now. </p><p>It's also not normal, clearly, because we're in the middle of a pandemic. And we have tens of thousands of new COVID infections every single day, widespread food insecurity. Like we haven't seen these kind of food lines in my lifetime, I don't think. People across our country are struggling, and unfortunately we see that we are right now not dealing with this crisis. We are instead, literally having closed the Senate virtually, and the only proceedings that are being allowed to go forward are not the issues of helping people who are struggling, but dealing with this. </p><p>And it's not normal that we have a president who has repeatedly attacked the legitimacy of our institutions, so much so--and I've never seen something like this in my lifetime, that his former cabinet members, his former chief of staff, all talk about the danger he represents to the country we all love. In fact, probably one of the most respected person on both sides of the aisle, General Mattis, who served as our Secretary of Defense, went as far as to say, a man who has been very reserved in his comments, that Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy. </p><p>We are at a time that the legitimacy of our institutions are at stake. And it's not normal that the president would further cast a shadow over your nomination as well as the independence of the court by saying he would only nominate justices who would tear down Roe v. Wade, who would overturn ACA. And it's not normal, amidst this all--and again, something that I find hard to believe that we're talking about, is that we have a president who cannot commit himself to the peaceful transfer of power. Now, in the light of this abnormality, most Americans think we should wait on your nomination. It's an illegitimate process; most Americans think that we should wait. </p><p>Today--and I appreciate you not following the news, but 90 of your fellow faculty members from Notre Dame wrote an open letter, calling on you, for the sake of our democracy--they didn't speak to whether you're right or left, or your judicial philosophy or qualifications. They wrote an impassioned letter, for the sake of our democracy, they publicly issued a statement asking that your nomination--that you pull yourself--withdrawal from this nomination process and have it be halted until after the November election. This is not normal. And again, the overwhelming majority of Americans want to wait, but my colleagues here are not listening. </p><p>And so, I am going to ask you some questions, that if you had told me five years ago, that would be questions asked at a Supreme Court nomination hearing, I would've thought they wouldn't be possible. But unfortunately, I think they're necessary to ask you, and I hope that you'll give me direct answers. The first one, you've already spoken towards issues of racism and how you deplore it, but I want to just ask you very simply--and I imagine you'll give me a very short resolute answer, but you condemn white supremacy, correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you. I'm glad to see that you said that. I wish our president would say that so resolutely, unequivocally as well. But we are at a time that Americans are literally fearful because their president cannot do that in the resolute manner in which you did. I'm--I'm sorry that that question had to be even asked, at this time. Here's another one. Do you believe that every president should make a commitment, unequivocally and resolutely, to the peaceful transfer of power? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, senator, that seems to me to be pulling me in a little bit into this question of whether the president has said that he would not peacefully leave office. And so, to the extent that this is a political controversy right now, as a judge, I want to stay out of it, and I don't want to express a view on-- </p><p>BOOKER: --So--so judge, I appreciate what you've said about respecting our Founding Fathers, about the originalism. It's remarkable that we're at a place right now that this is becoming a question and a topic--but I'm asking you, in light of our Founding Fathers, in light of our traditions, in light that everyone that serves in that office has sworn an oath where they quote, swear to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States--I'm just asking you, should a president commit themselves like our--our Founding Fathers I think had a clear intention like the grace that George Washington showed to the peaceful transfer of power--is that something that presidents should be able to do? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, one of the beauties of America from the beginning of the republic is that we have had peaceful transfers of power and that disappointed voters have accepted the new leaders that come into office and that's not true in every country. And I think it is part of the genius of our constitution and the good faith and goodwill of the American people that we haven't had the situations that have arisen in so many other countries where there have been--where those issues have been present. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you, Your Honor. Do you think that the president has the power to pardon himself for any past or future crimes he have may--he may have committed against the United States of America? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, that would be a legal question. That would be a constitutional question and so in keeping with my obligation not to give hints, previews or forecasts of how I'd resolve the cast that's not one that I would answer. </p><p>BOOKER: Well, I think I agree with you that it is an issue right now. Something I never thought would be an issue before but it is an issue that our president may intend to pardon himself for future crimes or past crimes. </p><p>If a president is personally responsible for seven hund--several hundred million dollars in debt while he's in office potentially to foreign entities do you think he has the responsibility to disclose who his lenders are? Especially given the emoluments clause. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, there's litigation against the emoluments clause. I think it was in the  Fourth Circuit, I don't know where it stands but that clearly is an issue that's being litigated and--and one present in court is not one in which I can offer an opinion. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you. I think it's disturbing that we're having this conversation. I think it's disturbing that we have a president that has brought what should be settled in the minds of most Americans presidents should reveal what their debts are--especially if they are to foreign nations. A president should not be able to pardon themselves for future crimes. Presidents should condemn white supremacy. Presidents should commit themselves to the peaceful transfer of power. </p><p>Judge Barrett you've--you've seen a lot of my colleagues and I put up pictures of people in this room and stories we've told and I've appreciated the way you've listened. It's not a stretch to understand why a lot of Americans are afraid right now. All we have to do is look at the statements and actions of my Republican colleagues, the Republican Party platform, and the president who nominated you. </p><p>And even some of your own words, which have been read by my previous colleagues around the Affordable Air--Care--Care Act, President Trump, who nominated you for this vacancy has not only explicitly stated that the Supreme Court should overturn the Affordable Care Act, but he promised that he would nominate a judge who would, quote, do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee, John Roberts, on Obamacare. </p><p>President has tried to this legislatively, he's tried to do it administratively. He has failed time and time again but he's promised over and over again to tear down the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, all of my Republican colleagues on this committee except for one has voted to overturn the Affordable Care Act because House and Senate Republicans have tried to do it 70 times. The one Republican who did not was an Attorney General who joined 20 state Attorney Generals who sued to overturn the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>You, yourself said, and now I will quote you, that Justice Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausing--plausible meaning to save the statute. The same Chief Justice Roberts Trump implied, didn't do the right thing. And so, Judge Barrett you have said that if you are on the Court you will hear and consider the arguments from both sides. I was actually very interested when you said that you would put your family members in the shoes of litigants on both sides. Given all that you've heard said over and over again about the intentions to tear away the Affordable Care Act and the Affordable Care Act, given what you've heard about the people who rely on it--given the commitment you know that President Trump said explicitly to only appoint judges who would overturn the ACA, is it unreasonable for people to fear putting yourself in the shoes of people--is it unreasonable for the people who have been up here in their pictures is it unreasonable for them to fear the ACA would be overt      urned if you are confirmed to the Court? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, I want to stress to you, Senator Booker, as I've stressed to some of your colleagues today that I am my own person. I'm independent under Article III and I don't take orders from the executive branch or the legislative branch. </p><p>BOOKER: I understand that. Can I restate my question because I don't think you're understanding it I'm just asking you as an act of empathy--can you understand the fears that are exhibited by the people we put up? The two people I put up, Michele and Merit, I don't know what their political party is. I don't know if they're going to vote for me I'm on the ballot. I don't know--I just know they're people that wanted their voices to be heard because they are afraid right now. And what your nomination represents. All I'm asking is can you empathize with that? Can you understand that? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I can certainly empathize with people who are struggling. I can empathize with people who lack healthcare. You know, one of the things that was so striking to me when we went to get our daughter Vivian form the orphanage in Haiti was the lack of access to basic things like antibiotics and it just made me appreciate the fact that we had access to healthcare. So I can certainly empathize with all of that. And with respect to the ACA you know, should I be confirmed and--and as I've said I would consider the issue of recusal of threshold question of law in whether to hear that case--but should I be confirmed and should I sit and hear the case as I assured you I would consider all the arguments on both sides. And one of the important issues int hat case is whether even if the mandate has become unconstitutional since it was zeroed out--whether it would be consistent with the will of Congress for the whole Act to fall--it's a statutory question not a constitutional one. </p><p>Or whether the man date could be severed out and the rest of the act stand. So the task of every justice who hears this case would be to look at the structure of the statute and look at its text to determine whether it was the will of Congress when they passed the ACA-- </p><p>BOOKER: And Judge, I apologize especially after the good behavior that was noted that we shouldn't be talking over each other my time is-- </p><p>BARRETT: No, that's OK Senator. </p><p>BOOKER: My time is--is running quickly. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>BOOKER: I guess I just as a guy who looks at justices I was just asking you to express that you understand the fear that's in America right now because you heard story after story of people who don't' know if they are going to be able to afford their healthcare. Who don't know if they will be denied their insurance coverage? And I'm going to move on because of the short time. but I was just asking you can you understand the fear given the president that has said they will put a justice on there that will tear down the Affordable Care Act, thus taking away healthcare for millions of Americans--there is fear in our country right now. </p><p>But I want to move now to earlier what Senator Durbin and you had discussed they asked about your view on racism and the role of courts in assess--in addressing racial justice. I was troubled that you said that racial justice and equality--and I'll quote you, were how to tackle the issue of making it better those things are policy questions. I think that that's, quote, how to tackle the issue or of making it better the racial injustice those things are policy question and not for the court. </p><p>The federal government's own data and this is I think you and I referenced this in our private conversation which I appreciate--you--you said you were familiar with a lot of the data bout discrimination in our criminal justice system. For example, the U.S. Census Commission shows that prosecutors this is U.S. Census Commission, said the prosecutors are more likely to charge black defendants with offenses that carry harsh mandatory minimum sentences than similarly situated whites. Are you familiar with that the U.S. Census Commission? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm not familiar with that particular-- </p><p>BOOKER: Does that surprise you? </p><p>BARRETT: I--I mean I don't know, Senator Booker that seems an odd thing for me to express an opinion on. As--as you-- </p><p>BOOKER: I'm not asking you. These are facts. These are just facts. </p><p>BARRETT: As you and I I'm not familiar with that study. As you and I discussed, I am aware that there is evidence and that there have been studies of systemic racism or implicit bias in the justice systems. So I am aware of that issue. I--I was not aware-- </p><p>BOOKER: You are aware of evidence that there is implicit racial bias? </p><p>BARRETT: I am aware that there have been studies showing that implicit bias is present in many contexts including in the criminal justice system. </p><p>BOOKER: OK. I'm just going to read some of these other statistics cause I think they are really important and this is independent data form the U.S. Censusing Commission that black defendants again, are compared with similarly situated white defendants who are subject to three strike sentencing. Enhancement at a significant higher rate which on average added 10 years to sentences. You're not familiar with that study? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm not familiar with that study. </p><p>BOOKER: Do--do such cases come before the Seventh Circuit? </p><p>BARRETT: The--the three strikes cases? </p><p>BOOKER: Yes </p><p>BARRETT: Are you talking about the three strikes--the Prison Litigation Reform Act cases where they're struck out, or are you talking about-- </p><p>BOOKER: --I'm asking cases in the criminal justice system that relate to racial bias. Do they come before the court? </p><p>BARRETT: So, certainly we have discrimination cases. Certainly there are 1983 cases. There are Title VII cases. </p><p>BOOKER: I would imagine so. And--and it--and--and in those--in your research for those cases, you familiarize yourself with a lot of the data on the discrimination within the system. </p><p>BARRETT: That--you know, we familiarize ourselves with the arguments the parties make and the information that they put in the record. And in some cases, I have had a parties submit--or its submitted in the district court, technically, and then made part of the record. But-- </p><p>BOOKER: --And--and so, I just want to be clear. You believe that there is in fact implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senate-- </p><p>BOOKER: --It's just a yes or no question. Do you believe in fact that there is implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, it would be hard to imagine, in a system--a criminal justice system as big as ours, not having any implicit bias in it. </p><p>BOOKER: So, is that a yes? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, yes, I think that in our large criminal justice system it would be inconceivable that there wasn't some implicit bias. </p><p>BOOKER: Okay. Over the last two years, about 121 of President Trump's judicial nominees to the federal court have said unequivocally that there is implicit racial bias within the justice system quite clearly. </p><p>I'd like to turn to what--a--a--an opinion you wrote last year about race discrimination, Smith versus Illinois Department of Transportation. The case involved in African-American traffic control officer who had been fired from the Illinois Department of Transportation. This employee claimed that he had been subjected to hostile work environment, and that the supervisor called him the N-word. </p><p>But you ruled that the employee had failed to make the case that he had been fired in retaliation for his complaints about race discrimination. And now you acknowledged that, quote, and I'm--I'm--you--and I'm going to quote you now. ""The N-word is an egregious racial epithet."" But you went on to insist that the employee couldn't ""win simply by proving that the N-word was uttered at them,"" and that he failed to show that this--that his supervisor's use of the N-word against him ""altered the conditions of his employment and created a hostile or abusive working environment."" </p><p>And you said that even based on his own subjective experience, this black employee had ""no evidence that his supervisors were lashing out at him because he was black."" I'm very surprised to--to have to make this point at all, but even a staunch conservative like Justice Kavanaugh, and my questioning of him, spoke to the obvious harm here in a way that you don't seem to. He wrote in a Court of Appeals case that ""being called the N-word by a supervisor suffices by itself to establish a racially hostile work environment."" You disagreed with that. </p><p>Why do you believe that the law recognizes the harm that is inflicted on a black person in this country when they are called that word by their work supervisor, but anyone really, for that matter, and the--and all the history dredged up in that word, centuries of harm, why--why do you believe differently than Justice Kavanaugh? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, that opinion does not take a position different than Justice Kavanaugh. It expressly wrote--was written very carefully to leave open the possibility that one use of that word would be sufficient to make out a hostile work environment claim. </p><p>The problem was that, in that case, the evidence that the plaintiff had relied on to establish the hostile work environment involved other--you know, he was driving the wrong way down a ramp and then expletives were used, not the N-word. And the N-word was used after his termination had already begun, and he didn't argue under clear Supreme Court precedent. I didn't make up the objective subject development. Under clear Supreme Court precedent, both are required, and he didn't say that it altered the terms of--that's not how he pled or made his case. And it was a unanimous panel decision. </p><p>BOOKER: And forgive me if I'm reading your--this case wrong, but you are saying to me he was not claiming that he had a hostile work environment, and-- </p><p>BARRETT: --He-- </p><p>BOOKER: --And that--and that it isn't the fact pattern that this supervisor called him the N-word. And--and--and that does not constitute a hostile work environment in the way that Justice Kavanaugh said clearly that it does. </p><p>BARRETT: No, Senator, I think you're mischaracterizing what I said, with all respect. In that opinion, the evidence that he introduced to show the hostile work environment was the use of expletives when he drove the wrong way down. He was--he was hired to be a safety driver for the Illinois Department of Transportation, and he based his hostile work environment claim on the use of expletives at him based on poor work performance. </p><p>That was when he relied upon, and then his termination proceedings had begun. He didn't tie the use of the N-word into the evidence that he introduced for his hostile work environment claim. And so, as a panel, we were constrained to decide based on the case the plaintiff had presented before us. So, the panel very carefully wrote the opinion to make clear that it was possible for one use of the N-word to be enough to establish a hostile work environment claim if overplayed that way. </p><p>BOOKER: I'm going to turn to the AutoZone case you discussed earlier was Senator Feinstein. The initial panel of three judges that examine the case ruled against Kevin Stuckey. You were not a part of that initial panel, but you did have an opportunity to vote on whether to hear the case before the entire court. </p><p>You had an opportunity to confirm the bedrock principle in--in--enshrined in Brown versus Board of Education about separate but equal, really to say that separate is inherently unequal, but you voted no, you didn't think the full-court needed to examine this deliberate segregation of employees by race. But the judges on the court disagreed with you. In fact, three judges explained we know that ""deliberate racial segregation, by its very nature, has an inverse effect on the people subjected to it."" </p><p>On--one of the essential teachings of--of Brown versus Board of Education, which I know you're familiar with, is a--is that idea of separate being inherently unequal. What--why did you think that the separate but equal facilities were lawful, or why didn't you see this as a practice that was--were there--worthy of closer scrutiny? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, as I said earlier to senator--Senator Feinstein, I did not make a merits decision on that case and I wasn't on the initial panel. The calculation of whether to take a case en banc is different than a merits determination. So, I wasn't reaching any decision about whether Title VII applied to that situation or not. </p><p>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, I think it's 35, that governs en banc proceedings, set out standards. In this case didn't create an intra-circuit conflict or an intra-circuit conflict. And so, I didn't think it met the Federal Rule of--all my vote means is that I didn't feel like it satisfied the elevated high standard for en banc review, not that I thought it was correct. There's a lot of deference to panels in my court. </p><p>BOOKER: Right. But, I mean, three judges disagreed with you. These were judges appointed by Republican and Democrat presidents. They saw the case about separate but equal really compelling. They thought the issue deserve closer scrutiny. And you had an opportunity to rejoin them, but you didn't. </p><p>You referred earlier to the problem of implicit racial bias in our system for this idea that, despite the color of your skin, people can get a hearing, people can get justice. In this denial, it seems to me that you disagree with the--the prioritization, at least, of your three colleagues. </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, eight of my colleagues chose not to en banc. And the en banc process is a different one than the merits decision making process. To decide that case on the merits and know whether I would come out the same way, I would have had to participate in it and read the briefs and hear the arguments. And I think-- </p><p>BOOKER: --And so, the three justices were wrong, then you disagree with your colleagues. </p><p>BARRETT: The three judges who dissented, my three colleagues my respect very much, thought that it met the standard for en banc review. That's a different question than in the merits. And so, I did disagree with them about whether to take it en banc. So, I was within the group of eight colleagues that decided that maybe that would be an issue we could take up in the future, but not to disturb the panel decision then. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you. </p><p>BARRETT: And that's not a merits determination. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you, your honor. Thank you. Moving quickly, Judge Barrett, five years ago the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples to marry. This was the Obergefell case, which has been discussed today. The court declared the Constitution grants LGBTQ Americans equal dignity in the eyes of the law. </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of couples have built their lives on this decision. I've married some of them myself. On that day five years ago, the court fulfilled really that ideal of equal justice under law. And yet now that same-sex marriage is legal, we've seen efforts to try to undermine that decision. Justice Ginsburg wrote about legal rules that would ""create two kinds of marriage, full marriage and skimmed-milk marriage."" </p><p>I firmly believe that our laws should allow discrimination against people on the basis of who they are. I have a number of questions on this topic if I can get through them, but I wanted to offer you a--a further opportunity to address the issue that I don't think you got to fully address that my colleague brought up. When you did use the term ""sexual preference"" earlier today rather than sexual orientation, is there a difference and what is it? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I really, then using that word, did not mean to imply that I think that--you know, that it's a matter--not a matter of--that it's not an immutable characteristic or that it's solely a matter of preference. I honestly did not mean any offense or to make any statement by that. </p><p>BOOKER: But by what you just said, you understand about that immutable characteristic. In other words, that </p><p>[*]BOOKER: --that wants--sexuality is not a preference it is who they are. Is that what you're saying? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, I'm saying I was not trying to make any comment on it. I fully respect all the rights of the LGBT community. Obergefell is an important precedent of the court. I reject any kind of discrimination on any sort of basis. </p><p>BOOKER: So you--you do say Obergefell's decision. But what about your two colleagues--excuse me. Forgive me. What about Alito and Thomas who have said that the Court has created a problem that only it can fix. They--they clearly don't see that as a precedent worth following. So you--you said Obergefell is a precedent. </p><p>BARRETT: I said Obergefell--of course, Obergefell is an im--is a precedent. It is an important precedent. As you pointed out there are reliance interests now in Obergefell. As to why Justices Alito and Thomas have called for its overruling in--in the--the recent opinion that they issued I can't really speak to what they're thinking-- </p><p>BOOKER: --They call it a problem. Do you know what they're referring to? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, I--I don't know what Justices Thomas and Alito were thinking. That you'd have to ask them. </p><p>BOOKER: So we're now seeing cases where gay and lesbian Americans are being denied equal access to social security survivors' benefits. One same-sex couple in Arizona was together for 43 years, got married, but one of them died six months later and now the serat--surviving spouse is being denied benefits because they weren't married long enough to--after 43 years together in love. </p><p>Does this violate the cou--the rule of equal treatment that the Supreme Court has laid down? </p><p>BARRETT: Well in Obergefell? Could you repeat the--the facts of this? </p><p>BOOKER: They were--they were--they were together for 43 years. The law changed and allowed them to marry. They married. One died soon after. And they're being denied survivor benefits because they weren't married long enough because the law wrongfully denied them that equality. </p><p>BARRETT: So that would be a legal question that would have to come up and be decided in the context of a real case. I mean--it's plain that Obergefell recognizes the full right of same-sex couples to marry but the question of what are the implications of that for benefits would be something that would come up with the--before a court later so-- </p><p>BOOKER: --So--but there are some precedents so maybe I can ask a different question-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Sure. </p><p>BOOKER: Can a hairdresser refuse to serve an interracial couple's wedding because they disapprove of racial--interracial marriages? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Loving v. Virginia follows directly from Brown and it makes unconstitutional any attempt to prohibit or frit--forbid interracial marriage. </p><p>BOOKER: Could they refuse to serve a black couple's wedding? </p><p>BARRETT: Could a baker or a florist refuse to--Title VII prohibits any sort of discrimination on the basis of race by places of public accommodation. </p><p>BOOKER: How--how about an interfaith wedding? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator, I feel like you're taking me down a road of hypotheticals that is going to get me into trouble here because as you know I can't opine on how cases would be resolved and I've said that whether they're easy questions or hard questions. I can't do that. </p><p>BOOKER: So I'm not the lawyer that you are but you seem to honor the precedents that are enough to protect discrimination against African Americans, interracial couples, but you stop on saying that unequivocally about people stopping on religious discrimination or the--against a Muslim couple's wedding or interfaith wedding-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Well, senator, I think--you know--what Title VII says as I'm sure you know is Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, on the basis of sex. I--I--all I can do is say refer to the statute. But of course as to whether there would be evidence to show or whether any particular encounter between a customer and a florist or a baker violated Title VII that would be a case that would have to come up--you know--as I discussed with Senator Sasse with real litigants, litigated on a full record. So I--you're asking a series of hypotheticals. </p><p>BOOKER: And then--so I'm assuming that you will not respond or--or for the same reasons you've uttered before you will not respond about whether a florist can refuse to serve a same-sex couple. </p><p>BARRETT: Well I--it sounds like you're on your way to talking about Masterpiece Cake Shop and some of the cases that are very hotly contested and winding their way through the courts. And so I want to make sure that I'm not in a position where I'm eliciting any views that would bear on litigation that's very active. </p><p>BOOKER: Well the--and I--and I guess you maybe can understand if we go back to the--the question that both I and--and Senator Hirono asked you about what--what you said you--you didn't mean to offend about whether it's a choice or not. These are about are they immutable characteristics of an individual like their race. I just want to just close by saying the--the story of some folks in my home community of New Jersey, Emily Sonnessa and Jan Moore. </p><p>They've been together for 51 years. They've raised three children. At last count--and I think that that's a good way of putting it--they have 18 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. You know how families are. </p><p>BARRETT: Mm-hm. </p><p>BOOKER: But for a long time they had to keep their relationship and their love a secret. Finally, one same-sex marriage when--once same-sex marriage became legal they got married. And thanks to the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell they can now enjoy their full rights. Judge Barrett, you're asking the United States Senate to agree to have you replace Justice Ginsburg which would tilt the balance of the court further to the right. </p><p>Remember that it was Justice Ginsburg who warned against full marriage for some couples and skim milk marriage for others. Like so many couples in my state of New Jersey and around the country Emily Jan are worried about what might happen if the Supreme Court starts to peel back some of their hard-fought rights. They believe that their love should be valued by their government and equally as the love of any other people. </p><p>And they believe a lot of the rights that they now enjoy which were denied in the past to African Americans even, to interracial couples--they believe that they should be able to preserve them. And so I--my time's expired. You've been very generous in the--as has the chairman in allowing me to go over. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to talk with you more tomorrow. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Booker. </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you very much. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Crapo. And we'll take a--a break for supper next. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And we're four away from--from the finish today. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Before I begin I do have a couple of letters I'd like to submit for the record, one from the Speaker of the Idaho House, Scott Bedke, in support of Judge Barrett's nomination and the other from the National Shooting Sports Foundation also in support of the nomination, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And Judge Barrett, I am going to--well I'll get to some new material but a lot of what I do at the beginning will be going over things you've already said and you must think you'd said them way too mu--had to say them way too many times. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I'm gonna just be sure that we get some things nailed down once more. Before I do that though there's been a lot said today that really needs to be responded to. This won't be a question to you, these first two. I'm just gonna quickly respond to a couple of them. </p><p>The first was one of my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse, spent a very long presentation trying to make the case that there is a lot of dark money out there trying to control the Supreme Court nominations and this whole process and--and the situation that we face today. I just want to set the record's right--these are actually--records straight. These are actually some statistics that Senator Cruz quickly when through when he spoke. </p><p>But yeah, there is dark money in politics and I think that we should get it out. What this means is that money that where you don't know who the real donors are behind the entity that's making the spe--expenditure. Fortunately we're getting a lot of that out but there's still a lot there. The impression though that was left was that this dark money's all on one side. The reality is if you look at opensecrets.org that this data's from 2016 but I've seen data even later into 2018. And it's--it's the same kind of statistics. </p><p>And that is that really the--the significant majority of the dark money is being spent in favor of the Democratic side rather than the Republican side. Of the top 20 organizations and individuals that they identified who contribute to Super PACs who then utilize the money in the way that was talked about 14 of them give exclusively to Democrats. Of the top 10 on that list only two give to Republicans. </p><p>So--and the totals by the way were $422 million in this report going to Democrats and $189 million going to Republicans. So yeah, there is money in the system which we can't identi--a lot of this money by the way is going into ads against you, Judge Barrett. But we can't--we can't get it all out yet. I think we ought to get it out. But let's not try to create the impression that this is just some one-sided circumstance that's happening in the country. </p><p>The other thing I want to go over first before I get into my questions is the same thing I went over yesterday. Because the allegations have been made again and again and again that somehow we are rushing this case and somehow we are violating the history and the precedent of the way the Senate operates and the way the presidency operates when there is a vacancy in an election year. </p><p>Some people count these things differently. There are--there's the statistic that I will use that will count all presi--all vacancies that have happened whether the vacancy occurred in the election year or whether it just didn't get resolved until the election year. And--but it doesn't matter whether you just take the ones that arose in the election year or if you take all of them that were resolved in the election year. The precedent is the same, it's overwhelming. In every single case, the sitting president made a nomination. Every case. In those cases, in which the Senate was of the same party as the president--I'm going to use the one for all of the nominations that actually were dealt with in an election year, there were 29, 19 of them were when the party was the same as the president. 17 of those 19, the party moved ahead with the president's nomination, and the nomination was confirmed. Ten of those times it was when the part was not the party of the president. In nine of those cases, the party th     at was not the party of the president declined to move forward until the next president was elected. </p><p>Now, that's the precedent of the Senate. That's what happened in 2016, when the Senate was of a different party than the president, and it's what's happening now, when the Senate is the party of the president. And those are the facts, and that's the precedent. In terms of the timing, I--I went through the timing of that as well. I think your hearing started, Judge Barrett, on the 16th day from the day you were nominated. There's a bunch of members of the Supreme Court whose nomination hearings started sooner than that, including Ruth Ginsburg--Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And so, the fact is that normal procedures, appropriate timing, and appropriate policy and precedent is being followed here as we move forward. </p><p>Now, having made those points, once again, I will--like I said, I will get into some new questions for you, but I'm going to go over a lot of things that you've already talked about, because I really think it's important that we just make it as clear as possible. You've talked about originalism and textualism, is there a difference between those two things? </p><p>BARRETT: They are the same basic approach, but we use originalism mostly to refer to interpreting the constitutional texts, and textualism we use to refer to interpreting statutory texts. But they both involve the same principle, which is that one comes to the law and interprets it as it would have been understood by those at the time of its--either its ratification in the case of the Constitution, or its enactment, in the case of a statute, and that the law remains the law until its lawfully changed through democratic processes. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, thank you. And I assume you would consider yourself both an originalist and a textualist? </p><p>BARRETT: I do, Senator Crapo. </p><p>CRAPO: And you've written quite a bit about precedent and stare decisis. Could you just, once again, tell us what that is? And maybe you could make a distinction between what it means at the appellate level and at the Supreme Court level. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So there are two kinds of stare decisis. There's horizontal stare decisis, which is, say, the Supreme Court's obligation to follow its own precedent, and then there's vertical stare decisis, which is my obligation right now on the Seventh Circuit to follow Supreme Court precedent, because it sits above me in the federal-judicial hierarchy. Precedent--for vertical precedent, there's no question. I mean, I can't buck what the Supreme Court does. It--it, you know, sets the precedent and all lower courts must follow it. </p><p>CRAPO: Right. </p><p>BARRETT: For horizontal precedent, for example, on my own court right now on the Seventh Circuit, the court that renders a precedent does have the ability to reconsider it under certain circumstances. Otherwise-- </p><p>CRAPO: --And-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Errors don't get fixed, and Plessy v. Ferguson would still be the law of the land. </p><p>CRAPO: So--and you will, I'm sure, tell me, what are those--what are the rules there, when you do horizontal reevaluation? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So when a court decides whether or not to overrule a precedent, it considers first of all, is it wrong, and how egregiously wrong is it? You know, that we can see in the Brown v. Board of Education decision, how that factor played. You also consider reliance interest, because as I said before, stare decisis is short for stand by the thing decided and don't disturb the calm, so courts don't recklessly get in the business of just stirring up--you know, disrupting people's lives, you know, unless it's--it's the other factors, council in favor of doing it. </p><p>You consider whether the law has developed since the precedent in a way that undercuts the foundations of the president--precedent itself, same for the facts. You also consider whether the precedent that you set has provided to be workable for the courts below you that must follow it. So, in my case on the Seventh Circuit, that would mean the district courts. Have we set out a--an articulation of the law and a case that lower courts can actually use? </p><p>CRAPO: And so, if I--to paraphrase here, if--if a judge in a horizontal situation, either a Supreme Court Justice evaluating Supreme Court precedent-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Mm-hmm--. </p><p>CRAPO: --Or a circuit court judge evaluating the circuit court's precedent. If they felt the precedent was wrong, that's not enough. </p><p>BARRETT: That is not enough. </p><p>CRAPO: And you have to have, then, the reliance and the other factors all falling into the right circumstance, before a decision to actually overrule or overturn a precedent is made? </p><p>BARRETT: That's true. And this might be a good time, Senator Crapo, for me to make one other point about horizontal stare decisis doctrine. Earlier--and I can't remember which interchange it was, someone was pointing out, you know, that I said stare decisis should have weaker effect in constitutional cases. That's actually what the Supreme Court has said. That's a well-established principle of stare decisis doctrine itself. </p><p>The Court has said that it gives super strong effect to precedent in statutory cases, because you all can always step in and fix any errors of statutory interpretation the Court might make. But the Court itself has expressly said that it gives weaker stare decisis effect in constitutional cases because the only way to remedy an error is by constitutional amendment. So I just want to be clear, that that is simply a restatement of the Court's own doctrine, that wasn't something I invented. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, appreciate that. And you also mentioned earlier that there are some, I think you said six super-precedents? </p><p>BARRETT: Let's see, I can't remember how many are on the list. But as I said, it's in constitutional law scholarship, there are some precedents that scholars have identified as utterly beyond question, that no serious person ever calls for their overruling. </p><p>CRAPO: Could you--I think Brown v. Board of Education would be one of those? </p><p>BARRETT: Marbury v. Madison, which establishes the power of judicial review. Let's see, the cases--probably easier for me to just identify what the precedents stand for. So the power of judicial review, the power of the Supreme Court to review judgements from state courts, the proposition that the 14th Amendment applies only to state action, the incorporation of the Fourth Amendment and by implication the other Bills of Right--Bill of Rights--other rights in the Bill of Rights against the states. So they're--they're mostly structural, kind of foundational principles, you know, and they're just so settled, no one seriously challenges them anymore--. </p><p>CRAPO: --Alright. Thank you. I--I appreciate that. I think that's very helpful. And in this hearing, you've been asked about at least three very significant Supreme Court precedents, and you've been asked whether you were asked to commit to overturn them, or whether you've even had conversations with the president or his staff about them. One--and I just want you to, again, give your answer on that, because I want this to be very clear. Roe v. Wade, have you had any. conversations with the president or with the White House staff, White House counsel, anyone, and have you made any commitments about how you would rule on any case dealing with that? </p><p>BARRETT: I have not, Senator Crapo. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And the same set of questions with regard to Obergefell? </p><p>BARRETT: I've had no conversations with anyone in the White House staff about that case, my views of it, how I would rule. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, and then finally, the current case, California v. Texas? </p><p>BARRETT: No conversations at all. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, thank you. Now you also earlier testified that there's a difference between judicial decision-making and the process of making a judicial decision versus say the process you would make as a professor when writing an article or what have you. Could you just quickly get into that with me? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So a professor, when writing law review articles or doing academic critique, is kind of a 10,000-foot level. You know, you're not in the trenches like a judge is, because you are not deciding it in the context of a real case with real litigants in front of you, the adversarial process, where you have people on either side, where you hear arguments and you consult with your colleagues and you write your opinion. And I think one thing that's worth pointing out about the judicial process is that I have had the experience of changing my mind at various points along the way. I've gone into oral argument more than once thinking, you know, I was going to rule one way, and then oral arguments changed my mind, or I've-- </p><p>CRAPO: --Mm-hmm--. </p><p>BARRETT: --Gone into conference, and my colleagues have changed my mind. I've even changed my mind, and this is not uncommon on the court, once I started writing an opinion. Judges say, ""It won't write,"" you know, which means what you thought was right when you starting writing it, you realize actually didn't really work out. So, I think that process and the fact that judges keep an open mind all the way through is evidence of how the judicial process really is unique in our system, and it's a different enterprise than academic critique. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. I--I've been able to observe that a little bit. I clerked on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. </p><p>CRAPO: And so I've been able to observe that exact process in each of those steps that you talked about taking place. And--and you're right that's how it happens when it's done properly. </p><p>Next, I want to go one--one more specific kind of process type thing to make sure we all understand it right and that's the recusal. Interestingly, you've been asked by my colleagues on the other side to assure that you have made no commitments about case law but that to give a commitment on recusal you have said that there is a process for recusal as well and that you would follow that. Could you please lay that out again once again for us? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. Recusal is a question of law because 28 USC 455 the recusal statute actually obligates a judge to recuse in certain cases of either actual bias or apparent bias and there are Supreme Court precedents interpreting the range of a judge's obligations under that statute. There are also professional conduct committees to consult and I think collaboration and consultation as I've said before with other justices is the typical practice according to Justice Ginsberg's description of it. </p><p>So it is a legal question that's governed by statue and precedent so it's not one I can make an advanced resolution of. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Thank you. Now I want to move to frankly, back to CaliforniaTexas--yeah, California v. Texas. And the preexisting conditions issue that has been raised by a number of my colleagues here. We've heard a lot about the Affordable Care Act yesterday and today. I serve on the Finance Committee as well as the Judiciary Committee and so this is an issue I really care about a lot. I'm' passionate about ensuring all individuals, especially Idahoans, have affordable, quality, healthcare coverage and making sure that they have coverage for their preexisting conditions is especially important regardless of what one thinks about the Obamacare legislation. Reasonable people can disagree about the totality of the success of Obamacare. </p><p>And this is something that I think should be remembered but many of the policies in Obamacare were policies on which we had agreement between Republicans and Democrats as we moved forward at that time trying to craft a healthcare law. People may recall this was being negotiated in the finance committee for quite a while before President Obama pulled it back and pulled his own statute out. And one of the things that we had agreement on was protecting preexisting conditions back then. There was no fight over that. </p><p>And, in fact, I think every single U.S. senator wants to protect access to coverage for patients with preexisting conditions Republicans and Democrats. So here we are now talking about the Obamacare legislation that was pushed through the Senate when there was a Senate and a president of the same party and the ability to avoid a filibuster. And we are now looking at legislation challenging one part of that. Again, you've talked about this but I'd like you to set up this next question. There's a difference between NFIB v. Sebelius the case which you have made some commentary on and Texas v. California. Could you tell me the difference? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. NFIB v. Sebelius involves whether the mandate violated the con--it was farmed initially as a case about whether the mandate violated the congress clause. And the majority in that case as I've discussed in earlier interchanges interpreted the mandate provision to be a tax rather than a penalty. And Chief Justice Roberts said that he thought it was justified as an exercise of Congress' taxing power but would have been invalid under the commerce laws. </p><p>Now, the new case that the Supreme Court is poised to hear involves a different question, if the mandate which has now been zeroed out the initial question does resemble NFIB v. Sebelius. The initial question is is something a tax if it is zero dollars? So is it still a tax and if it's not a tax can it be justified under Congress' taxing power. But severability, even assuming that it is no longer a tax because it's zeroed out. The next question is if that provision is unconstitutional does just that provision become inactive so to speak or does the whole statue fall and that is the question of severability. </p><p>So in some respect whether one thought that the mandate was unconstitutional or not the act would have to be found--that would have to be inseverable for it to fall. </p><p>CRAPO: And haven't--you may not know the answer to this but I--I believe that in the last session of the Supreme Court seven members of the Court said that there is a very strong presumption against--in favor of severability rather than knocking down an entire statute. </p><p>BARRETT: That is true. It is an established doctrine and it was reiterated even last term. </p><p>CRAPO: So did you participate in a moot court case on this last month or in the last near future? </p><p>BARRETT: I did so-- </p><p>CRAPO: Could you tell us what a moot court case is? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So William and Mary Law School has every year what it calls its Supreme Court preview and it includes a moot court case. There's a long tradition of moot court exercises at law schools you know, sometimes they're called mock trials. Sometimes they're called moot courts, that's when they're appellate. And it's a chance to educate the community around the law school, the students or in the case of this William and Mary program it also draws in people from around Williamsburg so they can see how the judicial process works, so-- </p><p>CRAPO: And judges often participate in moot courts, right? </p><p>BARRETT: Judges often participate in moot courts and in this particular one there were maybe comprising the panel the--the conference involves several other events. But this moot court involved a panel it was supposed to be a mock argument for this case and they were about four judges, a couple law professors and some journalists who were on the panel with advocates flushing out the case so that we did it by zoom because of the pandemic--but so students could see how the process might look. </p><p>CRAPO: And so what--what did the court the moot court decide? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I do want to preface this Senator Crapo, by saying it was an educational exercise. </p><p>CRAPO: I understand. </p><p>BARRETT: So it was made very clear to the audience both at the outset and then in the deliberation room and then outside that this didn't--it was not designed to reflect the actual views of any of the participants and nor could it because this was show up, you're not reading the briefs, diving deep down and you know, a lot of times people change their votes in the deliberation room just for het sake of mixing it up and making it interesting. </p><p>CRAPO: I understand. Now, I appreciate you making that clear. </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, I just want to make clear the context. The vote was in the--the panel the majority said that the mandate was now a penalty and was unconstitutional but severable. I think there was also a group in a minority who said there was no standing. To be honest, now I can't remember maybe--maybe there was--I could be wrong about this and I feel like there was maybe another minority that said it wasn't unconstitutional. </p><p>CRAPO: And how did you vote? </p><p>BARRETT: I voted to say that it was unconstitutional but severable. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. So you voted in favor the--the one clue we might have as to your thoughts on the issue even though this was just an exercise and you didn't' have the whole case presented and--and I understand that. I'll just say to the viewers the one clue we have is you're really in this moot court case. And I think that's kind of an answer frankly to a lot of those who are raising this specter that you are going to try to take the whole Affordable Care Act away from everyone because of this very narrow case that is in front of the Supreme Court. </p><p>BARRETT: I do want to be very clear Senator Crapo, for the record that it wasn't designed to reflect my actual view. So to the extent that people think I might have been signaling to the president or anyone else what my views on the Affordable Care Act are you know, they couldn't have taken any signal from that certainly. But I wasn't trying to signal anything because it was a  mock exercise. </p><p>CRAPO: It was a mock case, it was a moot court. I understand that. Very much. </p><p>Let me just go into a couple of others--other issues here in fact, I can hit them very fast. Senator Ernst mentioned the Orchard Hill v. Army Corps of Engineers case on the waters of the United States. That is a bit deal in Idaho and frankly, in most of the western United States. Most of the entire United States. And I appreciated your--your ruling and I'm just going to tell you--I'm not going to ask you a question about it I appreciated your ruling. </p><p>I am going to ask you a question about the Chevron doctrine and this is one of those you may not be able to respond to but what would you tell me what the Chevron doctrine is? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So I got into this a little bit with Senator Ernst. The Chevron doctrine is a doctrine that when a statute is clear and that's end of case but if Congress passes a statute that is giving an agency authority or that's describing the boundaries of an agency's authority and there's ambiguity in that statue then the Court will treat that ambiguity as a delegation to the statute--a delegation to the agency to fill in the details. </p><p>CRAPO: Yeah. And--and I--I'll just tell you I disagree with that doctrine. I think that the courts ought to have the ability to interpret the statute. And if it's ambiguous, they should interpret it as best they can, and that the--the interpreter in our system should not be the agency that is enforcing the statute. I think the courts should oversee this. Now, that's just my opinion. So, the question that I've--you probably can't answer is what's your opinion? </p><p>BARRETT: You're right. I can't answer, Senator Crapo. </p><p>CRAPO: Okay. Well, thank you very much. </p><p>I--I just had another couple of quick questions. I was going to go into the Heller case. Well, I--I will ask you. Tell me what you--what do you believe the basic ruling of Heller is? </p><p>BARRETT: The basic ruling of Heller is that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms for self-defense. </p><p>CRAPO: So--so, if I were to--to characterize it as the--the Heller case reaffirmed that the right to bear arms as one of the rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to individuals. </p><p>BARRETT: That is what Heller held. </p><p>CRAPO: That's what Heller held. Okay. You know, I--I do have a number of additional questions which were just kind of softballs, but-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARRETT: --I like softballs, if I could pick. </p><p>CRAPO: Maybe you deserve softballs right now, but I think instead I'll give you the break and you can have-- </p><p>BARRETT: --I like that too, Senator Crapo-- </p><p>CRAPO: --You can have the last five minutes of my time or--or you'll get done five minutes sooner. Thank you very much-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>CRAPO: --For being willing to do this. You are an outstanding nominee, and I am very glad to be able to support you. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Crapo. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Crapo. With that goodwill in mind, we'll break and will come back, say, 6:50. That'll give us about 30 minutes to grab a bite and we'll start with Senator Harris when we get back. </p><p>[*](RECESS) </p><p>GRAHAM: Sorry I'm late. I owe you a minute; apologize. Senator Harris, is she available? Senator Harris, if you could--there you are. We see you. Can you say something? Can you hear me, senator? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes, I can. </p><p>GRAHAM: Okay, great. Okay. The floor is yours, Senator Harris. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to extend greetings to Judge Barrett, and I look forward to our conversation this evening. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, senator. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Before I begin, I--I want to just take a moment to talk directly to the American people about where we are and how we got here. </p><p>So, we are in the middle of a deadly pandemic that has hit our country harder than any other country in the world. More than 215,000 of our fellow Americans have died. And millions more, including the president, Republican members of this committee, and more than 100 front-line workers here at the Capitol complex, have been infected. </p><p>This pandemic has led to an historic economic crisis causing millions of workers to lose their jobs without warning, and 12 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance. The Senate, I strongly believe, must be a needs to be laser focused on you, the American people, to help you get through this pandemic. To do so, the Senate urgently needs to pass critical financial relief for those who are struggling because of this pandemic, and many are struggling. People need help. </p><p>They need help to pay their rent or mortgage. Parents need help putting food on the table. The millions of American workers who have lost their jobs need help making it through the end of the month. And small businesses need help so they don't have to close their doors for good. But sadly, Senate Republicans have rushed to hold this Supreme Court confirmation hearing rather than help those who are suffering through a public health crisis not of their making. </p><p>As I said yesterday, these priorities are not the American people's priorities. Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Senate Republicans' number one priority has been to tear down. And remember, before the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies held a virtually unchecked power over our healthcare system. </p><p>They could refuse to cover basic medical expenses like maternity care, like mammograms, like prescription drugs, or hospital stays. Worst of all, if you are sick, they could deny you coverage altogether and there was nothing you could do about it. Over the last nine years, Republicans in Congress have tried 70 times, 70 times to repeal or roll back the ACA in the United States Congress. </p><p>In 2013, Senate Republicans were so desperate to stop at success that they shut down the entire government for weeks. After President Trump was elected, Washington Republicans spent nearly a year trying to repay--repeal the ACA, but I will always remember the thousands of Americans from all over our country at all walks of life who credit into the halls of the United States Capitol to require that lawmakers see their faces and understand how they would be heard if there was a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>Brave activists in the disability community staged citizens on the Hill. Seniors protested to keep prescription drugs affordable. Mothers and fathers walk the halls with their children in strollers to show Congress the face of those who depended on the law. And doctors and nurses protested to protect their patients' access to the care they desperately need. </p><p>Together with many of my colleagues, I joined civil rights and community leaders to speak to the thousands of people who gathered outside the Capitol as they pleaded, as they begged with lawmakers to do the right thing, all of these dedicated Americans demanding that their voices be heard, and they made a difference. </p><p>They made a difference. History will remember that late-night thumbs down moment when the great, great John McCain denied Republicans the opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And now following a decade of failure, Washington Republicans have realized that the Affordable Care is working too well and helping too many people to repeal it without facing serious political consequences. </p><p>But what are they doing? After suffering the backlash they provoked by targeting the law in Congress, they decided instead to circumvent voters and try to strike down the Affordable Care Act through the courts. Right now the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are urging the Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act and all of its patient protections. </p><p>Republicans are scrambling to confirm this nominee as fast as possible because they need one more Trump judge on the bench before November 10th to win and strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. This is not hyperbole. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening. </p><p>And here's what you have to know. People are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of the pandemic. There are more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes, heart disease, who know that they could be denied coverage or charged more by insurance companies if Donald Trump is successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>And because of the coronavirus, more than 7 million people have now a pre-existing condition that they didn't have earlier this year. Those who depend on the ACA are afraid of their lives being turned upside down if the court strikes that down. They know what could happen. </p><p>And Judge Barrett, I will share with you and the American people a list; no protections for pre-existing conditions, higher costs for healthcare for women and people over the age of 50, young adults picked up their parents' insurance, more expensive prescription drugs for seniors, insurance companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity care, no free mammograms, cancer screenings, birth control, insurance companies reinstating annual and lifetime caps, and more than 20 million Americans losing insurance at the worst possible time, again in the midst of a pandemic, including nearly 2 million Texans, 607,000 North Carolinians, 288,000 South Carolinians, 227,000 Iowans, and 4.2 million Californians. </p><p>And the pain of losing these protections will disproportionately be felt among the 9 million African American, Latino, Asian, and Native Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But this isn't about statistics. This is about millions of real people living real lives who deserved their government and its institutions to see them and to heed their call. </p><p>And I know a Republican member of this committee said earlier today that the people who will lose healthcare are somehow not relevant to this hearing. I disagree. Helping these people is supposed to be why we are all here, why we all ran for office in the first place. And I'm here fie--for people like Felicia Perez, and this is her. </p><p>Felicia is a writer, a public speaker, and former high school teacher from Southern California who now teaches at the University of Nevada Reno. She has multiple pre-existing conditions, including arthritis, asthma, and a rare autoimmune disorder that cause tumors that have wrapped around her optic nerve and part of her brain. </p><p>Her life depends on periodic cancer fighting infusions that cost $160,000 a year. Felicia is terrified. She knows that without the Affordable Care Act she could not afford ongoing treatment, the </p><p>[*]HARRIS: treatment she needs to stay alive. And here's exactly what she said, and I will quote, ""My life is in the hands of people I do not know, who do not know me, who are essentially telling me I don't matter, that my life doesn't matter, that my health doesn't matter, that the day-to-day quality of my life doesn't matter, and that's really hard."" </p><p>Tragically, Felicia's story is not unique. Her fears are shared by millions of Americans. The Affordable Care Act and its protections hinge on this Supreme Court and the outcome of this hearing. </p><p>Before being elected, President Trump promised that every justice he put forward would, quote, will do the right thing, unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts, on Obamacare, unquote. Judge Barrett, 18 months later you criticized the Chief Justice for holding the Affordable Care Act when you concluded, quote, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. </p><p>My question is, how many months after you published that article did President Trump nominate you to be a judge on the Court of Appeals? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Harris, I apologize. I don't remember the timing of that article. I was nominated--I believe my nomination to the Court of Appeals was announced in May of 2017. </p><p>HARRIS: That's correct. </p><p>BARRETT: But I don't remember when the article came out. </p><p>HARRIS: The article was published in January of 2017, so that would've been five months later. Justice Ginsburg whose seat you are seeking to fill provided the critical fifth vote in a 5-4 decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. So let's lay this out for everyone who's watching. </p><p>As I have discussed previously, one, Republicans have spent a decade trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Two, Donald Trump promised to name a Supreme Court justice, and Supreme Court justices, who would tear down the Affordable Care Act. Three, President Trump is before the Supreme Court right now arguing that it be struck in its entirety. Four, the Supreme Court could be just one vote away from overturning the Affordable Care Act and all of its protections, including for everyone who has a pre-existing condition or may ever get a pre-existing condition. </p><p>In other words, the Affordable Care Act and all its protections hinge on this seat and the outcome of this hearing. And I believe it's very important that the American people understand the issues at stake and what's at play. </p><p>Judge Barrett, the day after President Trump announced your nomination to the Supreme Court, he tweeted, quote, ""Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court,"" end quote. But in reality, there is no alternative that protects the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act every day. The horrifying truth is that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are fighting to take healthcare away from the American people in the middle of a pandemic, as I have said. President Trump has said that he wants to protect the American people's healthcare, but the reality is right now, he is asking the Supreme Court to take it away, period. </p><p>Senator Klobuchar, Judge Barrett, asked you earlier today but did not receive an answer. Prior to your nomination, were you aware of President Trump's statements committing to nominate judges who will strike down the Affordable Care Act? And I'd appreciate a yes or no answer, please. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Harris, I want to be very, very careful. I'm under oath. As I'm sitting here, I don't recall seeing those statements, but if--let's see, I don't recall seeing or hearing those statements. But I don't really know what context they were in, so I guess I can't really definitively give you a yes or no answer. What I would like to say is I don't recall hearing about or seeing such statements. </p><p>HARRIS: Well, I imagine you were surrounded by a team of folks that helped prepare you for this nomination hearing. Did they-- </p><p>BARRETT: I have had--yes. </p><p>HARRIS: Let me finish, if you don't mind. </p><p>BARRETT: Oh, I'm so sorry. </p><p>HARRIS: Did they inform you of the president's statements and that this might be a question that was presented to you during the course of this hearing? </p><p>BARRETT: When I had my calls with senators, it came up. Many of--many of the Democratic senators wanted to know about the Affordable Care Act and to satisfy themselves that I had not made any pre-commitments to the president about it. </p><p>HARRIS: And so you then became aware of the president's statement; is that correct? </p><p>BARRETT: Let's see, Senator Harris, in the context of these conversations, I honestly can't remember whether senators framed the questions in the context of President Trump's comments. Perhaps so. I think, from my perspective, the most important thing is to say that I have never made a commitment. I've never been asked to make a commitment, and I hope that the committee would trust in my integrity not to even entertain such an idea. And that I wouldn't violate my oath if I were confirmed and heard that case. </p><p>HARRIS: So just so I'm clear, and then we can move on. Are you saying that you are now--before I said it--aware or not aware that President Trump made these comments about who he would nominate to the United States Supreme Court? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Harris, what I was saying, I thought you initially framed the question as whether I was aware before this nomination process began. And the answer to that question-- </p><p>HARRIS: And I'm now asking you if you are aware--were you aware before this hearing began, that he said that? </p><p>BARRETT: So you're changing-- you're asking me now whether I was aware before the hearing began? </p><p>HARRIS: As a follow-up question, I am, yes. </p><p>BARRETT: And what I said was that when I had my calls with Democratic senators, this question came up, and I don't recall but it may well have been that they referenced those comments in the course of those calls. Even if so, that wasn't something that I heard or saw directly by reading it myself. </p><p>HARRIS: Senator Leahy asked you earlier today, but I think it bears repeating, do you think it is important for the American people to believe that Supreme Court justices are independent and fair and impartial? And that is a yes or no answer, please. </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, Senator Harris. </p><p>HARRIS: A number of my colleagues have asked you today whether you would recuse yourself from cases on the Affordable Care Act. You did not directly answer their questions, and instead you described a process by which that would work or happen. And so my question is, isn't it true that at the end of that process, regardless of that process, that it would be you who ultimately would make the decision about whether or not you would recuse yourself? </p><p>BARRETT: That is true, and I can't have you elicit a commitment from me about how I would make that decision in advance. That would be wrong. </p><p>HARRIS: Right. And what I've asked you is that is it not correct that that is the process that ultimately it would be you, and you alone, that would make the decision about whether you would be recused. You've already opined on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, and that position satisfied the president's promise to only nominate judges who would tear down the Affordable Care Act. And Senate Republicans rushed this process so that you could rule on this very case. The reasonable question about your impartiality will undoubtedly hang over this court's ultimate decision in the Affordable Care Act case if you refuse to recuse yourself. I strongly believe that. </p><p>Supreme Court justices routinely consider the consequences of their decisions on people's lives. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled against President Trump in his effort to repeal DACA. protections for dreamers. Children, of course, who have arrived in the United States, many before they could talk or walk. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority that included the crucial vote of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. </p><p>The court rejected the Trump's administration's attempt to end protections for dreamers. Chief Justice Roberts said the administration had not taken into consideration the fact that many dreamers relied on those protections when they started their careers and businesses, when they served in the military of the United States, when they bought homes and when they started families. </p><p>Senator Hirono asked you whether it is appropriate for a Supreme Court justice to consider real-world impacts. But you're a sitting judge now. So my question is, in deciding whether to uphold government action, do you currently consider the consequences of your rulings on people's lives? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Harris, that's part of the decision of every case. </p><p>HARRIS: And so you do. </p><p>BARRETT: Every case has consequences in people's lives. So, of course, I do in every case. That's part of the judicial decision-making process. </p><p>HARRIS: And would you do that as--if you are actually voted on the United States Supreme Court? Would you do that there as well? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator, considering how the resolution of a dispute will affect parties, will affect people as part of the judicial decision-making process and I will continue engaging in that process to the best of my ability. </p><p>HARRIS: So if the Affordable Care Act is struck down more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions like heart disease, diabetes and cancer would pay more for insurance or be denied coverage entirely. More than 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage entirely including nearly 3 million black Americans and over 5 million Latino Americans received access to health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>Insurer--insurers will once again be able to discriminate against more than 50% of African Americans and nearly 40% of Latinos with preexisting conditions. Insurers will be able to deny coverage to more--more than one quarter of Native Americans with conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. All of this in the midst of a pandemic that is not going away any time soon. </p><p>A pandemic that when age is taken into account has been three times as deadly for black, Latino, pacific islander and native Americans. A pandemic that has killed approximately 1 in 1000 black Americans, 1 in 1200 native Americans and 1 in 1500 Latino Americans. Judge Barrett, would you consider the 135 million people who gained protections under the Affordable Care Act when deciding a case that challenges that law? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Harris, if I were to be confirmed and conclude that I was not that I was able to sit on the case pursuant to the recusal statute. And then, if I heard the case and decided the case I would consider all the protections that Congress put in place. And as I said earlier--earlier during this hearing the question would be figuring out whether Congress assuming that the mandate is unconstitutional now whether that consistent with your intent this is Congress' law would permit this act to stand or whether the flawed portion of it could just be excised out. And that is a question not of what judges want, it's not a question of the Supreme Court it's a question of what Congress wanted in the statute. And that is the statue you know that you enacted and extended this healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. </p><p>HARRIS: What weight would you give the fact that 135 million Americans with preexisting conditions are now depending on the protections of the Affordable Care Act, what weight would you give that? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Harris as I mentioned to Senator Hirono stare decisis takes reliance interests into account. Because as I've said before stare decisis is about keeping stability in the law. So the law often takes into account reliance interests. I can't really say sitting here how they would play in or weigh on this case because that's part of the legal calculus of the case. So I can't really give you the kind of commitment or precommitment that you're asking for me of how I would weigh factors or how I would structure my decision-making process. </p><p>HARRIS: I would ask you to consider if you're confirmed on the Court a credible benefit of the Affordable Care Act and that a--a destruction of its protections will have a devastating impact on millions hundreds of millions of Americans. </p><p>Judge Barrett, you testified yesterday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg opened the door for many women in law. And I certainly believe and know that to be true as a personal matter. She was a trailblazer for women's equality and gender equal--equity. As a law student, as a teacher, as a civil rights lawyer and as a second woman ever to sit on the United States Supreme Court Justice Ginsberg broke many barriers for women across the country. </p><p>We I believe all fondly remember her as--as a--as a person who had patience, she had the will and the vision to make our country a more equal place and a more just place. And one of the things she fought for was a woman's right to control her own body and to make decisions about her own body and healthcare and reproductive choices. The Constitution of the United States protects a woman's right to choose whether or when to become a parent. And it protects a woman's right to choose abortion. </p><p>Women of color, immigrant women, women with low incomes and women in rural areas face significant barriers when attempting to access birth control, cancer screenings and comprehensive reproductive healthcare. Moreover, anti-choice activists and politicians have been working for decades to pass laws and file lawsuits designed to overturn Roe and the precedence that followed. The threat to choice is real. </p><p>Just last year, the Court heard a case that gave it an opportunity to revisit and overturn its abortion precedent in a case called June Medical Services. The Supreme Court struck down a medically unnecessary restriction that would have closed all but one abortion clinic in Louisiana. Chief Justice Robert--Roberts agreed with the courts four liberal members that the court was bound by its own precedent to strike down the Louisiana because it was virtually identical to a Texas law that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016. </p><p>As a result, women in the state were able to receive the full range of reproductive care. But Chief Justice Roberts wrote his own separate opinion in the case to make clear that in the future he could not be counted on to uphold a woman's right to choose. </p><p>Justice Ginsberg provided the critical fifth vote to strike down the unconstitutional abortion restriction in June Medical Services. So we must be honest about the impact of her passing and the impact it will have on the court's decisions in cases regarding women's access to reproductive healthcare. </p><p>Now my Republican colleagues have said that there is a minimal chance that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. But back in January, 39 Republican senators including 10 members of this very committee signed their names so a Sup--a Supreme Court Brief that asked the court to quote, take up the issue of whether--whether Roe should be reconsidered and if appropriate overruled. So let's not make any mistake about it. Allowing President Trump to determine who fills the seat of Ruth Bader Ginsberg a champion for women's rights and a critical vote in so many decisions that have sustained the right to choose poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country. </p><p>After all, President Trump said that overturning Roe v. Wade will quote, happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting prolife justices on the court. Judge Barrett, several times today you have quoted Justice Ginsberg's testimony about not making predictions in future cases. However, she was far more forthcoming at her confirmation hearing about the essential rights of women. In 1993, Justice Ginsberg's confirmation hearing shows that she testified that quote, the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When government controls that decision for her she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. </p><p>Then, Judge Ginsberg went on to say, quote, ""It is essential to women's equality with man that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling. If you impose restraints that impeded her choice you are disadvantaging her because of her sex,"" unquote. </p><p>Now, Justice Ginsberg did not tell the committee how she would vote in any particular case. But she did freely discuss how she viewed a women's right to choose. But Judge Barrett, your record clearly shows you hold a different view. In 2006, you signed your name to an advertisement published in the South Bend Tribune that described Roe v. Wade as quote, ""An exercise of raw judicial power"" and called for putting quote, ""An end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade."" You signed a similar ad in 2013 that described Roe as quote, ""infamous"" and expressed opposition to abortion. Also, in 2013 you wrote an article about Supreme Court precedent in which you excluded Roe from a list of well-settled cases, that you said, ""No justice would overrule even if she disagrees,"" suggesting of course that you believe Roe is susceptible to being overturned. </p><p>On the 40th anniversary of Roe, you delivered a speech in which you said that the court's recognition of the right to choose was ""created through judicial fiat rather than grounded in the Constitution."" And during your tenure on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, you have been willing to reconsider abortion restrictions that other Republican-appointed judges found unconstitutional. </p><p>As the Senate considers filling the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was straightforward enough in her confirmation hearing to say that the right to choose is ""essential to women's equality,"" I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose and make her own health care decisions. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the following three documents be entered into the record: a letter opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP, statement opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a report opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you very much, Senator Harris. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I have a letter here in support of Judge Barrett signed by 281 graduates and former classmates of hers at the extraordinary St. Mary's Dominican High School in New Orleans, and I'd like to offer that into the record. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>KENNEDY: You tired, Judge? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm--I'm looking forward to the end of the hearing today, I must admit. </p><p>KENNEDY: Me too. I'm still going to ask you questions. </p><p>BARRETT: I was hoping you'd say you are going to yield your time, senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: No, ma'am. A lot of my colleagues and you as well have talked about the oath that you will take if you're confirmed and sworn in as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. What's in that oath? What's it say? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, that oath requires a judge, you know, taking the oath as a judge to do equal justice to all, you know, without fear, favor, you know, regardless of wealth, you know, to--to fairly apply the law, is what it boils down to, to not give preferential treatment for express biases in plain terms. </p><p>KENNEDY: It says you'll administer the law in an impartial manner without regard to your personal feelings, doesn't it? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, it does, senator. </p><p>KENNEDY: It's says you will support and defend the Constitution, doesn't it? </p><p>BARRETT: Um-hmm. </p><p>KENNEDY: A pretty serious oath, isn't it? </p><p>BARRETT: It is. </p><p>KENNEDY: Are you going to take that oath and affirm it if you're confirmed? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: You're not lying? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm not lying. I took that oath before I began as a judge on the Seventh Circuit, and I have not violated that oath. And I would take it again. And those are serious to me. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, now, Senator Harris just called you a liar. She said that if you take that oath, you'll be lying, that you've already made up your mind of how you're going to vote on some cases, particularly dealing with--with abortion and the Affordable Care Act. Let's just cut to the chase. She said you're a liar. Are you a liar? </p><p>BARRETT: I am not a liar, Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: All right. I want you to tell me again. Look me in the eye. You're in front of God and country. If you take that oath, will you mean it? </p><p>BARRETT: I will mean it. If I take that oath, I will mean it. </p><p>KENNEDY: You swear to God? </p><p>BARRETT: I swear to God. </p><p>KENNEDY: You'll-- </p><p>BARRETT: --And I have sworn at the Seventh Circuit, and I meant it there too. </p><p>KENNEDY: You'll never break that oath? </p><p>BARRETT: I will not break that oath. </p><p>KENNEDY: No matter what your personal feelings are? </p><p>BARRETT: No matter what my personal feeling-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --No matter what your religion is? </p><p>BARRETT: No matter what my religion is. </p><p>KENNEDY: So, when Senator Harris and her colleagues say your liar, they're wrong? </p><p>BARRETT: They are. </p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Let's see. You're 48 years old. You're an honors graduate of Rhodes College, an extraordinary liberal arts school. You're an honor--honors graduate of Notre Dame Law School. You clerked for two distinguished federal judges. You've been a chaired law professor. You've--you're a devout Christian. You've raised seven children. </p><p>I don't mean to wax too metaphysical here, but do you have personal values as a result of this? </p><p>BARRETT: I would hope that no one would consider me to be nominated for anything if I had no values. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you have personal opinions? </p><p>BARRETT: Of course I have personal opinions. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you have principles? </p><p>BARRETT: I have principles. It wouldn't be fit for office if I didn't. </p><p>KENNEDY: Let's suppose that we had a nominee appear before us. It happens to be a man in my hypothetical. And he said I've been nominated for a federal judgeship. And I finish law school, but I hadn't cracked a law book since law school since civil procedure. And I don't have any opinions. I don't have any principles. I don't read newspapers. I don't even read the news. I hadn't read a book since law school. </p><p>I'm like Bluto in Animal House. I'm just fat, drunk, and--and--and stupid. I think--I think the Germans were the ones who bombed Pearl Harbor. I think--I think climate change, I think--didn't it cause the Cold War? But I'm your guy because I don't have any values. I'm a blank slate. And that's what required--is required, isn't it, for me to be impartial? Do you think we ought to confirm that gentleman? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, then Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote an opinion on this issue and--addressing recusal. And he said basically that if someone reached middle years, which one is basically middle-aged if one would be a justice on the Supreme Court, and had a mind that was a blank slate and had no opinions, then one would question such a person's fitness for office. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, my colleagues seem to think you--you're only qualified if you're--if you're dumb, if you have a blank slate, you've never thought about the world. You've thought about the world, haven't you? </p><p>BARRETT: I indeed have. </p><p>KENNEDY: Have you thought about a--social problems facing our world? </p><p>BARRETT: I have thought about social problems facing our world. </p><p>KENNEDY: Economic problems? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>KENNEDY: I--I don't want to know what--what your feelings are, but have you thought about the merits and--or lack thereof of nuclear energy? </p><p>BARRETT: No, I really haven't (INAUDIBLE) that one. </p><p>KENNEDY: How about affirmative action? Have you thought about that as--just as a subject? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>KENNEDY: You have? </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, I've thought about it. </p><p>KENNEDY: How about climate change? You mentioned climate change. Have you read about that? </p><p>BARRETT: I read about climate change. </p><p>KENNEDY: And you have some opinions on climate change that you've thought about? </p><p>BARRETT: You know, I'm certainly not a scientist. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm not saying you are. </p><p>BARRETT: I mean, I--I've read things about quiet--climate change. I would not say that I have firm views on it. </p><p>KENNEDY: How--how about have you thought about the merits of a flat versus progressive income tax? </p><p>BARRETT: I have thought fleetingly about that. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. </p><p>BARRETT: These aren't the things that I--you know, I'm not a tax lawyer or an economist. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm not trying to trump--trap you. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. </p><p>KENNEDY: How about Justice Kagan? I've always been impressed with her credentials; a graduate of Princeton, did an MPhil at Oxford. I think she went to Harvard Law, was dean of Harvard Law School. </p><p>BARRETT: Um-hmm. She was. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you think she's thought about the world? </p><p>BARRETT: I'm sure she has. And I too am very impressed with Justice Kagan. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, me too. You think she's thought about climate change and has personal feelings? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know. I mean, probably, but I can't really say what, you know, Justice Kagan has thought or not about. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Now, you have personal feelings about abortion, don't you? </p><p>BARRETT: I do have personal feelings about abortion. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you have personal feelings? Have you ever thought about how we deliver healthcare in this country? </p><p>BARRETT: I do. But Senator Kennedy, one of the things about the judicial role that I've repeatedly emphasized in the hearing today is that I've got personal views and personal feelings on a range of matters, just like every human does and just like every judge or justice on the court does. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, that's what I'm getting at. Now, my colleagues say and Senator Harris said that, even though you have a personal opinion about abortion, that you will violate your oath to put aside those personal feelings and fairly decide abortion cases. Is that true? </p><p>BARRETT: That, I gather, was the thrust of what she was saying to me, yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: Is she right? </p><p>BARRETT: No, she's not right. </p><p>KENNEDY: And let's talk about the Affordable Care Act. It's going--you know, California v. Texas. You've thought about the delivery of healthcare. </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: You got seven children. </p><p>BARRETT: Spent a lot of time-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --You've probably been to an emergency room-- </p><p>BARRETT: --(INAUDIBLE) healthcare. Yes. </p><p>[*]KENNEDY: You formed--you formed opinions about the delivery of healthcare. Are you going to--should you recuse yourself? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Kennedy, any opinions that I have-- everyone has opinions. Any opinions that I have are just not relevant to the resolution of the case. </p><p>KENNEDY: Right. </p><p>BARRETT: Affordable Care Act case or anything else. And a lot of my opinions, you know, are not ones that are expert. For example, in scientific matters or taxing matters. I mean, I might have dinner-table discussions, but I don't purport to be an expert in any of those fields. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I'm going to hit this one another lick now, because this is serious. </p><p>BARRETT: Okay. </p><p>KENNEDY: Some of my colleagues and Senator Harris say you're lying. Are you lying? </p><p>BARRETT: I am not lying. </p><p>KENNEDY: Are you going to take that oath and abide by it? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>KENNEDY: Will you ever break that oath? </p><p>BARRETT: I will not break that oath, Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Now, one of my colleagues--I don't remember which one--said that because President Trump appointed you, or nominated you rather, that if there's a case that happens to go before the United States Supreme Court after you are confirmed, dealing with the upcoming election, they ask you to recuse yourself. Remember that question? </p><p>BARRETT: Uh-huh. </p><p>KENNEDY: And you said you would go through the process. </p><p>BARRETT: Of determining the recusal question, yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: But you didn't commit to recusing yourself until you--in one way or the other. You said you'd go through the process. </p><p>BARRETT: I said I would go through the process. I committed to going through the process of determining whether to recuse. I did not commit to it (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KENNEDY: Now, President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court. </p><p>BARRETT: Uh-huh. </p><p>KENNEDY: Did anybody ask him to recuse himself when the president's tax returns were before the court? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know. </p><p>KENNEDY: Justice Gorsuch was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Did anybody ask him to recuse himself when President Trump's tax returns were before the Court? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know if any motions were filed. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you know who Paula Jones is? </p><p>BARRETT: I do. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. She sued a president of the United States, didn't she? </p><p>BARRETT: She sued President Clinton. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, Clinton v. Jones, famous case. President Clinton nominated Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer to the United States Supreme Court. They heard that case. Did anybody ask that Justice Ginsburg recuse herself because President Clinton nominated her? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't know if any motions were filed. </p><p>KENNEDY: Do you think she should have? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, that's not something I would opine on. I'm sure that she discharged her oath to consider the question. </p><p>KENNEDY: Did any of my colleagues ask that Justice Breyer recuse himself from hearing Clinton v. Jones because President Clinton had appointed him? </p><p>BARRETT: I don't think that's come up. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, I don't think so either. All right, I want to finish this housekeeping, because I want to talk about the law. I want to give you a chance to respond to something. Some butthead professor at Boston University says that because you and your husband have two children of color that you're a white colonist. The implication is that you're a racist, and that you use your two children as props. Do you use your children as props? </p><p>BARRETT: Senator Kennedy, it was the risk of people saying things like that which would be so hurtful to my family that when I told Senator Graham this morning that my husband and I had to really weigh the costs of this, it was saying deeply offensive and hurtful things, things that are not only hurtful to me but are hurtful to my children, who are my children who we love, and who we brought home and made part of our family. And accusations like that are cruel. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, they are, aren't they? How low can you go? I didn't want to ask that question when your kids were here. I'm sorry you have to go through that. </p><p>Okay, let's talk about the law. Let's suppose--I'm not going to ask you how you're going to rule on a case. </p><p>BARRETT: Okay. </p><p>KENNEDY: And you couldn't answer anyway. You'd violate the judicial canons of ethics. I don't know what would happen to you, but it would probably be pretty bad, because you're a sitting judge. You're on the Seventh Circuit. </p><p>BARRETT: I am a sitting judge. </p><p>KENNEDY: But let's suppose that a litigant, let's suppose Congress passed a statute making distinctions on the basis of wealth. </p><p>BARRETT: Okay. </p><p>KENNEDY: And somebody filed a lawsuit and said--their argument is that wealth is a suspect classification. How do you--how are you going to analyze a case like that? Tell me how you'd analyze it. I just want to know how you think. </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. Well, if someone argued that wealth was a suspect classification, I assume you're saying that they're probably making an equal protection claim. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yep. </p><p>BARRETT: So I would go to--precedent would be the first source, because the equal protection clause has a rich body of precedent under it that identifies suspect classes. For example, classes drawn on the basis of race are suspect, and they get heightened scrutiny. So I would look through Supreme Court precedent to determine whether there was anything relevant to the question of whether wealth was a suspect class or not. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. You're familiar with San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, I guess?</p><p>BARRETT: My mind's getting mushy this many hours into the hearing, so you might need to refresh my memory. </p><p>KENNEDY: I understand. Well, let me put it another way. Wealth is not a suspect classification, is it? </p><p>BARRETT: I am not aware of a case saying that wealth would be a suspect classification. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, here's what I don't understand. I've always wondered about this. Okay, this is--remember, this is Congress passing the statute, not some state. So the litigant is not pursuing this under the 14th Amendment. He's pursuing it under--or she--under the Fifth Amendment. And he's making a substantive--well, no, he's making an equal protection argument. Not substantive due process, that would be a fundamental right. </p><p>Where does the Fifth Amendment mention equal protection? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, the Fifth Amendment has a due process clause, but the Fifth Amendment doesn't-- </p><p>KENNEDY: I know. But the 14th Amendment has a due process clause and an equal protection clause, but the Fifth--which applies to the states. But the Fifth Amendment clause, Fifth Amendment to the Constitution has a due process clause, but it doesn't say a word about equal protection. </p><p>BARRETT: That's true, but the Supreme Court has interpreted it as applying the equal protection clause as well against (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>KENNEDY: How can they do that if the words aren't there? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, there was a case, I believe the case in which the court addressed this was the one that address the constitutionality of segregation in the District of Columbia, which is governed by federal law. And the court said the same principle applies. So essentially, the reasoning of Brown applied there. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, I remember that. All right, let's talk about--Senator Crapo talked about it a little bit. I went back and took a look at how Scalia wrote--you know this better than I do--Scalia wrote the majority opinion. I think Stevens wrote the leading dissent. And it was interesting they both took an originalist approach. And I went back and looked it up. Scalia relied on--and tell me what an originalist approach is again. I know there are different strains, but what's your strain? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. You take the Constitution--so in Heller, for example, what Justice Scalia did, and this is an example of originalism, he went back to the time of the ratification of the Second Amendment to figure out whether when people--when that amendment was ratified, whether that right to bear arms was considered to be an individual right or one that was a civic right. </p><p>KENNEDY: Excuse me for interrupting, but considered by whom? </p><p>BARRETT: Considered by the people. </p><p>KENNEDY: The people. </p><p>BARRETT: By the people at the time, not in the minds of the framers, but by the people. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. I went back and looked--I'm sorry. </p><p>BARRETT: No, no, no. </p><p>KENNEDY: I've had a little coffee. I'm kind of jacked up. I went back and looked it up. Scalia, he relied on to reach his opinion, he relied on founding-era dictionaries, founding-era treatises, English laws, American colonial laws, British and American historical documents, colonial-era state constitutions, post-enactment commentary, all on the Second Amendment. </p><p>And then here comes Justice Stevens; he's a dissenting. He relied on in his dissent, he relied on linguistic professors, an 18th-century treatise on synonymous words, on a different editor of one of the same colonial-era dictionaries on which Scalia relied. So they both went back and looked at history. </p><p>Here's my question. Since when did justices become historians? Let me put it another way. If this is the way we're going to interpret the Constitution by looking at history, why do we need you guys? Why don't we just hire professional historians? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, so justices and judges interpret laws, and we interpret texts. And if texts are unclear, you have to figure out what their meaning is, right? So with the Constitution sometimes that does require delving into history. One point that I think is worth Justice Scalia, would make this point that the alternative is let's say you have an amendment like the second amendment's right to bear arms--if it's not evident looking at it whether it's an individual right or a collective right for the sake of the militia--one approach would be to rely on the moral judgment of the judge of the justice to say whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing for the common good for people to have that individual right. And, of course, judges aren't moral philosophers either. So when you're interpreting a text and you need to turn to something what judges know is words and what judges know is law and so having them go back and look at the history those are familiar things to lawyers. And they are things that      all justices consider. </p><p>As I said earlier in the hearing all justices do consider the history and the original meaning and that's been true since the beginning of the Court itself throughout the 19th century this idea of originalism isn't new. So throughout the 19th century you know, throughout the 20th the Court has resorted back and looked to see what the original meaning is. It's just that I would say the difference between those who identify themselves as originalists and those who just consider it is the amount of weight that they give it. </p><p>So all judges have to be skilled in--in doing it to a degree because everyone agrees as a matter of law the original meaning matters. </p><p>KENNEDY: Tell me what the 9th Amendment means. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, the 9th Amendment was once famously described by Judge Bork as an ink blot. The 9th Amendment has not been flushed out in litigation. I don't think it's an ink blot just to be clear--but it's not one that--that there is a whole lot of case law on. </p><p>KENNEDY: I want to talk to you a little bit about originalism or at least your staring of originalism and how it's--how it's related to--to a textualism and how it's different from--from purposivism. Did I understand you correctly to say an originalist believes a judge has to follow the original public meaning of the Constitution? </p><p>BARRETT: Correct. </p><p>KENNEDY: The original public meaning. </p><p>BARRETT: Public meaning as distinguished from private intentions of those who drafted the document. </p><p>KENNEDY: Does this mean when you say original public meaning who's meaning? The average person in the community at that time? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, we would say informed observers. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm sorry? </p><p>BARRETT: I would say informed observers. Like so those who were familiar with the debates which is why looking at the state ratifying conventions debating the Constitution can be a fruitful source. </p><p>KENNEDY: Is it OK? I know it's not OK to--to do it exclusively but is it OK to consider what the drafters though? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. And you know, James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention are a source that the Court routinely looks to in trying to determine original meaning it's just that it's not conclusive. </p><p>KENNEDY: What's the dimension of time? At what point in time do you look at the original public meaning? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I would say there's some debate about that because you know, you won't necessarily have all the evidence you need right from 1791 which is when the Bill of Rights, you know, was ratified. You know, I think looking at the evidence from before that so we see that in Heller the Justice Scalia looked at how people understood that right all the time leading up to the ratification of the 2nd Amendment because it cast light on the language people were speaking at the time and how they would have understood it. </p><p>So you definitely can look some before. </p><p>KENNEDY: OK. Excuse me for interrupting. </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, sure. </p><p>KENNEDY: My clock is running. If you--if you look at 10 years after the Constitution was adopted is that OK? How about 20? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think it's I think all of that can be relevant evidence I think the farther that you get away from the ratification of the document then I think the dicier it gets because we might say that well between 1791 and you know, 1801 that people had roughly the same understanding. But, of course as time passes you know, then attitudes can change. So I wouldn't say that there's a firm cut off but I think it's clearly the case that the evidence that's closer to the time is the most probative. </p><p>KENNEDY: OK. What's the difference between originalism and textualism? </p><p>BARRETT: Well textualism is a how we describe a method of interpreting statutes. So it actually, in many respects is kind of like originalism applied to a statute. So it would say you take statutory text you know, you know for the Clean Water Act or you know, the make up one the--the Amy Barrett Act passed today you look at what the words would have meant to those who read the act at the time and informed observers of the--of the debate. </p><p>KENNEDY: So you're looking at the ordinary meaning of the words. </p><p>BARRETT: You're looking at the ordinary meaning of the words. </p><p>KENNEDY: The plain meaning of the words. </p><p>BARRETT: The plain meaning of the words. </p><p>KENNEDY: What if--what if they're unclear? </p><p>BARRETT: Well, there are a series of canons of interpretation that judges employ to decipher language. They are like linguistic tools like sometimes a list means the expression of some things, implies the exclusion of others. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm familiar with all those. You know better than I do. But--but if--if the statue is unclear if there is no ordinary meaning--meaning can you look at legislative history? </p><p>BARRETT: Generally, I think that legislative history is a less fruitful source because generally, when people make arguments about legislative history they tend to be less about what a word meant and how a statue would apply to a certain circumstance which is a little bit different. </p><p>KENNEDY: But if it's ambi--ambiguous you can look at legislative history as a last resort? </p><p>BARRETT: We can look at legislative history to determine whether there was a particular understanding of a word or a phrase. But I think it would be in most cases inadvisable to look at legislative history to make a determination certainly not to treat it as binding but how a statute would apply to a particular set of facts. </p><p>KENNEDY: How--how ambiguous a--a lot of text will say if it's--if it's--if the statue is ambiguous if it's unclear then I can consider secondary sources. How ambiguous does it have to be? 51 percent? 65 percent? How do you know how ambiguous? </p><p>BARRETT: It's not a precise--it's an art not a science I would say Senator Kennedy. You know, you exhaust all the canons of interpretation and that includes even ones that are not the grammatical canons but are like the avoidance canon. You run through all of those and then you look at the structure of the statue. And I mean, I think deciding when something crosses the threshold in becoming ambiguous so you can consider canons like the Rule of Brevity or the avoidance canon that that's a very difficult question and it's part of the debate about the Chevron doctrine. </p><p>KENNEDY: Are you familiar with the term ""purposivist""? </p><p>BARRETT: Yes. </p><p>KENNEDY: OK. I think--you correct me now--a purposivist says look I look at the statue even--even if it's clear I can still look at secondary sources and try to figure out what problem the legislative body was trying to solve. </p><p>BARRETT: That is so, yes. Purposivist would say that to be faithful to Congress would be to be faithful to the purpose of the statute and that sometimes the text doesn't align directly with the purpose and that in that circumstance the judge should go with the purpose rather than the text. </p><p>KENNEDY: Now everybody is a textualist now or an originalist but really aren't--aren't a lot of textualists really purposivists? In other words they go well, looked at the language of the statute, it's unclear. So I checked off the originalist or rather textualist box and now I can just go look at what problem congress was trying to decide and do whatever the hell I want to do? </p><p>BARRETT: There has been some academic commentary definitely in the last five or 10 years saying that that's become kind of the new strain of textualism. You might know the case, Holy Trinity. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. </p><p>BARRETT: Calling it the new-- </p><p>KENNEDY: It's been overruled though hasn't it? </p><p>BARRETT: Holy Trinity, you mean its approach to statutory interpretation and its endorsement? </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. </p><p>BARRETT: No. It's never been overruled. But it's fallen out of favor. But this idea of doing what you're saying stretching to find ambiguity in text the argument that some make is that it's kind of a new form of Holy Trinity because rather than saying that the text is clear but inconsistent with the purpose the argument is that the purpose renders the text unclear. </p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Let me ask you a couple of more. I want to talk about a state constitution. In Louisiana we had a--a constitutional convention in 1973, we wrote a new state constitution. And we recorded everything. We got I think 14 volumes of transcripts, committee reports, anything you could possibly want to know about the drafting of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution. You're an originalist. Are you telling me to just throw that stuff out? </p><p>BARRETT: No. Those things would be the equivalent of looking at James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention and state ratifying conventions. All those things to shed light on what Louisianans were thinking when that constitution was drafted and ratified. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Mr. Chairman, I want the record to reflect that I landed this plane with 26 seconds left. </p><p>GRAHAM: So noted. Thank you very much, Senator Kennedy. Senator Blackburn? </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Thank you, Judge-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --Mr. Chairman. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: I have three letters to submit, one from Penny Nance, the CEO of Concerned Women of America on behalf of that organization; Amy Kramer, chairperson of Women for America First on behalf of their organization. They're both in support of Judge Barrett. And then a letter from Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, who is applauding her record on textualism and stand in support of her nomination. </p><p>GRAHAM: Without objection. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Judge Barrett, you have been a trooper, and so we're going to do a little bit of loose end tying up and then get you on your way. And we appreciate the commitment that you have made. </p><p>And Jesse, I tell you what, my hat is off to you. You have just been great to be here today and to stand right with her. I tell you, my--I wish my husband were here. We were talking a little bit earlier today about--when I called him about how you have been right here, hardly leaving the chair, the entire time. And we appreciate that. My husband has said he's someday going to write a book and he's going to call it I carried her purse-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--Because we couldn't do what we do without supportive spouses. </p><p>The first thing I want to say, and Senator Ernst touched on this, our colleagues across the aisle have spent a lot of time talking about COVID relief and the importance of that for healthcare for people that are suffering. They have the opportunity. We can put our bill back on the floor. </p><p>They each chose to vote no, every single one of them, on additional PPP, unemployment insurance, money for testing and vaccines, getting schools open, and liability protection so that businesses can open. So, we would be very pleased to have that bill back on the floor and to pass it to get needed relief to the American people. </p><p>The second thing I want to touch on, I think there's been a little bit of confusion on--with some of the comments that were made. It's important to note that abortion is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. </p><p>BARRETT: The word ""abortion"" does not appear in the U.S. Constitution. </p><p>BLACKBURN: That is correct. And Roe versus Wade is not an amendment to the Constitution. </p><p>BARRETT: Roe versus Wade interprets the 14th Amendment of the Constitution and locates the right to terminate a pregnancy in the liberty--in the due process clause, the liberty interest. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Correct. I think that from some of the comments from some of our colleagues, there has been confusion about that. </p><p>The next thing is Senator Whitehouse kind of came at you, saying you had never tried a case. And I think it is important to note that Justice Kagan had never tried a case. And we want to have that--she's been mentioned several times today, so as a point of clarification we would want to mention this. </p><p>One thing that we have heard a good bit about at this committee, and some of our colleagues chose to mention this yesterday, is that Republicans don't nominate enough female judges. But when we nominate a highly qualified woman for a Supreme Court vacancy, what is the very first thing they do? They turn their attack machine on and then they start into the politics of personal destruction. </p><p>And they attack you for not being--for not fitting into the paradigm of the left because you're pro-life, pro-family, pro-religion. And we have seen this happen with other judges that have come before us. Judge Neomi Rao, Wendy Vitter, they have been criticized. And if you don't buy into this agenda of the left if you're female, then they act as if you're not a real woman. </p><p>And I will tell you quite frankly, they do not believe that all women deserve to have the opportunity to have a seat at the table. It's only certain women. And we have seen their liberal narrative play out today. Senator Hirono really tuned up on this when she suggested that you, of all people, would not support women in the workplace. </p><p>And I--I will tell you this as a woman who has worked in the private sector and then in public service. When comments like that are made, it discourages all women from trying to step forward and trying to take the skills that they have developed in one area of their life and then use it as an opportunity to serve their nation, to serve their community, because they don't want the liberal attack machine pointed at them. </p><p>And I will tell you quite frankly it is so discouraging to me to see groups on the left is saying we want diversity, but let that diversity come from a woman who is on the political right and it's like their heads explode. They do not want that as a part of the conversation. What they prefer to have is that very narrow liberal viewpoint. And I look forward to the day when that will stop, because all women deserve the opportunity to rise. </p><p>And, you know, I find it so interesting that they don't want to support women from the political right because we do not submit to the leftist agenda. We won't submit to that. So, then freethinkers end up being called bad women and traitors to our gender and other disparaging comments that are out there. </p><p>And you have endured some of these pretty extraordinary revelations today, many of which have involved accusations that you're part of some sort of backroom conspiracy to rig the system against the American people and that your record as a judge is somehow frightening and is going to cause a panic. But I have a feeling that this isn't the first time you have heard such rhetoric for been subjected to such rhetoric by a group of your peers that have probably tried to hold you back because of your personal beliefs. </p><p>I think that most of us that come from the political spectrum of the right have endured that a professional organization that would've been nice to join, but because you're pro-life you can't. Opinion not wanted, participation not wanted because you're pro-religion, pro-family. Opinion not wanted. Do not apply for admission. </p><p>And this is the kind of wrongheaded perceptions that need to stop. It is not uncommon for women who practice their faith or who hold pro-life views to endure this, especially in a professional context. And that is what we have seen the left throw at you today. And I find it so interesting that they have tried to use this focus to evaluate your professionalism as a judge, doing to you exactly what they say they despise; interesting take. </p><p>I'd like to hear a little bit more about the intellectual and personal discipline you mentioned during Senator Lee's line of questioning. Let's go back to that. You said that discipline is required when </p><p>[*]BLACKBURN: resisting the urge to exercise your own will when deciding how to rule on a case. So talk for just a second about that, why it's important to stay true to your basic constitutional-statutory framework, rather than favoring the living-Constitution approach. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, Senator Blackburn, I think as it came up with Senator Leahy and I know with Senator Sasse and Senator Hawley, too, that judges are not policymakers. You know, we live in a pluralistic society where we have lots of different views on lots of different matters, as Senator Kennedy was pointing out. And so in a pluralistic society, you know, I may approach a particular problem--let's say it's a problem of constitutional law--and I may really feel like the result I want is one way. But I'm just one person, and there are surely other people in America, other people on the bench, who would see the best resolution going a different way. </p><p>So who am I or who is any judge to say that their result like, oh, just this once or just this time, I'm going to reach the result that seems the best, even if it runs against the law that the people have ratified. And so it would be wrong because--I mean, I don't think people, I think I said earlier, want to live under the Law of Amy. I mean we have the United States Constitution, and that's what judges should be faithful to. I see Senator Kennedy doesn't want to live under the Law of Amy. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, but I think probably the Law of Amy prevails at the Barrett household over those children. </p><p>BARRETT: 50-50. </p><p>BLACKBURN: I used to tell my children, and my son's birthday is today and we were chatting earlier. And we were laughing about how when I wanted them to do something that they didn't necessarily want to do, I would remind them that I was the chief mama in charge. And so it was something that was going to happen. </p><p>Let me touch just a second on Obamacare. Because they have--our friends across the aisle have seemed to express just a deep concern about a case that is coming up on November 10, the severability clause, and how this would take Obamacare down. Again, this is--goes into their fear mongering and causing panic, and we know that. Because it's not about the ACA case that is scheduled for November 10. This is all about their concern that a constitutionalist judge on the Supreme Court just might get in the way of their push to implement government-run healthcare. To do a socialized-medicine plan or to do the Green New Deal or to do statehood for D.C.; their wish list of items that they have. </p><p>But we do, for the record, need to clean up the numbers that are around this. We've heard some wild numbers get thrown around today when it comes to the ACA. There are right now 8.3 million Americans enrolled in the ACA Marketplace Exchange, enrolled in Obamacare. So--and what they're doing is blowing that number up. And they have tacked on the entire individual market, and added Medicaid and Medicare to get to their number that they are saying is 150 million Americans are going to lose their healthcare. </p><p>What they're not saying is there are 153 million Americans that are in the private healthcare marketplace. So if they got their way, every one of those individuals in that private healthcare marketplace would lose their health insurance. So our goal is to make certain that all Americans have access to affordable healthcare. </p><p>And I think it's a bit disingenuous the way they're--that 8.3 million is the number that comes to us from CMS and HHS. And then as I said, they are blowing that up by adding in the entire individual market and Medicaid and Medicare, and forgetting to mention that there are 153 million Americans that have a private health insurance. </p><p>My colleague from California would really like to have people believe that your sole mission in life is to overturn the ACA, and you have stated that you are not on a mission to overturn the ACA. </p><p>BARRETT: I am not, Senator Blackburn, and I have no mission and no agenda. Judges don't have campaign promises. </p><p>BLACKBURN: That's a good thing. And they've made much about a letter that you signed opposing a contraceptive mandate, and an article that you wrote criticizing an interpretation of the ACA as a tax. </p><p>BARRETT: Uh-huh. </p><p>BLACKBURN: But I had a very interesting conversation today, actually did a Facebook live with one of your former students who had written an op-ed for RealClearPolitics. Chase? </p><p>BARRETT: Uh-huh. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And Chase Giacomo said one of the things he appreciated about you is that you made your students think. And I think that is a wonderful trait for a judge, because what you did was to cause them to get into problem-solving. And at a time when we live in a cancel culture, that is a very positive thing to have students do, to cause them to think. So we really appreciate that, and I know that you've stated that you're going to put aside personal opinions and abide by the Constitution when it comes to addressing all of the cases that would come before you. </p><p>Let's move on. Senator Sasse went to the Fourth Amendment with you, and I want to touch on this pertaining to electronic searches and surveilled--surveillance. The Fourth Amendment is so important for safeguarding the privacy of our citizens and our data from unreasonable searches and seizures. And so many Americans are doing so much of their life online. And I think it is imperative that Americans have the ability to protect their virtual you, which is their presence online, their data, their transactional life. And now for so many people, it is the way they are working. And as you said at the White House ceremony, the Barrett e-Academy of which you all co-principled, people are going to school online. </p><p>And there was a case, Carpenter v. U.S., and it outlined just how far the Constitution protects searches of electronic evidence. It was a 5-4 decision, and the court ruled that law enforcement must obtain a warrant in order to track a person's cellular location information beyond seven days. </p><p>Justice Thomas and Gorsuch both dissented, and Justice Gorsuch objected that the majority's reasonable expectation of privacy standard was not faithful to the Fourth Amendment text. Instead, Justice Gorsuch reasoned the Fourth Amendment protects only those searches included in the original text, searches of persons, houses, places, and effects. Some critics of originalism complained that today's laws should not be governed by the dead hand of the past. </p><p>Can you explain to us how the Fourth Amendment can still govern the modern world's searches and seizures, and how will it continue--how will it continue to apply to emerging technologies that the founders never could have imagined? </p><p>BARRETT: Sure. So I think as a general matter, you know, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. And it doesn't mean that it protects only the kinds of searches and seizures that those who lived at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights could have anticipated. Surely they couldn't have anticipated the Internet or cell phones or, you know, airplanes for that matter. But one can reason from the kinds of privacy protections that were in place in 1791 when the Fourth Amendment was ratified to see if the search of modern technology now is analogous to it. </p><p>So, one example is the Kyllo case. Justice Scalia wrote that opinion. And that's a case where law enforcement had used an infrared detector to see if someone was growing--I think it was marijuana on the inside. And they could use the infrared to see if it lit up if people were using heat lamps-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: --Right-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Essentially inside. And Justice Scalia said that, yes, that was a search, you know, that the Fourth Amendment did apply and the police had to have a warrant. </p><p>Even though the technology didn't exist at the time, it was the same kind of invasion into the home, and so it didn't matter that, you know, infrared machines were not in the come--contemplation of the generation that ratified the Fourth Amendment. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. And then is there a difference between searching for data via device that is in a person's possession and searching for, say, data on the servers that are hosting? </p><p>BARRETT: Let's see. So, that would be a question I probably can't answer. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. </p><p>BARRETT: In addition to the Fourth Amendment, there would also be statutes that, you know, govern how much data one could mine. So, that would be one of those legal hypothetical situations that I wouldn't be able to answer in the context of the hearing. </p><p>BLACKBURN: All right. Let's end it at that so that you can get out of here. There are a couple of things that--tomorrow we're going to have time, and we will talk about a couple of those other questions, campus free speech, executive overreach, a couple of other things we like to have on the record. But thank you very much for your patience and for your desire to serve. </p><p>BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I would like to echo what Senator Blackburn said. You've been very patient, very poised, and I really appreciate the way you handled yourself today. To the committee, I quite frankly think this has been a good example of what can be in the Judiciary Committee, challenging questions on things that matter to people in a way that you can leave the arena saying, well, that worked pretty well. </p><p>One more day, 20 minutes apiece. See you at 9:00. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/""><dc:source sourceScheme=""royaltyReportingKey"">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=""PGUID"">urn:contentItem:612F-1601-JDPT-T01H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=""productContentSetIdentifier"">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=""last-updated"">2020-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

A magistrate judge ruled Friday[4] that there was enough evidence to keep five out of six men charged federally with the kidnapping plot behind bars; the sixth man, Barry Croft Jr., was arrested in New Jersey[5] but has not yet appeared in court in Michigan. Eight more men face state terrorism charges[6].Scoping Out The Governor's HouseWhile it's sometimes difficult for prosecutors to prove the intent behind alleged criminal conspiracies, such as in the kidnapping plot case in Michigan, the group's willingness to be photographed and filmed — includingby an undercover informant[7]—certainly doesn't hurt the government's case. That's perhaps most evident in photos of the men casing Whitmer's house. </p><p>One picture released by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan shows an alleged plotter using binoculars to peer across a lake at Whitmer's vacation home. Authorities say the men discussed escaping with Whitmer by boat and even mulled leaving her in the middle of Lake Michigan[8].U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Drive-By PhotographyThe men also allegedly documented themselves driving right by the governor's house on two separate occasions, taking photos as they went. As an FBI agent's affidavit[9] notes, the group allegedly performed the first of two drive-by stake outs of Whitmer's vacation home on Aug. 29 — when they allegedly 'took photographs and slow-motion video from their vehicle as they drove by it, and discussed conducting additional surveillance from the water at a later date.' Those photos and videos ended up in the group's encrypted messaging channel[10] — which are usually pretty secure, unless they've been infiltrated by a federal informant.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Emojis And GIFs Still CountProsecutors allege that the men relied at times on coded language — such as referring to explosives as 'cupcakes' — but text message conversations released by prosecutors show a new level of buffoonery. In one instance, in a group chat[11] that involved an FBI source, the alleged conspirators used emojis and .gifs from 'Borat' and 'Inglorious Basterds' to illustrate their excitement at stalking the governor and, potentially, blowing up a bridge in order to slow police response.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan Cartographic Paper TrailDefendant Adam Fox, prosecutors allege, even hand-drew a map of Whitmer's vacation home that included estimated police response times. The FBI's source allegedly captured a picture of what the government says is Fox drawing that map, as well as the map itself.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of MichiganVacuum Shop ShenanigansFox, the alleged ringleader of the kidnapping plot, lived for much of the past year in the basement of a vacuum cleaner repair shop, sharing the space with his two dogs and plenty of spare vacuum parts. The store's owner, Briant Titus, told TPM Wednesday[12] that Fox kept the alleged plot hidden from him — 'because he knew he'd be homeless' otherwise. But Fox appears to have filmed footage of himself training in that same shop basement. [embedded content] Training Videos From A PT CruiserPlenty of armed groups take part in training exercises, often involving target practice, medic training and the like.But the jabronis accused of plotting the governor's kidnapping managed to make even this look ridiculous, given their alleged choice of vehicle: A gosh darn PT Cruiser[13].BREAKING: Today @FOX17[14] obtained new FBI docs in an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan @GovWhitmer[15] - the docs lay out tactical training, surveillance, and violent threats against lawmakers and police officers.. pic.twitter .com/kYNkf0F5pK[16]; — Doug

Next week it could be Adam Hattersley[2]. Blame ambition, an optimistic forecast, or the call of being in a Democratic majority, but the lure of Congress continues to woo Florida House Democrats. It's a no brainer the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wants proven election winners challenging incumbents like GOP Reps. Vern Buchanan and Ross Spano. But in Tallahassee, there's a certain somberness accompanying this news. </p><p><url normalizedValue=""https://www.libertypartnersfl.com"">https://www.libertypartnersfl.com</url>/            <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Margaret-Good-1.png"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Margaret-Good-1.png</url> Margaret Good challenging Vern Buchanan is bittersweet for her Tallahassee colleagues.; 'There's no way you can replace a Margaret Good or an Adam Hattersley in the Florida House,' said House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee. Still, he believes the Democratic caucus boasts 47 members talented enough to champion the cause. If these two go, the caucus will lose a pair of strong freshman, one a Deputy Democratic Leader. But in a chamber filled with political optimism, change remains constant, said Rep. Evan Jenne. 'When you lose good House members, you miss them at meetings, on the floor and just walking around the building. But it happens every cycle   on both sides,' he said. Jenne, set to share Democratic leadership with Bobby DuBose after the 2020 election, acknowledges significant political consequences as well. Good and Hattersley flipped red sets blue in 2018. What happens now? Jenne won't discuss Hattersley's seat; the Riverview Democrat has yet to declare. But Good is one of four House Democrats representing districts won by Donald Trump in 2016.            <url normalizedValue=""http://www.electsmith28.com/Last"">http://www.electsmith28.com/Last</url> November, she won by the smallest margin of any victorious House Democrat. 'That's not an easy district for Democrats to win, but we have shown with great candidates we can play in any part of the state,' he said. The Florida House Victory Fund already has eyes on recruits, Jenne promised. McGhee said it's ultimately up to the people. And the people voted Democratic as recently as November, so he's confident.   Latino voters will make up an increasing share of the electorate in 2020, and that doesn't bode well for Trump, according to a new poll from Priorities USA, a Democratic Party super PAC. The committee found 25 percent of Florida Latino voters are firmly behind the president, and another 11 percent were leaning his way. Meanwhile, 57 percent are either planning to vote for a Democrat or seriously considering it. About the only bright spot for the President is his standing with CubanAmerican voters, 41 percent of whom plan to vote for him in 2020 compared to 24 percent who plan to vote for the Democratic nominee. That metric is the only one in the poll, which also measured Arizona and Nevada, to show Trump above water. That margin is dwarfed by the number of Puerto Ricans and voters of South American descent living in Florida who are ready for a change   the 'certain to vote' blocs and are nearly 2-to-1 against him. And more than 20 percent in each of those demos have one foot in the D column. Priorities USA attributes POTUS' weak showing to Trump's immigration policies, which they say 'are deeply unpopular with the Latino communities in these states, and can be seen as emblematic of his larger racist and divisive message that, not surprisingly, is toxic with Latino voters.' Still, the PAC says it needs to up its outreach efforts to capitalize on the trend. Among the 'softer Democratic supporters' that means addressing their priorities rather than relying solely on anti-Trump sentiment. In Florida, a quarter of respondents said health care was their top issue, followed by 23 percent who said immigration and 16 percent who picked gun violence.   'Chances of a tropical system double to 60% as a disturbance creeps toward Florida[3]' via Joe Mario Pederson of the Orlando Sentinel   In a matter of six hours, odds rose to 60 percent that the disturbance over the Bahamas would become a tropical system by Wednesday as it moves toward Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. If the disturbance develops into a tropical storm, it would be the third named storm of 2019, with the name 'Chantal.' The disturbance was detected Sunday afternoon and had a 20 percent chance of tropical development within 48 hours. By 8 a.m. Monday those chances crept up to 30 percent but have since ballooned. The disturbance is expected to follow a possible curve up the east Florida Peninsula and toward the Georgia coast, the NHC said.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190722151711-bahammas-low-pressure-disturbance-super-tease.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190722151711-bahammas-low-pressure-disturbance-super-tease.jpg</url> A tropical disturbance is making way to Florida, which   if it strengthens   could turn into TS Chantal.

Good has announced she is running for Congress. The Sarasota Democrat announced she would challenge U.S. Rep. Buchanan. 'I have realized it's not just my state house district that needs better representation,' Good told Florida Politics. 'It's this entire region.' Buchanan, a Sarasota Republican, in November won reelection to a seventh term in Florida's 16th Congressional District. He welcomed the Democrat to the contest. 'Next year's election is going to be pivotal to determine the direction of the country,' Buchanan said. 'I look forward to being part of that discussion.'           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vern-buchanan-525x420.png"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vern-buchanan-525x420.png</url> It's officially official: Margaret Good is seeking to unseat Vern Buchanan.; As Fla Pol told you  'Good, Democrat who won Florida House seat in Donald Trump territory, now running for Congress[5]' via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times   Less than two years after Good defeated RepublicanJames Buchanan in a closely watched Florida House race, she has now set her sights on unseating his father. Good announced she's running for Congress and will challenge seven-term incumbent Buchananfor his Sarasota-based district. 'I'm not afraid of a tough fight when it's about doing what is right in this community,' Good said in an interview shortly after jumping in the race. 'Because when you're motivated to do the work and be the best representative you can, that resonates with people.' Good proved to be a formidable fundraiser in her 2018 race and when she narrowly won a full-term later that year by about 1,200 votes.   DATELINE: TALLY   'Power plant plan draws fire from environmentalists[6]' via Jim Turner of News Service of Florida   Sierra Club Florida is pressing forward with concerns about greenhouse-gas emissions as Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet prepare this week to consider approving a Tampa Electric Co. power-plant project. The Sierra Club, which wants alternative energy sources such as solar power, disagrees with the findings of an administrative law judge who recommended that the plan be approved by DeSantis and Cabinet members, who serve as the state Power Plant Siting Board. Diana Csank, a representative of the Sierra Club, told Cabinet aides last week that questions remain about Tampa Electric's plan to use natural gas attorney Larry Curtin, representing Tampa Electric, said a recommended order from the administrative law judge addresses the Sierra Club's concerns.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/teco_power_plant.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/teco_power_plant.jpg</url> The project, at Tampa Electric's Big Bend Power Station in Hillsborough County, would involve shutting down one generating unit, known as Unit 2, in 2021. Former OFR chief 'got pressure' to drop case   Florida's top financial regulator under former Gov. Rick Scott says CFO Jimmy Patronis' office urged him to end a 2018 legal battle with a securities broker who made a significant donation to Patronis' campaign. As reported by Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida, Drew Breakspear, who led the Office of Financial Regulation from 2012 until Patronis forced him out in 2018 amid a series of public clashes, says his office was discouraged from getting involved in a fight broker Patrick Dwyer was having with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 'We got pressure to drop it,' Breakspear said, adding the pressure came from Patronis' office. 'Dwyer gave that contribution, and two weeks later, we got pressure.' Patronis denies Breakspear's account.  'Florida's bank regulator scandal comes to a head this week. Here are 5 big questions about it.[7]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times 'Florida grand jury on school safety says 'numerous' districts not following post-Parkland laws[8]' via Emily Mahoney of the Tampa Bay Times   That's according to that grand jury's first interim report, released by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody's office. 'We have heard days of testimony from Department of Education, school district and law enforcement officials regarding administrative hurdles, increased costs to their districts, and shortages of the qualified employees necessary to bring these districts into compliance with these important safety measures,' the report reads. The grand jury also pointed to problems between districts and law enforcement, both of which are tasked with ensuring that every public-school campus has armed security, along with many other mandates. What Richard Corcoran is reading   'School district turns unused cafeteria food into frozen, take-home meals for kids[9]' via WSBT.com   A school district in Indiana is working to provide take-home meals for students in need to ensure they have enough food to eat over the weekends. Elkhart Community Schools teamed up with a nonprofit group called Cultivate to create a pilot program that will provide weekend meals As part of the pilot program, 20 kids will receive a backpack with eight individual frozen meals every Friday until the end of the school year. The meals will be made using food that cafeteria workers prepared but never served. 'Ahead of 2020, Republicans craft immigration policy[10]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida   Sen. Joe Gruters and Senate Judiciary Chairman David Simmons plan to file measures that illustrate different approaches to the thorny topic of immigration, the source of some of the Legislature's most heated controversies in recent years. While Gruters' proposals would further crack down on illegal immigration, Simmons is seeking to add protections for undocumented residents living and working in the Sunshine State. Simmons says he will file legislation that would give undocumented immigrants legal permits to work and drive in Florida, in an effort to bring them 'out of the shadows' and have them follow state laws. Such a policy change would have an impact on roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants living in the state. 'Citrus officials focus on ramped up marketing strategies[11]' via Lakeland Ledger   The Florida Citrus Department is passing the plate, or perhaps the glass, hoping people are willing to give millions of dollars to expand marketing for orange juice. That was one of the more concrete things the Florida Citrus Commission, the department's governing body, agreed to during a six-hour workshop.   STATEWIDE   'Pension suspension lawsuit in Florida could become a dogfight[12]' via James Call of the Tallahassee Democrat   A dispute over who gets to supervise the Department of Corrections canine unit almost cost Samuel Culpepper his state pension, according to his lawyers. Culpepper retired in May as the DOC's Director of Intelligence. Earlier this month, the State Board of Administration placed a hold on his retirement account. When the SBA froze his pension, he filed a lawsuit. The SBA lifted the hold the next day. Now his lawyers say that the encounter with IG Lester Fernandez was part of a ploy to regain control of DOC's 31 dogs that the department deploys to detect and recover contraband at state prisons. The canines were taken from the IG three years ago when the Intelligence unit was created.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samuel_Culpepper.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samuel_Culpepper.jpg</url> A pension fight over Samuel Culpepper, the former Director of Intelligence for the Department of Corrections, could be just a ploy to take control of the DoC canine unit. 'Three plans win Healthy Kids contracts[13]' via the News Service of Florida   The Florida Healthy Kids Corp. Board of Directors has approved contracts for three insurance companies to provide coverage in the Florida Healthy Kids program, which serves children ages five through 18. Effective Jan. 1, two health plans, Aetna Better Health of Florida and Simply Healthcare Plans, will provide coverage in all 67 counties. Community Care Plan, which is jointly owned by the North Broward and South Broward hospital districts, will be available to families in Indian River, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. Florida Healthy Kids currently provides subsidized coverage to 193,000 children and non-subsidized, or 'full-pay,' coverage to 15,500 children. 'When it comes to affordable housing, Florida needs to step it up, Influencers say[14]' via Samantha Gross of the Miami Herald   In a new survey of the Florida Influencers, a group of 50 prominent political and policy figures from across the state, nearly three quarters (73 percent) said the state should dedicate 100 percent of the money in the Sadowski Affordable Housing Fund to affordable housing instead of sweeping it for other uses. Many recommended subsidies for workforce housing, incentives for developers to build more affordable housing or using public land to sell or lease to developers who commit to building it. Others took a bolder approach like Annie Lord, the executive director of advocacy group Miami Homes For All. Lord insists the Governor veto any bill that spends Sadowski dollars on anything other than affordable housing. 'Financial services sector bolsters Florida's economic growth in June[15]' via Malena Carollo of the Tampa Bay Times   Florida's economy remained strong in June, and the financial service sector is partly to thank. Florida's unemployment rate stayed at 3.4 percent from May to June, and the state added 16,100 jobs over the month (up less than 1 percent). It has gained and 218,800 jobs since last June (up 2.5 percent). Business and professional services, which includes the financial service sector, added the second-most jobs between June 2018 and last month (40,500 jobs), following education and health services (54,700 jobs). The only sector to lose jobs was information (500 jobs), which includes newspapers. 'Okaloosa boasts lowest jobless rate in Florida[16]' via The Destin Log   The Okaloosa County metropolitan statistical area boasted Florida's lowest jobless rate in June, at 2.9 percent, according to figures released by the state Department of Economic Opportunity. Gov. DeSantis touted private-sector job creation Friday as Florida's unemployment rate held steady from May to June. The 3.4 percent jobless rate for June reflected 349,000 Floridians out of work   down 4,000 from May   from a workforce of 10.3 million. 'Florida Chamber: Access to talent is top concern among small business owners[17]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   The Florida Chamber of Commerce's Third Quarter Small Business Index Survey shows access to talent is a top concern among small businesses. 'Florida's small businesses continue to be concerned about being able to hire a talented workforce,' said Jerry Parrish, Chief Economist and Director of Research at the Florida Chamber Foundation. 'Improving Florida's talent pipeline for a better workforce will help ensure jobs have talented employees and will help put workers on the path to prosperity.' The Chamber surveyed 130 small businesses; 27 percent listed workforce quality as their top concern. The next highest concern was economic uncertainty, with 12 percent indicating that was their biggest worry as owners anticipate another economic recession. What Jeff Brandes is reading   'Are Uber and Lyft the future of transit? Not so fast[18]' via Aaron Short of StreetsBlog USA   Cities that turn to technology companies to save their transit systems are bound to be disappointed. Pinellas County's transit authority was the first in the country to supplement its bus service with taxpayer-subsidized rides from Uber in February 2016. A new report from the Shared Mobility Center shows that West Floridians were too optimistic about the effects that such taxi companies would have on transit.

'Best state for retirement? Answer isn't necessarily Florida[19]' via RouteFifty.com   Though thousands of elderly people migrate south to Florida to retire each year, a new ranking of the best and worst states for retirement shows that other, less obvious places may be better suited to the needs of the graying population. The rankings, compiled by BankRate, a consumer financial services company, were based on the factors of affordability, crime, culture, weather, and wellness. These created a surprising, Midwest-heavy top five: Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, and Florida.            <url normalizedValue=""https://www.fahp.net/program-highlights"">https://www.fahp.net/program-highlights</url>D.C. MATTERS   'Federal budget would raise spending by $320 billion[20]' via Emily Cochrane, Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley of The New York Times   White House and congressional negotiators reached accord on a two-year budget that would raise spending caps and lift the government's debt ceiling, likely averting a fiscal crisis but splashing still more red ink on an already surging deficit. If passed by Congress and signed by Trump, the deal would stop a potential debt default this fall and avoid automatic spending cuts next year. The agreement would also bring clarity about government spending over the rest of Mr. Trump's term. But it is another sign that a Capitol once consumed by fiscal worries simply no longer cares   even as the government's red ink approaches $1 trillion a year. 'Meet the woman who ties Jeffrey Epstein to Donald Trump and the Clintons[21]' via Ben Schreckinger and Daniel Lippmann of POLITICO   People who know those involved said Epstein's connections to two U.S. presidents ran through one bubbly British heiress: Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, who has denied accusations made in civil suits of aiding and participating in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors, has been among the financier's closest associates. Unlike Epstein, she comes from a rarefied background that gave her entre to the rich and powerful. For years, beginning in the early '90s, Maxwell and Epstein cut glittering figures on the Manhattan and Palm Beach social circuits, with Maxwell taking the lead. Her family knew Trump before Epstein arrived on the scene, and she continued to socialize with Chelsea Clinton after Epstein was jailed on sex offenses.           <url normalizedValue=""https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ghislaine-maxwell.jpg"">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ghislaine-maxwell.jpg</url> British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell may be the connection between Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump and the Clintons.

That's according to a report from Jonathan Swan of Axios. The selection process has been narrowed down to a 'final few choices,' according to Swan. Among those choices is the Miami golf club owned by the President. As President, Trump has utilized his properties in an unprecedented manner. While Trump resigned from the Trump Organization before his inauguration, his family still controls the trust containing those holdings. The President remains the sole beneficiary.

'U.S. consulates 'abusing their discretion' to stop legal immigration, lawyers say[25]' via Monique Madan of the Miami Herald   For one South Florida man, half a million dollars couldn't cut it. For the U.S. citizen to bring his parents from overseas on immigrant visas, the Department of State wanted proof that he had at least four times the required amount. In his case, federal law says the man only needed to show $220,000 in assets, but the U.S. demanded proof of $1 million. 'I feel like I'm in an Austin Powers movie,' the man's attorney, Tammy Fox-Isicoff, told the Miami Herald.

But the president's digital strategy goes far beyond typing whatever is on his mind, 280 characters at a time. That information is used to solicit donations, but it's also used to put ads in front of both supporters and enemies alike, aiming to motivate or discourage specific behaviors. According to online spending data tracked by Bully Pulpit Interactive, Trump is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on immigration-related ads online   some targeting his base with one message, while others target Latino voters with a completely different message. 'Bernie Sanders might be losing his New Hampshire firewall[28]' via James Pindell of The Boston Globe   With a little more than six months to go until the 2020 New Hampshire primary, Sanders can no longer take the state for granted.

He relinquished first place to former Vice President Joe Biden and tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

He even won Tarrant County, a rare feat. And although he lost to Sen.Ted Cruz, his arrow seemed to point only up. Now it appears that was his peak. A recent poll in New Hampshire had him at 0.0%. That is neither a typo nor an 'Animal House' joke. There's increasing talk thatO'Rourke should drop out and run for Senate again, this time againstJohn Cornyn.

In recent months, organizers said they have collected nearly twice the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot next year The exact legal effect the amendment would have remains unclear.

Reggie Brown, a Democrat who served on the City Council from 2010 until his suspension in 2018, asserts that numerous procedural delays violated his right to a speedy trial. Central to Brown's position is that co-defendant, alleged co-conspirator, and former Council colleague Katrina Brown's motions for delay compromised his defense.

Oil experts expect the price of crude oil to rise significantly as a result of the attack. In other news, former Prime Minister David Cameron said that a second Brexit referendum cannot be ruled out, and identified the Tory Brexit supporter Michael Gove as a 'foam-flecked Faragist'.

This is in direct opposition to what Beto said just last year (see below). The NRA called him out on it! Democrats just don't understand the meaning of the Second Amendment and why our founders put it in place.[48]  Climate Activists Plan to Bring Traffic to a Standstill in D.C.[49] As the United Nations Climate Action Summit opens in New York later this month, a coalition of activists plans to bring D.C.'s streets to a standstill by blocking key intersections around the city. 'It's important to call attention to the climate emergency,' says Kaela Bamberger, a spokesperson for the group. 'The point being to disrupt business as usual for people and policy makers in decision-making positions, and also to essentially shut the city down until the issue gets the type of attention that it deserves based on the gravity of the crisis that we're in.' She declined to say exactly which streets will be blocked or exactly when the protest will start, but it is aimed at disrupting the morning rush hour on September 23.[50]  Democrats Represent All Countries But America, Mr. Kirk[51] Noting in all the foofaraw of the Democrat debates that there has not been a single American flag on stage for all three debates, American writer and founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk is asking on Twitter what country are the Democrats trying to represent? Everybody else's country, Mr. Kirk. Make that everybody else's but the one whose borders are being ignored, called America. A quick scan of Google images from Democrat debates shows no flag. As Kirk points out: 'Not in Detroit, Not in Miami. And not last night in Houston'.[52]  Democrats Call for Communist Revolution and Civil War During Third Presidential Debate[53] Beto and other dems openly admit they're coming for your guns.[54]  Dems Call for Boycott of ABC After Airing Brutally Honest Ad Against Socialism[55] ABC aired a brutally honest ad against socialism during the Democratic Debate last night that caused the left to call for a boycott of ABC. The ad begins with a photo of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC) and then it begins to burn to show the atrocities caused by socialism. The left was mad about the burning picture but not about the photos of the results of socialism. The video is below and is called 'New Faces GOP' and was produced by a GOP Super PAC.[56]  Does New Drone Footage Reveal Underground Lair on Jeffrey Epstein's 'Pedo Island'?[57] Ever since Jeffrey Epstein made national headlines for pedophilia in 2008, the disgraced financier's lifestyle has been under a microscope. Following his June 6 arrest on federal charges of sex trafficking minors, however, particular attention has been paid to his Caribbean island, Little St. James — also known as 'pedo island,' where Epstein allegedly kept a harem of underage sex slaves to serve at the pleasure of he and his rich and famous visitors. While Epstein sat in jail pending trial — before his alleged suicide — a YouTube channel under the name 'Rusty Shackleford' began uploading high-resolution drone footage of just about every visible nook and cranny of Little St. James. From the main property where a previously seen computer mysteriously disappeared days later, to the strange cube-shaped 'temple,' to Epstein's giant sun-dial, to an ambulance — the island, which is still being maintained by an active staff of locals, has no shortage of oddities.[58]  Dopey Former Bartender Says 'Miami Will Not Exist' In Few Years if We Don't Obliterate Economy With Her Green New Deal[59] Earlier this year Democrat leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed an impossible $93 trillion Green New Deal to obliterate and ruin the US economy in the name of global warming junk science. The liberal media has been propping up this lunacy since AOC introduced it months ago. And they wonder why no one trusts them anymore? But AOC was not through. This idiot told an audience this week that Miami will not exist in a few years if we don't obliterate the US economy.[60]  Ex-NFL Player Arrested for 'Jussie Smollett-Style' Hate Crime Hoax[61] A former NFL player has been accused of faking a hate crime in an effort to profit from an insurance payout, but his stupidity in failing to cover his tracks has won him comparisons to Jussie Smollett, the 'Empire' actor who infamously fabricated a hate crime in which he was allegedly attacked by two white men in MAGA hats. This time around, Edawn Coughman, who played in both the NFL and Canadian football leagues, was arrested and charged earlier this week with insurance fraud and filing a phony police report.[62]  HBO and Apple Lead Hollywood's Climate Change Propaganda Campaign[63] Hollywood is ramping up its efforts to feature the environment and climate change storylines in its TV movie productions, with a host of recent and upcoming titles being released this year addressing global warming, pollution, and other issues, according to a new report. Among the most prominent titles are HBO's Years and Years, starring Emma Thompson, and Apple's upcoming Losing Earth, based on the New York Times Magazine article about climate change. Variety reported that Hollywood is wrestling with the way it portrays climate change as the industry takes a more activist role.

Reports show former NBC chairman Bob Wright has briefed Trump officials on a proposal to create an agency called Health Advanced Research Projects Agency, or HARPA, to design inventive ways to use data for preventing violent incidents. Wright is one of Trump's long-time friends. Ivanka Trump asked people pushing for the new agency if it could prevent mass shootings, one person familiar with the conversations who spoke on anonymity because off the sensitive details told The Washington Post on Sept. 9. Her questions came after the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

'It was the most uncomfortable feeling in the world,' said the woman, who did not want to be identified.[68]  Older iPhones Reported 'Breaking' After Apple Unveils iPhone 11[69] Right after Apple announced the iPhone 11, numerous owners of older iPhones began to report device malfunctions reminiscent of a 2017 debacle in which the company admitted slowing the performance of older phones — 'officially' in order to extend their battery life. At the time, Apple said in a statement that it had 'never — and wound never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product.' According to USA Today, however, the coincidences are piling up. 'So, of course I'm suspicious that yesterday's Apple announcement killed my current iPhone. It just stopped working. Awesome,' claimed Twitter user ZarduBen.[70]  Only in Illinois: Wife of Indicted Political Boss Will Hold Highest Judicial Post in State[71] Authored by Austin Berg via IllinoisPolicy.org Illinois Supreme Court Justices chose Anne Burke as their chief on Sept. 10. One could almost hear the gears turning on the Chicago machine, a hobbled but still functioning apparatus now in the sights of federal investigators. Anne Burke is an accomplished lawyer. She helped start the Special Olympics. These facts should not prevent criticism arising from her 50-plus year marriage to a 50-year Chicago political boss: Ed Burke.[72]  Over One Billion Users Worldwide Vulnerable to Hackers Using Google Calendar Security Flaw[73] According to The Independent, the flaw allowing scammers to trick Google Calendar users into exposing their personal details was first detected in 2017. The schemers use its setting that automatically adds an event from an email invitation into a person's calendar, even if the message was unwanted. Google is 'working diligently' to eliminate a weakness that could allow perpetrators to steal the sensitive data of Google Calendar users, the company stated in an update to the Help page for the service.[74]  People Are Already Getting Arrested for Trying to 'Storm Area 51'[75] Authored by John Vibes via The Mind Unleashed blog The viral campaign to 'storm Area 51' was scheduled for September 20th, and after months of controversy, the organizers decided instead to set up a festival called 'Alien Stock' in the middle of the desert, where all of the Area 51 enthusiasts could gather in a safe and legal way. Unfortunately, locals in the small town of Rachel, Nevada were not very happy about the idea of thousands of curiosity seekers descending on their neighborhood. After the festival was announced, a warning was posted on the town's website in response to the news, stating that local residents would defend their property by force if they had to, saying that 'the situation could get ugly.'[76]  Red Flag Gun Laws Are Rooted in Communist Methods of Oppression[77] This week government officials came back from their summer recess, and I have heard from a couple different sources that the US Senate in particular is seeking to fast track legislation on Red Flag gun laws as well as a possible ban on private party transfers of firearms and a possible ban on high capacity magazines. I can only hope that these are just rumors, but I suspect they are accurate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has publicly vowed to pursue any new gun control legislation that the Trump Administration supports, and Donald Trump has openly called for Red Flag gun laws involving mental health guidelines. The mainstream media now claims that a majority of Americans on both sides of the political divide support red flag legislation, but we all know how rigged such polls can be. The real question is, does the average American even know what red flag laws would entail? I think they do not.[78]  Sam Brownback Says Christian Persecution is at All-Time High[79] America's ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, said this week that hostility toward Christians in the world has reached an all-time high. 'There is more persecution of Christians now, arguably than any time in the history of the world, and the Christian faith is the most persecuted faith in the world, by far,' Brownback said in his keynote address at the sixth annual Solidarity Dinner hosted by In Defense of Christians (IDC) in Washington, DC.[80]  Seattle Area Council Member Proposes New Plan for Homeless Problem — Bus Homeless People Out of the City[81] Seattle has a massive homeless problem, perhaps only second to Los Angeles, California.

To make matters worse, she has some serious mental health issues. She is autistic, has obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suffers from Asperger syndrome. She is currently in the United States on a sort of climate change tour, and to speak at the United Nations. She is also participating in protests. During a demonstration at the White House on Friday, Thunberg said the U.S. has a moral responsibility to act on climate change. Funny, her handlers don't seem interested in bringing this message to China or India. [Comment: Go back to school Greta.][86]  The Corporation: A Peculiar Institution[87] by Servando Gonzalez Even perfunctory analyses of the way corporations operate and how they affect society show that corporations should be banned for the same reason slavery was banned. Actually, corporations have become nothing but a modern, more efficient form of slavery. Though, as the result of some legal chicanery, for some purposes they are considered people, corporations have no soul. Moreover, they have no ethics, principles or morals. Despite claims on the contrary they usually make in their institutional advertising, the only purpose of a corporation is to maximize the profits of its shareholders — at any cost. A film based on Joel Bakan's book The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, shows that most corporations exhibit many of the traits of psychopathic behavior, such as: Callous unconcern for the feelings of others; Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships; Reckless disregard for the safety of others; Deceitfulness: repeated lying and conning of others for profit; Incapacity to experience guilt; Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior.Corporations have created a particular sort of mirage. You look around and are tricked to believe that you see hospitals, colleges, department stores, hardware stores, drug factories, airlines, etc., but that is part of the illusion. Ultimately, corporations do not care about the products they make — be it cars, drugs, electronic gadgets, food, books, gas, or airplanes —, much less about their workers or the customers who buy their products. Their only goal is to persuade you to buy their products, disregarding whether or not their products are safe, negatively affect your health or create an addiction. To reach their goals they resort to any type of mind manipulation through advertising that includes falsehood, fabrications, deception, and outright lies, in order to maximize their profits. Proof that corporations do not care less about their customers is the fact that, to maximize profits, they have outsourced most of the manufacture of their products. But, having solved a short-term problem, they have created a long-term one: they have destroyed the way of living of their own consumers. The direct result of moving production overseas to Mexico, China, and other countries to profit from quasi-slave labor, is that they have deprived most of their working-class customers of their source of income. Currently, 9 out of every 10 products sold by the Walmart corporation are made in China, and 9 out of every 10 Walmart customers is a worker who lost his well-paid job because, to maximize its profits, Walmart does not buy American-made products. But that is not the only problem corporations pose. Once they become economically powerful they aim for political power as well. Their ultimate goal is to take control of the state, a political system Benito Mussolini called 'lo stato corporativo' — the corporate state— another name for Fascism. Like most things wrong on this planet, the modern corporation is a Rockefeller baby — initially they called it a trust. No wonder critics called the Rockefellers one of the families that have done more damage to the people of the world. [Comment: Recommended reading.][88]  Top Economist: Professor's Research Showing 'America Has Most Mass Shootings in the World' Is Bogus 'Academic Malpractice'[89] While dozens of news outlets, including CNN and MSNBC, reported that America has the most mass shooters in the world, Lott says they are using flawed data by University of Alabama professor Adam Lankford. So, if there is no evidence to prove that America has the most mass shootings in the world, why would the media and Democrats accept the flawed study without looking into it a little deeper? Could a push for gun control, regardless of the truth be the answer? But the claim is based on just one study, and the author of that study, Adam Lankford, would not release his data to either John Stossel or researchers in the field. Economist John Lott says that Lankford's study has many flaws. Watch, as top economist Jon Lott appears on John Stossel TV where he reveals the flawed data used by leftist media and politicians like Barack Obama to promote gun control. Lott calls Lankford's study, 'academic malpractice.' The Washington Times reports — John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, crunched the numbers and said his count shows that the U.S. had less than 3 percent of the world's mass public shootings over a 15-year period. That is smaller than the 4.6 percent of the world's population that the U.S. accounts for — and way less than the 31 percent of global mass shooters that Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama, claimed in his widely publicized studies.

One family from Sacramento, California, is grieving after their mother became ill and lost virtually all motor functions due to a mercury poisoning that experts say is the first of its kind in the US. Jay, the California woman's son, told local Sacramento news outlet KTXL that his mother quickly became sick at the end of June and was taken to the hospital for a week after using a special kind of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream that she had been importing from Jalisco, Mexico, through a friend for 12 years. Though she had been using the cream without any issues for over a decade, doctors were eventually able to identify this recent batch was tainted with methylmercury, a form of mercury that is toxic to the central and peripheral nervous systems[92]  USC Hosts Anime Writing Course, But Apparently Lacks Funds for State-Required Constitution Course[93] The University of South Carolina offers a course in which students can learn about anime writing while it refuses to comply with a state law mandating a Constitution course.

At the same time, the school has flouted a state law mandating that students take a course on the Constitution and other founding documents, stating funding concerns.[94]  Austria's Freedom Party Elects Norbert Hofer as New Leader[95] BERLIN (AP) — Austria's far-right Freedom Party elected former minister and presidential candidate Norbert Hofer as its leader on Saturday as it seeks to return to power in a Sept. 29 national election, trying to move beyond the scandal that brought down the previous administration. The Austria Press Agency reported that more than 98% of delegates at a party congress in Graz backed Hofer, who ran unopposed. Hofer was designated for the job after Heinz-Christian Strache, the party's leader of the past 14 years, resigned in May following the publication of a video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.[96]  France: Police Face Protesters in Nantes as 'Yellow Vest' Marches Resume[97] NANTES, France (Reuters) — Hundreds of demonstrators faced police in a tense stand-off in the French city of Nantes on Saturday as revived 'yellow vest' protests against the government of President Emmanuel Macron took place across the country. Police responded with tear gas after some protesters threw projectiles. A spokesman with the local prefecture said 21 people had been arrested.[98]  Italy: Govt Team Completed With Undersecretaries[99] M5S has 6 deputy ministers to PD's four, Conte says 'important' (ANSA) — Rome, September 13 — The government on Friday named 42 undersecretaries ending days of sometimes heated discussions, completing the government team. Senior government partner the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) gets 21 undersecretaries while junior partner the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) gets 18, government sources said. The other government components, the tiny leftwing Free and Equal (LeU) party and the Italians abroad group MAIE get two and one respectively. The M5S will also have an advantage in terms of deputy ministers with six compared to the PD's four. Only 14 of the 42 are women. Government sources voiced satisfaction that an agreement had been found on the undersecretaries. Both the M5S and the PD said they were satisfied with the number of officials they had obtained. 'Now we're ready to give our utmost,' said M5S leader and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. 'The government team is complete, ready to give its all for the country!,' he said. 'On Monday the new team will be sworn in which will be composed of 21 exponents of the 5-Star Movement, and six of these will be deputy ministers. For us that means: a lot of work to do and greater responsibility. We are ready!' Premier Giuseppe Conte said 'the acceleration on the government team is important because the country is awaiting responses. 'This team is sufficiently young and amalgamated', said the premier who confirmed 'the new team will be sworn on Monday'. 'It's a great team, built to last,' said Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora. But anti-migrant Euroskeptic League party leader Matteo Salvini said 'we've seen a disgraceful divvying up of seats by the M5S and the PD'. Also on Friday, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said Italy is a protagonist in Europe again thanks to the new government. Italy has just formed an unprecedented alliance between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left and pro-EU Democratic Party (PD), of which Gualtieri was an MEP for several years before being named economy minister in the new M5S-PD executive. With this government, Gualtieri said, 'Italy returns to being a protagonist in Europe, resumes the role that it is entitled to as a founder member (of the EU) which has ideas, imposes its vision of the EU as a path to improve, change, and make it more capable of facing the challenges of our world'. The new government has said, among other things, that it will try to change the Stability and Growth Pact, as President Sergio Mattarella also hoped in helping set up the M5S-PD coalition. 'Today we will present the government programme as illustrated in parliament by Premier (Giuseppe) Conte,' Gualtieri went on. The programme includes averting a 23-billion-euro VAT hike, cutting the tax wedge for low-to-medium earners, free nurseries for low-to-medium income families, and trying to get investments in the green economy excluded from EU fiscal parameters. Gualtieri said Friday, however, that the 2020 budget and excluding green investments had 'different timescales,' with the first obviously taking precedence over the second. 'The reform of monetary union is on a separate plane from the 2020 budget bill,' he said. Gualtieri stressed, however, that the time of 'clashes' with Europe, like those under former interior minister and Euroskeptic League party leader Matteo Salvini, was 'over'. Salvini, who pulled the plug on an M5S-League government August 8 hoping for a snap election to capitalise on high poll numbers and never thinking the M5S would get together with traditional foe the PD, had frequent run-ins over EU fiscal constraints. In an interview with La Repubblica daily, Gualtieri said 'there will never be wars with Europe again'. He also said the flat tax pledged by the League would be shelved, the quota 100 pension reform would run its course in three years, and a basic income would be improved. Gualtieri also vowed that the VAT hike would not happen, with an 'unprecedented' crackdown on tax evasion helping to get the 23 billion euros needed to fund its exclusion. The minister also announced that Italy will join the pro-climate coalition. In Helsinki, he announced that Rome was joining the coalition of financial ministers for the fight against climate change. This is a change, since Italy had thus far chosen not to take part in the initiative, which is made up of 40 countries. The aim of the coalition is to boost green investments. Eurogroup President Mario Centeno said that Gualtieri had reiterated Italy's pro-euro commitment at an informal Eurogroup meeting. Gualtieri, he said, had outlined 'the priorities for the near future and the commitment on policies that help preserve the stability of the euro'. He said 'Roberto is not new to the group, seeing as how he frequented it already before, in his capacity as chair of the economy committee. 'Today was not the day to discuss his presentation in detail. The Italian dossier 'will return to the fore in the context of the stability bills, together with those of all the other countries', said the Portuguese finance minister.[100]  Sweden: Gang Rape in Lule, Police Currently Looking for 'Two Dark-Skinned Men'[101] In the earlier hours on Thursday morning, police in Lule received a call from a woman who claimed to have been raped by two men.

Treating them earnestly alienates even the tolerant, and has no place in the classroom. The unceasing gender proliferation tipped over from a hoary dad joke into a bona fide social problem when a recent taxpayer-paid BBC Teach video featured educator Kate Daniels telling pre-teen children this: 'We know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now.' The 'now' is particularly endearing — recognizable from my own schoolmasters having to upend years of teaching a curriculum due to superior recent knowledge ('We used to think that peptic ulcers were caused by diet but NOW we know it is a bacteria'). Yet what are these stunning gender discoveries that have led us to find scores of new genders whose very existence we didn't even fathom at the turn of the millennium? Quantitative experiments must have been conducted or psychological questionnaires taken. At worst, some professor of sociology or gender studies must have written a paper categorizing them. But no. Most of these new genders have literally come from microblogging site Tumblr. They are random users' inventions, many are whimsies or equivalents of doodling a cool picture of an imaginary animal or a pirate and making it your avatar. Due to literal-minded inclusiveness taken to its logical conclusion, each one has now been catalogued, and is now being taught as objective fact, all in the space of less than five years. Take that, Copernicus.[130]  Thousands of Fetal Remains Found at Home of Former South Bend Abortion Doctor[131] SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Thousands of fetal remains were found at the home of a former South Bend abortion doctor, WSBT reports. The remains were discovered while family members were searching through the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on Sept. 3. His home is in Will County, Illinois. WSBT reports Kloper used to practice at the Women's Pavilion in South Bend. His medical license was suspended in 2015 after he was accused of failing to report an abortion on a 13-year-old girl. When the family located the remains, they called authorities and an investigation was launched.

Former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said that Italy has once again become 'Europe's refugee camp'. Mr. Salvini has also renewed his electoral alliance with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his party, Forza Italia. To see the headlines and the articles, click 'Continue reading' below.

In a joint statement, the two governments affirmed that 'no private entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of nations'. [Comment: Too bad they did not feel the same way about the creation of the EU and its politburo.][50]  Will Chicago be the Largest U.S. City to Declare Bankruptcy?[51] The city of Chicago is in dire fiscal and financial straits with an almost billion dollar budget deficit, bonds rated at junk status or below, numerous extremely costly legal judgments, a shrinking tax base, and unfunded public pension liabilities to the tune of an astonishing $42 billion. Other than that, it's a great place to live.[52]  A New Chicago Muslim College's Islamist Ties[53] The Prayer Center of Orland Park (OPPC), Illinois, recently declared the establishment of an Islamic university at its premises, the Universal Islamic College of Chicago (UICC) that will provide 'higher Islamic education to the American Muslim community as well as serve as a seminary that would prepare imams for mosques' in North America. The foundation of this four-year university is a joint effort between the OPPC and the Universal School in Bridgeview, Illinois. The identities of the founders and faculty of the university are deeply concerning and suggest the seminary will be promoting an Islamist ideology to Muslim students in Illinois and throughout the United States. In the video announcing the college's founding, Universal School is represented by its Superintendent Safaa Zarzour. Zarzour has extensive ties to Islamist groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, including serving as a board member and president of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), and currently vice-president and formerly Secretary General of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Zarzour also served as operations officer for the Zakat Foundation.[54]  A Third of Democrats Favor Declaring NRA 'Terrorist Orgnization'; 28% Say it Should be Illegal to Join[55] A new Rasmussen poll reveals that almost one-third (32%) of likely Democratic voters favor declaring the National Rifle Association a terrorist organization, after officials in San Francisco did just that. Meanwhile, 28% of Democrats say Americans should be banned from joining pro-gun rights organizations like the NRA — a view surprisingly shared by 15% of Republicans and 10% of unaffiliated voters. Just 13% of likely voters believe NRA members are more likely to commit a crime with a gun — and in fact 47% believe that members are less likely to commit such a crime. 28% think NRA membership makes no difference vs. the general population. The poll also revealed that 50% of voters have a favorable impression of the NRA, while 44% do not. Of that, 30% have a Very Favorable view of the group, while 33% have a Very Unfavorable one — virtually the same opinion as those polled held in March of last year. As we noted on Tuesday, the NRA has sued the city and county of San Francisco after its Board of Supervisors declared it a 'domestic terrorist organization. Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the suit accuses city officials of violating the group's free speech rights for political purposes, and claims the city is attempting to create a blacklist to prevent NRA-associated individuals from doing business there, according to Fox News. The lawsuit asks the court 'to instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.'[56]  Bernie Sanders Was Asked to Leave Hippie Commune for Shirking, Book Claims[57] Bernie Sanders was asked to leave a hippie commune in 1971 for 'sitting around and talking' about politics instead of working, according to a forthcoming book. We Are As Gods by Kate Daloz, scheduled for release April 26, chronicles the rise and fall of the Myrtle Hill Farm in northeast Vermont. Daloz, a Brooklyn writer, was in a special position to write a history of Myrtle Hill: she was raised near the commune in a geodesic dome residence with an outhouse called the Richard M. Nixon Memorial Hall. Her parents were close acquaintances of the commune residents, who offered them tips about wilderness living.[58]  Democrat Senators Fear Beto O'Rourke Torpedoed Gun Control With Confiscation Push[59] O'Rourke made clear that handing over AR-15s will be 'mandatory' under his plan.[60]  Forbes Blames Climate Change for 'Cognitive Decline' And 'Suicide'[61] Forbes magazine has attributed a whole new list of negative effects to 'climate change,' including lost productivity, violent crime, and 'cognitive decline.' Climate change has become the bogeyman responsible for all the world's ills, from racism to mass migration, but in its new article, Forbes has arguably taken climate hysteria to a whole new level.[62]  Gangs of Black Youth Preying on Elderly White People[63] Three separate videos show a gang of Minneapolis [blacks acting like hyenas] attacking and robbing vulnerable white people in a string of possible hate crimes. Police conducted a three-day search and arrested 16 individuals ranging from ages 13-25. In the first video, an elderly white man is seen trying to walk past a crowded area full of young black people when he's stopped and shoved by multiple suspects. One of the suspects appears to reach into the man's pocket and take something before running off with his loot. In the second video, another white man is standing on the sidewalk surrounded by a large group of young black men who begin to take his cell phone out of his hands.[64]  Greenpeace Members Face Federal, State Charges in Houston Protest[65] HOUSTON (Reuters) — Federal and state authorities on Friday criminally charged climate change protesters for shutting down the largest U.S. energy-export port for a day by dangling from a bridge.[66]  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy: Comey and McCabe Will Face Criminal Charges for Attempted 'Coup' (Video)[67] House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was on Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo today and he made some bold statements about James Comey and Andrew McCabe. If you believe McCarthy, the former FBI leaders might want to think about lawyering up right about now, because the hammer is coming down.[68]  Joe Biden Tells Bizarre Story About How He Once Faced Down a Gang Leader Named 'Corn Pop' (Video)[69] This is hilarious and sad. Biden has apparently told this story before and now he's spinning the yarn again. He claims that years ago when he was a lifeguard at a pool in a black neighborhood in Delaware, he had a confrontation with a gang leader named 'Corn Pop.'[70]  Make No Mistake: The GOP is Losing Texas[71] To date, five congressmen from Texas have resigned instead of seeking re-election in 2020. Their resignations signal two things from GOP leadership. The first is the realization that Texas is now lost. The second is that this loss is due entirely to the changing demographics resulting from legal and illegal immigration. The five congressmen that have resigned are Bill Flores (17th), Will Hurd (23rd), Pete Olson (22nd), Kenny Marchant (24th), and Mike Conaway (11th). Of these five, Congressman Conaway is unique in that his district will likely remain red for some time. He has not faced an opponent in numerous election cycles As noted, the reason for this is simple: demographics. For decades, the Republicans have told their voters that they were going to clamp down on illegal immigration and address the legal immigration policies that have facilitated this takeover. They have made excuse after excuse for not fulfilling those promises and now that lack of action is turning Texas blue one district at a time.[72]  New York Times Publishes New Uncorroborated Allegation Against Brett Kavanaugh by Former Classmate[73] If you think the left is done whining about Brett Kavanaugh, guess again. On Saturday evening, the New York Times published a rehash of the previous bogus allegations against now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, particularly the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, and threw in a brand new one for good measure. Ramirez had claimed Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale. Despite the potentially dozens of witnesses that would have seen this occur, Ramirez's story went uncorroborated throughout the entire confirmation process. 'If I had done that, it would have been the talk of campus,' Kavanaugh said in an interview with Fox News' Martha MacCallum.[74]  No Matter Who Wins in 2020, There Will be Blood[75] The machinations of an illiberal left, on display in its ever-increasing violence accompanied by the ululations of a propagandist media in contravention of an imaginary 'white supremacist' right, have riven the nation into diametrically opposed camps. The right will never accept socialism, while the left will accept nothing less. Trump Wins Those on the left will not allow a Trump victory, even should he win the popular vote and the Electoral College. They are used to getting what they want and like spoiled brats, have learned that tantrums work. Should Donald Trump prevail in his bid for a second term, the left will go insane, deploying every 'insurance policy' weapon at their disposal to negate four more years of the Orange Man. What Obama, Comey, and Brennan et al. did to Trump in his first term will seem mild in comparison to what the left is planning should he win.[76]  NYC Public Schools Excusing Students Who Plan on Participating in Upcoming Climate Strike[77] New York's public schools announced Thursday afternoon that they will excuse students who plan on attending various climate strikes throughout the city. '@NYCschools will excuse absences of students participating in the #ClimateStrike on Friday 9/20,' the NYC Public School's Twitter account notes. 'Students will need parental consent. Younger students can only leave school with a parent.'[78]  Ohio Cheerleader Kills and Buries Her Baby Girl, Gets No Prison[79] The former Ohio high school cheerleader accused of killing and burying her newborn girl days after prom apologized to the baby's father and walked free on Friday, according to reports. Brooke Skylar Richardson, 20, of Carlisle, will serve three years of probation after being found guilty Thursday of gross abuse of a corpse — but acquitted of aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment charges. Judge Donald Oda sentenced Richardson to seven days in county jail, but she was credited for time served. If she violates her probation, she can be locked up for up to a year in jail. Addressing the courtroom Friday before being sentenced, Richardson made a groveling apology, saying, 'I am sorry. I can sometimes be selfish, but I'm getting better. I'm forever sorry,' according to People. 'I've hurt a lot of people. I am really, really sorry. And I understand,' she added. Richardson's father, Scott Richardson, also addressed the court and asked for his daughter to be released. 'My daughter is suffering from an eating disorder and we are concerned about her health,' he said.[80]  Video: Dems Swearing They Don't Want to Take Your Guns Away, Then Beto Promising to Take Them to Dem Cheers[81] It's the cheering of the audience that shows it's not just crazy Beto, but the Dems as a block who are endorsing this.[82]  Alarmists: Ireland Heading for 'Climate Change Apocalypse' By 2050[83] 'Ireland is heading for a climate change apocalypse come 2050 if we don't implement massive changes,' claimed Emma McMenamy on Saturday in the Irish Mirror.

Prime Minister Johnson said last week he'd rather be 'dead in a ditch' than comply with a vote in Parliament forcing him to ask the EU to postpone Brexit beyond Oct. 31. But officials at the EU — which is broadly in favor of an extension if it's the only way to prevent a no-deal Brexit — privately voiced fears that one of their own leaders could help Johnson out. If a no-deal divorce is to be avoided, all remaining 27 member states would need to agree with Britain to extend the Brexit negotiating period at an October summit in Brussels.[88]  Germany: Thousands of Climate Protesters Target Frankfurt Auto Show[89] Tens of thousands of climate demonstrators turned up to protest at Germany's biggest car show in Frankfurt on Saturday, using the event as a platform to demand the car industry address its role in damaging the environment.

'The world order of tomorrow is not a world order based on nation-states, on countries — it's a world order that is based on empires', claimed the former prime minister of Belgium — which for its own part has a singularly unpleasant history as an imperial power.[102]  Vandal Who Defaced British War Graves in the Netherlands With Swastikas Arrested[103] Dutch police arrested a 36-year-old man from Mierlo who is suspected of spray painting Nazi swastikas on the war graves of British and Dutch soldiers at a cemetery in the Netherlands.

The army is pleased, but protesters want more time.[106]  Could be 'Weeks' Before Aramco Restores Full Production Capacity as Specter of $100 Oil Looms[107] With the Saudis now racing to restore full oil production to normal levels as one Sunday morning headline noted, the industry is bracing for a potential significant delay in production — given rumors the fires at the facilities struck in the early hours of Saturday may not be fully 'under control' as the kingdom was quick to assure hours after the raging explosions — which could translate into oil prices being very high for a long time. Industry sources said it could take weeks to return full production levels to normal. Following what Yemen's Houthis claimed was their own successful targeting of Saudi Arabia's second largest oil field in the Khurais, as well as the sprawling Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq — described by Aramco as 'the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world' — the Saudi company acknowledged it was forced to slash its output by half, equal to about 5% of world supply, specifically 5.7 million barrels a day of oil production lost. In the meantime, Saudi Arabia's stock market fell by 2.3% at Sunday's open. Though the company says alternative plans are in place to temporarily make up for the shortfall, such as tapping Aramco's global storage network, the 5.7 million barrels a day outage is the single worst supply disruption even over and against that brought on by the first Gulf War and the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.[108]  Oil Prices Soar After Attacks on Saudi Facilities[109] Oil prices hit their highest in four months after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on Saturday knocked out more than 5% of global supply. At the start of trading, Brent crude jumped 19% to $71.95 a barrel, while the other major benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, rose 15% to $63.34. Prices eased back slightly after US President Donald Trump authorised the release of US reserves.[110]  US 'Locked and Loaded' After Blaming Iran for Saudi Oil Attack[111] Washington says that satellite images show the attack was not launched from Yemen as Houthi rebels claimed. Both Iran and Iraq have rejected involvement in the attack that has threatened global oil supplies.[112]  Riots Break Out in Pakistan's Sindh Over Alleged Blasphemy by Hindu School Principal[113] Islamic Rioters had vandalised three temples, a private school and multiple houses belonging to the Hindu community.

Seventy percent of the individuals onboard the ship are military-aged men.[118]  Macron's France: Over 90,000 Migrants Lodge Asylum Claims in 2019, Tying With Germany[119] New statistics have revealed that France is now tied with Germany for new asylum applications this year, with over 90,000 migrants attempting to claim asylum in France. A document from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) claims that France has seen a total of 91,372 asylum applications so far in 2019, just 767 less than Germany over the same period, French newspaper Le Bien Publique reports.[120]  Migrant Crisis: 427 Migrants Land on Greek Islands in a Single Day[121] Middle Eastern migrants continue to flood into Greece from Turkey, with an additional 427 arriving in just twenty-four hours, according to new reports.

A college in Ohio is teaching students that pedophilia could merely be considered to be an alternative 'sexual orientation.' 'An actual topic we discussed in class today at a State University after watching an 8 minute Vice News video showcasing self identified pedophiles. This is going to be mainstreamed,' tweeted Alex Mazzara. The photo shows a presentation slide entitled 'Pedophilia as a Sexual Orientation'. Conservatives have been warning for years that the ultimate endgame of every fetish, gender identity and sexuality being not merely tolerated but endorsed would eventually be the mainstreaming of pedophilia.[132]  Remains of Over 2,000 Fetuses Found in Home of Deceased Illinois Abortion Doctor[133] This is a grotesque and heartbreaking story. Dr. Ulrich Klopfer recently passed away and his family found the remains of over 2,000 aborted babies in his home. It's the stuff of nightmares. FOX 59 reports: Thousands of fetal remains found at home of former South Bend abortion doctor Thousands of fetal remains were found at the home of a former South Bend abortion doctor, WSBT reports. The remains were discovered while family members were searching through the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on Sept. 3. His home is in Will County, Illinois. WSBT reports Kloper used to practice at the Women's Pavilion in South Bend. His medical license was suspended in 2015 after he was accused of failing to report an abortion on a 13-year-old girl. The Washington Examiner has more:[134]  The Left Hopes to Destroy Christianity by Changing It[135] The Left's assault of the Christian faith is three-pronged. First, leftists seek to redefine what it means to be a Christian. Next, they seek to silence Christian voices in the arena of public discussion. Third, they want to elevate the ideas of non-Christians to change traditional thinking. Hard to believe, but let's look. The Left wants to change the way culture sees Christianity. We see it on several fronts. The Left wants to divide the church about what is right and wrong. The United Methodists are ready to split on the issue of same-sex 'marriage.' There's a push among a small but loud faction of liberal voices that declare themselves 'exvangelicals,' who resist the church's stance of LGBT issues and abortion but want to retain and redefine what it means to be a Christian in 2019. In redefining Christianity, they want to shift the emphasis from a changed life to doing what they define as societal good.[136]  Thousands of Unborn Babies Found in Illinois Home of Abortionist Whose License Was Suspended for Performing Abortion on 13-Yr-Old[137] Dr. Kermit Gosnell has been called America's 'most prolific serial killer.' He regularly killed babies born alive at his clinic, which itself was staffed with inexperienced nurses and littered with blood-stained furniture and the remains of fetuses stored in basement freezers. Gosnell was later convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and hundreds of lesser charges, and in 2013 was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In October 2018, filmmakers Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer released Gosnell: The Trial of America's Biggest Serial Killer.' The film is the shocking true story of the investigation and trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell — his 30-year killing spree and the political and media establishment that tried to cover it up. Now, another gruesome finding tied to a recently deceased abortionist has surfaced in his Illinois home. The abortionist took the lives of unborn babies in two locations in Indiana. One of the practices was in South Bend, Indiana, where Notre Dame Catholic University is located. Breitbart News reports — Thousands of unborn children were found in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, an abortionist who passed away earlier this month. In 2015, the abortionist's medical license was suspended after he allegedly failed to report an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl. The remains of 2,246 unborn children have been found inside the Will County, Illinois home of a now-deceased abortionist, Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who passed away on September 3, according to a report by WGN-TV. As the watchdog group Operation Rescue has extensively documented, Klopfer had a history of abuses, including failing to report statutory rape of a 13-year-old and a 10-year-old. He sent the latter home with her parents, who knew their daughter was raped by her uncle but didn't want him prosecuted, without reporting it to the police.[138]  UK: Labour's Lammy Hails Song Lyrics Describing White 'Shame', 'Evil Ancestry'[139] Labour's David Lammy MP has shared song lyrics describing the 'shame' of being a white male, and the 'evil' of their 'ancestry'. 'Deep lyrics just dropped by Sam Fender,' tweeted the former Minister of State for Culture, quoting the following excerpt from the BBC-endorsed singer-songwriter's 'White Privilege' track: 'The patriarchy is real, the proof is here in my song. I'll sit and mansplain every detail of the things it does wrong 'Cause I'm a white male, full of shame My ancestry is evil, and their evil is still not gone'[140]  Why Gen-Z'ers and Millennials Support Socialism[141] Public-opinion polls reflect that large numbers of Americans in their 20s and 30s (i.e., Gen Z and millennials) support socialism. When one considers the indoctrination to which these young Americans have been subjected in their state-run educational systems, their preference for socialism actually makes sense. From the first grade, American students are indoctrinated with the notion that they live in a free country, one that has a free-enterprise economic system. By the time they graduate from high school, students have no doubts that this is true. The notion is refortified in those students who go on to college. By the time Americans start their careers, their mindsets are set in concrete: They are grateful that they live in a free country. Many of them continue reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which they learned in school and which they were expected to recite every day, a pledge that confirms that in America there is 'liberty for all.' Now, look around you. Examine the society in which you live. There are crises, chaos, and mayhem everywhere. Social Security. Health care. Immigration. Federal spending and debt. Monetary. Afghanistan. Iraq. Syria. Korea. Russia. China. Drug war. Forever wars. Secret surveillance. Assassinations. Death. Destruction. Bombings. Terrorism. Mass killings. Tribunals. Torture. Indefinite detention. Militarism. Invasions. Occupations. Coups. Regime-change operations. Trade wars. Sanctions. Embargoes. Police states. Alcoholism. Drug addiction. Homelessness. Poverty. Suicides. It's not a pretty picture, is it? It's a picture of a quite dysfunctional society. In the mind of the Gen Zer and the millennial, that is what comes with freedom and free enterprise. Given such, it's perfectly logical to want something else, and that something else happens to be socialism. It even makes sense that so many young people decide to check out of life early through suicide. They're thinking, 'If this is freedom — if this is the best there is — no, thanks. I'm leaving and hopefully going on to something better.'[142]  Why Has the Overpopulation Myth Remained So Persistent When it's So Easily Disproven?[143] Malthus could never have imagined the 'dizzying capacity for innovation' that human beings have shown in modern times, as Art Caden observes at Forbes. There were fewer than a billion people on the planet in 1800. The Earth is now nearing 8 billion people, and that population is far better fed today than they were in 1800. That population growth, the likes of which Malthus would have believed unimaginable, has been met, and even exceeded, by food production — to the extent that our government now subsidizes American farmers, to the tune of billions each year, in order to incentivize them to not grow excess food on their lands. These efforts exist as a measure to keep prices at 'profitable' levels for farmers, in our government's vainglorious efforts to fix prices in a free market. But government price-fixing aside, shouldn't it be easy to conclude that any assertion that an increasing population invariably leads to famine is extremely illogical, or at the very least, quite simply an incorrect hypothesis? The idea that increased population leads to scarcity of resources is seductive, however, and has remained incredibly persistent, despite all the evidence that has proven it false over the years.[144]

By the way, (INAUDIBLE) very special Veterans Day quiz this weekend, so watch that.</p><p>Also, watch SPECIAL REPORT with Bret now.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: All right, you guys look great out there and no cigar smell walking by down here.</p><p>All right, good evening. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>Breaking tonight, the defense rests in the case of the Illinois teenager on trial for killing two people and wounding another during a racial justice protest in Wisconsin last summer.</p><p>Lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse focused today on the key issue of self- defense.</p><p>Correspondent Garrett Tenney is in Kenosha, Wisconsin tonight with the latest. Good evening, Garrett.</p><p>GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Bret, good evening to you. With its final witnesses, the offense tried to hammer home its narrative that Kyle Rittenhouse was a victim forced to defend himself against aggressive individuals who were set on doing him harm.</p><p>Gabe (PH) Hernandez, a YouTuber and political commentator who was in Kenosha the night of the shootings testified that Joseph Rosenbaum helped push a flaming dumpster into a police car with officers inside and was furious when a militia member put the fire out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DREW HERNANDEZ, WITNESS: He led the charge into the gas station. He was getting physically aggressive. He appeared to be attempting to start a physical altercation with people in the gas station to the point where he was telling one of the individuals with a rifle shoot me and word shoot me and word clearly attempting to start a physical altercation.</p><p>TENNEY (voice over): Hernandez also testified that it was Rittenhouse who helped deescalate that standoff, only to later be targeted by Rosenbaum who he fatally shot.</p><p>Today, there were more fireworks between the judge and prosecutors. Judge Bruce Schroeder once again chastise Kenosha County's Assistant District Attorney for his line of questioning a day after the judge berated him and the defense requested a mistrial with prejudice for prosecutors bringing up issues the judge had ruled were off limits.</p><p>JUDGE BRUCE SCHROEDER, KENOSHA COUNTY, WISCONSIN CIRCUIT COURT: And I'm a little bit challenged when you say is there something that I'm saying that draws the face that you're making? Go ahead, say what you want to say.</p><p>THOMAS BINGER, PROSECUTOR, KENOSHA COUNTY, WISCONSIN: I have to say Your Honor, yesterday, I was the target of your ire for disregarding your orders.</p><p>SCHROEDER: I was talking yesterday about the Constitution of the United States and how the Supreme Court has interpreted it for 50 years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TENNEY (on camera): Judge Schroeder ended arguments without ruling on the defense's request for a mistrial. So, tonight, the jury heads home for the weekend.</p><p>Tomorrow, prosecutors and the defense will hash out jury instructions and Monday, will be closing arguments.</p><p>City officials are already preparing for any potential unrest. Kenosha sheriff says his department is working with local state and federal law enforcement to ensure the safety of this community, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Garrett Tenney in Kenosha. Garrett, thanks.</p><p>America is honoring its heroes on this Veterans Day. There are many observations all over the country.</p><p>In the nation's capital, President Biden spoke at Arlington National Cemetery. He said veterans endure and survive challenges most Americans will never know.</p><p>Lucas Tomlinson reports from the Marine Corps War Memorial overlooking Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): 100 years after the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was first dedicated, President Biden honored America's veterans.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You are the very spine of America, not just the backbone. You're the spine of this country.</p><p>TOMLINSON: Just as they did a century ago, a military procession marched through Arlington National Cemetery past the Tomb.</p><p>Overhead, a military flyover included army Black Hawk helicopters, Marine Corps Ospreys and Navy Super Hornets.</p><p>Throughout the nation's capital, more ceremonies took place at the World War I and World War II memorials as well as a wreath laying at the Navy Memorial and for the first time, a reading of all 7,070 names of those Americans killed in action since 9/11. Read by Gold Star families in a Tunnel to Towers ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: TJ, we love you, we miss you.</p><p>TOMLINSON: At the Vietnam Memorial, a ceremony in front of the Wall which lists all 58,318 Americans killed in action.</p><p>100 years ago today, an unknown American soldier killed in World War I was placed on a horse drawn carriage and paraded through the nation's capital to a state funeral at Arlington.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier itself is now become our national place of mourning for all those who have lost a loved one.</p><p>TOMLINSON: President Harding spoke at the Tomb's dedication ceremony November 11th, 1921. After seeing dedication ceremonies at Westminster Abbey and the Arc de Triomphe a year earlier, Americans pressed their government for a Tomb to honor those who were killed and never identified during World War I.</p><p>More than 100,000 Americans died fighting in that war.</p><p>TIM FRANK, ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY HISTORIAN: The American people read about these grand ceremonies in London and in Paris, and they started writing to the War Department and to Congress.</p><p>TOMLINSON: Earlier this week, for the first time in decades, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was open to the public, thousands lined up to place flowers and pay respects.</p><p>NATALIA VASQUEZ, CALIFORNIA RESIDENT: We are coming together to honor those that have sacrificed their lives for individual liberties and freedoms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMLINSON (on camera): 100 years ago today, it was known as Armistice Day to mark the end of World War I. It was supposed to be the war to end all wars.</p><p>In 1954 President Eisenhower changed the name to Veterans Day to honor veterans of all wars, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson in Arlington. Lucas, thanks.</p><p>As we honor our veterans here at home, two retired U.S. Marines remain in captivity in Russia. Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed have been in prison there for years, and they remain no closer to freedom now than the day they were arrested.</p><p>State Department Correspondent Benjamin Hall shows us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAULA REED, MOTHER: Trevor is a great young man. He had so much going for him. He had such a drive and he was achieving his goals.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Trevor Reed, a Texas born former Marine is still behind bars in Russia, sentenced last year to nine years in a labor camp charged for assaulting two police officers.</p><p>He's now on hunger strike to protest poor prison conditions held in solitary confinement, and his mother thinks she knows why.</p><p>REED: He was a presidential security guard Marine and if we can get some leverage for him, to get some people back that they want from the United States.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HALL: Paul Whelan, also a former Marine was detained in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years for an espionage charge he says was entrapment. Both he and Trevor are in awful conditions.</p><p>DAVID WHELAN, BROTHER: He spends most of his days making buttonholes at a labor camp in Mordovia. It's a cold part of Russia right now.</p><p>HALL: President Biden raised both cases with President Putin in Geneva in June pledging to do everything he could.</p><p>BIDEN: To the family of the detained Americans, (INAUDIBLE) we discussed it, we're going to follow through with that discussion. I am-- I am not going to walk away on that.</p><p>HALL: U.S. Ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan has been allowed to visit Reed, and both he and the State Department acknowledged they are both unjustly detained.</p><p>NED PRICE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: I can tell you that we are continuing to press this issue with the utmost priority.</p><p>HALL: But despite continued talk, Reed and Whelan remain locked up. And although Putin himself has said he's open to a prisoner swap, there has been little progress.</p><p>WHELAN: I think we're a little bit weary of waiting to see what the State Department and other agencies in the U.S. government will do to help Paul.</p><p>REED: I just don't understand why it's taking so long to get our loved ones back home to us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HALL (on camera): Trevor Reed's mother said this was a young man willing to stand up and take a bullet for his president. And all she asked now was that President Biden stood up for him, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Benjamin Hall at the State Department. Benjamin, thank you.</p><p>Breaking tonight, increasing concern over inflation is jeopardizing President Biden's domestic agenda up on Capitol Hill, if not his entire presidency going forward.</p><p>While the president likes to say that award winning economist say his plans will reduce inflation, other experts say inflation could become a much more permanent fixture. And even people in the president's own party are raising new and increasing alarms.</p><p>White House Correspondent Peter Doocy joins us live from the North Lawn with the latest. Good evening, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret.</p><p>Officials around here are clear, there is no overnight fix for inflation, and they admit that it is a problem.</p><p>But still today, they didn't say anything about it here at the White House or in Paris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY (voice over): Also apparently quiet on inflation, constituents with Democratic representatives.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): They're not talking about inflation by the way, they're talking about, hey, I don't have enough money in my budget to pay for the things I need to pay for.</p><p>DOOCY: Critics charge that's out of touch.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I understand that much of limousine liberals living in New York or Washington may not worry about these things. But for working class Americans having to pay an extra dollar, $1.50 a week or a gallon for your gas, it's making the budgets tougher and tougher to meet.</p><p>DOOCY: Rising gas prices are on the president's radar.</p><p>BIDEN: Have you ever paid this much for a gallon of gas?</p><p>DOOCY: Good question that has critics pointing a finger at a president in office 10 months.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): It's tragic to go hand in hand begging OPEC, could you please turn your cap on again? We're getting cold over here. That's nuts.</p><p>DOOCY: Nine months ago, a former Obama White House economist warned fellow Democrats the plan to cut COVID-19 relief checks was too big.</p><p>Larry Summers wrote at the time in the Washington Post about administration officials' dismissal of even the possibility of inflation, they claimed not a problem.</p><p>JARED BERNSTEIN, BIDEN ECONOMIC ADVISER: With respect to Larry's point, I mean, one thing is just wrong, which is that our team is dismissive of inflationary risks.</p><p>DOOCY: And Biden officials did not slim the package down.</p><p>LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER ECONOMIST AT THE WHITE HOUSE: What we infused was very, very -- was very, very large. And it was kind of predictable that it would lead to excess demand and inflation. And that's unfortunately what has turned out.</p><p>DOOCY: Now, the president himself admits $1,400 COVID relief checks may not have had the intended impact.</p><p>BIDEN: The irony is people have more money now. Because of the first laid major piece of legislation I passed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY (on camera): Officials around here are now starting to claim they think a fix for inflation is their Build Back Better plan. The same proposal, they also have said would help fix big problems like climate change, but there are some in the president's party who want the Congressional Budget Office to review it and figure out exactly how much it costs that could complicate Speaker Pelosi's plans for a vote next week.</p><p>Also next week, there is going to be a signing ceremony for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. But it's not clear how bipartisan that signing ceremony is going to be because we learned in a radio interview in Kentucky this afternoon that Mitch McConnell is not going to attend, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Big week next week. Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thanks.</p><p>While we were talking, some breaking news about the Build Back Better plan, new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center just released finds that some in the middle class would pay more in taxes under President Biden's Build Back Better social climate spending package we were just talking about.</p><p>The analysis also finds little to no benefit for the SALT cap. This is the state and local taxes cap provision for those in the middle class either while there would be benefits for high earners.</p><p>Again, this is coming from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in this analysis of the Build Back Better plan, a lot to go on that.</p><p>Stocks were mixed today. The Dow lost 159, the S&amp;P 500 gained three, the NASDAQ was up 82.</p><p>White House officials say the president still stands behind Saule Omarova as it's now a need to run the office of Comptroller of the Currency. This comes after we've reported criticism from Republicans and now concerned from key Democrats.</p><p>Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester says some of her past statements about the role of government in the financial system raised serious concerns about her impartiality. Senator Tester says he's looking forward to discussing those statements with her.</p><p>Up next, the latest on the migrant surge along the southern border with new exclusive video of the struggle between illegal immigrants and law enforcement there.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox five in New York where a Black Lives Matter leader is vowing there will be riots and bloodshed if Mayor-elect Eric Adams reinstates NYPD's anti-Crime Unit.</p><p>Hawk Newsome made the threats following a heated meeting with Adams at Brooklyn Borough Hall. Despite the comments, Mayor-elect Adams is reiterating that he will deliver what he promised to New Yorkers.</p><p>Fox 2 in Detroit where a judge approves a $626 million deal to settle lawsuits filed by Flint residents and others who were exposed to water contaminated by lead and bacteria in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>Most of the money is coming from the state of Michigan, which was accused of repeatedly overlooking the risks of switching Flint's water source without treating it.</p><p>And this is a live look at South Bend Indiana from our affiliate WSBT. One of the big stories there tonight, nearly 100 marching bands from across the country will perform over the next few days for the Bands of America Grand National Championship in Indianapolis.</p><p>The event returned today after taking a last year off due to the pandemic. Pretty cool.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER (voice-over): Live look at the Vietnam War memorial in Washington. Busy night on Veterans Day.</p><p>BAIER (on camera): A win tonight for former President Trump and his bid to withhold documents from the House committee investigating the January 6h Capital riot.</p><p>A federal appeals court is temporarily blocking the release of those records. This day is intended to give the court time to consider former President Trump's arguments. The release had been scheduled for tomorrow.</p><p>Meantime, the federal judge has overturned Governor Greg Abbott's executive order, banning mass mandates in Texas schools. The judge cited a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. He says the spread of COVID 19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs. The ruling allows local officials to make their own rules regarding mask mandates.</p><p>A ninth person has died from injuries sustained last Friday during the Astroworld music festival in Houston. 22-year-old college student Bharti Shahani was one of hundreds trapped as crowds pushed towards that stage when rapper Travis Scott appeared. A criminal investigation is underway.</p><p>Let's take you to the southern border. We're awaiting new numbers from Customs and Border Patrol about migrant encounters along the southern border in October. They've been very high up until this point.</p><p>Tonight, we'll show you a more exclusive video of essentially the cat and mouse game between illegal immigrants and the people trying to stop them on that border. Correspondent Bill Melugin is in La Joya, Texas tonight.</p><p>BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Illegal Immigrants hide in a bush in La Joya, Texas Thursday afternoon as a Texas National Guard helicopter hovers right above.</p><p>These two men were part of a group of runners who fled into a remote wooded area in an effort to evade Border Patrol. We were on scene deep in the brush as agents arrived, handcuffed, and arrested the two men.</p><p>Thursday has been an incredibly active day here in La Joya, as the Rio Grande Valley remains the epicenter of the border crisis.</p><p>Earlier in the day, our Fox flight team drone was above a large group of migrants being apprehended in La Joya. It was a mixture of family units being held separately from the single adult male runners, some of whom were dressed in camouflage.</p><p>In early this morning, Fox News was on scene as a group of 150 migrants crossed illegally into La Joya at around 1:30 a.m. The group largely family units, walked down a road and gave themselves up to Border Patrol. Under Biden administration policies, many of the families will be released into the U.S. with a future court date.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Laredo, Border Patrol arrested this Mexican national who they say is an active member of the Northeast cartel. He led police on a pursuit before he bailed out and jumped into the Rio Grande in an effort to escape, an effort that failed.</p><p>And as of November 22nd, vaccine mandate looms for federal workers, border patrol could be at risk of losing a chunk of its workforce at a time when they need every boot on the ground they can muster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THOMAS HOMAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: This administration doesn't care about the border situation, right? They haven't done one thing to slow the flow. There's been no enforcement strategy, no (INAUDIBLE) deterrence to the people entering illegally, it's all about wanting to bring these people and releasing them. So, they can care of the Border Patrol is half what it used to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELUGIN: And Bret, right now, you are looking live at our Fox flight team drone overhead in La Joya right now. And what you're looking at is this thick, dense brushy area where every single day illegal immigrants are coming through and hiding and running from law enforcement. This is where we saw those two guys get caught earlier today. These are the runners who do not want to be caught.</p><p>And what's remarkable is when you put it in perspective, look at what's directly across the street from this brushy area. These are American residential neighborhoods, literally just yards away from the epicenter of the border crisis. And what we've seen happen so many times before, as these runners will take off through these neighborhoods, they will hop fences, they will hide in backyards, they will hide underneath the cars, and it affects the lives of the people living here.</p><p>MELUGIN (on camera): And for the last couple of months or so here in La Joya, it started to seem like there was a little bit of a lull in activity. Well, we can tell you within the last week or so, that lull is over. The activity is picking up once again. Huge family units are coming across, runners are coming across at all parts of the day, and migrants are showing up literally everywhere you look. Border Patrol tells us they're noticing it as well. We'll send it back to you.</p><p>BAIER: Bill Melugin with the Fox flight team. Amazing look there, Bill. Thank you very much.</p><p>Up next, a look at how the supply chain crisis is affecting the lives and livelihoods of many Americans.</p><p>First, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight, China's Communist Party approves a resolution to elevate President Xi Jinping's status, likely securing an unprecedented third term.</p><p>The official document credits Xi as the main innovator behind what it calls Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.</p><p>Russia sends two nuclear-capable bombers on a training mission over Belarus in a show of support for its ally. The Jets practice bombing runs as Belarusian fighter jets simulated and intercept.</p><p>The bombers flew a similar mission Wednesday and flights are to be conducted on a regular basis.</p><p>The last South African apartheid president has died. F.W. de Klerk oversaw the end of the country's white minority rule but is still blamed for violence against Black South Africans.</p><p>He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Nelson Mandela in 1993 for their cooperation and moving away from institutionalized racism. F.W. de Klerk was 85.</p><p>Just some of the -- of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Tonight, we look at some of the long-term effects of the supply chain crisis gripping this country. National correspondent William La Jeunesse talked to some people whose lives and livelihoods are being directly affected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got a lot of ships all over the ocean, we can bring a man because there is no room.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a lot of people that don't want to work because they've been getting checks from the government.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My appointment was at 9:00. I was there. Waiting on my load, I didn't leave the port until 8:30.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Port officials say they are clearing the backlog of containers, but truckers complain that excessive rules often limit them to just one load a day, instead of three or four.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The only thing that we spend too much time in the ports. So, that's it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By the time you come back, your day is gone.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: 78 ships remain offshore, 30 percent more than a month ago when President Biden promised a supply chain fix.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today's announcement has the potential to be a game changer.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: It wasn't. 24/7 port operations remain more wish than reality because the rest of the supply chain has struggled to adjust. But again, yesterday, Biden promised help.</p><p>BIDEN: We're set to make significant progress.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: For many businesses, it's not fast enough.</p><p>GROVER GEISELMAN, FURNITURE RETAILER: At a minimum, you're looking into the third quarter of 2022.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: With their shipping calendar now stretched from weeks to months, living spaces furniture is relocating manufacturing.</p><p>GEISELMAN: We have been trying to pivot more back to the United States and Mexico for a period of time, and this just accelerated that move.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Shoe retailer Steve Madden is moving half its production out of Asia to Brazil, even Bosnia. Small shops are making adjustments as well.</p><p>SUSAN AMENTA, SMALL BUSINESS OWNER: And we're being advised that shortage will continue through the spring of 2022.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: This owner is placing her orders early, knowing they'll cost more.</p><p>AMENTA: You have to realize that even though things may be made here and stocked here, most fabrics are imported. So, they have to pass on the charges to us.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE (on camera): The silver lining, companies are considering reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. provided there is enough labor, and wages are competitive on a global scale. Both remain unanswered. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: William La Jeunesse of the Port of Los Angeles. William, thank you.</p><p>Congressional Democrats may be looking to rebrand themselves as normal after big disappointments for progressives during last week's off-year elections. There are fears by many in the party of major losses in next year's midterms and possibly a course correction now. Here's congressional correspondent Chad Pergram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: There's a push by some Democrats to recalibrate if they expect to compete in the midterms.</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN, (D-OH): You can't look like you're in disarray. It depresses your supporters, and it makes independent voters saying, well, these guys are the gang that can't shoot straight.</p><p>PERGRAM: Democrats are trying to sell people on bread-and-butter issues.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm going to create good paying union jobs with good benefits so you can raise family on and build the middle-class out.</p><p>PERGRAM: But Democrats remain determined to pass their expensive social spending package as consumers fret about inflation.</p><p>DAVID COHEN, UNIVERSITY OF AKRON: Political communication not the strong point of the Democratic Party. Selling policy and selling legislative achievements has been something that the modern Democratic Party has failed at most of the time.</p><p>PERGRAM: Democrats hope to temper their liberal message to capture swing voters. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in Scotland talking climate change.</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: And over $222 billion for environmental justice as part of President Biden's pledge, long overdue for the health and vitality of those who have suffered from pollution and environmental injustice.</p><p>PERGRAM: Progressive drown out the party's moderates. Cori Bush was one of six liberals who voted nay on infrastructure because Democrats hadn't yet coughed up money for the social spending plan.</p><p>REP. CORI BUSH, (D-MO): My no vote was not a no on infrastructure. My vote was to keep our leverage to make sure that we can deliver the full Build Back Better agenda. My vote was a yes.</p><p>PERGRAM: Soaring prices could jeopardize passes of the Democrats' big bill.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Hopefully this last effort to hit the economy with one more big tax and spending bill will bog down here as we move into the Christmas season. If you're in a deep hole, quit digging.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PERGRAM (on camera): Democrats aren't even convinced the bills supercharge their political process. They worry voters believe they veered too far to the left. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Chad Pergram live on Capitol Hill. Chad, thanks.</p><p>Up next, the panel on the struggling Biden economy, inflation, and that whole story about Democrats trying to rebrand. Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Do you think that Build Back Better in its current form is essentially dead because of inflation?</p><p>RON KLAIN, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Quite the opposite, Jake. the Build Back Better bill is the best answer we have to bringing those costs down.</p><p>TULSI GABBARD, (D) FORMER HAWAII REPRESENTATIVE: What this bill is going to do is make inflation worse. It's going to increase national debt. It's going to make things harder for our small businesses. And ultimately it's going to make people more dependent on a government that already is encroaching too much in almost every part of our lives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The White House chief of staff and former congresswoman, Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, talking about inflation there. ""National Review"" had their editors write this about Biden's inflation problem. ""We need more truck chassis, but current trade policy creates a combined tariff of over 200 percent on importing them. Labor policy designed in the early 20th century has allowed unions to entrench inefficiency and freeze labor productivity in the transportation sector. Environmental regulations in California have prevented the expansion of port capacity. The federal government has prioritized transitioning away from fossil fuels while begging OPEC to pump more oil. Build Back Better either leaves those problems untouched or exacerbates them. It sees government created problems and prescribes more government as the solution. It won't work.""</p><p>So why are these experts on two different sides looking at this massive bill seeing completely two different things. Let's bring in our panel, ""Washington Post"" columnist Marc Thiessen, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Bill McGurn, columnist for ""The Wall Street Journal."" Bill, the inflation thing is so real that everybody acknowledges it now. It's just that how to prevent a going forward is being debated.</p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Right. And of course, it's not just Republicans. Larry Summers also has worried about it openly, and Joe Manchin worries about it quite rightly. And the reason I think we have this is because we are asked to believe all these fantasies that this won't cost a dime. First, we were told there is no inflation, that it's transitory, it would end in September when people went back. None of these things are turning out.</p><p>The political problem for Biden is that you cannot spin inflation. People see it. They feel it when they get a sack of groceries, or they go to the gas pumps. Even my kids, who are not political, see that. And the problem Joe Biden has is that it's going to affect the passage of Build Back Better as a reconciliation bill. And I think also is going to affect the veracity of his claim that he doesn't tax anyone who earns under $400,000. If you have raging inflation, your paycheck is being eroded. And that's why they're call the impact on people at the bottom of the pile the cruelest tax.</p><p>So I think there is a big problem. And you ask why people are pursuing this. I think it goes back to the dominate dynamic of this. Progressives that are pushing this are largely in safe seats. Moderates are really Democrats in swing districts worried about winning reelection.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. Leslie, we do have this nonpartisan Tax Policy Center saying that they look at Build Back Better and see tax increases for middle-class. And some of it deals with SALT, the state and local taxes and what's in there. But there are two very divergent views of what this legislation as we don't even know what it really is, is going to do.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: We have that not just because of politics. We also have that, as you can see, Bret, from economists. I can find you 10 economists that say this is bad. I can find you 10, maybe 20 that say it's good. But a woman that I trust greatly is our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. She said, look, here is the reality. We've had inflation before in the 80s. We have it now. We will have it into next year.</p><p>And the reason for that and we didn't have in the 80s is COVID. Not only are we getting beyond COVID, even though we do still have the virus, we are not in the midst of a pandemic, we have more people going out, we are buying more. That is a good thing. The bad thing is we weren't ready for this. And the suppliers, the manufacturers worldwide, not just here in the United States, weren't ready for this.</p><p>We as Americans and as consumers do have a secret weapon, it's called buy American. We wouldn't have clogged ports 30 minutes from me, the largest port in the country, which, by the way, doesn't have the standards that the infrastructure bill will bring it up to that any other ports in the world does with our competitors internationally in this global economy.</p><p>So are we in a tough time right now? Absolutely. Will this get better? Yes. Do we need to be a bit more patient? Yes. And I say as one of the most impatient people on the planet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: Marc, the president said the stimulus checks that came out of the COVID financing from Capitol Hill, he said caused some of this inflation problem, conceding that it's only growing, not shrinking.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, ""WASHINGTON POST"": He's right. They pumped, you had $300 billion hole in the economy, and they pumped $1.9 trillion into it with stimulus checks and with child credits, and with the unemployment supplements. And as a result, the personal saving rates in August was $1.7 trillion that Americans were sitting on. So people have lots of money to spend, but they're not in a hurry to get back to work. And so that created this crisis.</p><p>What Joe Biden said is exactly Joe Manchin's argument against the stimulus bill that he wants to pass. If $1.9 trillion is driving inflation, imagine what $4 trillion is going to do to the economy. So it's going to raise prices, it's going to overheat the demand side of the economy before the supply can keep up and drive inflation. So he is making Joe Manchin's case for him.</p><p>BAIER: Quickly, Bill, there is some pressure, obviously, from progressives who believe that their whole thing about linking the two bills fell apart. They voted on the infrastructure bill, it passed. They're going to have a big signing ceremony next week. But they need to see the other side of this, according to them. Are they going to get the votes?</p><p>MCGURN: That's a good question. We'll find out if the moderates hang tough. They didn't really hang tough in the House. We'll find out if Joe Manchin hangs tough. People keep saying he's going to cave, but he's not making statements like someone who is about to cave. So we are going to find out very soon.</p><p>It's interesting to me, again, the people telling us not to worry about this and don't worry, inflation is going to go away, they're the same people who didn't predict that we would be where we are right now. They didn't see it coming, assured us it would change, and they were wrong.</p><p>BAIER: And listen, it might be more than Senators Manchin and Sinema. There may be other moderates out there both in the Senate and the House who step forward. So we shall see.</p><p>OK, panel, stand by, if you would. Up next, the Kyle Rittenhouse trial and what's coming from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYLE RITTENHOUSE, DEFENDANT: People were saying cranium him and get him, kill him. People were screaming, and I just was trying to get to the police running down the road.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you say I'm trying to get to the police. Why were you trying to get to the police?</p><p>RITTENHOUSE: Because I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself.</p><p>DAVID HANCOCK, RITTENHOUSE SPOKESMAN: It is clear that this district attorney's office should never have brought charges. They did without any meaningful investigation.</p><p>The candidate for the U.S. presidency himself last year prior to the election called Kyle Rittenhouse a white supremacist. Joe Biden called him a white supremacist. That's appalling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Well, Kyle Rittenhouse trial, as it's coming to an end here, has been gripping television to watch. The drama inside the courtroom, the interaction between the players.</p><p>We're back with our panel for some assessment. Leslie, as you watch this, would do you take away?</p><p>MARSHALL: There is so much here. As we said in the last segment, you can have people on one side or another of an issue see and say two different things, and that's exactly what we are seeing with this trial. Rittenhouse himself being brought to the stand as a defendant, very unusual, most so, obviously, in a self-defense case. Do people believe him? And that's going to be important, if the jury buys the emotional pleas that he was making to them. Not everyone does.</p><p>In addition to that, prosecution always obviously has the burden of the proof. Some people are saying too many charges and too strong. I don't think that premeditation has been proven yet. I think they are going to come down from first-degree on some of those charges to second-degree and might have to. There are many people out there in the jury of public opinion that thinks he will walk, but at the same time I do think there were a few times when the prosecution asked some very good questions, which is why did you come with 30 rounds of ammunition, why do you need 30 rounds of ammunition to help people?</p><p>And of course, each of those individuals who has been killed by him, there are three different situations when we watch the videotape, and we will have to see if the jurists agree with me on that.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. Marc, it is interesting to watch people pipe in on this case before it goes to the jury, before it is all decided. Representative Hakeem Jeffries from New York, who we should point out has been talked about in Democratic circles as a possible speaker down the road, ""Lock up Kyle Rittenhouse and throw away the key."" That's quite something if you're looking to dial down the emotions.</p><p>THIESSEN: Yes, it's outrageous, as is what Biden said about him. But look, there was a key moment today when they showed a video of one of the victims setting a dumpster on fire. And they might as well been showing a video of the prosecutor presenting his case, because the case is a dumpster fire. He violated his constitutional rights and scolded by the judge for bringing in the fact that he invoked his First Amendment right to remain silent. He got dressed down in front of the jury repeatedly.</p><p>And his star witness testified that Rittenhouse fired in self-defense. So I think the jury should not only acquit, the foreman should look at the prosecutor and say I award you no points and may have God have mercy on your soul. That's how bad it has been.</p><p>BAIER: Bill?</p><p>MCGURN: I see it slightly different from Leslie. I don't see two side. What's incredible to me is I see the prosecution making the defense side. Who's a persuasive witness that made the prosecution's case? Most of these things have come out by prosecution witnesses who are backing the defendant's story.</p><p>So again, I don't like to speculate, I'm not in the courtroom for all of it. But it is really astonishing that most of the witnesses that have been most powerful for Kyle Rittenhouse have been from the prosecution. I think it goes back to the first point, the case should never have been brought. If it were going to be broad, you would think that the prosecutors would talk to their own witnesses a little bit before they got on the stand.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it all, and we will take it, and when the jury has it and comes up with a decision, you will see it here on FOX. Panel, thanks. Have a great night.</p><p>When we come back, a look at Veterans Day around the country.</p><p>BAIER: Thank you to all the veterans serving in the military or who have served ever. Finally tonight, a look at Veterans Day events around the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are here today to commemorate the service that all veterans of all ages have given to our country.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the soldiers, we are basically past, present, and future doing our respects here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will be hard-pressed to find a better place to honor our veterans than this incredible museum, which gives a testament to the greatest generation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's Veterans Day, and this the day we recognize all who served.</p><p>BAIER: I cover the Pentagon for six-and-a-half years. I traveled the world with the military, and I came to respect and honor the service and sacrifice not only for the military members but also their families.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, here we go. Three, two -- are you ready?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have an opportunity and responsibility to give back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Giving an opportunity to come together and help others on the golf course is everything I could have asked for.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We remember all those who have come before us and given the greatest gift to our nation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was a long road through a couple wars. And I had a bad day once, and that brought me here today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It allows us to honor the 1.8 million Purple Heart recipients, and allows us to continue to tell their stories to Americans today and the generations to come.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One, two, three. Oh, they're beautiful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For our Navy, for they would always be courageous, for our marines, for they'd always be faithful, for our army as they come to our defense, for our Air Force to fly, fight, and win, and finally, for our Space Force, that they always be above.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BAIER: We really owe a lot to our veterans, really everything.

Bruen.""</nitf:hl2><nitf:hl2>Testimony by Amy Swearer, Senior Legal Fellow, Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, Heritage Foundation, Washington, D.C.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=""true"">Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and distinguished Senators,</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">My name is Amy Swearer, and I am a Senior Legal Fellow in the Heritage Foundation's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. n1 My areas of scholarship and study include, among other things, the Second Amendment, school safety, and the intersection of gun violence and mental health. I was a primary author of Heritage's recent e-booklet, The Essential Second Amendment, and run the organization's Defensive Gun Use Database. I have testified numerous on firearms policy at both the state and federal level, including on several occasions before this Committee. Most recently, these testimonies have covered an array of proposed gun control measures, recent nationwide spikes in violent crime, keeping the nation's children safe from gun violence, and the economic toll of gun violence. n2</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">Today, I have been asked--along with my fellow panelists--to discuss how Congress can protect public safety after the Supreme Court's opinion this past summer in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. The very title of the hearing implies that, as a result of the Bruen opinion and subsequent Second Amendment litigation, the public safety is endangered.</p><p nitf:lede=""true"">What an absurd premise.</p><p>To be clear, this mild insinuation that Bruen endangers public safety is quite tame compared to the hysterical theatrics employed by some media outlets and public figures. At various points after the opinion's release, pundits and policymakers have alleged, among other things, that Bruen:</p><p>* is a radical gun ruling that will lead to more violence; n3</p><p>* will have significant and dangerous consequences for New Yorkers, including law enforcement officers; n4</p><p>* is reckless, reprehensible, and shows an extreme vision for life in the United States; n5</p><p>* asserts that nearly any attempts at gun regulation are invalid; n6</p><p>* will literally get women killed. n7</p><p>The good news is that Bruen does none of these things.</p><p>In fact, in its most immediate impact, Bruen is likely to increase public safety by striking down laws that for far too long effectively prohibited ordinary, peaceable citizens from carrying firearms in public to defend themselves against violent victimizations. Defensive gun uses have a significant protective impact against violent crime--a protective impact which will now finally be fully extended to millions of residents in the seven states whose public carry frameworks formerly rendered most of them defenseless victims.</p><p>Yes, it is likely that when the dust of the post-Bruen legal fallout settles, several modern gun control laws will be struck down as unconstitutional (most of which should have been struck down under a fair application of Heller and McDonald). But these laws overwhelmingly failed to offer significant public safety benefits in the first place, and precisely for the reasons they will likely be struck down--in practice, they most commonly target peaceable Americans while doing very little to ensure that violent criminals are effectively deterred or prevented from committing violent acts.</p><p>At the same time, Bruen leaves ample room for the enforcement of a variety of public safety measures that are far more effective than the ""just do something"" laws it threatens. This is abundantly clear in those cases where courts have thus far struck down gun control statutes post-Bruen. In each those cases, the court points out constitutionally permissible measures (like pretrial detainment) that could have been but were not, in fact, used against the defendant, who then went on to simply ignore the stricken law.</p><p>I. Understanding Bruen: How Did We Get There and What Does It Actually Say?</p><p>Bruen was, in many ways, a much-needed correction to lower courts' widespread refusal to treat District of Columbia v. Heller n8 and McDonald v. City of Chicago n9 with any semblance of respect. In those landmark cases, the Supreme Court struck down bans on the possession of operable handguns inside the home. Taken together, Heller and McDonald affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is, indeed, individual in nature and centered on the natural right of self-defense. n10 The Second Amendment does not protect a second-class right, but one that is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and applicable against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. n11</p><p>At the very least, law-abiding, peaceable adult citizens have a right to own arms that are of a type commonly possessed by such citizens for lawful purposes. n12</p><p>Notably, the Court declined in both cases to explicitly adopt or apply a ""tiers of scrutiny"" framework, but deemed means-end interest balancing tests to be inappropriate and focused its analysis on the Amendment's text, history, and tradition. n13 It emphasized that nothing in either opinion should be understood as ""casting doubt"" on ""certain longstanding"" and ""presumptively lawful"" restrictions. n14 These included prohibitions on firearm possession by felons or the mentally ill, laws restricting the carrying of firearms in ""sensitive places"" like schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of firearms. n15</p><p>And then, for the next decade, the Court declined every opportunity to put flesh onto this bare bones Second Amendment framework. In the interim, lower courts developed a two-step approach that, in effect, led courts at the second step to use intermediate scrutiny to engage in the very type of means-end interest balancing the Supreme Court deemed inappropriate. Under this test, Heller and McDonald were effectively rendered toothless, and many lower courts never found a gun control law they could not uphold under the second step. n16 *</p><p>New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen n17 was the Supreme Court's first major attempt to clarify (and vindicate) Heller and McDonald, and address at least some of the questions those cases left unanswered--namely, what is the scope of the right to bear arms outside of the home and what, exactly, is the framework courts should use when analyzing Second Amendment challenges. New York generally prohibited civilians from possessing a firearm outside of their homes without an unrestricted concealed carry permit, which allows a person to ""have and carry"" a concealed handgun in public. Applicants for this license needed to prove to the state that they had ""proper cause"" for being armed in public, meaning they had a ""special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community."" In practice, this proper-cause requirement worked to ensure that ordinary, law-abiding New Yorkers did not have a right to armed selfdefense outside the home. Lower courts had upheld the constitutionality of the proper-cause standard both in New York and six other states with similar frameworks, uniformly justifying the requirement under some form of heightened scrutiny.</p><p>In Bruen, the Supreme Court struck down New York's ""proper cause"" requirement, holding that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense. n18 Just as importantly, the Court outright rejected the two-step test developed by lower courts in the wake of Heller and McDonald, finding in particular that the second step is ""inconsistent with Heller's historical approach and its rejection of means-end scrutiny."" n19 Instead, it adopted the following standard for Second Amendment cases:</p><p>When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.' n20</p><p>The Court explained that while courts are required to reason through historical analogy, this is ""neither a regulatory straightjacket nor a regulatory blank check."" n21 Courts should neither uphold every modern law that remotely resembles a historical analogue nor require the government to produce a historical twin or ""dead ringer"" for a modern law. According to the Court, Heller and McDonald pointed toward at least two central metrics for a historical analogical inquiry: ""whether modern and historical regulations impose a comparable burden on the right of armed self-defense and whether that burden is comparably justified."" n22</p><p>In short, New York's proper cause requirement did not fit within the confines of those ""reasonable, well-defined restrictions"" that historically delineated the outer limits of the right of peaceable, law-abiding adult citizens to bear commonly used arms in public for self-defense. While there is a longstanding tradition of limiting the intent for which one could carry arms in public, the manner by which one could carry arms in public, or the exceptional circumstances or sensitive places in which one could not carry arms, there was simply no historical analogue limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens who demonstrate a special need for self-defense. n23</p><p>Importantly, the Court explicitly stated that nothing in its holding ""should be interpreted to suggest the unconstitutionality"" of the shall-issue frameworks already employed by a majority of states and which do not require an applicant to prove an atypical need for self-defense. n24 At the same time, it did not ""rule out constitutional challenges to shall-issue frameworks"" whose bureaucratic burdens may nonetheless work to deny ordinary citizens their right to public carry. n25</p><p>II. Bruen's Most Direct Impact--Striking Down ""Proper Cause"" Carry Statutes--</p><p>Promotes Both Public Safety and a Fairer, More Equitable Criminal Justice System The most immediate and direct impact of Bruen is that it struck down ""proper-cause"" requirements in seven states, effectively forcing those states to become ""shall issue"" for purposes of concealed carry permits. While some have decried the prospect of a more concealed carry permit holders carrying guns in public places, insinuating that this will exacerbate violent crime problems, this is inconsistent with the evidence. Rather, because of Bruen, millions more peaceable Americans will have the option of lawfully defending themselves and others with a firearm in public, something that promotes the public safety. Moreover, because states may no longer arbitrarily prohibit public carry for ordinary Americans, fewer peaceable citizens are likely to find themselves branded ""violent weapons offenders"" for having the audacity to defend themselves in public without a government license they could never hope to obtain.</p><p>A. Peaceable Citizens Benefit from the Right to Armed Self-Defense, Both at Home and in Public Spaces</p><p>In general, lawful gun owners are not the driving force behind criminal gun violence. n26 It is universally true that most gun crimes are committed by a very small subset of serial offenders who are already prohibited from legally possessing firearms. n27 While some lawful gun owners will inevitably use their firearms in furtherance of criminal activity in any given year, the overwhelming majority will not. n28 This is particularly true of concealed carry permit holders, who are as a group one of the most law-abiding populations in the nation. Analyses of available state-level data routinely shows that they are, in fact, significantly less likely to be convicted of firearms-related violations than are police officers, who under federal law are exempt from most state-level gun laws (including those regulating public carry), including while they are off-duty. n29 This is not to suggest that law enforcement officers are prone to committing weapons offense--quite the opposite, it highlights just how little the public has to fear from an increase in concealed carry permit holders.</p><p>Given this reality, it is little wonder that the most methodologically sound studies on the issue routinely find that more permissive public carry schemes do not lead to more violent crime. n30 To the extent that any studies do show a relationship between public carry frameworks and violent crime, there still exists no logical causal mechanism to explain how more permissive public carry laws would conceivably cause that violent crime. The only crimes that could logically be the result of permissive public carry laws are those (1) carried out with firearms (2) in public places (3) by a person lawfully carrying that firearm under the permissive framework (4) who would not otherwise have been highly motivated to commit the same crime regardless of whether state laws prohibited him or her from carrying in public. Most crimes (in fact, the vast majority of crimes) do not fit within those parameters. And, again, concealed carry permit holders are overwhelmingly law-abiding and rarely commit any crimes, much less gun crimes in public spaces that were facilitated by their carry permits in the sense that permit holder committed a crime of opportunity during the normal course of his or her otherwise lawful public carry. Moreover, to the extent that permit holders sometimes do commit these types of crimes, it is equally true that they are sometimes stopped by other armed citizens whose ability to defend themselves and others is owed directly to the more permissive public carry framework. n31</p><p>Indeed, gun violence rates plummeted between the early 1990s and late 2010s, even as the national momentum shifted dramatically toward more permissive public carry schemes. n32 Not a single state that voluntarily moved to a more permissive framework has chosen to return to its more restrictive laws. Since most individuals who own guns or carry them in public do so out of concern for their own safety, it is far more likely (and the available evidence certainly suggests) that any causal mechanism works the opposite way--increases in violent crime tend to cause states to move toward less restrictive frameworks so that law-abiding citizens may better defend themselves in public, and not the other way around.</p><p>Just as advocates of stricter public carry laws often overstate concealed carry permit holders' contribution to violent crime, they often seriously downplay (or completely ignore) the protective impact of lawful gun ownership. According to a 2013 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost every major study on defensive gun uses has concluded that Americans use their firearms defensively somewhere between 500,000 and several million times every year. n33 In 2021, the most comprehensive survey of gun owners and gun use ever conducted reinforced these earlier studies, estimating an average of just over 1.6 million annual defensive gun uses. n34 Importantly, this latest analysis reveals that, unlike criminal gun uses, defensive gun uses are quite common amongst lawful gun owners, with approximately one-third of all gun owners reporting having used a firearm to defend themselves or their property. n35 Moreover, while many of these defensive gun uses occur in or around the gun owner's home, 14 percent (or approximately 224,000) occurred either in public or in a third-party residence. n36 The number of defensive gun uses outside of the home has likely been kept artificially low by overly restrictive public carry schemes like the one struck down in Bruen, precisely because these laws all but ensured that tens of millions of ordinary, law-abiding adults would never have the option of lawful armed selfdefense in public spaces.</p><p>Not only are armed civilians better able to resist criminal activity when it occurs, but according to criminals themselves, knowing that potential victims might be armed effectively deters many crimes from happening in the first place. According to one survey of imprisoned felons, roughly one-third reported being ""scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an armed victim,"" while 40 percent admitted that they had refrained from attempting to commit a crime out of fear that the victim was armed. n37 Well over half of the surveyed felons acknowledged that they would not attack a victim they knew was armed, and almost three-quarters agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses where people are at home is that they fear being shot."" n38 Importantly, the study also found that felons from states with the greatest relative number of privately owned firearms registered the highest levels of concern about confronting an armed victim. n39</p><p>This is consistent with the conclusions of a study that analyzed the effect of a Memphis newspaper listing all Tennessee residents with a handgun carry permit in a publicly accessible database, locating them within their five-digit zip code. The database received more than a million views in 2009. n40 The study's authors concluded that, in the months following a newspaper article that dramatically increased online traffic to the database, zip codes with higher densities of carry permit holders experienced a 20 percent relative decrease in burglaries compared to zip codes with lower densities of carry permit holders. n41</p><p>International data, too, seems to indicate that criminals generally consider the likelihood of armed resistance and adapt their behavior accordingly. According to one study, only about 13 percent of burglaries in the United States take place when the occupants are home, a rate far lower than in many other developed countries like Canada, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. n42 Because these ""hot burglaries"" are far more likely to result in an assault against a victim than are burglaries of unoccupied homes, it is relatively easy to predict--as several researchers have--that the lower percentage of hot burglaries in the United States results in over half a million fewer assaults every year than would otherwise occur if the percentage of hot burglaries was on par with these other countries, saving the nation billions of dollars in avoided crime costs and an untold number of lives. n43 While these studies looked specifically at burglaries, which by definition do not occur in public, it should be presumed that the same protective effects of gun ownership extend (at least to some extent) to the public sphere based on the same logic--most criminals seek to avoid armed resistance and in many cases will be deterred from attacking victims in a public place if those victims are likely to be armed.</p><p>Additionally, armed civilians play a significant but underacknowledged role in stopping active shooters, including those bent on committing acts of mass public violence. Between 2014 and 2021, armed citizens successfully stopped 51 percent of active shooters who carried out attacks in public places that allowed civilians to lawfully carry their own firearms for self-defense. n44 In none of those incidents did the armed citizen injure innocent bystanders. n45</p><p>Finally, armed self-defense--including armed self-defense in public--is often a vital but overlooked part of ensuring the safety of victims of intimate partner domestic violence. As explained below, too often, perpetrators of intimate partner domestic violence are simply told by a court not to contact or harm their victims, but are otherwise not detained. Far too often, they are not even prosecuted for their crimes until after they violate restraining orders. According to my analysis of the Heritage Foundation's Defensive Gun Use Database, between January 1, 2021 and March 10, 2022, we recorded 208 media-verified instances in which victims of intimate partner were protected from an abuser solely because they or a third-party was lawfully armed with a gun. In total, these armed citizens protected an estimated 395 potential victims, including 65 minor children and three unborn children. In 24 cases, the victim had a restraining order against the abuser, which was ignored. In 15 additional cases, it was clear that the assailant had a significant history of domestic violence, and in three cases, the victim was in the process of obtaining or renewing a protective order.</p><p>Our database is limited, and almost certainly undercounts by several orders of magnitude the actual number of times armed civilians successfully defend domestic violence victims from further abuse. First, our database relies solely on publicly accessible, online media reports that provide enough information to conclude that a particular DGU occurred during an incident of domestic violence involving partners. Often, media reports on DGUs fail to provide enough information for us to make reasonable determinations about the specific context in which the DGU occurred, or about whether the defensive gun user acted in an entirely lawful manner.</p><p>There is also good reason to believe that most defensive gun uses (in any context) are either not reported to police or are not considered ""newsworthy"" enough by local reports to garner a newspaper article. n46 Notably, our list almost exclusively involves situations where a gun was not just fired defensively, but where the assailant was injured or killed. It is impossible to know how many women are protected each year during defensive gun uses that are less likely to be reported in a public media source--like, for example, scenarios where the assailant is warded off by a warning shot or by the victim's mere presentation of a firearm.</p><p>At the very least, these verified defensive gun uses underscore the importance of the Second Amendment in protecting victims of domestic violence from their abusers. Far too often, civilian gun possession is framed as contrary to the interests of domestic violence victims. While it is certainly true that armed domestic abusers present a serious threat to their victims, it is also true that armed civilians routinely present a serious threat to would-be abusers.</p><p>Additionally, despite common suggestions by some prominent gun control advocates that armed domestic violence victims routinely have their firearms taken and used against them by their abusers, this is not supported by the available evidence. Such tragedies have, of course, occurred. But they are exceedingly rare, especially when compared to the number of successful defensive gun uses. Between our records of cases excluded from the Heritage database for being unsuccessful and the records available from the Gun Violence Archive--which flags instances of domestic violence involving guns stolen from their owners--we have been able to find only five cases since January 1, 2021, that even remotely fall into this category. In only one of these cases did an abuser overpower his armed victim, take her gun, and immediately use it against her to cause death or serious bodily injury. n47 In a second case, the abuser confronted the victim while she was not armed, demanded that she hand over the gun he knew she possessed for protection against him, and then used the gun to fatally shoot her nearly two weeks later. n48 In three other cases, a victim's gun was taken but the abuser either did not attempt to use the gun against the victim or did not successfully use the gun against the victim. n49</p><p>B. Overly Restrictive Public Carry Laws Have Devastating Criminal Justice Consequences</p><p>Not only does Bruen better enable peaceable citizens to defend themselves and others in public, it strikes down some of the worst aspects of discretionary, restrictive public carry frameworks that too often resulted in the government perversely creating ""violent weapons offenders"" out of otherwise law-abiding, upstanding citizens. As a coalition Black defense attorneys highlighted in an amicus brief in support of the petitioners in Bruen, New York's licensing requirements effectively criminalized the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular for poor and non-white Americans. n50 It was almost impossible for them to obtain a license to carry because licensing officials almost always determined that they lacked proper cause or sufficiently good moral character. And yet, because many still nonetheless truly felt a need to protect themselves with firearms in public despite government assessments to the contrary, or because they simply could not afford the often-prohibitive fees the government requires, thousands of New Yorkers were prosecuted every year as felons for possessing guns without licenses. n51 Nearly all of them were ethnic minorities. n52 In many cases, this is the only crime they were ever alleged to have committed. Now, at the very least, there is some method for ordinary peaceable New Yorkers to exercise their fundamental rights in a non-criminal manner.</p><p>Unfortunately, even shall-issue states sometimes make it too difficult for ordinary, law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry firearms in public, resulting in the same criminal justice problems. A recent study from Loyola University on arrests for illegal gun possession in Cook County helps to demonstrate the punitive effect of Illinois' burdensome process for obtaining a concealed carry permit. n53 A significant percentage of individuals arrested for illegal firearm possession are not otherwise prohibited from possessing guns and are not accused of using their gun in a violent manner or in furtherance of a crime. Their sole offense was a failure to obtain a concealed carry permit, something that under Illinois law they--as non-prohibited persons--could in theory obtain. The question is why individuals who want to carry in public and would actually qualify for the permit to do so nonetheless fail to obtain one. The answer seems to be, in large part, that obtaining a carry permit in Illinois will cost hundreds of dollars, require a working knowledge of the legal process, and impose serious time and logistical burdens.</p><p>III. The Post-Bruen Legal Fallout Is Widely Mischaracterized and Its Potential Public</p><p>Safety Consequences Grossly Exaggerated</p><p>With respect to the post-Bruen legal fallout, this hearing is probably at least six months premature. The most significant post-Bruen challenges are still working their way through the lower courts, and will likely take several more months (if not years) to fully resolve. That said, it is almost certain that Bruen will ultimately threaten certain types of modern gun control laws. The current extent of the post-Bruen legal fallout can be generally categorized into two groups: (1) cases dealing with public carry frameworks (most of which are in formerly ""proper cause"" states), and (2) cases in which more modern 20th century laws have been challenged. In each of these cases, the holdings and practical effects have been widely mischaracterized by gun control advocates and liberal academics, and the potential public safety consequences grossly exaggerated.</p><p>A. Successful Challenges to Post-Bruen Public Carry Frameworks in Formerly ""Proper Cause"" States</p><p>After Bruen, some formerly proper-cause states responded by merely suspending that requirement and leaving in place other time, place, and manner restrictions, which generally brought their public carry permit frameworks in line with the more restrictive and burdensome shall-issue jurisdictions. Others, however, seemingly went out of their way to take out their frustrations over the Bruen decision on law-abiding concealed carry applicants. New York and New Jersey are two prime examples. They immediately implemented extensive changes to their public carry laws that were obvious attempts to circumvent and undermine key aspects of Bruen.</p><p>Since these states could not use its discretion to determine whether an applicant had a ""proper cause"" to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights in public, they pivoted to insisting that applicants must still prove they are of sufficiently good ""moral character."" Licensing officers still reserve all the discretion in the world to determine whether an applicant meets that standard (a standard that, of course, is not based on objective measures of character such as criminal history or evidence of dangerousness). Applicants in New York, specifically, have to provide lists of all current and past social media accounts, the names and contact information of family members and cohabitants, at least four character references, and basically any other information a licensing officer decided might be relevant.</p><p>While the Court in Bruen said that New York could not deem the entirety of the public arena a ""sensitive place,"" both it and New Jersey did their darnedest to deem off limits as many public places as possible. Among other things, these states created a default presumption that a permit holder may not carry a firearm on to any third-party private property (including businesses open to the public) without explicit permission from the third-party--a presumption that all but ensures permit holders will not be allowed to bear arms in almost any area outside of their homes.</p><p>To the extent that some courts have enjoined parts of these post-Bruen public carry frameworks, it is because they largely fall far outside of the norms of the shall-issue frameworks identified in Bruen as presumptively constitutional. And, notably, most of New York's post-Bruen restrictions are still in place after the Second Circuit issued stays with respect to almost all aspects of the temporary restraining orders. n54 Oral argument is scheduled for March 20. It is likely that these more extreme aspects of New York's new framework will ultimately be struck down as inconsistent with Bruen, though likely by virtue of a ""grant, vacate, and remand"" order from the Supreme Court and not the Second Circuit, which, like the Ninth Circuit, is notorious for having never found a gun control measure that it could not find perfectly compatible with the Second Amendment. n55</p><p>This will not, however, create serious public safety concerns. Again, concealed carry permit holders are overwhelmingly law-abiding and are not the driving force behind gun crimes. These were not restrictions on public carry that New York, New Jersey, or others deemed necessary for maintaining public safety until after Bruen. That is because these brand-new restrictions are not about public safety in the first place. They are nothing more than cynical efforts to ensure that the concealed carry process is so convoluted, burdensome, and restrictive that many residents will simply decline to waste time and money obtaining a permit that does not actually seem to allow them carry anywhere outside of their homes. They are the very types of Kafkaesque bureaucratic burdens with abusive ends that the Bruen majority maintained would open a shall-issue regime to constitutional challenge. n56 * If and when these provisions are finally struck down, and New York and others are made to fall in line with other shall-issue states, the only effect on public safety will be an increased opportunity for peaceable citizens to defend themselves in public.</p><p>There has been, to my knowledge, only one successful post-Bruen challenge to public carry laws that pre-dated Bruen. In August of 2022, in Firearms Policy Coalition v. McCraw, n57 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined a Texas statute prohibiting law-abiding 18-to-20-year-old from obtaining a license to carry a handgun outside of the home for self-defense. n58 The court determined that law-abiding 18-to-20-year-olds are part of ""the people"" mentioned in the Second Amendment, and that the wholesale prohibition on their bearing handguns in public was not consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, as required by Bruen. n59 The court started its analysis by noting that the Second Amendment does not mention any sort of age restriction, and that ""when the Framers meant to impose age restrictions, they did so expressly."" n60 Heller made clear that ""the people"" is a term of art referring ""all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset,"" and in Bruen it was undisputed that ""ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens"" are part of the ""people"" whom the Second Amendment protects. n61 Moreover, while the Second Amendment protects an individual right regardless of whether he or she is actively engaged in militia service, ""logic demands...that the Second Amendment's protections extend at least to those who constitute the militia.. ,[I]t must protect at least the pool of individuals from whom the militia would be drawn."" n62 This was generally understood at the Founding to include able-bodied 18-to-20-year-olds. n63</p><p>Texas' scheme did not, like historical analogues, distinguish between methods of carrying a firearm in public (such as openly versus concealed), prohibit carrying only in certain ""sensitive places,"" involve the carrying of ""dangerous and unusual"" arms, or deal with gun ownership by felons or the mentally ill. While laws restricting certain rights of individuals under the age of 21 were enacted in some jurisdictions during the latter half of the 19th century, the court recalled that Bruen ""should not be understood to endorse freewheeling reliance on historical practice"" from that period ""to establish the original meaning of the Bill of Rights."" n64 Rather than appeal, Texas settled the case and changed its concealed carry permitting scheme to allow applications from law-abiding residents aged 18 or older. n65</p><p>Notably, at least one federal circuit has already disagreed withMcCraw's reasoning, though in a case dealing with the slightly different (but very much related) issue of laws prohibiting gun sales to young adults. n66 However, should the reasoning in McCraw ultimately win the day (an outcome that is perfectly reasonable under a fair application of Bruen), the sky will still not fall. As with restrictive public carry laws implemented by formerly ""proper cause"" states after Bruen, there are few negative public safety implications for allowing law-abiding 18-to-20-year-olds to obtain permits to carry firearms in public for self-defense on the same basis as other law-abiding adults.</p><p>B. Successful Challenges to Non-Public Carry Gun Laws Based on Bruen Framework</p><p>There have also been a handful of successful post-Bruen challenges to gun laws unrelated to public carry. While these cases are still working their way through litigation and additional appeals, they do provide meaningful insight into how Bruen may operate to strike down certain types of gun control laws. Importantly, they also provide valuable insight into the types of laws that lower courts generally agree Bruen leaves untouched.</p><p>United States v. Quiroz n67</p><p>One month after McCraw, in September of 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed an indictment under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(n), which prohibits those under felony indictment from ""receiving"" (but not possessing) firearms or ammunition. The court reasoned that the federal statute does not ""align with the Nation's historical tradition,"" as required by Bruen. n68 In this case, the defendant was under felony indictment in Texas state court for both burglary and for jumping bail with respect to that burglary charge. While under indictment, he attempted to buy a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer, during which transaction he denied being under felony indictment when filling out his required ATF Form 4473. Because of a delayed background check, the defendant was able to acquire the firearm before the denial came back to the dealer. Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was informed of the illegal firearm acquisition. The defendant's firearm was seized, and he was charged and ultimately convicted of violating [Sec.] 922(n), as well as 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(a)(6), which prohibits a person from making false statements during the purchase a firearm.</p><p>In holding [Sec.] 922(n) unconstitutional, the court reasoned that the Second Amendment's plain text presumptively protects the ""receipt"" of a firearm just as much as the ""keeping"" and ""bearing"" of a firearm, as the right to possess an object necessarily encompasses the right to ""receive"" it into one's possession. n69 Far from being ""relatively similar"" to historical regulations, [Sec.] 922(n)'s history does not begin until the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 and did not apply to state-level indictments for non-violent crimes until 1968. n70 Moreover, the court noted that the statute warranted additional skepticism because of historical misappropriation of similar laws to ""pretextually and unlawfully disarm unfavored groups"" without the benefit of due process or legal tribunals. n71</p><p>United States v. Price n72</p><p>In October of 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted a defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 922(k) and 924(a)(1)(B), effectively finding that those statutes were unconstitutional under the Bruen test. n73 Here, law enforcement officers arrested the defendant during a traffic stop in which they searched his vehicle and found a pistol with an obliterated serial number. The defendant had previously been convicted in another state of involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery, both felonies, and was indicted by a grand jury for both being a felon in possession of firearm and for possessing the unlawfully altered gun. n74</p><p>The court upheld the indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm, noting that the Supreme Court repeatedly issued assurances in Heller, McDonald, and Bruen that its opinions ""did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as 'prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons.'"" n75 The Bruen majority in particular was careful to state that the Second Amendment protects ""the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms for self-defense."" n76 Even if Bruen did intend for lower courts to re-examine felon-in-possession laws, such laws ""fit comfortably within the nation's longstanding tradition of disarming unvirtuous or dangerous citizens."" n77</p><p>At the same time, the court could not find such historical evidence for criminalizing the mere possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. n78 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 922(k) and 924(a)(1)(B) are not commercial regulations on the sale of arms, but rather criminal prohibition on any person's possession of an unserialized firearm, regardless of that firearm's condition at the time of the commercial sale. n79 Moreover, it was not until 1934 that Congress first required serial numbers on firearms, and even then, it was only for a small subset of firearms covered under the National Firearms Act. It was not until 1968 that the federal government first broadly required serial numbers on all firearms manufactured or imported in the United States. n80 By 1938, Congress had prohibited the sale, transfer, or receipt of guns with obliterated serial numbers, but did not criminalize possession of such a firearm until 1990. n81 The court therefore dismissed the defendant's indictment for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, finding that the relevant statutes were unconstitutional under Bruen.</p><p>At least one other federal district court has reached an opposite conclusion. n82</p><p>United States v. Harrison n83</p><p>In early February of 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed an indictment under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(g)(3), which prohibits unlawful users of controlled substances from possessing firearms, because the government failed to prove that this prohibition was consistent with ""the historical traditions that define the outer limits of the right to keep and bear arms."" n84 The defendant in this case was arrested during a traffic stop in which officers discovered a loaded handgun in his vehicle, as well as various marijuana and THC-infused substances. n85 At the time of his arrest, the defendant was on bond awaiting trial in Texas for aggravated assault, stemming from an altercation in which he and another man were alleged to have shot into a crowd at a college party, seriously wounding one victim. n86 Importantly, it was not clear to the court from pre-trial records that the defendant had been prohibited from possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. n87</p><p>In the court's view, the historical statutes cited by the government only restricted the public carry of firearms by individuals who were actively intoxicated. n88 They did not, however, impose a broad prohibition on all gun possession in all circumstances for those who use intoxicating substances but are currently sober. n89 In short, the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulations ""was tethered to the principle that the Constitution permitted the dispossession of persons who demonstrated that they would present a danger to the public if armed."" n90 Where felon-inpossession laws deprive a person of the right to keep and bear arms after a criminal conviction requiring an individualized, adversarial proceeding that complies with the requirements of due process, [Sec.] 922(g)(3)'s deprivations occur without any pre-deprivation due process, at all. n91 The court was clear to note, however, that Bruen does not prohibit the government from playing a role in protecting the public from dangerous people who possess firearms. If the state of Texas thought that the defendant was a danger to the public based on his alleged involvement in a previous shooting, it could have demonstrated to a judge during an individualized proceeding that he should be kept in pre-trial detention, which ""would be a highly effective means of protecting the public from a gun-toting [defendant]."" n92</p><p>A Tenth Circuit panel has already heard oral argument for this case, but it has not yet issued a decision.</p><p>United States v. Rahimi n93</p><p>Most recently, gun control advocates have decried a Fifth Circuit panel decision where the court vacated a conviction under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 922(g)(8), which prohibits gun possession for individuals under certain types of domestic violence restraining orders, finding that the statute ""fails to pass constitutional muster"" under Bruen. n94 In this case, the defendant had various criminal charges pending against him in Texas state court for, among other things, using a firearm while physically assaulting his girlfriend in December 2019, and committing aggravated assault against a different woman in November 2020. n95 He was not, apparently, held on pre-trial detainment. However, as a result of the December 2019 allegation, he was subject to a civil protection order prohibiting him from ""committing family violence,"" coming within 200 yards of his ex-girlfriend, or possessing a firearm. Nevertheless, he was accused of participating in five additional shootings within the two-month span between December 2020 and January 2021. During his arrest, officers found him in possession of two firearms, so on top of all of his other various state criminal charges, he was charged in federal court with violating [Sec.] 922(g)(8).</p><p>The Fifth Circuit, in holding [Sec.] 922(g)(8) unconstitutional, noted that while the defendant was subject to a civil restraining order and accused of committing a number of serious criminal offenses, he was not a convicted felon, mentally ill, or otherwise within a category historically understood as excluding someone from ""the people"" for purposes of the Second Amendment. The only historical laws remotely resembling modern arms prohibitions based on civil protection orders were surety laws, which did not completely deprived a person of the right to keep and bear arms, but only prohibited him from publicly carrying arms if he failed to ""post surety."" Through Bruen's lens, then, [Sec.] 922(g)(8)'s ban is an ""outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted."" n96</p><p>Importantly, as with the district court in Harrison, the Fifth Circuit panel was quick to point out that while the government could not disarm the defendant through a civil restraining order, it was not left without options. Judge Ho's concurrence in particular made clear that:</p><p>Those who commit violence, including domestic violence, shouldn't just be disarmed--they should be detained, prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated. And that's exactly why we have a criminal justice system--to punish criminals and disable them from engaging in further crimes. n97</p><p>Whereas civil protection orders can be ""misused as a tactical device in divorce proceedings"" and arise in situations where judges may feel pressured (or even incentivized) to grant them, criminal proceedings require much more robust standards of due process. n98 During criminal proceedings, the government can detain and disarm defendants before trial and as part of the sentence. The court cast no doubt on the government's ability to continuing prohibiting gun possession for convicted felons. It can also pursue charges against (and therefore detain and disarm) those who threaten criminal violence. n99</p><p>Themes From These Cases:</p><p>Gun control advocates have painted these cases as devastating for public safety, a refrain that continues gaining traction due in no small part to the involvement of unsympathetic defendants and the general public's limited and unnuanced understanding of criminal law. One media outlet went so far as to assert that the Rahimi opinion literally gives ""violent domestic abusers"" a ""license to kill,"" as though the judges had unilaterally declared murder to be legal before handing the defendant a machine gun and saying, ""Have at it."" n100 The reality is that in every single case outlined above, the government was left with a variety of options for detaining and disarming the allegedly dangerous person. Assuming none of these cases is overturned during further appeal, in none of them is the defendant likely to be lawfully able to possess arms at any time in the near future or ever. And in none of them is the ultimate result that society must throw up its hands, decriminalize murder, and give guns to violent offenders. Any suggestion to the contrary is preposterous.</p><p>In Quiroz, the government can seek to have the defendant detained while pursuing the original criminal charges for burglary--pre-trial detention may be particularly warranted given that he is also accused of bail jumping. It can seek to have a court impose a prohibition on possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. If the defendant is convicted of either of his two felony charges, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms as a condition of his sentence or in perpetuity as a convicted felon.</p><p>In Price, the government may still prohibit the former violent felon from possessing firearms and can pursue additional criminal charges for violating that prohibition. In the meantime, the government can seek to have him held in pre-trial detention or incarcerated as part of his sentence.</p><p>In Harrison, the government may continue pursuing criminal charges against the defendant for allegedly shooting innocent partygoers. The government can seek to have him held on pre-trial detention or prohibited from possessing firearms as a condition of his pre-trial release. If he is convicted, the government may protect the general public by incarcerating him, prohibiting him from possessing weapons as a condition of his probation or parole, and prohibiting him as a violent felon from possessing firearms after his sentence is completed. If he is acquitted, the government can prohibit him (and anyone else) from possessing firearms in public while actively intoxicated, and can arrest and criminally charge him for doing so.</p><p>In Rahimi, the defendant is likely going to spend many years in state prison for shooting at multiple innocent victims and committing multiple serious domestic violence offenses. n101 Should he be released, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms, either as a condition of his parole or because of his conviction for a violent felony.</p><p>In short, anyone who insists that these cases greatly affect the government's ability to detain and disarm violent offenders either has not read them, does not understand how these laws work, or is a liar with a flair for the dramatic.</p><p>IV. Properly Understood, Bruen Leaves Ample Room for Legitimate and Effective Public Safety Solutions</p><p>As the actual holdings from the above cases indicate, to the extent that Bruen threatens certain gun control laws, they are generally laws that have never been effective at protecting the public. At the same time, Bruen clearly leaves ample room for many constitutionally legitimate options when it comes to public safety. The even better news is that these public safety solutions are actually far more effective than any of the gun control laws likely threatened by Bruen.</p><p>A. The Gun Control Laws Realistically Threatened by Bruen are Generally Ineffective at Protecting Innocent Victims</p><p>The cases outlined above largely speak for themselves about the ineffectiveness of the laws they struck down. Many of the overly restrictive post-Bruen public carry frameworks were not deemed ""necessary"" for the public safety until after Bruen. They apply to a segment of society (concealed carry permit holders) that are overwhelmingly not responsible for gun crimes. As a practical matter, they do nothing to deter criminals who were already motivated to carry without a permit and use firearms to harm innocent parties, and who routinely did so while violating more restrictive public carry laws. Civil protection orders, as well, are rarely effective against the most motivated (and therefore the most dangerous) offenders, who routinely violate those conditions with impunity. At the same time, they can be weaponized against innocent parties, including as a way for domestic violence offenders to further their abuse.</p><p>Meanwhile, laws that strip law-abiding young adults of their fundamental rights do not distinguish between the vast majority of adults who are peaceable and law-abiding, and those who by their actions have proven themselves to be individualized risks of criminal violence. As with other laws outlined above, motivated criminal offenders are likely to simply ignore the prohibition, as they already routinely do. Meanwhile, while it is true that adults between the ages of 18 and 20 are responsible for a disproportionate amount of violent crime, it is equally true that they are disproportionately likely to be victimized by violent crime--and therefore disproportionately likely to need to rely on their right to armed self-defense.</p><p>While an exhaustive review of all potentially threatened laws in unnecessary, two other major prohibitions are worth analyzing--bans on so-called ""assault weapons,"" and bans on so-called ""large-capacity magazines.""</p><p>Bans on So-Called ""Assault Weapons ""</p><p>In Heller, the Court reasoned that the Second Amendment's protections are not limited only to those arms in existence at the time of ratification, but ""extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms."" n102 While ""dangerous and unusual"" arms may fall outside of the Amendment's scope, it certainly covers small arms (in that instance, handguns) that are ""typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,"" like self-defense. n103</p><p>There is no standard definition of ""assault weapon,"" but the phrase generally refers to a semiautomatic rifle with a detachable magazine and one or more of a handful of common cosmetic features, such as a pistol grip, forward grip, barrel shroud, collapsing or folding stock, or threaded barrel. n104 Despite purposeful attempts by gun control advocates to conflate these guns in the public mind with machine guns and select-fire assault rifles, semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips and barrel shrouds are functionally identical to all other semi-automatic rifles.</p><p>Semi-automatic rifles--with or without the cosmetic features decried by gun control advocates as being ""military-style""--are the exact type of bearable small arms whose civilian possession is protected by the Second Amendment. n105 Even as early as 1994, well before Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, the Supreme Court referred to these rifles as weapons that ""traditionally have been widely accepted as lawful possessions."" n106 This is even more true today, when tens of millions of these rifles are currently in the hand of peaceable, law-abiding citizens who will never use them to harm themselves or others. n107</p><p>If bans on so-called ""assault weapons"" are struck down under in post-Bruen litigation (as they should be), public safety will not be meaningfully impacted. To begin with, these bans have never been clearly associated with measurable increases in public safety. There exists no plausible causal mechanism explaining how such a ban could lead to fewer gun crimes given how rarely rifles of any kind are actually used to commit crimes and how easily ""non-assault weapon"" versions of the same firearm could be used just as effectively by criminals in the vast majority of cases. n108 During the past decade, rifles of any kind were known to be used in only 3 percent to 4 percent of homicides, without any clarity on how many of those rifles were ""assault weapons"" compared to other types of ""non-assault"" rifles. n109 The average American is, in fact, several times more likely to be stabbed to death than he or she is to be shot to death with a rifle of any kind. n110</p><p>Similarly, handguns are by far the weapon of choice in non-fatal firearm crimes. n111 Even if enforcement were immediate and total, such that no criminal could ever again access a pistol-gripped semi-automatic rifle, most crimes (in fact, virtually all crimes) could just as easily and effectively be carried out with a ban-compliant firearm of the same caliber. It is little wonder, then, the official government report on the 1994 federal assault weapons ban--which expired in 2004-- determined that ""[s]hould it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. [Assault weapons] were rarely used in gun crimes even before the ban."" n112</p><p>Indeed, the primary concern raised by advocates of assault weapons bans is related to the least common type of firearm violence--mass public shootings, which account for a fraction of a percent of all gun homicides every year, although they certainly garner a lot of attention for understandable reasons. n113 Gun control advocates, politicians, and the media routinely characterize semi-automatic rifles, specifically the AR-15, as the ""weapon of choice"" for mass public shooters. This is far from an accurate depiction of the facts. Of 82 mass public shootings that occurred between 2012 and 2022, 38 involved shooters who used handguns alone while only 17 involved shooters who used rifles alone. n114 Even if this analysis includes the 19 mass public shootings in which the perpetrator possessed a combination of firearms including a rifle, most mass public shootings still would not involve the use of a rifle. n115</p><p>To the extent that semi-automatic rifles are utilized by mass shooters, it is because they are popular among all Americans, the vast majority of whom will never use them for any unlawful purpose, much less a mass shooting. Moreover, some of the deadliest mass public shootings in United States history have been carried out with nothing more than handguns. This includes the worst school shooting in U.S. history at Virginia Tech in 2006, where the shooter was able to fire 174 rounds in roughly 11 minutes, killing 30 people and wounding 17 others with nothing more than common, relatively low-caliber handguns. n116 Similarly, in 1991, a shooter at a Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 19 with two handguns. n117</p><p>The reality is that, even if all would-be mass public shooters were successfully diverted to the use of ""non-assault weapons,"" it would likely have no meaningful impact on their ability to kill large numbers of unarmed civilians. n118 With only a few arguable exceptions, such as the 2018 Las Vegas shooting, the type of firearm was not a major factor in the ability of mass shooters to cause significant casualties, particularly compared to other important factors such as the time the shooter remained unconfronted by a meaningful response. n119 This is because both ""assault weapons"" and ""non-assault weapons"" are functionally the exact same firearms and expel the exact same caliber of bullets with the exact same muzzle velocity, impacting the victim's body in the exact same manner.</p><p>At the same time, the millions of Americans who own these firearms do so for the same reasons that police departments across the country now routinely issue them to their peace officers, who are, by definition, not authorized to wage offensive warfare or ""kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time."" n120 In short, they are incredibly useful tools against criminal threats that commonly arise in a civilian context. Civilians can and do use them to great effect in defense of themselves and others. n121</p><p>Magazine Capacity Limitations</p><p>Again, even before Bruen the Court had made clear that the Second Amendment's protections are not limited to the technology that existed in 1792. n122 Multi-shot firearms were well-known to the Founding generation, and the trend in firearm manufacturing toward increased ammunition capacity was already well underway by the time the Second Amendment was ratified. n123 Rifles with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition first achieved mass-market success in the late 1860s, while handguns with such magazines first became popular in the 1930s. n124 By the 1960s and 1970s, advancements in magazine technology had made magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds the factory standard for many of the most popular firearms on the civilian market, with millions of such firearms being sold. n125 As one might guess from the longstanding popularity of 10+ round magazines by civilians, attempts to limit magazine capacity for civilians are a modern phenomenon. Far from being rooted in some historical tradition of regulation, the first laws even remotely resembling modern bans on large-capacity magazines did not arise until the 1930s--and two of the three were repealed within decades. n126 Even today, magazine capacity limits exist in only a minority of states, most of which did not impose those limitations until the 21st century. n127 It is therefore incredibly difficult to see how any court could uphold such modern bans while remaining faithful to Heller and Bruen.</p><p>As with bans on semi-automatic firearms deemed ""assault weapons,"" the public safety implications are minimal should post-Bruen litigation result in bans on ""large-capacity magazines"" being struck down as unconstitutional. Most gun crimes are not targeted shooting attempts, but rather robberies and aggravated assaults in which the perpetrator brandishes--but does not fire--the gun. n128 Even with respect to the minority of gun crimes in which perpetrators fire their weapon, it is not at all clear that magazine capacity limits offer meaningful benefits. Only a small percentage of homicides involve two or more victims, which are the types of crimes most likely to require an offender to fire more than 10 rounds. n129 Unsurprisingly, an official analysis of the 1994 federal law prohibiting their sale concluded that there was ""no evidence of reductions in multiple-victim gun homicides or multiple-gunshot wound victimizations"" as a result of the prohibition. n130 This is hardly surprising, given that the ""banned.. .magazines were used in only a modest fraction of gun crimes before the law."" n131 Moreover, later analyses have determined that the proportion of all multiple-victim homicides actually increased slightly during the first half of the federal ban, before stabilizing around 2000 and remaining consistently around 4.5 percent until 2008, when the most recent report was apparently published. n132</p><p>It is little wonder, then, that proponents of magazine capacity limitations have increasingly turned away from arguments that these laws will lower crime rates, generally, and instead focus on their alleged impact on the least common type of gun violence--mass public shootings. n133 One of the most popular arguments raised in favor of limiting magazine capacity for civilians is that mass public shooters may use standard capacity magazines to inflict higher numbers of casualties, namely by decreasing the number of times they need to reload. Again, even assuming widespread compliance and effective enforcement, limiting magazine capacity is unlikely to meaningfully lower casualty rates in mass public shootings. First, mass public shooters can (and routinely do) work around these limitations by bringing several firearms and extra loaded magazines, easily replacing expended magazines within seconds. n134 Moreover, an analysis of data from mass public shootings shows that most perpetrators do not actually use magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds, and that regardless, mass public shooters typically do not fire at a fast enough rate for casualty counts to be attributed to magazine capacity. n135 This conclusion is supported by the findings of various panels analyzing the effect of magazine capacity for individual mass shootings, as well as by the reality that high casualty counts have occurred during shootings where only ""limited-capacity"" magazines were used. n136</p><p>It is not just that these laws have little practical effect on criminal actions--at the same time, they undermine the practical ability of peaceable citizens to defend themselves in those scenarios where the need for armed self-defense is most acute, such as when they are outnumbered, outgunned, or otherwise placed at a tactical disadvantage. n137 These scenarios of tactical disadvantage are almost certainly more common for peaceable citizens than for criminals, who have the upper hand in planning and executing their crimes. Unlike law-abiding citizens, who must reactively defend themselves whenever and under whatever circumstances they are victimized, criminals can (and often do) wait for (or even create) the most advantageous circumstances. For example, a significant percentage of homicides, robberies, and other violent crimes involve multiple offenders. n138 Multiple-offender homicides, in particular, are becoming increasingly common, with roughly one out of every five homicides in 2008 involving multiple offenders. n139</p><p>Indeed, gun control advocates arguably concede this point on the potential importance of being able to fire more than 10 rounds without reloading when they support magazine capacity laws that universally exempt law enforcement officers, including in their off-duty capacities and with their personal firearms. Law enforcement officers in the United States are peace officers acting in a civilian context, and generally speaking respond to the same criminal threats first faced by the peaceable citizens who called them for assistance in the first place. The circumstances under which they may use deadly force largely parallel the laws of self-defense for civilians. While off-duty, their powers of arrest and investigation are, in many cases, based solely on the rights of citizens' arrest possessed by all other members of society. And while most civilian defensive gun uses do not involve any rounds being fired, much less more than ten rounds being fired, the same is true of police-involved shootings. n140 To whatever extent, then, that standard capacity magazines are useful for law enforcement officers, they are equally useful for civilians who face those same threats.</p><p>B. Bruen Does Not Realistically Threaten a Variety of Far More Effective Public Safety Measures</p><p>Just because Bruen is likely to threaten several laws that were ineffective at protecting the public in the first place does not mean that the opinion leaves the government without other valid and effective tools. Bruen, and the post-Bruen cases outlined above, were abundantly clear about the plethora of constitutionally legitimate measures at the government's disposal.</p><p>With respect to public carry, the Bruen majority made clear that certain regulations have ample historical support. These include limitations on the intent for which a person can carry firearms in public, on the manner by which one carries firearms in public, and on the ""exceptional circumstances"" under which a person may not carry firearms in public. n141 Moreover, while the government may not declare wide swaths of the public sphere off limits under the guise that it all constitutes a ""sensitive place,"" the Court looked favorably on a ""sensitive places"" doctrine properly limited to areas like legislative assemblies, polling places, courthouses, and their modern analogues. n142 Neither the Supreme Court nor any post-Bruen lower court has questioned the constitutional validity of shall-issue frameworks that require applicants to receive training before carrying public. n143</p><p>Under Bruen, it is almost unquestionable that the government may prohibit gun possession for those convicted of violent criminal offenses, who threaten to commit violent acts against other, or who are mentally ill and dangerous to themselves or others. The government can also protect the public by holding those charged with criminal offenses in pre-trial detention or imposing gun prohibitions as a condition of pre-trial release. It can choose to pursue incarceration for violent offenders instead of probation or parole. Or, in the alternative, it can impose gun prohibitions as a condition of diversionary programs, deferred sentencing agreements, or probation or parole.</p><p>The catch, however, is that this means state and local prosecutors have to actually pursue criminal charges against violent offenders or file petitions for civil commitment proceedings. It means that they have to seek pre-trial detention against people who they believe are dangerous. It means that federal prosecutors have to step in and pursue federal charges and federal detention when local rogue prosecutors are willing to let violent criminals terrorize communities.</p><p>This last point in particular raises an important question to which this Committee should seek answers--what, exactly, is this Justice Department actually doing to pursue charges in [Sec.] 922(g) felon-in-possession cases? The last time I testified before this body, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams sat next to me and told you:</p><p>An overall lack of accountability for violent offenders is contributing to the rise in gun violence. In some of our major cities, district attorneys are not prosecuting serial firearm offenders, [and] judges continue to release violent offenders on low or no bond. To address these challenges Congress must provide resources to the U.S. Attorney's offices to support additional federal prosecution, as appropriate. n144</p><p>The Justice Department has done a lot since then. For example, via agency fiat, it turned tens of thousands of peaceable AR-pistol owners into felons if they did not register their guns and pay the government $200. It has certainly made a big stink about shutting down every gun store it can the first time they see a clerical error. And sure, the Justice Department says on a nice little memo that it is really extra super serious about prosecuting gun crimes--but are they targeting the small subset of repeat offenders who are overwhelmingly responsible for terrorizing innocent people? Is there any actual evidence that they are ramping up efforts to step in and prosecute violent offenders for felon-in-possession, particularly in the cities most plagued by local rogue prosecutors refusing to add gun enhancements? Because thus far, I can find none. n145</p><p>The reality is that these available methods under Bruen are far more effective at protecting the public than the laws Bruen threatens. This point is perhaps nowhere as obvious as in United States v. Rahimi, the case so many gun control advocates have decried as literally ""going to get women killed."" Any sane, sober, and prudent observer would have looked at the underlying facts of that defendant's initial domestic violence charges and realized that he presented a serious risk of violence and should not have been released from pre-trial detention. Instead of ensuring that any of his victims were protected from further injury, the government chose to rely on a civil protection order--a piece of paper saying ""please refrain from owning guns."" And, predictably, this violent individual simply ignored that piece of paper on his way to ignoring a number of other laws about not shooting at people, endangering the lives of nearly a dozen more innocent victims.</p><p>True, Bruen does not allow Rahimi to be charged for having a gun while under a protection order, because it does not allow the government to disarm via such actions in the first place. But Bruen certainly would have authorized the government to seek to have Rahimi detained while facing charges for violently assaulting two women. It would also have authorized the government to seek to have a court disarm Rahimi as a condition of his pre-trial release (a condition he likely would have ignored just as flippantly as he did the restraining order). Regardless of Bruen, Rahimi is likely going to spend a good number of his remaining years in state prison for committing violent crimes. And, under Bruen, if and when Rahimi is released from prison, the government can prohibit him from possessing firearms as a convicted violent felon.</p><p>Bruen is not ""going to get women killed.""</p><p>It will force the government to actually utilize the more effective tools it already has at its disposal to protect women, and all other members of the public, from violent individuals.</p><p>And just as importantly, it will allow more innocent victims to better protect themselves from any violent offenders the government refuses to pursue or prosecute.</p><p>Media-Verified Cases of Successful Defensive Gun Use Against Intimate Partner Violence, January 1, 2021, to March 10, 2023 n146</p><p>Date.........Location.........Secondary Context........................Protective Order?...............Min.

Nevertheless, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) effectively authorizes off-duty and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in public, in any state, subject only to certain federal restrictions. See 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 926B-C; FAQ On Amendments to the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, NRA Explore (last accessed Mar. 11, 2023), <url normalizedValue=""https://le.nra.org/understanding-leosa/freauently-asked-auestions/"">https://le.nra.org/understanding-leosa/freauently-asked-auestions/</url>. Meanwhile, concealed carry permit holders wishing to carry in another state are reliant on state-level reciprocity agreements or must apply for a non-residents' permit in the state in which they wish to carry. Often, the most gun-restrictive states either do not recognize the permits of the vast majority of other states, and in many cases effectively do not authorize non-residents to obtain permits. In any case, concealed carry permit holders who cross state lines are subject to a complex and complicated web of restrictions that can change even between individual counties and cities.

Of note, the victim was shot shortly after leaving her place of work and while walking to a bus stop to take public transportation home. Id. While the victim had a concealed carry permit, it is possible that her company's weapons policy forbade her from carrying while at work. If this is the case, she likely would not have be able to carry to or from work, either, as she would not have a place to safely store her firearm during work hours. This type of scenario--where concealed carry permit holders are forced, for logistically reasons, to disarm themselves for much longer than any particular law or policy would require in a vacuum--is far from uncommon.</p><p>n49 SWAT Situation With Armed Man in W.

The factor that most obviously impacted the casualty count in this shooting was not the shooter's use of a pistol-gripped rifle, but his use of a bump stock device, which significantly increased his rate of fire. There is at least a facially plausible argument that the shooter's use of foregrips and pistol grips enabled him to better hit his targets from a distance of almost 500 yards than if his firearms did not have such features. However, there are several problems with this argument. First, the shooter does not appear to have been pinpointing specific victims, but rather attempting to fire as many rounds as possible at the general mass of concertgoers. Given that his target was comprised of thousands of potential victims packed tightly together in a large, open space, any potential slight decrease in accuracy rendered by the use of a ""featureless"" rifle would likely have resulted not in fewer casualties, but merely a different set of casualties. Second, while it is still unclear which of the shooter's dozens of firearms were actually used that night, many of them were attached with bipods--common devices for hunting and marksmanship that allow the shooter to rest the front end of the firearm in a stable and elevated position. The use of these devices--which are not features of ""assault weapons""--would have provided far more stability from the shooter's ""sniper's nest"" vantage point than would a foregrip or pistol grip. Moreover, from such a position, there are a variety of methods the shooter could have used with a featureless rifle to stabilize the firearm even without a bipod or foregrip, such as resting the forestock on a bag or chairback.</p><p>n120 English, 2021 National Firearms Survey, supra note 34, at 33-34.</p><p>n121 Data from the 2021 National Firearms Survey suggests that rifles are used in roughly 13 percent of defensive gun uses, though it is unclear how many of these rifles are semi-automatic ""assault weapons"" compared to other types of rifles. Id. at 10-16. Media-verified defensive gun uses often do not include specific information on the type of weapon used, much less clearly distinguish between various types of rifles. However, it is abundantly clear that civilians, just like law enforcement officers, can and do rely on these weapons for self-defense.

Viewers of the new 'Raymond on the Road' segment were treated to scenes of boarded-up homes and filthy encampments populated by homeless people.Advertisement FREE Trump 2020 Hat While Supplies Last - [Claim Yours][2] South Bend right now is 'a place where the local population here — 25 percent of them — live beneath the poverty line. And crime has risen to 20-year highs, with violent assaults exceeding by 173 percent the national average. And there are a lot of abandoned homes here,' Arroyo reported, noting that he was standing just a few miles from 'the golden dome of Notre Dame.'AdvertisementArroyo spoke with a number of residents of the city for their take on Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential candidacy in light of the economic worries in South Bend. </p><p>'We've got a mayor that's more concerned about politics right now than he is about public safety in our own city, and it's infuriating,' said Harvey Mills, president of the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police. 'Now the public sees us as villains,' Mills added. 'They're looking at police officers as someone that wants to hurt them, not help them,' he said, explaining why it's tougher for law enforcement to do their jobs right now. 'And morale is at an all-time low, as far as I'm concerned. I've been a police officer here for 27 years. This is the lowest I've ever seen it.' 'And it's mainly due to the mayor's lack of public support for our officers.'SPREAD THE WEALTH WHO?Inside The Obamas $15 Million Dollar House of Hypocrisy on Martha's Vineyard[3]Advertisement Mills said that 'more than 10 officers have been shot at' since the Eric Logan shooting case in June of this year. 'We attribute that to the racism remarks that Mayor Pete has been spewing, and demoralizing our police department and the public. You know, the public is now afraid to approach us.' A South Bend police sergeant on June 16 was involved in a shooting that killed an African-American man, Eric Logan, who was 54 — sparking outrage in the community.Sergeant Ryan O'Neill fatally shot Logan during a dispute; O'Neill is currently the subject of a special prosecutor investigation and a civil lawsuit, as a CBS News Indiana[4] affiliate reported. The St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office said Logan was holding a knife as he approached an officer who was responding to a report of a person breaking into cars. Sergeant O'Neill told authorities[5] later that he fired his weapon only after Logan refused police orders to drop the knife.Advertisement O'Neill was not wearing a body camera — which has raised questions for many. O'Neill has since resigned his police position.Logan — the man who died in the shooting — was a convicted felon who was brandishing an eight-inch hunting knife, police authorities said. 'Honestly, I can't wait to get out,' one South Bend resident told Arroyo for 'The Ingraham Angle' segment. 'I get tired of hearing shootings every night.' Several others whom Arroyo interviewed mentioned their disdain for the downtown area — they said they won't and don't like to go there at night. 'My message to the mayor is to drop the politics and be a leader for the city that he was sworn to be a leader for,' said Mills of the Fraternal Order of Police.Some people, however, do support the mayor. 'I like Mayor Pete I support him 100 percent,' one woman told Arroyo. And many people give him credit for new construction and other initiatives in the city.Advertisement But a poll in early July showed that Mayor Pete 'continued to receive zero support from black Democratic voters as he fell below five percent in overall support after last week's debates,' as Newsweek[6] reported last month.

The 45th anniversary of a key U.S. Supreme Court decision, which ruled against a cross-city school busing effort in metro Detroit, comes during a time of renewed debate about busing to achieve desegregation. Koby worked with Kalyn Belsha, a reporter from our Chalkbeat National bureau, to provide a look at that historic ruling, as well as a new report out Thursday that shed light on the ways district boundaries continue to divide students by race and resources. Detroit figures prominently in the report. But it also highlights boundaries between Oak Park and Berkley school districts, as well as other school districts in Michigan. You can read Koby and Kalyn's story here[1]. And you can read the full report here[2]. Meanwhile, next week 20 Democratic presidential candidates will descend on Detroit for two big debates. As someone who cares deeply about education issues, I'm hoping education will be front and center — or at least get more than the passing references it received when 10 presidential candidates participated in a forum during the NAACP convention this week in Detroit. So I have a question for our Rise ...ine readers: What do you want to hear from the candidates about education next week? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Email me at <email normalizedValue=""mailto:lhiggins@chalkbeat.org.[3]"">lhiggins@chalkbeat.org.[3]</email>; Have a great weekend, and don't forget to scroll down for more education news. </p><p>— Lori Higgins, senior reporter Rise ...ine is Chalkbeat's morning digest of education news. Subscribe[4] to have it delivered to your inbox.;SCHOOL DESEGREGATION The stubborn persistence of racial segregation in Detroit schools can be traced back to Milliken v. Bradley[5], a pivotal Supreme Court case decided 45 years ago this week. Chalkbeat [6]Michigan Radio[7] HOMELESS CHILDREN A sobering new report says there could be more than 15,000 homeless children ages 4 or younger in Michigan, with more than one in 10 in several rural counties lacking stable housing. Bridge Magazine[8] FOUR YEAR ASK Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is reviewing a proposal from the Benton Harbor school board that asks for four years to improve the district high school. Detroit News[9] WSJM[10] ABC57[11] WHO'S IN CHARGE A letter from the president of the Wayne-Westland school board suggests the district may not be complying with a recent court order. Hometown Life[12] SCHOOL COUNSELORS A northern Michigan school district is hiring two new school counselors to address the emotional needs of students. Record Eagle[13] TEACHER PREP A Michigan college is reinstating a teacher education program because of renewed interest and teacher shortages. MLive[14] A-F GRADES An op-ed from the executive director of a school choice advocacy organization says parents are counting on A-F school letter grades from the state.

Where are many of them looking? Main streets and town centers in smaller cities in middle America, according to aNew York Times report[1]. This story goes against the narrative that Opportunity Zone money will end up largely in places like Manhattan, Brooklyn, San Francisco, and other destinations that are already overheated with development. A good deal of the moneywillend up in such places, but theTimesstory suggests that this investment will spreadfar and wide. </p><p>This makes sense to me for three reasons. Opportunity Zones are a decentralized program and funds are easy to set up, even for small developers. A decentralized program points to decentralized geography. Second, the sheer size of the program—with $6 trillion in potential capital gains waiting to be invested—means that capital cannot pour into a few places and meet the deadline for getting projects started. Third, destinations where land prices are already sky high may not offer the best future returns. I believe the best potential for Opportunity Zones, given current markets, is in mixed-use, walkable places. How many of the zones have plans, infrastructure, and coding in place for significant mixed-use development? Preparation is key. 'What's the difference between an Opportunity Zone project idea, and an opportunity zone project? One word: Readiness,' notes Ian Ross, founder of the websiteOppsites[2]. Cities with shovel-ready plans for downtowns and neighborhoods, which are also OZs, could see many of their projects move forward more quickly. These cities offer a wide variety of sizes and locations in urban and suburban contexts. Ranson, West Virginia, a small city about an hour and a half from DC, is one example of a place with extensive new urban plans and Opportunity Zones. The market demand for urbanism will continue to grow in the next decade, and such cities could offer an affordable urban lifestyle alternative to central city neighborhoods. The more investment comes in via OZs, the more value will grow in a place like Ranson.Powhatan Place rendering. Source: City of Ranson'The Powhatan Place (former foundry on Mildred Street) community's ultimate goal is to create a more livable and sustainable community in Old Town Ranson and Charles Town—a place where residents can live where they work, walk to shop, and have easy access to nature and recreation,' according to anOppsites listing[3]. For another illustration, see Westminster, Colorado, where a new downtown is being built for a suburban city with no existing walkable downtown—on 105-acre former shopping mall site (see rendering at top of article). Downtown Westminster's plan comprises 2,300 residential units, including substantial affordable housing, and 1.7 million square feet of commercial uses, such as a grocery store, shops, restaurants, a movie theater, and office space. There will be 18 publicly accessible parks and civic spaces. Construction of the first phase is well underway. It is likely that Downtown Westminster would be built without an opportunity zone—yet the OZ status will give the project a lift and reduce the likelihood of it stalling. When all of the phases are built out, the city has plans to make the downtown even larger by extending the street grid to adjacent sites. Notes one city official: 'Having land control allows us to better negotiate getting affordable housing. We highly value equity and inclusivity and think it should be part of our vision.' Downtown Westminster is designed as a 'place' that will grow incrementally over time, serving as 'the center of public life in a community that has evolved from a purely suburban growth paradigm,' explains the project designers, Torti Gallas + Partners. All of downtown Detroit and surrounding neighborhoods are Opportunity Zones. Downtown Detroit's resurgence this decade is well known, but parts of the city center have received relatively little investment. The creation of a new public space on the west side of the Central Business District is spurring development.Beacon Park was built to anchor an emerging district, spur economic growth within the neighborhood, and provide a high-quality gathering space for Detroit residents.Beacon Park. Source: livingLABand TouloukianTouloukianThrough an inclusive community engagement process, an idea for a pop-up park on a large vacant parcel grew over time into a plan, and then construction, of a permanent square with a restaurant, community gathering space, and large circular lawn. Located on Grand River Avenue, one of downtown's five radiating arteries, the park serves as a gateway to downtown from the west, and will make investment into the area through an Opportunity Zone more attractive. 'The transformation of this space is nothing short of remarkable,' says Mayor Michael Duggan. Elkhart, a city of 52,000 in north Indiana, is not a place that is well known nationally for its urban revival. Yet Elkhart adopted a plan for a $400 million, 90-acre 'River District' across from downtown. The district offers a setting for a great deal of urbanist development, including a thousand housing units, 170,000 square feet of retail space, 110,000 square feet of office space, and a hotel—all in an Opportunity Zone. A project like this in a small city may seem unlikely, but it is moving forward quickly. Elkhart Common Council last week approved[4] a development loan to support a major project in the district, including a supermarket and 134 residential units. Planning is by Speck ...sociates and StantecUrban Places.Town square at the heart of the Elkhart River District.The rules for Opportunity Zones are still not finalized, and the impact of this federal program will not be known for some time. That said, Opportunity Zones aregenerating interest[5]at a level that indicates this program will live up to its hypewith regard to level of investment. Significant potential for urbanism lies outside of central locations in East and West Coast cities. This potential is likely to get a boost from Opportunity Zones. The biggest support willcome where the public sector has established the ground rules and infrastructure for compact urbanism.
