An[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 also in how he has been able to be openly gay in the most mainstream of political arenas.38 Back [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2uring P[ORGANIZATION]SON14s first campaign, the wor[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2 was that his a[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2visers [P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2i[P[ORGANIZATION]SON]2nt want him to call too much attention to his being black.

Affordable for whom? It is not just a question from communities within the footprint of every proposed rezoning in [PERSON]. It is a question that is being asked across the nation. More than in any campaign in recent memory, housing has become a key topic in the DATE2 presidential race, reflecting a national housing crisis spanning from megacities like GPE2 and [PERSON] to smaller urban centers like [PERSON] and rural areas like [PERSON], GPE6.According to some research, home prices in 70 percent of the country are more than average household can afford."
southbend,2020-02-10T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,South Bend Tribune,"homeless, homelessness, housing crisis, affordable housing","DATE0, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis","[ORGANIZATION] found that in [ORGANIZATION], 38 percent of all renter households were rent burdened, an increase of about 19 percent from [LOCATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], where Democratic hopeful [ORGANIZATION] is mayor, there are 400 homeless households. In former Mayor [PERSON] town, there are nearly 60,000 people living in homeless shelters. According to [ORGANIZATION], almost 7 million housing units are needed to make up for the lack of affordable housing stock in the country. DATE2, the [ORGANIZATION] administration took steps that could have a heavy impact on the future of housing, such as creating ORG2, chaired by [ORGANIZATION], which will look at ways to reform local zoning laws that prevent the construction of multifamily housing units. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] proposed a revision to the [ORGANIZATION] administrations anti-discrimination Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule Secretary [PERSON] proposed that rules implementation and method be left up to local jurisdictions rather than the federal government. Some candidates have come up with comprehensive, ambitious housing plans while others have proposed more modest responses. Housing policy experts and advocates say this is the first time in modern history that housing has become a main presidential issue and also the first time moderators asked a question about affordable [PERSON]g during a nationally televised Democratic presidential debates. The core of the crisis is the lack of affordable housing for lower income households, and voters are interested in knowing the candidates housing plans before they make a vote, says [PERSON], the president and CEO of [LOCATION]. In some cities and towns, there are enough apartments or housing-but there are not enough households who can afford those housing units.Its a multifaceted problem, and there are already federal programs in [STREET] aimed at addressing some aspects of italthough they appear to be falling short. The mix of targets and tools means the candidates plans share broad similarities and some striking differences.Theres actually quite a bit of overlap, says [ORGANIZATION], a fellow at [ORGANIZATION] at ORG6. The first is that they acknowledge that there are people who have low incomes who cant afford housing. Thats basically a national problem that everywhere in the country, there are some people who just earn so little that they cant afford to pay rent that would cover the operating costs on a basic apartment.The second big box idea is that they need to talk about is the fact that in some places like GPE2 and [PERSON], we havent been building enough new housing to keep up with demand, and most of the candidates have acknowledged that, adds PERSON8. And then the third big point, is talking about racial disparities in housing markets the past history of discrimination for things like mortgage lending and the degree of racial segregation that still exists in most cities.Of course, comparing what the candidates propose is just one lens. Whether the ideas are legally, financially and politically viable is another key test. With that in mind, heres a detailed look at the key housing proposals from candidates in [ORGANIZATION].PERSON9 specificsFor [PERSON], [PERSON]0 served as a GPE4 senator until he became Vice President in the [ORGANIZATION] administration. During his time as Senator, [PERSON]1 co-sponsored or sponsored 11 pieces of legislation related to housing and development ranging from [ORGANIZATION]-which allowed the [ORGANIZATION] secretary to purchase vacant, single-family homes-to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of [ORGANIZATION] to include persons with disabilities including other measures. The Fair Housing Amendments Act, which expanded the forms of discrimination deemed violative of fair-housing laws, and enlarged the list of classes protected from housing discrimination to include the disabled. [PERSON]1 in [LOCATION]. Although [PERSON]1 has not released a comprehensive housing plan like his rivals [PERSON]2, [PERSON]3, [PERSON]4 or [ORGANIZATION]0  [PERSON]1s campaign does focus on investing in the middle class through entrepreneurship and community investments.We have spoken to almost every candidate and I am bewildered that [PERSON]1 has not put out a plan yet, says [PERSON]6.The [PERSON]1 campaign raised 61 million at last report. After retirees and law firms, the real estate industry is the third-biggest source of [PERSON]1s contributions, according to ORG7. Dozens of smaller contributions in increments ranging from 2.50 to 5,600 were made by several GPE2 real-estate developers. Other contributions include 3,500 from [PERSON]8 a GPE5-based developer. [PERSON]4 A vow to cut homelessnessAs mayor of the nations largest city for DATE8, Mike [PERSON]4 oversaw the largest public housing authority in the country, ran a [INSTITUTION] system under a unique local legal right to shelter and helped regulate one of the largest biggest real-estate markets in the world. That gives him a deeper track record  for praise andor scrutiny  than any of the other candidates in the race, even the other mayors [ORGANIZATION]0, currently, and, formerly, [ORGANIZATION]1.That record is decidedly mixed. [PERSON]4 rezoned 40 percent of the city, but some of those zonings prevented any increase in affordable housing. His housing plan generated lots of units 165,000 but many of them were unaffordable to the neighborhoods in which they were built. He made big promises on reducing homelessness, but cut off the supply of Section 8 and public housing to the shelters. Until late in his term, he did little for [ORGANIZATION]4.[PERSON]4 laid out his housing plan for the nation in DATE9. He plans on guaranteeing housing vouchers to all Americans at or below 30 percent of the area median income, which is an estimated 28,830 for a household of three help families stay in their homes by funding emergency financial assistance expand federal grants to cities that implement effective eviction prevention programs and create pilot programs for tenant counseling and legal-advice services. He would also raise [ORGANIZATION] and increase [ORGANIZATION] for low-income households. Mike [PERSON]4 For access to housing, [PERSON]4 plans on recruiting more landlords into the voucher system and reducing the red tape within that system. He says he will use regulation and incentives to mitigate discrimination by landlords. He will also establish navigator services to help tenants find and secure housing. Additionally, [PERSON]4 plans to cut the homeless population in half using existing federal resources coupled with initiatives by local governments. He wants to double federal spending on homelessness from under 3 billion to 6 billion [LOCATION]0. He says he will increase federal support for housing-first strategies and provide housing-search support and short-term rental assistance. As preventative measures, he wants to expand the promotion of rapid-rehousing and permanent supportive housing, providing stability to the chronically homeless to address issues such as substance use disorder and mental-health services where needed and serving as a bridge to rental assistance. He will also integrate homeless support with critical wrap-around services and expand federal grants to cities that implement effective homelessness prevention programs.In order to increase housing supply, [PERSON]4 plans on increasing funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and prioritizing new transportation funding for areas that have undertaken progressive zoning reform and reward municipalities that support affordable housing development in neighborhoods with good schools, transportation, and economic opportunity. He will also provide funding for public housing by streamlining [ORGANIZATION] program and increasing funding to ORG9. Additionally, his plan will provide resources to help homeowners, building owners, and tenants for energy-saving renovations. He will also increase funding for energy retrofits and fully fund the existing Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program which helps mitigate home energy, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs costs. For tenants, [PERSON]4 wants to help renters become homeowners through a pilot program targeted to assist people with down payments for new homes, provide federal matching funds to offer all residents of the 100 communities as down payment and expand access to financial services. His goal includes one million new African-American homeowners. For local governments, [PERSON]4 wants streamline investments to address the housing crisis by building on President [ORGANIZATION]s Strong Cities, [ORGANIZATION] initiative by driving an interagency effort from [ORGANIZATION]0. The [ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION]1 initiative was created to give technical assistance to local governments in order to execute their economic vision and strategies through public and private partnerships. [PERSON]4, a billionaire, is financing his own campaign to the tune of 200 million so far and is not accepting contributions. [ORGANIZATION]0 Douglass Plan targets vacant-land potentialDecades younger than most of his presidential rivals , [ORGANIZATION] came onto the campaign stage with experience as mayor of [ORGANIZATION]. His housing plan was released [LOCATION]2 [LOCATION]3 along with several other plans to help middle-to low-income households by lowering child care costs, making college more affordable, lowering health care costs and furthering consumer rights protections. [ORGANIZATION]0s housing plan is similar in scope to Senators [PERSON]2 and [PERSON]3s housing plans. He will invest 430 billion to create access to affordable housing for over 7 million households and to create an additional 2 million housing units through creation and preservation initiatives. He also plans on working to reform local zoning laws. He wants to also invest in homeownership and is looking to facilitate homeownership of one million low-income households. Refoming zoning is a common theme among the Democrats. PERSON8 says this is new territory for federal policy.  Because thats really new, its hard to say at this point that any of those are more likely to succeed or even more likely to get adopted, she says.Another [ORGANIZATION]0 plan is to target redlined neighborhoods part of a comprehensive plan, known as [ORGANIZATION], to mitigate racial and income in equities, particularly in communities of color. The Douglass Plan lists several initiatives ranging from criminal justice to health equity reforms. Mayor [ORGANIZATION] Within [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION]0s housing agenda includes the Community Homestead Act in which cities would apply for federal funding to operate land banks to acquire vacant properties and provide them to low-income families under a [LOCATION]4 residency obligation.PERSON8 notes [ORGANIZATION] offers more to cities like [ORGANIZATION] or GPE6 or GPE7 where there are swathes of land with city-owned houses in certain poor conditions, but was not tailored for larger cities where vacant space is rare.It is not the first time [ORGANIZATION]0 has pushed to create housing. After he was elected to Mayor of [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]1, he created a task force to analyze the citys vacancy stock which identified 1,900 vacant and 1,275 abandoned properties to renovate and reuse. In a report, similar to [ORGANIZATION], the task force recommended establishing a land bank to encourage neighborhood revitalization efforts such as renovating homes with violations. In response in [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION]0 launched a 1,000 Homes in a [DATE] initiative with a budget of 10.5 million dollars funded by [ORGANIZATION]s [ORGANIZATION] program, [ORGANIZATION]2, and the states Blight Elimination Program3, a program to bring up property value through revitalization efforts. According to [ORGANIZATION]4, the initiative has met with some success. The city handled 1,122 houses 427 were repaired, 569 were demolished, 10 were deconstructed, six were set aside for repair by community development corporations, and 110 were under contract for demolition. Despite the success, the initiative also came under criticism for displacing some families from debilitated housing, instead of fixing their homes. The [ORGANIZATION] city administration argued that those homes had not been occupied for [LOCATION]5, according to [ORGANIZATION] Tribune5. [ORGANIZATION]0s campaign fundraising has topped 76 million, with an estimated 932,988 from individuals connected to real estate groups, according to ORG7.[ORGANIZATION]5 A broad if modest plan Sen. [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5 Senator [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION]5s rise began when she became GPE8 Attorney. She became the first woman elected Senator in her state in [LOCATION]6 just [LOCATION]7 shy of the [LOCATION]8 foreclosure crisis. At the cusp of the crisis, [ORGANIZATION]5 co-sponsored several [ORGANIZATION] measures ranging from the bills to protect mortgage applicants to an amendment to the tax code allowing some flexibility for homeowners who originally financed their mortgages through a qualified subprime loan. Since then, she has cosponsored several measures to mitigate homelessness, end discrimination against victims of domestic violence, and create easier access to the federal housing voucher program, among over 30 other housing and development bills and amendments. Akin to the housing plans proposed by [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]8 and [ORGANIZATION]1, [ORGANIZATION]5s housing plan is focused on creating affordable housing, mitigating homelessness and creating paths to homeownership but she focuses on tweaking several existing federal programs. [ORGANIZATION]5 plans to fight housing discrimination by creating a new federal grant program for access to free legal counsel for people facing evictions prohibiting discrimination based on income source or the blacklisting of tenants who have been evicted in the past modifying the current Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule and restoring [ORGANIZATION]4 to monitor fair lending practices whose authority has been reduced by the [ORGANIZATION] administration. For tenants, she plans on expanding rental assistance for affordable housing in rural towns by improving access to existing federal programs, and through the purchasing power of [ORGANIZATION]5 and [ORGANIZATION]6, her administration will encourage lenders to serve rural mortgage markets. Additionally, she will expand support for affordable senior housing and direct affordable housing programs to allow retrofitting of rental housing for seniors. She also has plans for major investments in [ORGANIZATION] pilot program, which allows families to use their vouchers in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Additionally, [ORGANIZATION]5 plans on tackling outdated zoning policies by incentivizing cities who change their zoning policies with federal housing and infrastructure grants. As a path to prevent future evictions, she wants to create a personal savings account called UP Accounts for retirement and emergencies. Under her UP Accounts plan, employers will set aside at least 50 cents per hour worked to help people build more than 600,000 in wealth over the course of a career. The funds could also be accessed during emergencies that cause delayed payments for rent. [ORGANIZATION]5 also plans to expand [ORGANIZATION] for developing affordable rental housing and investing in homeless assistance grants that provide emergency and long-term housing. She proposes a new federal tax credit, similar to [ORGANIZATION], to encourage investment in family-owned homes in distressed neighborhoods. She also wants to build on existing programs to allow certain types of rental housing assistance to be used for homeownership expenses and also plans on proposing legislation that will expand access to capital for down payments. She also wants to allow credit bureaus to use on-time payment data from cell phone bills, utilities, and rent in calculating credit scores so it is easier to build credit. During [LOCATION]9 of her presidency, [ORGANIZATION]5 plans on strengthening Community Reinvestment Act protections, developing policies to encourage financial institutions to make loans and investment in local communities. [ORGANIZATION]5 also wants to focus on educating first-time homebuyers through improving education programs that especially target communities with low levels of homeownership. [ORGANIZATION]5 also plans on reversing the [ORGANIZATION] Administrations proposed changes to federal housing subsidies and updating regulations for reverse mortgages, especially for seniors. Her plan for funding some of these existing and new programs will come from raising the capital gains rate to the income tax rate for households making over 400,000, and part of her infrastructure plan, which includes plans for housing, will raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.According to [ORGANIZATION]7 [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]5s campaign has raised an estimated 29 million dollars. Her campaign has raised an estimated 300,741 dollars6 from the real estate industry ranging from a maximum of 2,800 to even one dollar7 in donations, according to ORG7 and the [ORGANIZATION]8. Next to [PERSON]1s punt, [ORGANIZATION]5 offers the most modest plan among the major Democratic candidates.[ORGANIZATION]1 Rent control and moreLast year in DATE20, Senator [PERSON]2 introduced a 2.5 trillion plan to mitigate the growing housing crisis across the country.[ORGANIZATION]1 plans to invest 1.48 trillion in [ORGANIZATION]9 in order to create, preserve and rehabilitate permanently affordable housing units within mixed-income development. An additional 400 billion will be invested to build 2 million mixed-income social housing units also administered through [ORGANIZATION]9. He also plans on investing an additional 500 million dollars in the GPE9 ORG20 ORG21 Section 515 program, an existing rural rental housing loans program to provide affordable rental housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. [ORGANIZATION]1 calls for increasing funding for ORG22 to 3 billion to build, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing in Indian country. [ORGANIZATION]1 also plans on investing 70 billion dollars in improving public housing, including to provide broadband services, and wants to repeal the Faircloth Amendment which does not allow [ORGANIZATION] to construct new public housing units. Sen. [PERSON]2 On Section 8, [ORGANIZATION]1 plans on fully funding the rental assistance program with 410 billion dollars over DATE21 and making it a mandatory funding program for all eligible households. He also plans on expanding and strengthening the enforcement of the Small Area Fair Market Rent rule, which reforms voucher payments to help recipients move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods. When it comes to tenant protections, [ORGANIZATION]1 proposal for national rent regulation would cap DATE22 rent increases at no more than 3 percent while allowing landlords to apply for waivers if significant capital improvements are made on the property. [PERSON]2 has a proposal for whats essentially nationwide rent-control, which is [STREET] outside the box of anything thats been discussed before and Im not totally clear whether thats constitutional. And it would be very difficult to implement, PERSON30 says. He also plans to implement a just-cause requirement for evictions. Additionally, he wants to provide 2 billion towards states and localities right to counsel programs for tenants facing evictions or foreclosure proceedings, or at risk of losing their Section 8 rental assistance.[ORGANIZATION]1 also wants to streamline the review process and direct funding towards implementing fair and inclusive zoning ordinances with a focus on communities that face gentrification. For example, he proposes to [STREET] a 25 percent house flipping tax on speculators who sell a non-owner-occupied property, if the property is sold for more than its purchase price within [DATE] of the procurement. Another proposal from [ORGANIZATION]1 will impose a 2 percent Empty Homes tax on the property value of vacant, owned homes. Hes called for creating an independent agency to protect Section 8 renters from discriminatory landlords, fully funding the existing ORG23 at 1 billion over DATE21 and ensuring formerly incarcerated residents are not excluded from public housing options. [ORGANIZATION]1 wants to use 25,000 ORG24 units in DATE23 for homeless households and also double the funding for the ORG25 homelessness assistance grants to over 26 billion over DATE24 to build permanent supportive housing. Additionally, he plans on providing 500 million in funding to states and localities for homeless outreach programs. [ORGANIZATION]1 also wants to invest 50 billion over DATE25 to provide grants for community land trusts and other shared equity homeownership models and invest an additional 15 billion to enact a 21st Century Homestead Act, which will revitalize abandoned properties and historically disadvantaged communities. For first-time home buyers, he wants to invest an additional 2 billion in ORG21 and an additional 6 billion in [ORGANIZATION] to create a first-time homebuyer assistance program that will increase home ownership. [ORGANIZATION]1 campaign has raised the most money110 millionamong his Democratic counterparts for the [PERSON] presidential elections. According to ORG7, almost 380,000 was donated by members of real-estate groups.[ORGANIZATION]8 Aiming to limit FAC0 roleSen. [PERSON]3 got her start as an academic and became an advisor to ORG26 in [DATE]. But her profile grew after she spoke as a proponent of heavier regulations on banks, especially after the role they played in the [LOCATION]8 financial crisis. Her plan revolves around four main goals reducing rents for lower- and middle- class families closing the racial barriers to housing that the federal government created DATE27 with redlining removing other kinds of discrimination from affordable housing and finally, ending FAC0 heavy influence on the housing market. Sen. [PERSON]3 [ORGANIZATION]8s plan promises 500 billion over DATE25 to build and rehabilitate affordable housing, with almost all of that going to ORG27, a [ORGANIZATION] affordable housing production program. The leftover cash includes over 500 million going into the ORG21s Rural Housing Service8, 2.5 billion into the Indian Housing Block Grant9 and [ORGANIZATION], and 4 billion into creating a new grant called ORG29, designed to help fund housing construction for middle-class families specifically in areas where affordable housing is scarce. A large portion of the 500 billion will be shouldered by private-public partnerships, which puts [ORGANIZATION]8 in line with President [ORGANIZATION]s housing policy.11 To pay for the rest, the bill proposes a lower cap on the estate tax. Instead of taxing inheritances starting at 22 million, [ORGANIZATION]8 proposes the tax start at 7 million, adding about 14,000 more multi-million dollar families to the pool of funding.[ORGANIZATION]8 promises to curb cities exclusionary zoning policies, like mandatory parking requirements12, development fees or minimum lot sizes, which a report from [ORGANIZATION]13 says caused a massive increase in segregation. [ORGANIZATION]8s plan to incentivize cities to axe these policies? [PERSON] a 10 billion carrot. Her bill proposes a new grant program that cities can apply for in order to build infrastructure, schools or parks. [ORGANIZATION]8 also plans to dismantle the effects of redlining14. [ORGANIZATION]8 proposes a substantial housing grant for residents in affected neighborhoods, provided that they have lived there for DATE29, qualify as low-income and are first-time home-buyers. The grant is aimed towards eliminating or easing the cost of a down payment on a home for minorities in disadvantaged areas. She also plans on expanding rights under the Fair Housing Act, which currently prohibits landlords from discriminating on the basis of sex or race. Her bill proposes to expand the act to include sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, and the source of ones income, like a housing voucher.When the [ORGANIZATION]0 acquires single-family homes through foreclosure, it often sells those homes to private equity firms like [ORGANIZATION]1. These firms, in turn, will hike up the price of those homes. [ORGANIZATION]8s plan aims to stop this cycle. [ORGANIZATION]8 would mandate that a minimum of 75 percent of these foreclosed homes are sold directly to an individual owneroccupant, or to a community group that will rehabilitate the home and sell it directly to an owneroccupant. Her plans for tenants focus on rent-burdened households by investing 500 billion over DATE21 to create, preserve, and rehabilitate over 3 million affordable housing units for lower-income families and her plan would lower rents by 10 percent. According to the [ORGANIZATION]8, [ORGANIZATION]8 has raised 82 million. Her campaign has seen an estimated 255,181 dollars from members of the real-estate industry, per ORG7.A broader discussionAs part of [ORGANIZATION]s campaign [ORGANIZATION] which started [LOCATION]2, the national housing advocacy group has issued a list of recommendations it hopes will guide candidates and, eventually, the next presidential administration.The [ORGANIZATION]2 recommendations are four-fold. The first is to preserve and produce deeply affordable homes to meet the 7 million unit shortageat a cost of at least 40 billion, plus another 50 billion dollar investment in repairing public housing. The second policy is funding rental cash assistance and the third recommendation is emergency cash assistance for households who may have faced a medical emergency and lack the funds to pay rent for a period of time. The last policy recommendation is to protect tenants from all discrimination and abuses. PERSON8 believes the housing policy discussion needs to expand even more, to discuss the environmental impactespecially in the context of climate changeof building housing in car-dependent suburbs, and to address the role of housing value in perpetuating the racial wealth gap. Most middle income households, their largest financial asset is the equity in their home thats been pretty detrimental to African-American and [ORGANIZATION] households who are less likely to be homeowners or they become homeowners later in life and tend to buy houses in neighborhoods where prices dont appreciate as much, she says. So the homeownership strategy has created this very large racial wealth gap, and theyre sort of nibbling around the edges of that, but not actually addressing the fact that there are some limits to using homeownership. None of them have explicitly linked this to is there another [STREET] that we can help Americans save money and develop wealth thats not tied to home ownership.Read deeper [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]4, [ORGANIZATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]6 and in [LOCATION], the Fight for Americas Soul in [PERSON] is About Land16 The post [ORGANIZATION]0, Running for President Means Talking About the Housing Crisis17 appeared first on [ORGANIZATION]7.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18"

He joined up with other like-minded people to form Connect[PERSON]259, a small organization dedicated to envisioning a neighborhood free of PERSON27-980. The key thing is that this is public land, [ORGANIZATION]2 said. Public land is for the public good. We should be seeking to maximize the public good, not just accepting whatePERSON28r happens to already be there.

[ORGANIZATION]2 The left should resist the siren song of modern monetary theory [ORGANIZATION]3, [ORGANIZATION]3.

At such a moment, why embrace a theory that has nePERSON28r been tested on a significant scale? To shift toward an economic theory that sees taxes as largely irrelevant to goPERSON28rnment spending is economically and politically unwise.

Thank you!  This entry was posted in [PERSON]795 on [PERSON]8 [DATE] by [PERSON]3 [PERSON]4, PERSON27 [ORGANIZATION] had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. PERSON27 [PERSON] in uniPERSON28rsal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. [PERSON]9 is the prime example, but tuition-free college and [ORGANIZATION]0 also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservatiPERSON28 Republicans can deliPERSON28r on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. PERSON27 dont much care about the ism that deliPERSON28rs the benefits, although whichePERSON28r one does [ORGANIZATION] to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second [PERSON]5 saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. PERSON27 dont much care, as long as the benefits are deliPERSON28red. To me, the key issue  and this is why [PERSON]9 is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the [PERSON]6-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes [PERSON]9, at the PERSON28ry least, a moral and strategic imperatiPERSON28. And that lePERSON28l of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  ePERSON28n the worthy fight to help the refugees [PERSON]7, [PERSON]8, and [PERSON]9 wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock [PERSON] campaigns, one by the [ORGANIZATION]1, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the [ORGANIZATION]2 and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that PERSON27 regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or ePERSON28n rePERSON28rses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies [ORGANIZATION] achiePERSON28d? PERSON27 am also PERSON28ry hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those PERSON27 [ORGANIZATION] listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize!

PERSON15 fundraising ability  and the fact that he rarely if ever holds fundraisers to collect cash  is a major advantage for his campaign as we move forward into [PERSON] and into [ORGANIZATION] when voters start voting.

That bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks accountable for scams by requiring them to certify that they conducted a due diligence inquiry and found that no illegal conduct was occurring on their watch.

The proposal would also create a permanent and well-funded unit dedicated to investigating financial crimes.  Thats the stuff to give the troops!

When ORG34 on [PERSON]1 published its first ever profit figures since its nationalization nearly 40 DATE30s ago, it also lifted the veil of secrecy around its mega oil fields. The companys bond prospectus revealed that [ORGANIZATION]2 is able to pump a maximum of 3.8 million barrels a day  well below the more than 5 million that had become conventional wisdom in the market.  [PERSON].  [ORGANIZATION] 737 [ORGANIZATION] Manufacturing [ORGANIZATION] man flies alone on commercial plane to [ORGANIZATION]4 ORG35.  A [ORGANIZATION] man flying to [ORGANIZATION]4 got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane He was the only passenger on the [ORGANIZATION] 737-800.. The ORG36 travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from [ORGANIZATION]4, and to avoid flying empty, one-[STREET] tickets were sold. Only one person bought one. I wonder why? Manufacturing Between Two [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]es, PERSON10ays of Silence and [ORGANIZATION]. In [PERSON]4 after the crash, [LOCATION]n aviation officials visiting [ORGANIZATION]5 cast aspersions on their Indonesian counterparts, even as they refused to speak on the record Which was more reliable? An airplane manufacturer that was one of the most respected companies in [ORGANIZATION]6, or a low-cost carrier with a long history of shocking safety [PERSON] operating in a country troubled by corruption and weak regulation?  A country troubled by corruption and weak regulation. [PERSON] in 737 [PERSON] ORG38 Was Lax in Inspector Training [ORGANIZATION]3. Multiple whistleblowers provided the committee with information alleging that numerous ORG38 employees, including those involved in ORG39 for the [ORGANIZATION] 737 [ORGANIZATION], had not received proper training and valid certifications, Senator [ORGANIZATION]4, a [ORGANIZATION]7 Republican, said in a letter to [ORGANIZATION] PERSON10aniel [ORGANIZATION] DATE16. Manufacturing [ORGANIZATION] Air Force Again Halts PERSON10elivery of [ORGANIZATION]s Tanker Over PERSON10ebris [ORGANIZATION]6. Amazing quotes Elaborating on the trash left behind by workers, Secretary [ORGANIZATION]7 told the [ORGANIZATION] PERSON10efense subcommittee [TIME] that it was a manufacturing discipline issue on the assembly line where we saw a breakdown. If you drop a wrench you have to find a wrench, she said. You have to wipe down surfaces so you dont have pieces of aluminum that over time get in the midst of things and cause serious problems. The latest delivery halt was prompted after the service opened up some closed compartments, such as inside wings, and found flaws, she said without elaborating.  Sounds like a demoralizes workforce, to me. I sure hope there arent loose wrenches sliiding around inside the wings of civilian aircraft, because that would be bad. Manufacturing Pontifications I dont know what to make of this [PERSON] News41. One cant help but think, a lot, about the two [ORGANIZATION] 737 [ORGANIZATION] crashes and the facts that [ORGANIZATION] created the system, linked it to one sensor, not two, didnt tell the airlines pilots about it, didnt include it in pilot manuals, didnt have a safety alert system as standard equipment, initially blamed the [LOCATION]3 pilots and reportedly lobbied [PERSON] not to ground the airplanes. And self-certified the system too42, let us remember. More Four concurrent commercial airplane programs the [ORGANIZATION] being a hybrid between commercial and military each had trouble. Two of their last four airplanes have been grounded by regulators. A third airplane had such poor quality control the customer stopped taking delivery. Three of the four were DATE30s late. Whats going on here? [ORGANIZATION] resources were clearly stretched too thin. Billions of dollars were going out the door in cost overruns. Were bad management decisions made by the bean-counting [ORGANIZATION]8 regime? Was there something systemic happening? Or just a run of bad luck and bad timing?  Good questions. Well worth a read. Manufacturing PERSON10isaster and the [ORGANIZATION] CEO Crains [ORGANIZATION]8 Business43. Though [ORGANIZATION] CEO [PERSON] [LOCATION]5 career will be defined by the 737 [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]0 and [ORGANIZATION]1 say the crisis is unlikely to end it. That would require a game-changing development, like federal prosecutors discovering that executives misled regulators about safety. But [ORGANIZATION]2 of [LOCATION]4, who views [LOCATION]5 performance in the hot seat less favorably, is less sure. He is particularly critical of [ORGANIZATION]s decision after the crashes to make standard on the [PERSON] a safety feature that was previously optional and cost extra. He argues that the move makes it appear as if safety were optional. It has negative PR consequences in the [STREET] that punching a guy in the face has PR problems The real problem is that you punched someone, [ORGANIZATION]3 says. [PERSON] mistakes are glaring such that, if I were on the board, I would be holding side meetings saying, PERSON10o we have alternatives for a CEO? Ironically, the crisis [ORGANIZATION]5 faces is largely of [ORGANIZATION]8s making. PERSON10ecisions about the [PERSON]s design and budget, as well as to rush production to beat competition from [LOCATION]8, happened on [ORGANIZATION]8s watch. The first [PERSON] test flight came [PERSON]6 after [ORGANIZATION]5 became chief executive in [PERSON]7. By then, [ORGANIZATION]6 says, the die was already cast.  Yup. [ORGANIZATION] stumbled with the 787, but still kept moving forward, though off balance. Then, with the 737, it fell. NOTES  [ORGANIZATION] was self-certified by [ORGANIZATION], and filed the tech [ORGANIZATION] with the ORG38 late. Perhaps thats what the criminal investigation is looking into.  So, Im not the only one.  Manufacturing PERSON10aimler CEO [ORGANIZATION] safety debate highlights challenge for autonomous tech Reuters44. What is very important is the psychological dimension. If you look at what is happening with [ORGANIZATION] then you can imagine what happens when such a system has an incident, [ORGANIZATION]7 said, commenting on the motor industrys efforts to develop autonomous cars. Half of [ORGANIZATION] adults think self-driving vehicles are more dangerous than those driven by people, while two-thirds would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle, a [ORGANIZATION]0 poll found [PERSON]8. In the same poll, about 63 percent of respondents said they would not pay more to have a self-driving feature on their vehicle, and 41 percent of the rest said they would not pay more than 2,000.  PERSON10ont worry. LOC2 will be programming ethics into the robot car AIs. [ORGANIZATION]1 announces it will shut down ebook program and confiscate its customers libraries [ORGANIZATION]2. [ORGANIZATION]3 has a PERSON10RM-locked ebook store that isnt making enough money, so theyre shutting it down and taking away every book that every one of its customers acquired effective [PERSON]9. Customers will receive refunds. This puts the difference between PERSON10RM-locked media and unencumbered media into sharp contrast. I have bought a lot of MP3s over the DATE30s, thousands of them, and many of the retailers I purchased from are long gone, but I still have the MP3s. Likewise, I have bought many books from long-defunct booksellers and even defunct publishers, but I still own those books. When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didnt get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund.  Well, thats why we need PERSON10RM, right? Tech [ORGANIZATION]4 to allow free access to 24,000 hybrid and electric vehicle tech patents to boost market [ORGANIZATION]5. [ORGANIZATION]4 said it will offer around 23,740 patents related to electrification technology, with the grant period running from DATE13 to [DATE]. [ORGANIZATION]4 also hopes that opening up its technology for motors and batteries, which are key components of electric and fuel-cell vehicles, will increase their supply and help it to cut costs in developing such vehicles. But it remains uncertain whether the use of [ORGANIZATION]4 patents will be as widespread as the carmaker hopes, observers said. [ORGANIZATION]4 said in [DATE] [PERSON]7 it will offer patents related to its fuel-cell vehicles but it has only led to a dozen contracts. Tech The ugliness of photorealism Wireframe47. The issue of photorealism in games is a matter of personal taste, a question of aesthetics. Id argue that what people are responding to is the technical mastery. That weve been conditioned to believe more polygons, more particles, newer more advanced shaders are what is crucial and amazing. Beauty can rise up out of ugliness. It is possible. But I cant help but find the reflexive need to fall over these massive commercial ventures and characterise them as beautiful extremely distasteful. We should know better. Most, if not entirely all, game developers who work at triple-A studios dont enjoy many protections from abusive crunch practices massive layoffs as weve just seen at [ORGANIZATION]6 to make earnings calls sound better, or the ability to petition for the kinds of bonuses or residuals they deserve from shipping a title that sells. We know that labour conditions in this industry suck because we know how quickly people burn out and leave. [ORGANIZATION]. In [DATE], [ORGANIZATION]7 won a nearly 500 million order for as many as a dozen of its hybrid-electric [ORGANIZATION] airships operational in [ORGANIZATION] or DATE53 from a buyer who plans to lease their 20-tons of freight capacity to LOC3 oil and gas companies. Leasing an airship is cheaper than building new roads across permafrost melting due to climate change, and roughly seven times cheaper per ton than using heavy-lift helicopters. As [ORGANIZATION]9 and the rest of the world extend their search for raw materials into ever-more remote regions, airships are likely to become crucial links in logistics chains. The Biosphere What can bees teach economists about how markets work? [ORGANIZATION]8. In DATE54, a bee-rights movement emerged in the GPE20, with the motto Never kill a [PERSON][ORGANIZATION] presses, and I cant summarize this article. But its full of facts and interesting twists and well worth a read, especially for how Nobel sic Prize-winning economist [ORGANIZATION]8 used bees as an example of positive externalities, when he didnt know anything about bees!

But when you actually sit down and watch the thing, it turns out to be utterly spellbinding. For long stretches, it can be hard to remember which screen is which [ORGANIZATION]9 land- and city-spaces are so unerringly accurate that I found myself checking left and right to keep my bearings, miming writing with my dominant hand to confirm. But then every now and then  and as the film develops, increasingly often  a human face will enter, and the difference becomes bluntly, laughably obvious. On the left, commuters walk briskly. People  builders, waitresses, fighter pilots  stand by machines, looking into the camera intently, often slightly uncomfortably. On the right, their doubles simply mill about, almost at random their faces, at any rate generic, have nothing in them.Impressive.

Thank you!  This entry was posted in [ORGANIZATION] on [DATE], DATE563 by Lambert Strether64.About [ORGANIZATION]3, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. [PERSON] is the prime example, but tuition-free college and ORG67 also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a PERSON10ebt [PERSON]. Clearly, neither liberal PERSON10emocrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism Because markets. I dont much care about the ism that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second [PERSON] saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I dont much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue  and this is why [PERSON] is always first with me  is the tens of thousands of excess deaths from despair, as described by the Case-PERSON10eaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes [PERSON], at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics  even the worthy fight to help the refugees [ORGANIZATION]4, PERSON35, and [ORGANIZATION]5 wars created  bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow  currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock PERSON10octrine campaigns, one by the ORG69, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the ORG70 and in the press  a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed lets call such voices the left. Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the PERSON10emocrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnt allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since Ive been blogging about it [ORGANIZATION]9 for [DATE], but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26 top  27  28  29 top  30 AfgdOW4zUErJqxb3.99  31 top  32 top  33 OQF5gjc4GoiK3aYL.99  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64"

Theres no [STREET] you can replace a [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], said [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]29ic Leader [PERSON]. Still, he believes the [ORGANIZATION]29ic caucus boasts 47 members talented enough to champion the cause. [ORGANIZATION]9f these two go, the caucus will lose a pair of strong freshman, one a Deputy [ORGANIZATION]29ic Leader. But in a chamber filled with political optimism, change remains constant, said Rep. [PERSON]. When you lose good [ORGANIZATION] members, you miss them at meetings, on the floor and just walking around the building. But it happens every cycle on both sides, he said. [PERSON], set to share [ORGANIZATION]29ic leadership with [ORGANIZATION] after the [ORGANIZATION] election, ac[ORGANIZATION]ledges significant political consequences as well. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] flipped red sets blue in [LOCATION]. What happens [ORGANIZATION]? [PERSON] wont discuss [ORGANIZATION]s seat the GPE1 [ORGANIZATION]29 has yet to declare. But [ORGANIZATION] is one of four [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]29s representing districts won by [PERSON]1 in [LOCATION]. [PERSON], she won by the smallest margin of any victorious [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]29. Thats not an easy district for [ORGANIZATION]29s to win, but we have shown with great candidates we can play in any part of the state, he said. The [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] Victory Fund already has eyes on recruits, [PERSON] promised. [PERSON]2 said its ultimately up to the people. And the people voted [ORGANIZATION]29ic as recently as [PERSON], so hes confident. [ORGANIZATION] voters will make up an increasing share of the electorate in [ORGANIZATION], and that doesnt bode well for [PERSON]3, according to a new poll from [ORGANIZATION], a [LOCATION] super [ORGANIZATION]. The committee found 25 percent of [ORGANIZATION] voters are firmly behind the president, and another 11 percent were leaning his [STREET]. Meanwhile, 57 percent are either planning to vote for a [ORGANIZATION]29 or seriously considering it. About the only bright spot for the President is his standing with Cuban[ORGANIZATION] voters, 41 percent of whom plan to vote for him in [ORGANIZATION] compared to 24 percent who plan to vote for the [ORGANIZATION]29ic nominee. That metric is the only one in the poll, which also measured [PERSON] and [PERSON], to show [PERSON]3 above water. That margin is dwarfed by the number of Puerto Ricans and voters of South [ORGANIZATION] descent living in [PERSON] who are ready for a change the certain to vote blocs and are nearly 2-to-1 against him. And more than 20 percent in each of those demos have one foot in the D column. [ORGANIZATION] attributes PERSON[LOCATION]6 weak showing to [PERSON]3s immigration policies, which they say are deeply unpopular with the [ORGANIZATION] communities in these states, and can be seen as emblematic of his larger racist and divisive message that, not surprisingly, is toxic with [ORGANIZATION] voters. Still, the [ORGANIZATION] says it needs to up its outreach efforts to capitalize on the trend. Among the softer [ORGANIZATION]29ic supporters that means addressing their priorities rather than relying solely on anti-[PERSON]3 sentiment.

I can only hope that these are just rumors, but I suspect they are accurate. [PERSON]1 Majority Leader PERSON30 has publicly vowed to pursue any new gun control legislation that the [ORGANIZATION] Administration supports, and Donald [ORGANIZATION] has openly called for Red Flag gun laws involving mental health guidelines. The mainstream media now claims that a majority of [ORGANIZATION]s on both sides of the political divide support red flag legislation, but we all know how rigged such polls can be. The real question is, does the average [ORGANIZATION] even know what red flag laws would entail? I think they do not.78 PERSON31 Says [ORGANIZATION] is at All-Time High79 [PERSON]s ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, PERSON31, said [LOCATION]2 that hostility toward Christians in the world has reached an all-time high.

Comment Go back to school Greta.86 [PERSON]5 by PERSON37 Even perfunctory analyses of the [STREET] corporations operate and how they affect society show that corporations should be banned for the same reason slavery was banned. Actually, corporations have become nothing but a modern, more efficient form of slavery. Though, as the result of some legal chicanery, for some purposes they are considered people, corporations have no soul. Moreover, they have no ethics, principles or morals. Despite claims on the contrary they usually make in their institutional advertising, the only purpose of a corporation is to maximize the profits of its shareholders  at any cost. A film based on PERSON38 book [ORGANIZATION], shows that most corporations exhibit many of the traits of psychopathic behavior, such as Callous unconcern for the feelings of others Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships Reckless disregard for the safety of others [LOCATION] repeated lying and conning of others for profit Incapacity to experience guilt Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior.Corporations have created a particular sort of mirage. You look around and are tricked to believe that you see hospitals, colleges, department stores, hardware stores, drug factories, airlines, etc., but that is part of the illusion. Ultimately, corporations do not care about the products they make  be it cars, drugs, electronic gadgets, food, books, gas, or airplanes , much less about their workers or the customers who buy their products. Their only goal is to persuade you to buy their products, disregarding whether or not their products are safe, negatively affect your health or create an addiction. To reach their goals they resort to any type of mind manipulation through advertising that includes falsehood, fabrications, deception, and outright lies, in order to maximize their profits. Proof that corporations do not care less about their customers is the fact that, to maximize profits, they have outsourced most of the manufacture of their products. But, having solved a short-term problem, they have created a long-term one they have destroyed the [STREET] of living of their own consumers. The direct result of moving production overseas to GPE28, [LOCATION], and other countries to profit from quasi-slave labor, is that they have deprived most of their working-class customers of their source of income. Currently, 9 out of every 10 products sold by the [PERSON]6 corporation are made in [LOCATION], and 9 out of every 10 [PERSON]6 customers is a worker who lost his well-paid job because, to maximize its profits, [PERSON]6 does not buy [ORGANIZATION]-made products. But that is not the only problem corporations pose. Once they become economically powerful they aim for political power as well. Their ultimate goal is to take control of the state, a political system PERSON39 called lo stato corporativo  the corporate state another name for [PERSON]7. Like most things wrong on this planet, the modern corporation is a PERSON40 baby  initially they called it a trust. No wonder critics called the PERSON40s one of the families that have done more damage to the people of the world.

So, if there is no evidence to prove that [PERSON] has the most mass shootings in the world, why would the media and Democrats accept the flawed study without looking into it a little deeper? Could a push for gun control, regardless of the truth be the answer? But the claim is based on just one study, and the author of that study, PERSON43, would not release his data to either PERSON44 or researchers in the field. Economist [PERSON] says that PERSON46 study has many flaws. Watch, as top economist [PERSON] appears on PERSON44 TV where he reveals the flawed data used by leftist media and politicians like PERSON48 to promote gun control. PERSON[DATE] calls PERSON46 study, academic malpractice. [ORGANIZATION] reports  [PERSON], president of [PERSON]2, crunched the numbers and said his count shows that the GPE24 had less than 3 percent of the worlds mass public shootings over a [ORGANIZATION]7 period. That is smaller than [ORGANIZATION] of the worlds population that the GPE24 accounts for  and [STREET] less than the 31 percent of global mass shooters that PERSON43, a professor at the [PERSON]9, claimed in his widely publicized studies.

One family from GPE29, GPE23, is grieving after their mother became ill and lost virtually all motor functions due to a mercury poisoning that experts say is the first of its kind in the GPE6. PERSON50, the GPE23 womans son, told local GPE29 news outlet [PERSON]4 that his mother quickly became sick at [ORGANIZATION]9 and was taken to the hospital for [ORGANIZATION]0 after using a special kind of Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream that she had been importing from [PERSON]0, GPE28, through a friend for [ORGANIZATION]1.

At the same time, the school has flouted a state law mandating that students take a course on the Constitution and other founding documents, stating funding concerns.94 [PERSON] [PERSON]8 Elects PERSON51 as New Leader95 [PERSON]1 AP  [PERSON] far-right [PERSON]8 elected former minister and presidential candidate PERSON51 as its leader on [ORGANIZATION]3 as it seeks to return to power in a [ORGANIZATION]4 national election, trying to move beyond the scandal that brought down the previous administration.

Senior government partner the anti-establishment [ORGANIZATION] ORG51 gets 21 undersecretaries while junior partner the centre-left [LOCATION] ORG55 gets [DATE], government sources said. The other government components, the tiny leftwing ORG56 party and the Italians abroad group ORG57 get two and one respectively. The ORG51 will also have an advantage in terms of deputy ministers with six compared to the ORG55s four. Only 14 of the [DATE] are women. Government sources voiced satisfaction that an agreement had been found on the undersecretaries. Both the ORG51 and the ORG55 said they were satisfied with the number of officials they had obtained. Now were ready to give our utmost, said ORG51 leader and Foreign Minister PERSON56. The government team is complete, ready to give its all for the country!, he said. On [ORGANIZATION]9 the new team will be sworn in which will be composed of 21 exponents of the [ORGANIZATION], and six of these will be deputy ministers. For us that means a lot of work to do and greater responsibility. We are ready! Premier [PERSON] PERSON55 said the acceleration on the government team is important because the country is awaiting responses. This team is sufficiently young and amalgamated, said the premier who confirmed the new team will be sworn on [ORGANIZATION]9. Its a great team, built to last, said ORG60 Minister PERSON58. But anti-migrant [ORGANIZATION] leader PERSON59 said weve seen a disgraceful divvying up of seats by the ORG51 and the ORG55. Also on [ORGANIZATION]6, ORG61 Minister PERSON60 said [PERSON]6 is a protagonist in [ORGANIZATION] again thanks to the new government. [PERSON]6 has just formed an unprecedented alliance between the anti-establishment [ORGANIZATION] ORG51 and the centre-left and pro-[ORGANIZATION] [LOCATION] ORG55, of which PERSON61 was an [ORGANIZATION] for DATE40 before being named economy minister in the new ORG51-ORG55 executive. With this government, PERSON61 said, [PERSON]6 returns to being a protagonist in [ORGANIZATION], resumes the role that it is entitled to as a founder member of the [ORGANIZATION] which has ideas, imposes its vision of the [ORGANIZATION] as a path to improve, change, and make it more capable of facing the challenges of our world. The new government has said, among other things, that it will try to change the Stability and Growth Pact, as President PERSON62 also hoped in helping set up the ORG51-ORG55 coalition. [PERSON] we will present the government programme as illustrated in parliament by Premier [PERSON] PERSON55, PERSON61 went on. The programme includes averting a 23-billion-euro [ORGANIZATION] hike, cutting the tax wedge for low-to-medium earners, free nurseries for low-to-medium income families, and trying to get investments in the green economy excluded from [ORGANIZATION] fiscal parameters. PERSON61 said [ORGANIZATION]6, however, that the DATE41 budget and excluding green investments had different timescales, with the first obviously taking precedence over the second. The reform of monetary union is on a separate plane from the DATE41 budget bill, he said. PERSON61 stressed, however, that the time of clashes with [ORGANIZATION], like those under former interior minister and [ORGANIZATION] leader PERSON59, was over. PERSON63, who pulled the plug on an ORG51-ORG64 government DATE[DATE] hoping for a snap election to capitalise on high poll numbers and never thinking the ORG51 would get together with traditional foe the ORG55, had frequent run-ins over [ORGANIZATION] fiscal constraints. In an interview with ORG65 [DATE], PERSON61 said there will never be wars with [ORGANIZATION] again. He also said the flat tax pledged by the ORG64 would be shelved, the quota 100 pension reform would run its course in DATE43, and a basic income would be improved. PERSON61 also vowed that the [ORGANIZATION] hike would not happen, with an unprecedented crackdown on tax evasion helping to get the 23 billion euros needed to fund its exclusion. The minister also announced that [PERSON]6 will join the pro-climate coalition. In [PERSON]8, he announced that [PERSON]7 was joining the coalition of financial ministers for the fight against climate change. This is a change, since [PERSON]6 had thus far chosen not to take part in the initiative, which is made up of 40 countries. The aim of the coalition is to boost green investments. ORG66 President PERSON64 said that PERSON61 had reiterated [PERSON]6s pro-euro commitment at an informal ORG66 meeting. PERSON61, he said, had outlined the priorities for the near future and the commitment on policies that help preserve the stability of the euro. He said PERSON65 is not new to the group, seeing as how he frequented it already before, in his capacity as chair of the economy committee. [PERSON] was not the day to discuss his presentation in detail. The Italian dossier will return to the fore in the context of the stability bills, together with those of all the other countries, said the Portuguese finance minister.100 [PERSON]9 Gang Rape in GPE40, Police Currently Looking for Two Dark-Skinned Men101 In [TIME] on [DATE] [TIME], police in GPE40 received a call from a woman who claimed to have been raped by two men.

The idea, which is being pursued hotly by the legion of ORG71ers headed by [PERSON]1, is that parliamentary sovereignty can be used to deny national sovereignty, the Monarchy presenter said in an interview with [PERSON]2 GPE[DATE] [PERSON]3 to Stay in Prison Over Absconding Fears109 ORG72 co-founder [PERSON]3 is to remain in prison when his jail term ends because of his history of absconding, a judge has ruled.

ORG80 Minister [PERSON] said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7m barrels a day  about half the kingdoms output. A Yemeni Houthi rebel spokesman said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. GPE6 Secretary of ORG81 PERSON81 blamed the attacks on GPE49 saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen.1[DATE] PERSON82 [PERSON] in [ORGANIZATION] ORG82 The [ORGANIZATION] administration has claimed the death of [ORGANIZATION], a son of late ORG84 leader PERSON84.

Treating them earnestly alienates even the tolerant, and has no [STREET] in the classroom. The unceasing gender proliferation tipped over from a hoary dad joke into a bona fide social problem when a recent taxpayer-paid [ORGANIZATION] video featured educator PERSON87 telling pre-teen children this We know that we have got male and female, but there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now. The now is particularly endearing  recognizable from my own schoolmasters having to upend DATE53 of teaching a curriculum due to superior recent knowledge We used to think that peptic ulcers were caused by diet but NOW we know it is a bacteria. Yet what are these stunning gender discoveries that have led us to find scores of new genders whose very existence we didnt even fathom at DATE54? Quantitative experiments must have been conducted or psychological questionnaires taken. At worst, some professor of sociology or gender studies must have written a paper categorizing them. But no. Most of these new genders have literally come from microblogging site ORG96. They are random users inventions, many are whimsies or equivalents of doodling a cool picture of an imaginary animal or a pirate and making it your avatar. Due to literal-minded inclusiveness taken to its logical conclusion, each one has now been catalogued, and is now being taught as objective fact, all in the space of less than five DATE53.

Other than that, its a great [STREET] to live.52 A New GPE2 Muslim Colleges Islamist Ties53 ORG3 [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], recently declared the establishment of an Islamic university at its premises, [ORGANIZATION] that will provide higher Islamic education to the [PERSON]n Muslim community as well as serve as a seminary that would prepare imams for mosques in [ORGANIZATION]. The foundation of [ORGANIZATION] is a joint effort between the [ORGANIZATION] and ORG6 in GPE5, [PERSON]. The identities of the founders and faculty of the university are deeply concerning and suggest the seminary will be promoting an Islamist ideology to Muslim students in [PERSON] and throughout GPE6. In the video announcing the colleges founding, ORG7 is represented by its [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] has extensive ties to Islamist groups linked to [ORGANIZATION], including serving as a board member and president of the GPE2 chapter of ORG9 ORG10, and currently vice-president and formerly Secretary General of the Islamic Society of [ORGANIZATION] ISNA. [PERSON] also served as operations officer for ORG12 A Third of Democrats Favor Declaring ORG13 Terrorist Orgnization 28 Say it Should be Illegal to Join55 A new ORG14 poll reveals that almost one-third 32 of likely Democratic voters favor declaring ORG15 a terrorist organization, after officials in GPE7 did just that. Meanwhile, 28 of Democrats say [PERSON] should be banned from joining pro-gun rights organizations like the ORG13  a view surprisingly shared by 15 of Republicans and 10 of unaffiliated voters. Just 13 of likely voters believe ORG13 members are more likely to commit a crime with a gun  and in fact 47 believe that members are less likely to commit such a crime. 28 think ORG13 membership makes no difference vs. the general population. The poll also revealed that 50 of voters have a favorable impression of the ORG13, while 44 do not. Of that, 30 have a Very Favorable view of the group, while 33 have a [ORGANIZATION] one  virtually the same opinion as those polled held in [DATE]. As we noted on [ORGANIZATION], the ORG13 has sued the city and county of GPE7 after its ORG16 declared it a domestic terrorist organization. Filed in the [PERSON] ORG17 for GPE9, the suit accuses city officials of violating the groups free speech rights for political purposes, and claims the city is attempting to create a blacklist to prevent ORG13-associated individuals from doing business there, according to ORG18. The lawsuit asks the [STREET] to instruct elected officials that freedom of speech means you cannot silence or punish those with whom you disagree.56 PERSON2 Was Asked to [ORGANIZATION], Book Claims57 PERSON2 was asked to leave a hippie commune in [DATE] for sitting around and talking about politics instead of working, according to a forthcoming book. We Are As Gods by PERSON3, scheduled for release [PERSON], chronicles the rise and fall of FAC0 in northeast [PERSON]0. PERSON4, a [PERSON]1 writer, was in a special position to write a history of [PERSON]2 she was raised near the commune in a geodesic dome residence with an outhouse called FAC1. Her parents were close acquaintances of the commune residents, who offered them tips about wilderness living.58 Democrat Senators Fear PERSON5 Torpedoed Gun Control With Confiscation Push59 [PERSON] made clear that handing over AR-15s will be mandatory under his plan.60 ORG19 Blames Climate Change for Cognitive Decline And Suicide61 ORG19 magazine has attributed a whole new list of negative effects to climate change, including lost productivity, violent crime, and cognitive decline. Climate change has become the bogeyman responsible for all the worlds ills, from racism to mass migration, but in its new article, ORG19 has arguably taken climate hysteria to a whole new level.62 [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] Three separate videos show a gang of [PERSON]3 blacks acting like hyenas attacking and robbing vulnerable white people in a string of possible hate crimes. Police conducted a [ORGANIZATION] search and arrested 16 individuals ranging [ORGANIZATION]. In the first video, an elderly white man is seen trying to walk past a crowded area full of young black people when hes stopped and shoved by multiple suspects. One of the suspects appears to reach into the mans pocket and take something before running off with his loot. In the second video, another white man is standing on the sidewalk surrounded by a large group of young black men who begin to take his cell phone out of his hands.64 ORGDATE19 Members Face Federal, ORG77 Charges in [PERSON]4 Protest65 HO[PERSON]TON [ORGANIZATION] and state authorities on [ORGANIZATION] criminally charged climate change protesters for shutting down the largest GPE3 energy-export [INSTITUTION] for DATE8 by dangling from a bridge.66 ORG22 Minority Leader [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] ORG22 Minority Leader [PERSON] was on [DATE]6 Morning Futures With [PERSON] and he made some bold statements about [PERSON] and [PERSON]. If you believe [PERSON]2, the former ORG23 leaders might want to think about lawyering up right about now, because the hammer is coming down.68 [PERSON]3 Tells Bizarre Story About How He Once Faced Down a Gang Leader Named [PERSON]4 Video69 This is hilarious and sad. [PERSON]5 has apparently told this story before and now hes spinning the yarn again.

Their resignations signal two things from [PERSON]. The first is the realization that [PERSON]7 is now lost. The second is that this loss is due entirely to the changing demographics resulting from legal and illegal immigration. The five congressmen that have resigned are [PERSON]7 17th, [PERSON]8 23rd, [PERSON]9 22nd, PERSONDATE19 DATE12, and PERSON21 11th. Of these five, Congressman PERSON22 is unique in that his district will likely remain red for some time. He has not faced an opponent in numerous election cycles As noted, the reason for this is simple demographics. For DATE13, the Republicans have told their voters that they were going to clamp down on illegal immigration and address the legal immigration policies that have facilitated this takeover. They have made excuse after excuse for not fulfilling those promises and now that lack of action is turning [PERSON]7 blue one district at a time.72 ORG25 Publishes New Uncorroborated Allegation Against PERSON23 by Former Classmate73 If you think the left is done whining about PERSON23, guess again. On [TIME], the ORG25 published a rehash of the previous bogus allegations against now-ORG27 Justice PERSON23, particularly the allegations made by PERSON24, and threw in a brand new one for good measure. PERSON25 had claimed PERSON23 exposed himself to her at a party at ORG28. Despite the potentially dozens of witnesses that would have seen this occur, PERSON25s story went uncorroborated throughout the entire confirmation process. If I had done that, it would have been the talk of campus, PERSON26 said in an interview with ORG18 PERSON27 No Matter Who Wins in DATE11, There Will be Blood75 The machinations of an illiberal left, on display in its ever-increasing violence accompanied by the ululations of a propagandist media in contravention of an imaginary white supremacist right, have riven the nation into diametrically opposed camps. The right will never accept socialism, while the left will accept nothing less. [ORGANIZATION] Wins Those on the left will not allow a [ORGANIZATION] victory, even should he win the popular vote and [LOCATION]. They are used to getting what they want and like spoiled brats, have learned that tantrums work. Should Donald [ORGANIZATION] prevail in his bid for a second term, the left will go insane, deploying every insurance policy weapon at their disposal to negate [PERSON] of the Orange Man. What PERSON30, PERSON8, and PERSON31 et al. did to [ORGANIZATION] in his first term will seem mild in comparison to what the left is planning should he win.76 [PERSON]8 Public Schools Excusing Students Who Plan on Participating in Upcoming Climate Strike77 [PERSON]9 public schools announced [TIME] that they will excuse students who plan on attending various climate strikes throughout the city.

Prime Minister PERSON43 said [ORGANIZATION]0 hed rather be dead in a ditch than comply with a vote in ORG37 forcing him to ask the ORG2 to postpone [PERSON] beyond [ORGANIZATION]1. But officials at the ORG2  which is broadly in favor of an extension if its the only [STREET] to prevent a no-deal [PERSON]  privately voiced fears that one of their own leaders could help PERSON43 out.

In the meantime, Saudi Arabias stock market fell by 2.3 at SunDATE18 open. Though the company says alternative plans are in [STREET] to temporarily make up for the shortfall, such as tapping [ORGANIZATION]6s global storage network, the 5.7 million barrels DATE8 outage is the single worst supply disruption even over and against that brought on by the first Gulf War and the [DATE]9 Islamic Revolution in [PERSON]0.108 Oil Prices Soar After Attacks on Saudi Facilities109 Oil prices hit their highest in [PERSON]0 after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on DATE14 knocked out more than 5 of global supply.

As the watchdog group [ORGANIZATION] has extensively documented, [PERSON]7 had a history of abuses, including failing to report statutory rape of a [ORGANIZATION]4 and a [ORGANIZATION]1. He sent the latter home with her parents, who knew their daughter was raped by her uncle but didnt want him prosecuted, without reporting it to the police.138 GPE23 Labours Lammy Hails Song Lyrics Describing White Shame, Evil Ancestry139 Labours [PERSON]8 MP has shared song lyrics describing the shame of being a white male, and the evil of their ancestry. Deep lyrics just dropped by [PERSON]9, tweeted the former Minister of ORG77 for Culture, quoting the following excerpt from the ORG78-endorsed singer-songwriters [ORGANIZATION] track The patriarchy is real, the proof is here in my song. Ill sit and mansplain every detail of the things it does wrong [ORGANIZATION] Im a white male, full of shame My ancestry is evil, and their evil is still not gone140 Why Gen-Zers and Millennials Support Socialism141 Public-opinion polls reflect that large numbers of [PERSON] in their DATE19s and [ORGANIZATION]3 i.e., [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION]5s support socialism. When one considers the indoctrination to which these young [PERSON] have been subjected in their state-run educational systems, their preference for socialism actually makes sense. From the first grade, [PERSON]n students are indoctrinated with the notion that they live in a free country, one that has a free-enterprise economic system. By the time they graduate from high school, students have no doubts that this is true. The notion is refortified in those students who go on to college. By the time [PERSON] start their careers, their mindsets are set in concrete They are grateful that they live in a free country. Many of them continue reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which they learned in school and which they were expected to recite [ORGANIZATION]4, a pledge that confirms that in [PERSON] there is liberty for all. Now, look around you. Examine the society in which you live. There are crises, chaos, and mayhem everywhere. ORG79. Health care. Immigration. Federal spending and debt. Monetary. GPE60. [PERSON]3. GPE61. GPE62. [PERSON]. [PERSON]8. Drug war. Forever wars. Secret surveillance. Assassinations. Death. Destruction. Bombings. Terrorism. Mass killings. Tribunals. Torture. Indefinite detention. Militarism. Invasions. Occupations. [PERSON]. Regime-change operations. Trade wars. Sanctions. Embargoes. Police states. Alcoholism. Drug addiction. Homelessness. Poverty. Suicides. Its not a pretty picture, is it? Its a picture of a quite dysfunctional society. In the mind of the [PERSON]er and the [ORGANIZATION]5, that is what comes with freedom and free enterprise. Given such, its perfectly logical to want something else, and that something else happens to be socialism. It even makes sense that so many young people decide to check out of life early through suicide. Theyre thinking, If this is freedom  if this is the best there is  no, thanks. Im leaving and hopefully going on to something better.142 Why Has the Overpopulation Myth Remained So Persistent When its So [ORGANIZATION] [PERSON]0 could never have imagined the dizzying capacity for innovation that human beings have shown in [ORGANIZATION]6, as [PERSON]1 observes at ORG19. There were fewer than a billion people on the planet in [ORGANIZATION]7. The [PERSON] is now nearing 8 billion people, and that population is far better fed DATE9 than they were in [ORGANIZATION]7. That population growth, the likes of which [PERSON]0 would have believed unimaginable, has been met, and even exceeded, by food production  to the extent that our government now subsidizes [PERSON]n farmers, to the tune of billions [DATE], in order to incentivize them to not grow excess food on their lands. These efforts exist as a measure to keep prices at profitable levels for farmers, in our governments vainglorious efforts to fix prices in a free market. But government price-fixing aside, shouldnt it be easy to conclude that any assertion that an increasing population invariably leads to famine is extremely illogical, or at the very least, quite simply an incorrect hypothesis? The idea that increased population leads to scarcity of resources is seductive, however, and has remained incredibly persistent, despite all the evidence that has proven it false over the [ORGANIZATION]1.144  [DATE]  4 370393  5 370455  [DATE]  7 370439  [DATE]  9 370483  [DATE] 370461  12 370423  13 370457  [DATE]  [DATE] 370479  21 370475  22 370388  [DATE]  [DATE][DATE][DATE]31 [DATE]  [DATE]  33 370425  [DATE][DATE]  [DATE]  41 370435  [DATE]  44 370421  45 370405  [DATE]  47 [DATE]  [DATE]  49  50 topheadline  51  52 topheadline  53  54 topheadline  55  56 topheadline  57  58 topheadline  59  60 topheadline  61  62 topheadline  63  64 topheadline  65  66 topheadline  67  68 topheadline  69  70 topheadline  71  72 topheadline  73  74 topheadline  75  76 topheadline  77  78 topheadline  79  80 topheadline  81  82 topheadline  83  84 topheadline  [DATE] topheadline  87  88 topheadline  89  90 topheadline  91  92 topheadline  93  94 topheadline  95  96 topheadline  97  98 topheadline  99  100 topheadline  101  102 topheadline  103  104 topheadline  105  106 topheadline  107  108 topheadline  109  110 topheadline  111  112 topheadline  113  114 topheadline  115  116 topheadline  117  118 topheadline  119  1DATE19 topheadline  121  122 topheadline  123  124 topheadline  125  126 topheadline  127  128 topheadline  129  130 topheadline  131  132 topheadline  133  134 topheadline  135  136 topheadline  137  138 topheadline  139  140 topheadline  141  142 topheadline  143  144 topheadline"

southbend,2019-02-27T00:00:00Z,Newstex Blogs,WNDU,affordable housing,Opportunity Zones will help those who help themselves,"This makes sense to me for three reasons. Opportunity Zones are a decentralized program and funds are easy to set up, even for small developers. A decentralized program points to decentralized geography. Second, the sheer size of the programwith 6 trillion in potential capital gains waiting to be investedmeans that capital cannot pour into a few places and meet the deadline for getting projects started. Third, destinations where land prices are already sky high may not offer the best future returns. I believe the best potential for Opportunity Zones, given current markets, is in mixed-use, walkable places. How many of the zones have plans, infrastructure, and coding in [STREET] for significant mixed-use development? Preparation is key. Whats the difference between [LOCATION] project idea, and an opportunity zone project? One word [ORGANIZATION], notes [ORGANIZATION], founder of the [ORGANIZATION]. Cities with shovel-ready plans for downtowns and neighborhoods, which are also [ORGANIZATION]s, could see many of their projects move forward more quickly. These cities offer a wide variety of sizes and locations in urban and suburban contexts. [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], a small city [TIME] from [ORGANIZATION], is one example of a [STREET] with extensive new urban plans and Opportunity Zones. The market demand for urbanism will continue to grow in [ORGANIZATION], and such cities could offer an affordable urban lifestyle alternative to central city neighborhoods. The more investment comes in via [ORGANIZATION]s, the more value will grow in a [STREET] like [ORGANIZATION].FAC0 rendering. Source City of [ORGANIZATION]The FAC0 former foundry on FAC1 communitys ultimate goal is to create a more livable and sustainable community in Old Town [ORGANIZATION] and GPE3 [STREET] where residents can live where they work, walk to shop, and have easy access to nature and recreation, according to anOppsites listing3. For another illustration, see [PERSON], [PERSON], where a new downtown is being built for a suburban city with no existing walkable downtownon 105-acre former [INSTITUTION] site see rendering at top of article. Downtown [PERSON]s plan comprises 2,300 residential units, including substantial affordable housing, and 1.7 million square feet of commercial uses, such as a grocery store, shops, restaurants, a movie theater, and office space. There will be 18 publicly accessible parks and civic spaces. Construction of the first phase is well underway. It is likely that Downtown [PERSON] would be built without an opportunity zoneyet the [ORGANIZATION] status will give the project a lift and reduce the likelihood of it stalling. When all of the phases are built out, the city has plans to make the downtown even larger by extending the [STREET] grid to adjacent sites. Notes one city official [LOCATION] land control allows us to better negotiate getting affordable housing. We highly value equity and inclusivity and think it should be part of our vision. Downtown [PERSON] is designed as a [STREET] that will grow incrementally over time, serving as the center of public life in a community that has evolved from a purely suburban growth paradigm, explains the project designers, ORG2Partners. All of downtown GPE6 and surrounding neighborhoods are Opportunity Zones. Downtown GPE6s resurgence [LOCATION] is well known, but parts of the city center have received relatively little investment. The creation of a new public space on the west side of LOC2 is spurring development.FAC2 was built to anchor an emerging district, spur economic growth within the neighborhood, and provide a high-quality gathering space for GPE6 residents.FAC2. Source livingLABand TouloukianTouloukianThrough an inclusive community engagement process, an idea for a pop-up park on a large vacant parcel grew over time into a plan, and then construction, of a permanent square with a restaurant, community gathering space, and large circular lawn. Located on FAC3, one of downtowns five radiating arteries, the park serves as a gateway to downtown from the west, and will make investment into the area through [LOCATION] more attractive. The transformation of this space is nothing short of remarkable, says Mayor [PERSON]. GPE7, a city of 52,000 in [LOCATION], is not a [STREET] that is well known nationally for its urban revival. Yet GPE7 adopted a plan for a 400 million, 90-acre LOC4 across from downtown. The district offers a setting for a great deal of urbanist development, including a thousand housing units, 170,000 square feet of retail space, 110,000 square feet of office space, and a hotelall in [LOCATION]. A project like this in a small city may seem unlikely, but it is moving forward quickly. GPE7 Common Council [PERSON] a development loan to support a major project in the district, including a supermarket and 134 residential units. Planning is by [LOCATION] and ORG5.Town square at the heart of the GPE7 LOC4.The rules for Opportunity Zones are still not finalized, and the impact of this federal program will not be known for some time. That said, Opportunity Zones aregenerating interest5at a level that indicates this program will live up to its hypewith regard to level of investment. Significant potential for urbanism lies outside of central locations in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] cities. This potential is likely to get a boost from Opportunity Zones. The biggest support willcome where the public sector has established the ground rules and infrastructure for compact urbanism.  1  2  3  4  5"
