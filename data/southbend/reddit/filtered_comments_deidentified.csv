I don't personally provide direct services or work with clients anymore so I haven't heard it myself but I trust those I have heard it from. Some were talking about trying to alert media or police to it but not sure that anyone has enough information to work with. "
8,2017-06-06 16:41:36 UTC,2,2017-06-06 16:45:03 UTC,[[ORGANIZATION]] Proposed [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION],"Don't read the comments on [ORGANIZATION]. Quite a bit of thickheadedness and ignorance. I'm not sure it'll work here (I don't think most of the panhandlers are homeless, I think they are looking to supplement some sort of handout (e.g. disability) where if they got a ORG1 job they'd lose that handout), but it's certainly an interesting idea that has apparently had success in [ORGANIZATION]. "
8,2017-06-06 16:41:36 UTC,3,2017-06-06 20:46:28 UTC,[[ORGANIZATION]] Proposed [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION],"Not really a downside but it is a stupid idea in my opinion. 

- A panhandler makes more than $2 every 15 minutes standing still.

- Panhandlers, moreso homeless squatters are a huge polluters of our parks. I've personally relocated them and cleaned their piles of shit off the steps in front of buildings.

- I don't want them hanging out in our parks. I fully understand this is a shitty thing to say but I don't want to be told to feel sympathy for the homeless that don't utilize the shelter due to mental illness or drug addiction only to have them in our parks. 

- If there isn't already, the city can pass an ordinance to prevent it, plain and simple. If we can tell them they are not allowed to sleep under the viaduct (which we did), we can tell them they can't panhandle on the medians or sidewalks. If it gets challenged upstream so be it, at least we actually tried."
8,2017-06-06 16:41:36 UTC,1,2017-06-06 23:42:54 UTC,[[ORGANIZATION]] Proposed [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION],"I agree with literally all of your points. I do think it is important to distinguish between the homeless and the panhandlers. We know they are not the same thing, and have different solutions. 

I personally do have a bit of sympathy (tiny, tiny amounts) for those who can't get assistance because of an addiction or other mental illness. Being cut off from help is just going to make them more desperate. Like it or not, they are here and will continue to be our problem. If they can't get help, they will be out there in perpetuity, which isn't good for any of us. 

As far as passing an ordinance, I'm all for enforcing existing legal ordinances and if anyone can come up with something legal that isn't already on the books, they absolutely should get it done. We should not be allowing them to create makeshift communities, especially at the expense of the health, safety, and cleanliness of our city. However, it is extremely foolish and short sided to suggest that we should do more and let it be challenged in the courts. Panhandlers and homeless are a known problem across the country, and it is pretty well established what you can and can not do. We absolutely need to be wary of inflicting legal penalties and costs upon us when that money could be used towards actually fixing the problem. 

So what works? What can we do that we aren't doing? Like you said, we need to be much more tough on enforcing actual existing rules. We need to be less tolerant of them outside of predetermined areas. On the more creative side of things, we need to focus on reducing homelessness and making it inconvenient for the panhandlers. I would love to see a campaign where actual, well dressed people go with nice bright collection buckets and work the corners. Occupy the space they are already utilizing, then use the proceeds to fund services that get those who need legitimate assistance help, and does it in a [STREET] that we we a community can control and supervise. I'd especially like to see stuff like this on [ORGANIZATION]. Living near campus, the panhandlers are out in full force whenever out of towers are around. It's a huge image problem for us, and it does nothing but encourage them because they can rank in a lot of cash quickly. I also wouldn't be opposed to buying these people one [STREET] plane/train/bus tickets to any [STREET] a few hundred miles away. Make it a one time deal, and give them $50 if they accept. I'm sure some will find their [STREET] back, and others will take their [STREET], but it keeps them moving. I'm sure that will be controversial, but sometimes you gotta do whatever you can. "
4,2017-08-13 19:42:15 UTC,8,2017-08-13 19:46:36 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] mayor not backing jobs proposal for panhandlers,"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing. Giving someone with a substance abuse problem or a mental disorder a trashbag and $10 an hour to pick up trash isn't going to do a lot."
4,2017-08-13 19:42:15 UTC,4,2017-08-14 01:30:05 UTC,[ORGANIZATION] mayor not backing jobs proposal for panhandlers,"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

I believe a better option is to take any money that could have gone to this and continue to provide low cost housing for the truly homeless. Couple that with finding a [STREET] to get more mental health facilities in town would go a longer [STREET] than jobs for these people."

Recent trip to [PERSON], figured it would be a homeless [LOCATION] because the weather is primo. Instead noticed 0 homeless. Turns out [ORGANIZATION] puts them up in apartments as long as they're not on drugs/alcohol. Vets go to the front of the line I believe. Somehow it works, they even save money by doing it.

6,2017-07-14 20:48:27 UTC,4,2017-07-15 00:37:40 UTC,All of the hard work and money spent on FAC0 is going down the drain,"There were homeless people doing the same  before smart streets.  There are lots of homeless people and drug-addicted vagrants in most cities.  I personally believe that our local culture of conspicuous compassion is a big draw for homeless people.  Not saying anything bad about the programs themselves, they do great things for people. Just saying that most solutions offered will only increase the problem in the long run, and a lot of people are helping for the wrong reason"

But I agree. The panhandling has gotten a lot worse [LOCATION]. Something does need to be done short term and long term. I don't think we'll see much retail downtown until this is solved. 

I do believe that the panhandling and homelessness is possibly the last major hurdle for downtown. Friends and family that visit comment about it everytime to me. It's something we have to solve that other local communities don't. I think it's the last major blemish on downtown that can hopefully have a permanent solution. "

My other issue is with complaining with no solutions...

6,2017-07-14 20:48:27 UTC,5,2017-07-15 01:40:18 UTC,All of the hard work and money spent on FAC0 is going down the drain,"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET]. I've always thought [ORGANIZATION] should be a little more involved with [ORGANIZATION], and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ORG2 benefits from a better [ORGANIZATION]. "
6,2017-07-14 20:48:27 UTC,2,2017-07-15 12:08:05 UTC,All of the hard work and money spent on FAC0 is going down the drain,"Your opinions about my hype are irrelevant and this sub is for posting opinions -so, if you don't mind, I will choose to continue as often as I please.  Frankly, it is the comments I hear from visitors that inspire my posts and I can tell you with certainty that they are taking notice too of the good AND the bad.  

It's not the same in almost all ways.   Again, I'm downtown [ORGANIZATION] and have been for [LOCATION].  I've lived here for DATE2.  [ORGANIZATION] has brought activity and energy unseen in [LOCATION].  The [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] are really starting to gain traction.  

It's true that for [PERSON] there has been a relatively small presence of beggars and [STREET] people.  It has spiked greatly in [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] poses a grave threat to the really exciting things that seem to be gaining traction.

Through community involvement and improvements made to the park and surrounding areas it is a great and successful area...


The [ORGANIZATION] ambassadors police and mayor have allowed this to go on for far too long....

As i have stated originally it is all the services we provide which draws the homeless all to here... And many of the services (food and medical) we still provide even if they do not meet the criteria for shelter(pass a drug/alcohol screening)

It is a problem that is exacerbated by being the crossroads of [ORGANIZATION]

(many of the drug addicts are self medicating and so much of our mental health services have dried up)..

[ORGANIZATION] could pick them out and it doesn't require checking [ORGANIZATION]'s.  

I made a suggestion in my post and that was if we are either unwilling or unable to clear them out then there ought to be a very visible security presence...even if it is just added [ORGANIZATION] people keeping an eye on things.

I also see panhandlers in GPE4, just not nearly as many.

The library is one of the few remaining public spaces where people can just be, without having to do anything or serve any purpose. Calling into question someone's actions solely because they are perceived to be homeless, or because their appearance does conform to one's own, is a strange [STREET] to spend one's time.

With paid off debt.. . Now, I'm in affordable housing, for $500 DATE9 rent obligations... and, have [DATE] saved looking forward.. (9 benefits a month shy compared to what I suffered) 

Most of the homeless, is mentally ill..  90% is extremely mentally ill... or severly physically handicapped..  it's really sad sight...

The library is doing a beautiful thing and if it truly bothers you that much that you refuse to go to the downtown location I think you really should just be grateful you have the option and resources to [STREET] 5 miles to the next library.

Several of those now will back up directly to this building. If this project turns out the [STREET] others have, those homeowners are liable to be underwater on their mortgage before hardly moving in. some of those are liable to walk away from their mortgages, and where does that lead? See the west side before [ORGANIZATION] had many abandoned homes razed. 
The [ORGANIZATION] homes, while not having the best history, are not drug addicts and mental health patients unable to access other services. What happens when a resident stops taking their medication? Or relapses and is expelled from the program? When that happens people are evicted from the building, where will they go? They stay where they were. Our neighborhood is enclosed by busy roads and a golf course with its own barbed wire fence. The expensive new condos are safe they have FAC0 as a buffer. Once people are here they will stay here whether they are living in the residence or not. There's no where else to go, but the park around FAC1 middle school sure looks like a nice [STREET] to shoot up. Take a look at the center for the homeless downtown, or the soup kitchen at [ORGANIZATION]. People hang out all around there at [TIME]. I have a friend who lived near the soup kitchen and there were constantly seedy characters hanging out in her yard, fights, shouting about taking the word of PERSON2 to heart or face his wrath in hell....that was at [TIME] on a [ORGANIZATION], ans she lived a block away from the kitchen. 
Besides all that, it's especially angering that the city has done this with zero involvement from the neighborhood, zero warning, zero comment. They recently started building a security fence around the FAC1 IT department parking lot [PERSON] before this was announced. We should ""go greet [our] new neighbors"", yet the [ORGANIZATION] is worried about their vans? My nextdoor neighbor has been here since DATE2, this exact same project was tried in [LOCATION], the land was rezoned, but then the project abandoned after outcry from the neighborhood, much like th articles allude to. Fast forward [PERSON] they no longer have to have council approval because the land is already zoned as such, especially convinient we now only have virtual common council meetings, no one can voice opposition. They knew no one would want it in the neighborhood so they just looked the other [STREET] and literally said ""deal with it"". It's especially grand they only alerted residents within 350 feet of the property. You know how many houses are within that zone? About 6.   (and they only got a letter in the mail DATE5 before the press release). Are you telling me this will affect no one outside that radius? 
Even more angering is that [ORGANIZATION] vetoed, and [ORGANIZATION] voted against a planned car wash next to the ORG2 station because such use was ""deemed to negatively affect neighborhood property values, and was not in keeping with the atmosphere of the neighborhood"". But now with this they're just like ""oh uh....you know the west side has had a lot, we thought we'd spread it around let everyone share, but you guys are just gonna love it trust me, and with the school there, what a learning opportunity! Kids! You seeing all this plight??""

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like FAC0. Im genuinely hoping and cautiously optimistic that it wont be much of a problem."

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in [PERSON]'s district?"

12,2017-12-10 22:47:08 UTC,7,2017-12-10 22:47:56 UTC,Mayor [PERSON] on [ORGANIZATION] Issue,"Quote of the article.

""[ORGANIZATION] arrived in the form of a cold wind on [TIME] when I went to speak with homeless people encamped on FAC0, under a bridge near the [INSTITUTION]. It wasn’t my first visit, but with the downtown DATE2 warming shelter open for [ORGANIZATION], it was the best chance yet to try to understand why some people are still at the viaduct.

We had just left [ORGANIZATION], operated by volunteers and ORG1 in a building the city purchased for them [PERSON]. It’s very basic, but it offers a clean and safe [STREET] to sleep. [PERSON], it’s the only option for those with addiction or other issues preventing them from accessing other facilities. The shelter can sleep up to 30 people; [TIME], there were 23.

Seven people remained at the bridge. Most were asleep, but two spoke with us. “Why under the bridge?” my colleague asked one man after we got to talking. “It’s dry,” he said. “It’s one thing to be cold. It’s another thing to be wet.”

I offered to walk him to the shelter, two blocks away, but he said he didn’t want to give up his space and didn’t trust local nonprofits. We made the same offer to a second man, who said he would think about it, but then pulled his sleeping bag over his head and went to sleep.

[PERSON], there is no simple answer to the question of whether someone should be forced indoors. But most of us can agree that no human being should be living under a bridge. Some seek out places like this, but research shows that encampments carry a higher risk of disease, abuse, and physical violence.

Concerned about these harms, the city has begun cleaning the area more frequently. Some have objected at the sight of pallets and makeshift cardboard beds being carried away. (Contrary to rumor, crews are not confiscating warm weather clothing or similar personal property, except when abandoned.)

Others think that the city has been too tolerant, but we have limited legal options.

Often lost in the discussion is the tremendous level of effort — and progress — on homelessness here in [ORGANIZATION]. According to federal data, homelessness has fallen by a quarter since [ORGANIZATION].

We’ve added substantial resources, including a downtown social outreach ambassador and new funds for a “housing first” strategy that emphasizes getting people indoors so that other issues can be addressed. Meanwhile, 32 new beds of permanent supportive housing are becoming available at FAC1.

DATE8, we will invest $1.5 million in a gateway shelter for rapid re-housing. And we’re closing in on the goal of eliminating unsheltered veteran homelessness altogether.

But a scarcity of mental health and offender re-entry resources, plus the growing opioid crisis, are endangering these gains. And while [ORGANIZATION] brings the total number of DATE2 amnesty beds to 55, DATE9 this DATE2 there will not be enough beds and people will be turned away.

There is much more to do, and members of the community can help. Local charities housing homeless people, like ORG2, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION], need socks, hats, and other clothing in addition to volunteer hours and financial donations.

Looking further ahead, we as a community will need to finance about 50 more units of permanent supportive housing to meet local needs.

Most of all, we need unity of purpose. Those who feel strongly enough to hold a sign in protest or comment on social media can also help by contributing time or donating to organizations with a proven track record of moving people out of homelessness.

And those who think we are spending too much should consider how much more expensive it would be to let the problem play out by [STREET] of incarceration, in emergency rooms, and on the streets.

This is among society’s toughest issues, but our community is up to the challenge. As DATE10 beckons us to shopping malls, our conscience also calls us to do more, each in our own [STREET], to support those most in need.

In order to be healthy, happy, and employed, one must first be warm, sheltered, and safe. We can’t fix every problem in another person’s life, but we can and should help the most vulnerable meet basic needs.""

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.  


edit: we obviously also need to do it without stigmatizing or making false claims about the character of our unhoused neighbors."

To be fair it is standard procedure for the groups trying to create homeless facilities to wait until [TIME] to reveal their plans. 

See FAC1 (PSH) in [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] and the city very clearly hid their intent especially through the process of acquiring the land, because if its already zoned properly, then they don't need an iota of public input. They held a meeting and told the neighborhood to screw off which I don't think is the right [STREET] to go about it, but its the easiest route. 

I really [STREET] the blame on the city because the opposition is always going to be more fiery when the first time they are made aware of a project the city is basically DATE1 from construction.

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. [ORGANIZATION] didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the [INSTITUTION] to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had).

It is also less stigmatizing.

Obviously, scattered site still faces [ORGANIZATION] opposition and is more expensive. I believe the city previously made an attempt at that and was shot down.

re: [PERSON], I've been more out of the loop for a bit now, but I think you're probably right re: on site -- but the issue is (as anyone who has ever protested anything knows) the sidewalk out in front is likely public property. And I do know from past work, the least of the issue is the actual residents of our homeless centers and the bigger issue is the people who come to prey on them. Unfortunately, anywhere you [STREET] a complex like this becomes a giant beacon to attract bad actors to come try to prey on the people there.

Intoxication alone is not grounds for program dismissal, but drug dealing and violent conduct are. Treatment is encouraged and facilitated, with guests generally pursuing their paths to recovery at their own pace with the support of staff & ORG1 onsite.

I do think that anything regarding helping the unhoused faces a massive uphill battle for public image, and the general public finds low-barrier housing first approaches even more distasteful despite all evidence of its efficacy. obviously this leads shelter administrators to speak in oversimplified platitudes to beef up their pitch, but her line about ~functionally ending homelessness~ drives me up a wall every time I hear it, and I have heard it dozens of times. I feel like it also discredits those arguing in favor of the program, because those opposed can so easily say, “well I saw a homeless person [PERSON], so you must be full of crap!”
it’s just so validating to hear someone else mention that damn talking point.

I wish that public discussion had room for the nuance and complexity of all the entangled issues at play here. some of the worries are rooted in legitimate concerns, but the opposition gets too riled up and the narrative gets too polarized to facilitate a fruitful, good faith community discussion.

FWIW, through my personal experience, I would say the biggest contributing factor to concerns over a lack of safety/drug dealing/guests etc. would overwhelmingly be put in check with the construction of a purpose-built facility where those coming and going could be kept track of easily. a three building motel campus is extremely hard to supervise. IMO this is one of the best points in favor of the intake center’s construction, but to even discuss it would require acknowledging where the current program falls short, and no one is willing to do that because it will be gobbled up and twisted by people like [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] right into the script for the riled up ORG2’s 🫠"

The homeless population is stifling further growth downtown and more aggressive, immediate action should be taken. I’ve been speaking with business owners in the downtown area and they’ve all said the same thing. It’s impacting their businesses in a negative [STREET]. 

Unfortunately there is no easy solution that makes everyone happy. The housing first initiative is a good idea and a good start, but we don’t have the financial means to overnight a project like this with enough scale to get the current homeless off the [STREET]. We also don’t want to attract every homeless person within 100 miles. I would love to see [ORGANIZATION] help out some. To my knowledge I don’t think contribute much (I am not fully informed on this so I could be incorrect).  "

[ORGANIZATION] handling seems to have gotten a little bit better but the homeless emcampments are a terrible [STREET] for visitors to get a first impression of our city.

Honestly if I knew it was open I probably would have gone there at least once or twice. Also being a bar down the [STREET] from the [INSTITUTION] probably could hurt the crowd that comes in at times. Unfortunate to hear the [STREET] trying to open and closing again. From the outside it looked interesting enough

16,2024-03-29 02:36:31 UTC,1,2024-03-30 02:50:14 UTC,What's with all the shipping containers?,"Do you really think [ORGANIZATION] are the ones setting the prices of homes? The market sets the price, [ORGANIZATION] are “in-touch” with the market and know what the buying market is willing to pay for a house. 

I do agree that affordable housing is dead. When $[PERSON] only gets you a junk house in an undesirable neighborhood, something is wrong, but it’s not the [ORGANIZATION] fault that the prices are high. That’s like blaming the cashier for the high price of the food at the grocery store."
11,2022-10-03 03:14:42 UTC,2,2022-10-03 20:19:28 UTC,What does the community think of abandoned buildings downtown?,And the fat daddy's site has a 60 unit affordable housing apartment planned to be built on it!
1,2017-06-04 06:43:06 UTC,4,2017-06-04 14:13:33 UTC,Best.[DATE].Ever,"1) I totally agree. We need some more economic presence. I would personally be okay with some larger businesses being located at FAC0. Yeah, its not as close to the workforce as a 2-mile radius to downtown, but I feel that area is more attractive to some businesses. I'd rather have them there than closer to downtown if it risked us losing the business.

2) FAC1 has a great food scene. We have a river with good views of the skyline, and we should encourage local restaurants taking advantage of that. I think the [ORGANIZATION] is the only [STREET] to do so. 

3) Let's hope all the new apartments coming online fill up and more get built. 

4) [ORGANIZATION] isn't quite as bad as people make it out to be. The administration isn't perfect. There's issues, we can all agree. But, I feel that a large portion of the problem isn't the schools themselves, its the students. And by the students, I mean its their home life. And by that, I mean poverty. When mom/dad (if both are even in the picture) have to work late/multiple jobs/are alcoholic/don't care about their children, it makes it tough for the kids to behave in school and not act out. This is a deep issue that cannot be fixed [TIME], but it starts with a community effort to help guide these children to have the tools they need for success, but also we need more and better jobs for those parents that struggle to put food on the table or make rent. I think that if theres more money coming into these households, then over time the children will behave better (less acting out, less truancy, less drugs, more desire to learn) and [ORGANIZATION] test scores will improve. 

5) yes yes yes. [PERSON] needs to have real shopping. Right now its just office space and some restaurants. Theres hardly any retail. Why do most people go to the loop in [ORGANIZATION]? There's lots of retail, parks, and food. ORG2 runs downtown, which connect to [PERSON], which is where all the fiber runs into. Theres some along the toll [STREET] but most of it runs along the railroad tracks and into the basement of [PERSON]. I wish [PERSON] would have looked into [LOCATION] instead of [PERSON], but I understand the reality of the situation too. I think an [ORGANIZATION] would do well downtown. 

6) Without more retail and business downtown, I think it's tough to convince people still to come downtown. Sure, image is improving, but I'm still convincing people from the region (outside of [LOCATION]) that [PERSON] is not scary and you won't get taken by a homeless man and abused. Things are changing but we need more still. I think more people living and walking around downtown will help, but when the new ORG6 apartments go up and theres a real sign of things changing and growing, only then will outsiders really begin to see the change.

13,2017-07-20 13:21:48 UTC,3,2017-07-20 17:33:02 UTC,[[ORGANIZATION],"yes and no, people still need affordable housing, but the people that need affordable housing are ""undesirables"" to most developers. So moving them out of downtown to redevelop the area would be some mondo gentrifying. people being unable to afford housing on their own is more a symptom of a larger issues like unemployment, under employment, [INSTITUTION] education and blah blah blah. [PERSON] tl;dr its not easy. "
