Let me preface by saying I studied addiction in grad school and have worked in several rehab programs and a prison doing addiction counseling. 


Heroin in general is on the rise in the U.S. There are a lot of different factors that are contributing to this, but the two things you can look at whenever this happens are cycles and availability. Drugs of choice are usually cyclical (about every 10-20 years there is a spike in either uppers or downers). Currently the trend seems to be downers, which brings us to availability. About 10 years ago, pain killers were ""the thing"". This lead to the law cracking down on pills and pharmacies, which drove street prices for pills to be super high, which lead users to seek out other forms of opiates. Heroin is cheap and widely available, so now that's the hot ticket. In a few years it'll start to swing the other way. 


The Bend's proximity to Chicago and the fact that it's an easy stop when traveling between Chicago and Detroit puts it at a little higher of a risk for trendy drugs to be distributed here.

Sorry if hearing that bugs you.  Obviously, me being a PITA about it here hasnt helped much.  Problem is, I'm just the one the writes it here and gives voice to it...if you heard it from dozens of people a day like I do - you'd probably be more concerned.  

Dunno man.  I'm not a city official that is paid to provide solutions that pass legal and practical muster to this kind of stuff.  Since you asked so nicely: 1st thing I'd do is get with all of the community based providers (churches, CFTH, Hope, etc.) and ask what are we going to do THIS WEEK to get people off of the streets NOW (as in TODAY) that need help?  If there isn't any room in the centers then give each church/community group 10 tents and some support and ask that they each be a problem solving incubator and meet with them weekly to assess their findings.  I suspect the fly poop would get seperated from the pepper pretty fast and we would learn a lot.  The point is to get it off the streets immediately (like by the middle of next week) before it impacts 1 single visitor's impression of our city's otherwise impressive rebirth.

Panhandling downtown has to stop entirely immediatley.  Police, DTSB ambassoders need to be highly visible and let PH's know that they aren't welcome or tolerated and if they keep on harrassing our visitors and citizens they will be ticketed and then arrested if they continue.  If they need money for food or shelter then see solution above but quit being a nuisance to downtown...PERIOD.  People with signs standing on corners should be picked up...brought somewhere for needs assessment and provided resources for a way out of their situation immediately.  If they don't accept it then - sorry man...GTF off of our streets.  

I suspect the truth is that many have addiction problems and will refuse help in which case I would say that is their choice but they will have to allow their bad decisions to unfold somewhere else...it isn't our jobs to enable them any longer.  If they are mentally ill and the safety net isn't there for them then the city needs to make that case to the citizens of SB and to the state and appeal for the help that will be needed.

The point is...get this off of our streets and away from our visiting families immediately.  Then, I quit coming here monthly to bug you and making you feel uncomfortable.  I want SB to be a shining beacon to the state and to complete an amazing turnaround.  I'm sick of inaction and laziness disquised as compassion.  What's compasionate about allowing these poor souls to display their problem so visibly to the community while not taking decisive action?

That is part of the problem, we can't arrest them and we can't forcefully remove them. Other cities have already litigated this and unfortunately they have a first ammendment right to stand on the corners. 

I have said it before, one way to tackle this issue, particularly when we have a large influx of visitors (Notre Dame weekends especially), is to put legit charity volunteers on the major corners to collect money. Make it uncomfortable and unprofitable for them to stand on the corners, and hopefully they will move away from the major arteries, at least for a day or so. Will it solve the problem? No. It will however provide a small amount of funds that can be used to further combat the problem, and it will make it slightly less profitable for them to be out there, and slightly less of a blight on the city.

My point was that if that is the posture many want to hide behind then...why aren't there tents in their parking lots or back yards? The problem needs to stop right now.

The purpose of 'Smart Street's' was to attract visitors...LOTS of visitors many of which we would desire to move here and call downtown home resulting in new business's downtown....many new business's.  It was NOT to invite the needy to camp at the doorstep and visibly harass our visitors downtown. Panhandling got better but when I was downtown Friday night, I saw the same cast of characters laying kind of low but still waiting to pounce.

Personally, I'm a pretty compassionate guy and am willing to pay...even volunteer to help those that truly need it.  I suspect though that a large percentage of the vagrants/beggers are just wanting to be addicted bums...if others want to direct their compassion to that then be my guest but it isn't right that their chronic unimpeded presence continues to prevent what we all really want so that they can find more enablers.",1,2017-08-13 13:07:25 UTC

- A panhandler makes more than $2 every 15 minutes standing still.

- Panhandlers, moreso homeless squatters are a huge polluters of our parks. I've personally relocated them and cleaned their piles of shit off the steps in front of buildings.

- I don't want them hanging out in our parks. I fully understand this is a shitty thing to say but I don't want to be told to feel sympathy for the homeless that don't utilize the shelter due to mental illness or drug addiction only to have them in our parks.

[South Bend] Proposed Bill/Program to Help Get Panhandlers Off the Corners,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/6fmzdf/south_bend_proposed_billprogram_to_help_get/,2017-06-06 16:41:36 UTC,"> Don't read the comments on WNDU. Quite a bit of thickheadedness and ignorance.

It seems like a lot of people think the city should just cart them off, and by not doing that they are allowing this to continue. Obviously it is much more nuanced than that, as their are first amendment protections for anyone just holding a sign. There is very little we can do, and we basically get the brunt of it because our city has most of the social services in the region. ",2,2017-06-06 17:47:08 UTC

I do think it is important to distinguish between the homeless and the panhandlers. We know they are not the same thing, and have different solutions. 

I personally do have a bit of sympathy (tiny, tiny amounts) for those who can't get assistance because of an addiction or other mental illness. Being cut off from help is just going to make them more desperate. Like it or not, they are here and will continue to be our problem. If they can't get help, they will be out there in perpetuity, which isn't good for any of us. 

As far as passing an ordinance, I'm all for enforcing existing legal ordinances and if anyone can come up with something legal that isn't already on the books, they absolutely should get it done. We should not be allowing them to create makeshift communities, especially at the expense of the health, safety, and cleanliness of our city. However, it is extremely foolish and short sided to suggest that we should do more and let it be challenged in the courts. Panhandlers and homeless are a known problem across the country, and it is pretty well established what you can and can not do. We absolutely need to be wary of inflicting legal penalties and costs upon us when that money could be used towards actually fixing the problem. 

So what works? What can we do that we aren't doing? Like you said, we need to be much more tough on enforcing actual existing rules. We need to be less tolerant of them outside of predetermined areas. On the more creative side of things, we need to focus on reducing homelessness and making it inconvenient for the panhandlers. I would love to see a campaign where actual, well dressed people go with nice bright collection buckets and work the corners. Occupy the space they are already utilizing, then use the proceeds to fund services that get those who need legitimate assistance help, and does it in a way that we we a community can control and supervise. I'd especially like to see stuff like this on Notre Dame weekends. Living near campus, the panhandlers are out in full force whenever out of towers are around. It's a huge image problem for us, and it does nothing but encourage them because they can rank in a lot of cash quickly. I also wouldn't be opposed to buying these people one way plane/train/bus tickets to any place a few hundred miles away. Make it a one time deal, and give them $50 if they accept. I'm sure some will find their way back, and others will take their place, but it keeps them moving. I'm sure that will be controversial, but sometimes you gotta do whatever you can.

Residents have concern about strain on schools and hospitals.  I dont think those concerns are unfounded.

Theres no where near the number some people have claimed though.

Is it unreasonable for people in a small town to be concerned about increasing demand for limited resources, because lets face it healthcare and education are limited resources due to budgets and whatnot.  Someone will have to pay more for the increased demand in these services.

Their origin has nothing to do with the concerns, im sure the concerns would be the same if 4,000 Pennsylvania Dutch decided to relocate to Logansport.",-4,2024-10-25 13:55:29 UTC

They are definitely a leftist channel but the information in the video isn't any less relevant or truthful.  It's on YouTube watch it. 

Usually the influx of immigrants into one place happens for reasons. Usually the main reason is that there are jobs there that the current population isn't able to fill for one reason or another. It may strain the system temporarily, but eventually things will even out because most of those immigrants are there to work. That means they will pay taxes. From there it's up to the local and state governments to use those resources to help alleviate the strain the rapid population increase caused. Study after study has shown that immigration is beneficial to societies in the long term.  They may have some growing pains along the way though. 

I lived in Columbus and we had a large increase in the number of Haitian immigrants move there to work in the factories.  The only negative effects I saw was with housing shortages. The rent prices increased, but I blame the greed of landlords for that more than the people moving there. Housing is a problem everywhere in America.",2,2024-10-26 03:16:26 UTC

I do believe that the panhandling and homelessness is possibly the last major hurdle for downtown. Friends and family that visit comment about it everytime to me.

No, I really don't have any solutions but I do feel that it's important that people be aware of what is really going on. The last time I wrote about this, you and several others seemed to think it wasn't that big of a deal. It's gotten a lot worse and it continues to worsen .

I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for SB. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire US (is South Bend the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for Notre Dame to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of South Bend to help tackle this problem the right way.

Smart Streets has brought activity and energy unseen in that time.  The Cubs, 1st Friday's, The East Race and River Lights are really starting to gain traction.  

It's true that for the last 20 or so years there has been a relatively small presence of beggars and street people.  It has spiked greatly in the last year and IMHO poses a grave threat to the really exciting things that seem to be gaining traction.

> The flag is typically worn on the right shoulder of a military uniform, with the stars facing toward the front of the person wearing the uniform. One reason for this is because, when the flag is displayed this way, it appears to be ""flying"" as the troops march forward. To help visualize this, think of an American flag flying in the wind on a flagpole. The canton is always facing towards the front, with the stripes “flowing” behind.

I was reading the tribune this morning and the mechanic shop is the main driver. Apparently there are nine sex offenders living in that neighborhood or work live around the school and park already.  The new day follows state law and places them 1,000 feet away from a school. So to hear people just whip up these statements is so insane to me, they won’t look at data and keep pushing incentive based and that’s fine we have that at the homeless shelter and their director even endorsed new day. And they saw they want it downtown instead but that’s dumb. They have services on site and it’s by a transport center. They just want it downtown so they can say look at what a terrible city south bend is with crime and homelessness everywhere, that what you get when you follow California or something like that. It’s just aggravating to see people hearing but not listening to everything they’ve done to make this effective project a reality.",2,2024-02-01 12:55:00 UTC

(1) Broadway church on Carroll Ave 
(2) Lady of the road just before the jail on main street! 

I believe the community is working on a 24-hour facility for them to hang out? 

But, in the winter deep freeze, the walking commute is a huge distance between Broadway church and the library for warmth physiological need..(maslows hierarchy of motivational needs) 

Also, always keep in mind there's always a bad apple in every group... 

(Late 2022 winter transient homeless here) I have 3 months' experience as being amongst the transient homeless (reason I know have 9 disability checks currently saved up) - thus, I didn't do my 2021 disability review, and I was suspended until I did review (mid December 2022 - 9 months after suspension) 

But, the pains these transient homeless fave in the winter is worse than any pain I have ever suffered... me long 10 months of incomeless homeless... when I received my back disability pay in January 2023... I could easily choose a 100 dollar a day motel..  and be them again... a week later, I went into a homeless program..  rules, gotta obey rules, do the hours long chores, and go to weekday classes..  
It gave me rest, got my mind together, from that transitional, non rested, stressed out mind..  
At the hope missionary, I decided to repay creditors 13k in defaulted debt..  thus making my mind more compliant to hope missionary rules, program, and structure..  by time, I left hope when I graduated, I had amassed 11.5k savings.   With paid off debt.. . Now, I'm in affordable housing, for $500 monthly rent obligations... and, have 15k saved looking forward.. (9 benefits a month shy compared to what I suffered) 

Most of the homeless, is mentally ill..  90% is extremely mentally ill... or severly physically handicapped..  it's really sad sight... 

During my 10 months of incomelessness, the food stamp denial pains, (25% eligible applicants are denied, the highest denial rate in the US, Guam, and Puerto rico) 

And, locally, the oaklawn psychiatric does not help their patients with a case manager... the psychiatric center neglects the mentally ill badly... 

Thank God, I'm far more functioning and compliant....

My husband experienced someone who was suffering from severe mental health issues in front of the library not too long ago and he decided from now on he wanted to go to a further away one.

The debate about where to put the center is not legitimate. Since 2017 (that's now 6 years ago) the city has tried to put it a number of places. They tried to put it on Michigan Street across from the fire station. They tried to put it closer to Hope Rescue in downtown. This is all pre-COVID.

More recently the city has engaged with the county government to try and put it at Portage Manor or old Cleveland Road and the County said no. Everywhere the city wants to put it, residents get up in arms. So don't act like the city should put it somewhere else. They've looked for 6 years and you'd think a place that is relatively out of the way of residential areas would work.

Ill say, I think this effort is a bit disingenuous. They spout off on the mayor's office about how they were able to locate these sites in two weeks vs the multi year process, but the fact that it took them two weeks shows. The first site on the list, for example, is barred from residential development by IDEM. The second site, Rabbi Shulman, is highlighted because it is an existing structure with existing apartments. The site is scheduled for demolition because the work needed is too great, and affordable housing units are set to be built in its place. Even if they constructed on the site, it is trading one problem for another. Not to mention, many of their complaints about the Bendix site (too close to business) would apply, and then some, to that site. The sixth site abuts a residential neighborhood and Stanley Clark school, again, why would their previous complaints about Bendix not apply here and then some? 

Im not going to spend my time and pick apart each location, this is just what a 5 minute cursory glance shows. There are glaring problems with many of the sites they proposed. It is clear that they dont actually care about finding another location, they simply want to turn this into a divisive issue and stall the process.

Then they say we have 16 cites according to the new day and city’s requirements but the last 4 or so are below the necessary lot size of 3 acres. They started with ignition park yet again which is a no go. And a majority of the cites would require demolition or heavy clean up to prepare the lot. Which is weird since they say they have a responsibility to use taxes wisely but their options demonstrate that they’ll spend more to not put it on bendix so I don’t know how genuine that is.",9,2024-03-12 12:54:18 UTC

Now, if that building is not repairable, then I 'd say that the tenants were the ones who beat they daylights out of that building. Much like what happened to Cabrini Greens in Chicago.",2,2024-03-13 01:50:51 UTC

Very humanizing. My worst homeless experience was when I was driving under a bridge downtown that had a light right after you exit from under the bridge. Three street dwellers came up to my car tried to get me to roll down my window. I didn’t because it was 11pm nor did I have anything to give them. They seemed mad but it looked like they were going to walk away. Right before the light turned green two of the street dwellers  grabbed something from the third street dwellers backpack and then threw grey “slop” all over on my windshield. I have no idea what it was but it shocked me and I drove away quickly. When I got home most of it had run off the car but what was left was very thick and pasty. Had no odor to it. Very odd. Street dweller encounters are hit or miss. Regardless it’s important to remember they are human. I always keep some nickels and dimes on me now to hopefully avoid situations like the car slop incident. They’re just trying to survive and I will help them out when I can.

They shouldn't have to walk all over town with everything they own, to several places a day, to be inside, safe, with food, bathrooms and clean clothes.

Edit: the current situation requires almost everyone to go to three or four places a day with several hour gaps between the services where they sit outside, drink/drug, can't hit the library or bus station between, and *this* is what people are upset about. If they had a fucking day center and weren't ""put out"" for hours between services and *days* waiting for laundry (maybe they wouldn't push carts with a week worth of clean clothes or strain the laundry services they can rarely receive), from what I understand, there would be a lot less of the problems people keep saying are hurting the community. Moving the tents from one place to another doesn't solve anything it just puts the ""problem"" in front of someone else's window.",1,2020-07-18 20:29:06 UTC

I challenge any of you to say the same thing if this was moving in right next door to your home. Read the articles, all people quoted acknowledge there have been ""issues"" with other projects like this in town, Troy Warner even acknowleged as much saying he lived near one previously. The fact that he no longer lives there, I guarantee you the facility factored into him relocating. This neighborhood has been a nice quiet neighborhood with many families with young children. Our property values were finally coming up. What happens when my house is worth half what I paid for it? A lot of people have moved in recently paying upwards of $150 for their houses. Several of those now will back up directly to this building. If this project turns out the way others have, those homeowners are liable to be underwater on their mortgage before hardly moving in. some of those are liable to walk away from their mortgages, and where does that lead? See the west side before Buttigieg had many abandoned homes razed. 
The Corby homes, while not having the best history, are not drug addicts and mental health patients unable to access other services. What happens when a resident stops taking their medication? Or relapses and is expelled from the program? When that happens people are evicted from the building, where will they go? They stay where they were. Our neighborhood is enclosed by busy roads and a golf course with its own barbed wire fence. The expensive new condos are safe they have Ironwood as a buffer. Once people are here they will stay here whether they are living in the residence or not. There's no where else to go, but the park around Edison middle school sure looks like a nice place to shoot up. Take a look at the center for the homeless downtown, or the soup kitchen at the Methodist Church. People hang out all around there at all hours. I have a friend who lived near the soup kitchen and there were constantly seedy characters hanging out in her yard, fights, shouting about taking the word of christ to heart or face his wrath in hell....that was at 2am on a Tuesday, ans she lived a block away from the kitchen. 
Besides all that, it's especially angering that the city has done this with zero involvement from the neighborhood, zero warning, zero comment. They recently started building a security fence around the Edison IT department parking lot a few weeks before this was announced. We should ""go greet [our] new neighbors"", yet the SBCSC is worried about their vans? My nextdoor neighbor has been here since the early 80s, this exact same project was tried in the 90s, the land was rezoned, but then the project abandoned after outcry from the neighborhood, much like th articles allude to. Fast forward 25 years they no longer have to have council approval because the land is already zoned as such, especially convinient we now only have virtual common council meetings, no one can voice opposition. They knew no one would want it in the neighborhood so they just looked the other way and literally said ""deal with it"". It's especially grand they only alerted residents within 350 feet of the property. You know how many houses are within that zone? About 6.   (and they only got a letter in the mail a few days before the press release). Are you telling me this will affect no one outside that radius? 
Even more angering is that last year Mueller vetoed, and Troy Warner voted against a planned car wash next to the McClure station because such use was ""deemed to negatively affect neighborhood property values, and was not in keeping with the atmosphere of the neighborhood"". But now with this they're just like ""oh uh....you know the west side has had a lot, we thought we'd spread it around let everyone share, but you guys are just gonna love it trust me, and with the school there, what a learning opportunity! Kids! You seeing all this plight??""

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to Warner (and I should probably send one to Mueller as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter.

\- Oliver Davis got truly irate

\- Pam Meyer (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information Sunday night to council. Less than 24 hours before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from Oaklawn said the Oliver Apartments started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after 2 AM when there is no presence on site. Some lady from Oaklawn who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to June and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- The Heritage Foundation got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until 2 AM) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- The Heritage Foundation and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- Steve Camilleri of the Center for the Homeless berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from Hope Rescue essentially said the same thing. Steve also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes tonight the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which The Heritage Foundation said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with Steve apologized because they were voting against.

\- Camilleri also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly Oaklawn employees, and people like Camilleri who only took up about 25 minutes total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give 5 minutes to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition 30 seconds?

\- The Heritage Foundation had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the Oliver PSH project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the road. Marco kept repeating they asked their consultant (this week) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as Clear under Environmental Concern while giving numerous sites labels of Caution. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- Jo Broden tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter (Klein) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""homeless shelter"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. Marco said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 NWSNO meetings, 1 of which is attended. The NWSNO barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in February without a site in mind so then it became urgent in June to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around 2005. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in Broden's district?",19,2019-08-27 17:36:24 UTC

It's 20-22 units, they have leases, and some pay a small portion of rent but not usually. Originally (early July) it was a part time maintenance person, a 40 hours a week apt/community manager, and 17 hours a week for a off-duty cop. RA may live on site but they would have to go to the state for approval, likely be difficult, and not in plans currently.

There would be on site visits from Oaklawn (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to Oaklawn. Same for mental health and addiction services.  Oaklawn would have 2 case managers available, not solely dedicated. The homeless individual has the choice to participate.

He personally spoke in favor of this project last Monday in front of council/media, only for Pam and Marco to shit the bed and get voted down 7-2. Even Ferlic only spoke against but voted in favor because he's close with Pete. They'll probably try to stick with this site because the alternative would take 4-6 months and open up even more questions like whether the city should just buy 15 scattered buildings throughout all districts, or even get Mishawaka and adjacent cities involved in the solution? They will pay for soil testing/environmental report which should take 3 weeks since a few council members said they won't support a site without it. I'm guessing this can be ordered right away out of some discretionary fund without waiting on council approval and be ready by October 1st? They're going to need to put on a show to really appear to be listening to the community like a series of 6 public and advertised meetings. They will make adjustments to the budget and commitments to security, 24 hour on site staff presence, and a large benefit to the neighborhood (new park?, small business grants?, new lighting and sidewalks?). Operating budget will go up $120,000 per year and the development/construction estimate will go up $250,000? Buttigieg will make sure the increased costs get covered.

They had every opportunity to provide an update in the last 3 months but didn't. People found out about it by finding the petition to be on the RDC agenda at the last minute.

""Winter arrived in the form of a cold wind on Tuesday night when I went to speak with homeless people encamped on Main Street, under a bridge near the bus station. It wasn’t my first visit, but with the downtown winter warming shelter open for the season, it was the best chance yet to try to understand why some people are still at the viaduct.

We had just left Project WARM, operated by volunteers and Hope Ministries in a building the city purchased for them last year. It’s very basic, but it offers a clean and safe place to sleep. Some nights, it’s the only option for those with addiction or other issues preventing them from accessing other facilities. The shelter can sleep up to 30 people; that night, there were 23.

Seven people remained at the bridge. Most were asleep, but two spoke with us. “Why under the bridge?” my colleague asked one man after we got to talking. “It’s dry,” he said. “It’s one thing to be cold. It’s another thing to be wet.”

I offered to walk him to the shelter, two blocks away, but he said he didn’t want to give up his space and didn’t trust local nonprofits. We made the same offer to a second man, who said he would think about it, but then pulled his sleeping bag over his head and went to sleep.

Morally, there is no simple answer to the question of whether someone should be forced indoors. But most of us can agree that no human being should be living under a bridge. Some seek out places like this, but research shows that encampments carry a higher risk of disease, abuse, and physical violence.

Concerned about these harms, the city has begun cleaning the area more frequently. Some have objected at the sight of pallets and makeshift cardboard beds being carried away. (Contrary to rumor, crews are not confiscating warm weather clothing or similar personal property, except when abandoned.)

Others think that the city has been too tolerant, but we have limited legal options.

Often lost in the discussion is the tremendous level of effort — and progress — on homelessness here in recent years. According to federal data, homelessness has fallen by a quarter since 2005.

We’ve added substantial resources, including a downtown social outreach ambassador and new funds for a “housing first” strategy that emphasizes getting people indoors so that other issues can be addressed. Meanwhile, 32 new beds of permanent supportive housing are becoming available at the FUSE Center.

Next year, we will invest $1.5 million in a gateway shelter for rapid re-housing. And we’re closing in on the goal of eliminating unsheltered veteran homelessness altogether.

But a scarcity of mental health and offender re-entry resources, plus the growing opioid crisis, are endangering these gains. And while Project WARM brings the total number of winter amnesty beds to 55, some nights this winter there will not be enough beds and people will be turned away.

There is much more to do, and members of the community can help. Local charities housing homeless people, like the Center for the Homeless, Project WARM and Life Treatment Centers, need socks, hats, and other clothing in addition to volunteer hours and financial donations.

Looking further ahead, we as a community will need to finance about 50 more units of permanent supportive housing to meet local needs.

Most of all, we need unity of purpose. Those who feel strongly enough to hold a sign in protest or comment on social media can also help by contributing time or donating to organizations with a proven track record of moving people out of homelessness.

And those who think we are spending too much should consider how much more expensive it would be to let the problem play out by way of incarceration, in emergency rooms, and on the streets.

This is among society’s toughest issues, but our community is up to the challenge. As the holiday season beckons us to shopping malls, our conscience also calls us to do more, each in our own way, to support those most in need.

In order to be healthy, happy, and employed, one must first be warm, sheltered, and safe. We can’t fix every problem in another person’s life, but we can and should help the most vulnerable meet basic needs.""

This is true. Doesn't mean you should lack compassion or treatment for those with disorders.

1) Lack of public bathrooms. Which public location near the underpass lets homeless in to use the facilities?

2) Mental health disorders. When the world is a blur and you are hearing voices in your head, where you drop a loaf is not that important.

I believe it would be better at the new location because it will honestly be a custom facility to better meet needs rather than crammed into an existing old motel.

I spent many years as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's workgroups on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It works.2 - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the NW side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a way that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

To be fair it is standard procedure for the groups trying to create homeless facilities to wait until the last minute to reveal their plans. 

See the Hope Avenue Homes (PSH) in Edison Park. South Bend Heritage and the city very clearly hid their intent especially through the process of acquiring the land, because if its already zoned properly, then they don't need an iota of public input. They held a meeting and told the neighborhood to screw off which I don't think is the right way to go about it, but its the easiest route. 

I really place the blame on the city because the opposition is always going to be more fiery when the first time they are made aware of a project the city is basically 5 months from construction. Im very for this project, but come on......the city didn't let anyone know until planning was 80% complete and the school corp didnt know they couldn't secretly sell the land without advertising it.....really?",6,2024-02-02 14:09:16 UTC

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought m4n doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of m4n said homelessness was done for with m4n running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. Commisioner Deiter and Amy Drake hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. Deiter didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the fire department to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had).

It's much better for the people with challenges & the broader community to do scattered site housing where people with high needs can be surrounded by others with some levels of stability to contribute to them and where the high needs of others aren't constantly triggering their personal challenges. It is also less stigmatizing.

Obviously, scattered site still faces NIMBY opposition and is more expensive. I believe the city previously made an attempt at that and was shot down.

re: m4n, I've been more out of the loop for a bit now, but I think you're probably right re: on site -- but the issue is (as anyone who has ever protested anything knows) the sidewalk out in front is likely public property. And I do know from past work, the least of the issue is the actual residents of our homeless centers and the bigger issue is the people who come to prey on them. Unfortunately, anywhere you place a complex like this becomes a giant beacon to attract bad actors to come try to prey on the people there.

Intoxication alone is not grounds for program dismissal, but drug dealing and violent conduct are. Treatment is encouraged and facilitated, with guests generally pursuing their paths to recovery at their own pace with the support of staff & Oaklawn Recovery Coaches onsite.

I do think that anything regarding helping the unhoused faces a massive uphill battle for public image, and the general public finds low-barrier housing first approaches even more distasteful despite all evidence of its efficacy. obviously this leads shelter administrators to speak in oversimplified platitudes to beef up their pitch, but her line about ~functionally ending homelessness~ drives me up a wall every time I hear it, and I have heard it dozens of times. I feel like it also discredits those arguing in favor of the program, because those opposed can so easily say, “well I saw a homeless person last Tuesday, so you must be full of crap!”
it’s just so validating to hear someone else mention that damn talking point.

I wish that public discussion had room for the nuance and complexity of all the entangled issues at play here. some of the worries are rooted in legitimate concerns, but the opposition gets too riled up and the narrative gets too polarized to facilitate a fruitful, good faith community discussion.

FWIW, through my personal experience, I would say the biggest contributing factor to concerns over a lack of safety/drug dealing/guests etc. would overwhelmingly be put in check with the construction of a purpose-built facility where those coming and going could be kept track of easily. a three building motel campus is extremely hard to supervise. IMO this is one of the best points in favor of the intake center’s construction, but to even discuss it would require acknowledging where the current program falls short, and no one is willing to do that because it will be gobbled up and twisted by people like Dieter, Drake, and French and fed right into the script for the riled up NIMBY’s 🫠",6,2024-02-03 01:00:12 UTC

Willow is doing what she's supposed to, advocating for dtsb and the city in general. I don't know how that would be seen as a conflict.

This is the only one that makes sense, if we do anything with a south Shore it must come downtown. Otherwise it's a huge waste of money and just a kickback to developers.

The switch to a downtown location is expensive, but the resulting growth for the city would be enormous. As a person with a lot of study in transit policy, you'd see that whole area near the station boom with the easy access to Chicago, access to the stadium, and all the surrounding businesses. Whereas blowing millions on switching it from one side of the airport to the other will save ten minutes in travel, an action to yay does absolutely nothing for the south shore or the city. It's not enough time saving to matter and not close enough to people to boost growth.

When I spoke with nolan at their unveiling event on their grand plan to screw the city and asked why they wouldn't focus on downtown first, where the riders are, and use that to fund the airport expansion. He said they get all the riders they need from the airport. He has no interest in supporting the community, just getting kickbacks to developers. I'd really like to see someone checking into his finances and seeing if there are ties to our absurdly corrupt county commissioners.",31,2023-07-20 16:11:51 UTC

You casually raising the specter of a conflict of interest regarding a dedicated director of a non-profit based on nothing but idle speculation (as you hide in your anonymity) is not only wildly irresponsible, it’s toxic, a hindrance to intelligent & reasoned public discourse, and emblematic of what’s wrong with social media. You’re using a tactic the the dirtiest of politicians and sleaziest of tabloids have used for years: throw out an unfounded accusation with zero proof, and just let it float out there, lingering in people’s minds. “Is Joe Biden a secret shareholder in Amtrak?” “Does Donald Trump get kickbacks from the Saudi’s?”. “Is reddit user u/donceeano an internet troll living in his parent’s basement who’s paid by the airport to slander non-profit servants?” You don’t have to show proof of anything, just sling mud. It’s needlessly cruel, damaging, and counterproductive. 

In your post you made several points that you seem passionate about, and apparently want to engage in real conversation on.

Her DTSB employment compensation is determined by the non profit’s board. Her official capacity as director is to guide the organization as it promotes the mission of promoting downtown South Bend. 

It’s ok to disagree with Willow’s view on the location of a train station. There is enough evidence that a reasonable person can see why she favors it over other options. There is also plenty of evidence to say other locations are better.

Their sole focus is to keep their railways as functional, efficient, and safe as possible. Teams of lawyers exist to protect their property. They have zero incentive to introduce a bunch of liability and turmoil into their operations. Hence why Norfolk was not bashful about making that statement publicly. 

My proposed location wouldn't change the location of the track hypothetically. Lets just say that aspect stays the same. What is does do is immediately provides more land, cheaper land, in a less congested area, and some of which is already owned by the city. So off the bat I'm saying with zero effort I'm already proposing a more suitable location than Union Station",3,2023-07-20 20:06:17 UTC

Good on you. I clearly wrote that the mayor advocated for a “downtown train” when I posted the link. 

Much of what you’ve written is wrong or based on false info. You should understand what is actually happening on this issue in the real world before you start muckraking on the internet, making false accusations and misrepresenting the situation:

- The City, DTSB and Willow are advocating to help bring the train downtown. Period. 

- There is no downtown site that is currently “set”, because in the order of operations for these kinds of large scale projects, that part hasn’t happened yet. Union Station is simply the first and most obvious choice and so preliminary research is being done about its viability. 

- If you or anyone has a better location, it will of course be considered. Maybe do some research and show up at a meeting or send an email rather than grousing online.

- At this point in the process, the main goal is to make sure the Airport option is NOT hastily pushed through for federal funding before the downtown contingent can advocate for what they believe is a superior location for residents, the City, and the region. 

- The primary action needed from ANYONE and EVERYONE who cares about the South Shore (and hopefully Amtrak) train terminal moving downtown is to make your voice heard and give your feedback via “public comments” on the $75-150 million South Shore Airport Realignment Project that special interests are currently trying to push through without opposition. Tell them you don’t feel that Airport needs another SS station, and that the best spot for the South Shore end-of-the-line terminal should be Downtown, and why. The intention is to show those who are considering funding the airport project (which is NOT a done deal by any means) that there is a preferable option and slow down the process for the Airport option so that the City, DTSB, and other stakeholders have time to generate a superior counter proposal for a downtown option.  

- Public Comments on the South Shore Airport Realignment option can be made here: 
https://4p90f.r.bh.d.sendibt3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA6Qs4xydnpl223zY0ZmP0kPFy/efJpylBYF8Mt

- Your statement about how Northfolk Southern won’t negotiate regarding their right-of-way is simply false. That’s the kind of misinformation that people who want to spend $75-150 million to move the train station from one side of the airport to the other want you to believe, because it serves their cause. But it’s just not true. Of course railroads negotiate. How would they ever get anything done if they didn’t? Multiple transportation consultants who are working with the downtown contingent have made it very clear, at the meetings they’ve spoken at, that A) getting concessions from railroads is possible and is done routinely on large projects like this and B) that the rumor that they won’t negotiate is just gamesmanship by the Airport contingent.

- The accusations you made about a conflict of interest between DTSB/Willow and Kevin Smith are irresponsible and untrue. You do understand that DTSB’s charter and mission is to help improve, promote, and advocate for downtown residents and businesses, right? Not only is Union Station downtown, it’s a train station, and with doable modifications could accommodate a South Shore terminal. So if DTSB/Willow are advocating for a downtown train and mentioning Union Station as a viable option, it’s only because it is a viable option, and that’s their job. Not because of some imagined malfeasance that you dreamed up. And they aren’t the only ones who have championed that location. Literally, hundreds of other citizens, developers, consultants, professors, and politicians have advocated for Union Station over the past few years. Recently, a Notre Dame engineering class explored multiple different options for a potential downtown station. If you or anyone else have a better idea for where the South Shore should terminate downtown, then contact DTSB and share your thoughts. And if after that you still passionately believe that yours is a better option, then do your research, develop a pitch for it, and champion it with the downtown stakeholders as their process unfolds. 

That’s how stuff gets done.

Here’s hoping that you do the honorable thing, admit your misstep, delete your false accusations from your post, and then throw your hat in the ring by reaching out to DTSB/Willow and sharing your ideas for an alternate downtown train station location. You’ll find that the primary goal of the downtown contingent is simply to advance a proposal that they feel will have the greatest benefit for South Bend’s future and get funded by the Federal government.

I can also tell you that Sb Schools was designed for 132,000 Residents, and now it has 102,000. Which means less kids. I can also tell you that people are having a lot lesss kids.

Now that the stupid bussing between sections of track has finished, the entire process should be much easier. 

Just like any other public transportation system, one should be aware of times. Arrive a bit early to ensure a seat if possible. Once you leave South Bend, get comfortable and enjoy the ride. After an hour and a half or closer to 2 hours, you’ll be at millennium station. 

You can exit and walk up the stairs into the loop / downtown there, or, leave the train and head into the station, look up for the signs to the “pedway” to the CTA trains. It’s basically out then you make a left before leaving the train station and go through a series of doors and tunnels through a maze which links the lower levels of a multitude of Chicago buildings. You’ll pass what seem like malls, pass a window which looks into the pool of a gym, pass a few little restaurants and shops, and find your way to the CTA red line or continue to the Blue line. It can all be reached underground, which is super good to take advantage of when the weather is freezing. 

A google search of “south shore line” should bring up schedules and an app you can download for a more streamlined ticket purchase.

Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like Pete and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey Pete is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of Pete and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever.

It's not jaded to be not for a candidate that you're for, no more than I think you're jaded for disagreeing. It's just politics and reasonable people can come to disagreement. 

2. I litteraly just quoted what Jason himself said. If you have an issue with that then we'll idk what to tell you. 

3. Saying you'll find money for neighborhood improvements and homeless programs by ""consolidating government operations with the county and Mishawaka"" is a stupid idea and should be called out. It won't happen because Mishawaka would never do it and our combined 911 center shows how bad it would go if they did. Even if you did see some financial savings from reduced redundancies, it would take years to pan out the agreements, not exactly money you could spend on day 1.

4. Saying things like ""residents are disenchanted with downtown developments"" ; ""it's just another issue we need to stop screwing around on"" and ""South bend has been resurging for longer than the buttigieg Adminstration"" are all comments that would point me to believe Jason sees himself as pretty decent break with Pete. WHICH IS FINE he should just be honest about it an not say stuff at the end about people who like the current direction will like mine. Just own what you want to do. Because as someone who very much likes the direction of the city, and who is not disenchanted with downtown development or thinks the city is screwing around on a numbe of issues, that's a clear difference in opinion. Which again, is fine and that voice needs to be heard but this just seems like pandering. 

5. I haven't seen these detailed plans on homelessness you talk about, or any other issue for that matter. I read through his entire issues page a few days ago and didn't see a single actual initiative or policy. Just boilerplate ""city needs to invest more in sidewalks"" okay that's great but how do you do that? What's the plan? The only plan I've seen is for the low interest loans for teachers which I think is a great idea and give him credit for.

Also, Mishawaka government wont touch us with a 10 foot pole and the bad decisions by the area plan commission (which is combined South bend and county) show why it's a dumb idea because county leaders have certain priorities and city leaders have different ones.

Unfortunately there is no easy solution that makes everyone happy.

Like $750-$900 a month. Some are insane though, so dont get discouraged. 

Are you under a month to month lease, or is a contract (like a full year). If it is a contract, TALK TO A LAWYER. I would imagine they have to provide you with some accommodation. If it is month to month, you might be SOL.

Taxes,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/5ztf0r/taxes/,2017-03-16 21:23:08 UTC,"I have seen it both ways, it just depends on the payroll company. Typically if payroll has you listed at the correct address, they are taking the correct amount. Again, Indiana's tax code is pretty straightforward, so its pretty easy for the payroll companies. When there are errors, they are pretty small. Like, if you make $50k a year and even if you paid no tax, the most you might owe would be $1500, which sucks, but is completely manageable. 

If you want to verify that they are taking out the taxes, your state and local should be about 3% total. If they are taking about 2% state and have nothing listed for local, you might want them to bump it up, but if they are doing any combination that adds up to ~3%, you should be covered.

With regards to schooling, Indiana instituted a voucher system several years back which allows families to choose where their children can attend, even outside their own district (which is fairly common).  Penn High School is the biggest in the county, but New Prairie is growing as well.  South Bend Community School Corporation is shrinking, unfortunately.

If you intend to commute to Chicago, then the South Shore and Toll Road will certainly be helpful.  Many parts of the south side of town are nice, but you might want to stay towards the west or northwest side of town to be closer to the Toll Road and Train station.

I think best week ever is a good start, but I agree we need solid business establishments to attract a healthy amount of activity on a daily basis. It seems like every weekend in GR theres lot of people walking around and enjoying the city. The art festival in GR is always pretty fun too.

I have always stated that GR is the pinnacle for what a town of 100-300K people can be. What needs to happen to become the next GR and have that level of activity?

1) We need to become the whore to at least 5 large, multinational companies that want to locate within 2 miles of downtown. They want an abatement, throw it at them. They want lower property taxes, phase them in. We need them to get a larger educated workforce with well paying jobs.

2) We need more restaurants and bars within 200 feet of the river. Any new restaurant in the city must include outdoor patio seating or rooftop decking. If your establishment is a brewery, do whatever the fuck you want, just make sure its by the river/downtown.

3) Hey developers, you want to build your new apt/housing complex? There better be actual affordability in those homes. If we want affluent families or individuals to be moving downtown in droves, we need housing that people making 70-150K would want to move into. Hopefully will the new Commerce Center place this will be achievable. If I was looking for another place, it is a better investment to purchase a home nearly every time in this area assuming I want to live here more than 3 years.

4) Find some way to make South Bend Schools Great Again.  People who have families that want to live downtown, sure as shit don't want to be sending their kids to south bend schools. They have the expense of private schools or driving them across town. Younger, educated people/families value living in areas that have good education.

5) MORE BUSINESS! No one seriously gives a shit if someone opens their dream storefront downtown if it sells garbage. I have never seen a single person buy shit from the little store next to the chocolate factory. Get stores that have a name down there. We could support satellite offices for the likes of Amazon/Google/Facebook/Tech companies with the proximity to the fiber node that runs under the Toll Road. 

6) Last way to make DTSB similar to GR? Quit with the gimmicks. They draw people in but won't keep them. Drawing people down there with out a reason to stay is like putting lipstick on a pig. Cut that pig open, lay out the ham and bacon and let people feast. ",6,2017-06-04 12:47:52 UTC

Best.Week.Ever,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/6f621v/bestweekever/,2017-06-04 06:43:06 UTC,"1) I totally agree. We need some more economic presence. I would personally be okay with some larger businesses being located at Blackthorn. Yeah, its not as close to the workforce as a 2-mile radius to downtown, but I feel that area is more attractive to some businesses. I'd rather have them there than closer to downtown if it risked us losing the business.

2) GR has a great food scene. We have a river with good views of the skyline, and we should encourage local restaurants taking advantage of that. I think the Emporium is the only place to do so. 

3) Let's hope all the new apartments coming online fill up and more get built. 

4) SBCSC isn't quite as bad as people make it out to be. The administration isn't perfect. There's issues, we can all agree. But, I feel that a large portion of the problem isn't the schools themselves, its the students. And by the students, I mean its their home life. And by that, I mean poverty. When mom/dad (if both are even in the picture) have to work late/multiple jobs/are alcoholic/don't care about their children, it makes it tough for the kids to behave in school and not act out. This is a deep issue that cannot be fixed overnight, but it starts with a community effort to help guide these children to have the tools they need for success, but also we need more and better jobs for those parents that struggle to put food on the table or make rent. I think that if theres more money coming into these households, then over time the children will behave better (less acting out, less truancy, less drugs, more desire to learn) and SBCSC test scores will improve. 

5) yes yes yes. DTSB needs to have real shopping. Right now its just office space and some restaurants. Theres hardly any retail. Why do most people go to the loop in Chicago? There's lots of retail, parks, and food. Metronet runs downtown, which connect to Union Station, which is where all the fiber runs into. Theres some along the toll road but most of it runs along the railroad tracks and into the basement of Union Station. I wish Salesforce would have looked into SB instead of Indy, but I understand the reality of the situation too. I think an H&M would do well downtown. 

6) Without more retail and business downtown, I think it's tough to convince people still to come downtown. Sure, image is improving, but I'm still convincing people from the region (outside of SB) that DTSB is not scary and you won't get taken by a homeless man and abused. Things are changing but we need more still. I think more people living and walking around downtown will help, but when the new David Matthews apartments go up and theres a real sign of things changing and growing, only then will outsiders really begin to see the change.

 What is happening is these places are advertising student or elderly housing prices, and it is not available to the general public. Or else it has an income restriction, and the rate they advertise is only available for low-income qualifiers, and is on unadvertised ""market rate"" if you are not low income.

Unfortunately, there is not a good answer. Just keep looking, and if you see someplace make sure to confirm it is their market rate.

For what I found, you can expect 700-800 for a 2-bedroom apartment on the least expensive end in this area. 1 bedroom might be about 100 less, and studio not much less than that.

Also note some owners said no pets but it’s still worth reaching out. We told owners we would pay an extra fee per month and that changed their mind. 

One thing we didn’t do that is also check the houses that were for sale. Some of them are listed as available for both options. You also may be able to ask agents handling the listings, specifically the ones on the market longer, if owner would consider renting.
