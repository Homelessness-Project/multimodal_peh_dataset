- A panhandler makes more than $2 every 15 minutes standing still.

- Panhandlers, moreso homeless squatters are a huge polluters of our parks. I've personally relocated them and cleaned their piles of shit off the steps in front of buildings.

- I don't want them hanging out in our parks. I fully understand this is a shitty thing to say but I don't want to be told to feel sympathy for the homeless that don't utilize the shelter due to mental illness or drug addiction only to have them in our parks. 

- If there isn't already, the city can pass an ordinance to prevent it, plain and simple. If we can tell them they are not allowed to sleep under the viaduct (which we did), we can tell them they can't panhandle on the medians or sidewalks. If it gets challenged upstream so be it, at least we actually tried.",3,2017-06-06 20:46:28 UTC

I do think it is important to distinguish between the homeless and the panhandlers. We know they are not the same thing, and have different solutions. 

I personally do have a bit of sympathy (tiny, tiny amounts) for those who can't get assistance because of an addiction or other mental illness. Being cut off from help is just going to make them more desperate. Like it or not, they are here and will continue to be our problem. If they can't get help, they will be out there in perpetuity, which isn't good for any of us. 

As far as passing an ordinance, I'm all for enforcing existing legal ordinances and if anyone can come up with something legal that isn't already on the books, they absolutely should get it done. We should not be allowing them to create makeshift communities, especially at the expense of the health, safety, and cleanliness of our city. However, it is extremely foolish and short sided to suggest that we should do more and let it be challenged in the courts. Panhandlers and homeless are a known problem across the country, and it is pretty well established what you can and can not do. We absolutely need to be wary of inflicting legal penalties and costs upon us when that money could be used towards actually fixing the problem. 

So what works? What can we do that we aren't doing? Like you said, we need to be much more tough on enforcing actual existing rules. We need to be less tolerant of them outside of predetermined areas. On the more creative side of things, we need to focus on reducing homelessness and making it inconvenient for the panhandlers. I would love to see a campaign where actual, well dressed people go with nice bright collection buckets and work the corners. Occupy the space they are already utilizing, then use the proceeds to fund services that get those who need legitimate assistance help, and does it in a way that we we a community can control and supervise. I'd especially like to see stuff like this on Notre Dame weekends. Living near campus, the panhandlers are out in full force whenever out of towers are around. It's a huge image problem for us, and it does nothing but encourage them because they can rank in a lot of cash quickly. I also wouldn't be opposed to buying these people one way plane/train/bus tickets to any place a few hundred miles away. Make it a one time deal, and give them $50 if they accept. I'm sure some will find their way back, and others will take their place, but it keeps them moving. I'm sure that will be controversial, but sometimes you gotta do whatever you can.

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing.

But I agree. The panhandling has gotten a lot worse the last month. Something does need to be done short term and long term. I don't think we'll see much retail downtown until this is solved. 

I do believe that the panhandling and homelessness is possibly the last major hurdle for downtown. Friends and family that visit comment about it everytime to me. It's something we have to solve that other local communities don't. I think it's the last major blemish on downtown that can hopefully have a permanent solution. ",6,2017-07-15 01:01:00 UTC

It's tough because we want South Bend to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a LOT of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for SB. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire US (is South Bend the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for Notre Dame to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of South Bend to help tackle this problem the right way. I've always thought Notre Dame should be a little more involved with SB, and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ND benefits from a better SB. ",5,2017-07-15 01:40:18 UTC

It's not the same in almost all ways.   Again, I'm downtown every single day and have been for several years.  I've lived here for 40 yrs.  Smart Streets has brought activity and energy unseen in that time.  The Cubs, 1st Friday's, The East Race and River Lights are really starting to gain traction.  

It's true that for the last 20 or so years there has been a relatively small presence of beggars and street people.  It has spiked greatly in the last year and IMHO poses a grave threat to the really exciting things that seem to be gaining traction.

I believe the community is working on a 24-hour facility for them to hang out? 

But, in the winter deep freeze, the walking commute is a huge distance between Broadway church and the library for warmth physiological need..(maslows hierarchy of motivational needs) 

Also, always keep in mind there's always a bad apple in every group... 

(Late 2022 winter transient homeless here) I have 3 months' experience as being amongst the transient homeless (reason I know have 9 disability checks currently saved up) - thus, I didn't do my 2021 disability review, and I was suspended until I did review (mid December 2022 - 9 months after suspension) 

But, the pains these transient homeless fave in the winter is worse than any pain I have ever suffered... me long 10 months of incomeless homeless... when I received my back disability pay in January 2023... I could easily choose a 100 dollar a day motel..  and be them again... a week later, I went into a homeless program..  rules, gotta obey rules, do the hours long chores, and go to weekday classes..  
It gave me rest, got my mind together, from that transitional, non rested, stressed out mind..  
At the hope missionary, I decided to repay creditors 13k in defaulted debt..  thus making my mind more compliant to hope missionary rules, program, and structure..  by time, I left hope when I graduated, I had amassed 11.5k savings.   With paid off debt.. . Now, I'm in affordable housing, for $500 monthly rent obligations... and, have 15k saved looking forward.. (9 benefits a month shy compared to what I suffered) 

Most of the homeless, is mentally ill..  90% is extremely mentally ill... or severly physically handicapped..  it's really sad sight... 

During my 10 months of incomelessness, the food stamp denial pains, (25% eligible applicants are denied, the highest denial rate in the US, Guam, and Puerto rico) 

And, locally, the oaklawn psychiatric does not help their patients with a case manager... the psychiatric center neglects the mentally ill badly... 

Thank God, I'm far more functioning and compliant....

Ill say, I think this effort is a bit disingenuous. They spout off on the mayor's office about how they were able to locate these sites in two weeks vs the multi year process, but the fact that it took them two weeks shows. The first site on the list, for example, is barred from residential development by IDEM. The second site, Rabbi Shulman, is highlighted because it is an existing structure with existing apartments. The site is scheduled for demolition because the work needed is too great, and affordable housing units are set to be built in its place. Even if they constructed on the site, it is trading one problem for another. Not to mention, many of their complaints about the Bendix site (too close to business) would apply, and then some, to that site. The sixth site abuts a residential neighborhood and Stanley Clark school, again, why would their previous complaints about Bendix not apply here and then some? 

Im not going to spend my time and pick apart each location, this is just what a 5 minute cursory glance shows. There are glaring problems with many of the sites they proposed. It is clear that they dont actually care about finding another location, they simply want to turn this into a divisive issue and stall the process.

Very humanizing. My worst homeless experience was when I was driving under a bridge downtown that had a light right after you exit from under the bridge. Three street dwellers came up to my car tried to get me to roll down my window. I didn’t because it was 11pm nor did I have anything to give them. They seemed mad but it looked like they were going to walk away. Right before the light turned green two of the street dwellers  grabbed something from the third street dwellers backpack and then threw grey “slop” all over on my windshield. I have no idea what it was but it shocked me and I drove away quickly. When I got home most of it had run off the car but what was left was very thick and pasty. Had no odor to it. Very odd. Street dweller encounters are hit or miss. Regardless it’s important to remember they are human.

I challenge any of you to say the same thing if this was moving in right next door to your home. Read the articles, all people quoted acknowledge there have been ""issues"" with other projects like this in town, Troy Warner even acknowleged as much saying he lived near one previously. The fact that he no longer lives there, I guarantee you the facility factored into him relocating. This neighborhood has been a nice quiet neighborhood with many families with young children. Our property values were finally coming up. What happens when my house is worth half what I paid for it? A lot of people have moved in recently paying upwards of $150 for their houses. Several of those now will back up directly to this building. If this project turns out the way others have, those homeowners are liable to be underwater on their mortgage before hardly moving in. some of those are liable to walk away from their mortgages, and where does that lead? See the west side before Buttigieg had many abandoned homes razed. 
The Corby homes, while not having the best history, are not drug addicts and mental health patients unable to access other services. What happens when a resident stops taking their medication? Or relapses and is expelled from the program? When that happens people are evicted from the building, where will they go? They stay where they were. Our neighborhood is enclosed by busy roads and a golf course with its own barbed wire fence. The expensive new condos are safe they have Ironwood as a buffer. Once people are here they will stay here whether they are living in the residence or not. There's no where else to go, but the park around Edison middle school sure looks like a nice place to shoot up. Take a look at the center for the homeless downtown, or the soup kitchen at the Methodist Church. People hang out all around there at all hours. I have a friend who lived near the soup kitchen and there were constantly seedy characters hanging out in her yard, fights, shouting about taking the word of christ to heart or face his wrath in hell....that was at 2am on a Tuesday, ans she lived a block away from the kitchen. 
Besides all that, it's especially angering that the city has done this with zero involvement from the neighborhood, zero warning, zero comment. They recently started building a security fence around the Edison IT department parking lot a few weeks before this was announced. We should ""go greet [our] new neighbors"", yet the SBCSC is worried about their vans? My nextdoor neighbor has been here since the early 80s, this exact same project was tried in the 90s, the land was rezoned, but then the project abandoned after outcry from the neighborhood, much like th articles allude to. Fast forward 25 years they no longer have to have council approval because the land is already zoned as such, especially convinient we now only have virtual common council meetings, no one can voice opposition. They knew no one would want it in the neighborhood so they just looked the other way and literally said ""deal with it"". It's especially grand they only alerted residents within 350 feet of the property. You know how many houses are within that zone? About 6.   (and they only got a letter in the mail a few days before the press release). Are you telling me this will affect no one outside that radius? 
Even more angering is that last year Mueller vetoed, and Troy Warner voted against a planned car wash next to the McClure station because such use was ""deemed to negatively affect neighborhood property values, and was not in keeping with the atmosphere of the neighborhood"". But now with this they're just like ""oh uh....you know the west side has had a lot, we thought we'd spread it around let everyone share, but you guys are just gonna love it trust me, and with the school there, what a learning opportunity! Kids! You seeing all this plight??""

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*.

The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter.

Went from 7 to 12:30.

\- Oliver Davis got truly irate

\- Pam Meyer (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information Sunday night to council. Less than 24 hours before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from Oaklawn said the Oliver Apartments started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after 2 AM when there is no presence on site. Some lady from Oaklawn who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to June and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- The Heritage Foundation got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until 2 AM) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- The Heritage Foundation and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- Steve Camilleri of the Center for the Homeless berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from Hope Rescue essentially said the same thing. Steve also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes tonight the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which The Heritage Foundation said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with Steve apologized because they were voting against.

\- Camilleri also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly Oaklawn employees, and people like Camilleri who only took up about 25 minutes total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give 5 minutes to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition 30 seconds?

\- The Heritage Foundation had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the Oliver PSH project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the road. Marco kept repeating they asked their consultant (this week) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as Clear under Environmental Concern while giving numerous sites labels of Caution. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- Jo Broden tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter (Klein) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""homeless shelter"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. Marco said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 NWSNO meetings, 1 of which is attended. The NWSNO barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in February without a site in mind so then it became urgent in June to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around 2005. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in Broden's district?",19,2019-08-27 17:36:24 UTC

Mayor Pete on Homeless Issue,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/7ixinx/mayor_pete_on_homeless_issue/,2017-12-10 22:47:08 UTC,"Quote of the article.

""Winter arrived in the form of a cold wind on Tuesday night when I went to speak with homeless people encamped on Main Street, under a bridge near the bus station. It wasn’t my first visit, but with the downtown winter warming shelter open for the season, it was the best chance yet to try to understand why some people are still at the viaduct.

We had just left Project WARM, operated by volunteers and Hope Ministries in a building the city purchased for them last year. It’s very basic, but it offers a clean and safe place to sleep. Some nights, it’s the only option for those with addiction or other issues preventing them from accessing other facilities. The shelter can sleep up to 30 people; that night, there were 23.

Seven people remained at the bridge. Most were asleep, but two spoke with us. “Why under the bridge?” my colleague asked one man after we got to talking. “It’s dry,” he said. “It’s one thing to be cold. It’s another thing to be wet.”

I offered to walk him to the shelter, two blocks away, but he said he didn’t want to give up his space and didn’t trust local nonprofits. We made the same offer to a second man, who said he would think about it, but then pulled his sleeping bag over his head and went to sleep.

Morally, there is no simple answer to the question of whether someone should be forced indoors. But most of us can agree that no human being should be living under a bridge. Some seek out places like this, but research shows that encampments carry a higher risk of disease, abuse, and physical violence.

Concerned about these harms, the city has begun cleaning the area more frequently. Some have objected at the sight of pallets and makeshift cardboard beds being carried away. (Contrary to rumor, crews are not confiscating warm weather clothing or similar personal property, except when abandoned.)

Others think that the city has been too tolerant, but we have limited legal options.

Often lost in the discussion is the tremendous level of effort — and progress — on homelessness here in recent years. According to federal data, homelessness has fallen by a quarter since 2005.

We’ve added substantial resources, including a downtown social outreach ambassador and new funds for a “housing first” strategy that emphasizes getting people indoors so that other issues can be addressed. Meanwhile, 32 new beds of permanent supportive housing are becoming available at the FUSE Center.

Next year, we will invest $1.5 million in a gateway shelter for rapid re-housing. And we’re closing in on the goal of eliminating unsheltered veteran homelessness altogether.

But a scarcity of mental health and offender re-entry resources, plus the growing opioid crisis, are endangering these gains. And while Project WARM brings the total number of winter amnesty beds to 55, some nights this winter there will not be enough beds and people will be turned away.

There is much more to do, and members of the community can help. Local charities housing homeless people, like the Center for the Homeless, Project WARM and Life Treatment Centers, need socks, hats, and other clothing in addition to volunteer hours and financial donations.

Looking further ahead, we as a community will need to finance about 50 more units of permanent supportive housing to meet local needs.

Most of all, we need unity of purpose. Those who feel strongly enough to hold a sign in protest or comment on social media can also help by contributing time or donating to organizations with a proven track record of moving people out of homelessness.

And those who think we are spending too much should consider how much more expensive it would be to let the problem play out by way of incarceration, in emergency rooms, and on the streets.

This is among society’s toughest issues, but our community is up to the challenge. As the holiday season beckons us to shopping malls, our conscience also calls us to do more, each in our own way, to support those most in need.

In order to be healthy, happy, and employed, one must first be warm, sheltered, and safe. We can’t fix every problem in another person’s life, but we can and should help the most vulnerable meet basic needs.""

I spent many years as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's workgroups on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It works.2 - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the NW side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a way that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.  


edit: we obviously also need to do it without stigmatizing or making false claims about the character of our unhoused neighbors.",12,2024-02-02 14:52:22 UTC

To be fair it is standard procedure for the groups trying to create homeless facilities to wait until the last minute to reveal their plans. 

See the Hope Avenue Homes (PSH) in Edison Park. South Bend Heritage and the city very clearly hid their intent especially through the process of acquiring the land, because if its already zoned properly, then they don't need an iota of public input. They held a meeting and told the neighborhood to screw off which I don't think is the right way to go about it, but its the easiest route. 

I really place the blame on the city because the opposition is always going to be more fiery when the first time they are made aware of a project the city is basically 5 months from construction. Im very for this project, but come on......the city didn't let anyone know until planning was 80% complete and the school corp didnt know they couldn't secretly sell the land without advertising it.....really?",6,2024-02-02 14:09:16 UTC

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought m4n doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of m4n said homelessness was done for with m4n running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. Commisioner Deiter and Amy Drake hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. Deiter didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the fire department to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had). Honestly if m4n stops getting funded by the county I'm all down for camping in Deiter's years till he changes his mind.",5,2024-02-02 15:06:03 UTC

It's much better for the people with challenges & the broader community to do scattered site housing where people with high needs can be surrounded by others with some levels of stability to contribute to them and where the high needs of others aren't constantly triggering their personal challenges. It is also less stigmatizing.

Obviously, scattered site still faces NIMBY opposition and is more expensive. I believe the city previously made an attempt at that and was shot down.

re: m4n, I've been more out of the loop for a bit now, but I think you're probably right re: on site -- but the issue is (as anyone who has ever protested anything knows) the sidewalk out in front is likely public property. And I do know from past work, the least of the issue is the actual residents of our homeless centers and the bigger issue is the people who come to prey on them. Unfortunately, anywhere you place a complex like this becomes a giant beacon to attract bad actors to come try to prey on the people there.

Intoxication alone is not grounds for program dismissal, but drug dealing and violent conduct are. Treatment is encouraged and facilitated, with guests generally pursuing their paths to recovery at their own pace with the support of staff & Oaklawn Recovery Coaches onsite.

I do think that anything regarding helping the unhoused faces a massive uphill battle for public image, and the general public finds low-barrier housing first approaches even more distasteful despite all evidence of its efficacy. obviously this leads shelter administrators to speak in oversimplified platitudes to beef up their pitch, but her line about ~functionally ending homelessness~ drives me up a wall every time I hear it, and I have heard it dozens of times. I feel like it also discredits those arguing in favor of the program, because those opposed can so easily say, “well I saw a homeless person last Tuesday, so you must be full of crap!”
it’s just so validating to hear someone else mention that damn talking point.

I wish that public discussion had room for the nuance and complexity of all the entangled issues at play here. some of the worries are rooted in legitimate concerns, but the opposition gets too riled up and the narrative gets too polarized to facilitate a fruitful, good faith community discussion.

FWIW, through my personal experience, I would say the biggest contributing factor to concerns over a lack of safety/drug dealing/guests etc. would overwhelmingly be put in check with the construction of a purpose-built facility where those coming and going could be kept track of easily. a three building motel campus is extremely hard to supervise. IMO this is one of the best points in favor of the intake center’s construction, but to even discuss it would require acknowledging where the current program falls short, and no one is willing to do that because it will be gobbled up and twisted by people like Dieter, Drake, and French and fed right into the script for the riled up NIMBY’s 🫠",6,2024-02-03 01:00:12 UTC

2. I litteraly just quoted what Jason himself said. If you have an issue with that then we'll idk what to tell you. 

3. Saying you'll find money for neighborhood improvements and homeless programs by ""consolidating government operations with the county and Mishawaka"" is a stupid idea and should be called out. It won't happen because Mishawaka would never do it and our combined 911 center shows how bad it would go if they did. Even if you did see some financial savings from reduced redundancies, it would take years to pan out the agreements, not exactly money you could spend on day 1.

4. Saying things like ""residents are disenchanted with downtown developments"" ; ""it's just another issue we need to stop screwing around on"" and ""South bend has been resurging for longer than the buttigieg Adminstration"" are all comments that would point me to believe Jason sees himself as pretty decent break with Pete.

I was just down at the homeless shelter a couple weeks ago and a worker told me they have beds available at night usually enough to cover the people under the bridge but they just don't want to follow the shelters rules. That's why the amnesty programs are so important.,7,2017-12-30 16:34:16 UTC

Be careful driving under the Main Street bridge,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/6rngbe/be_careful_driving_under_the_main_street_bridge/,2017-08-04 20:58:06 UTC,"I watched someone run between cars yesterday when it clearly wasn’t safe. They nearly got hit by the driver behind me. 

The homeless population is stifling further growth downtown and more aggressive, immediate action should be taken. I’ve been speaking with business owners in the downtown area and they’ve all said the same thing. It’s impacting their businesses in a negative way. 

Unfortunately there is no easy solution that makes everyone happy. The housing first initiative is a good idea and a good start, but we don’t have the financial means to overnight a project like this with enough scale to get the current homeless off the street. We also don’t want to attract every homeless person within 100 miles. I would love to see the City of Mishawaka help out some. To my knowledge I don’t think contribute much (I am not fully informed on this so I could be incorrect).  ",5,2017-08-04 21:54:10 UTC

Honestly if I knew it was open I probably would have gone there at least once or twice. Also being a bar down the street from the homeless shelter probably could hurt the crowd that comes in at times. Unfortunate to hear the place trying to open and closing again. From the outside it looked interesting enough,1,2017-04-15 06:14:07 UTC

The market sets the price, Realtors are “in-touch” with the market and know what the buying market is willing to pay for a house. 

I do agree that affordable housing is dead. When $100k only gets you a junk house in an undesirable neighborhood, something is wrong, but it’s not the Realtors fault that the prices are high. That’s like blaming the cashier for the high price of the food at the grocery store.",1,2024-03-30 02:50:14 UTC
What does the community think of abandoned buildings downtown?,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/xu7zix/what_does_the_community_think_of_abandoned/,2022-10-03 03:14:42 UTC,And the fat daddy's site has a 60 unit affordable housing apartment planned to be built on it!,2,2022-10-03 20:19:28 UTC
Best.Week.Ever,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/6f621v/bestweekever/,2017-06-04 06:43:06 UTC,"1) I totally agree. We need some more economic presence. I would personally be okay with some larger businesses being located at Blackthorn. Yeah, its not as close to the workforce as a 2-mile radius to downtown, but I feel that area is more attractive to some businesses. I'd rather have them there than closer to downtown if it risked us losing the business.

2) GR has a great food scene. We have a river with good views of the skyline, and we should encourage local restaurants taking advantage of that. I think the Emporium is the only place to do so. 

3) Let's hope all the new apartments coming online fill up and more get built. 

4) SBCSC isn't quite as bad as people make it out to be. The administration isn't perfect. There's issues, we can all agree. But, I feel that a large portion of the problem isn't the schools themselves, its the students. And by the students, I mean its their home life. And by that, I mean poverty. When mom/dad (if both are even in the picture) have to work late/multiple jobs/are alcoholic/don't care about their children, it makes it tough for the kids to behave in school and not act out. This is a deep issue that cannot be fixed overnight, but it starts with a community effort to help guide these children to have the tools they need for success, but also we need more and better jobs for those parents that struggle to put food on the table or make rent. I think that if theres more money coming into these households, then over time the children will behave better (less acting out, less truancy, less drugs, more desire to learn) and SBCSC test scores will improve. 

5) yes yes yes. DTSB needs to have real shopping. Right now its just office space and some restaurants. Theres hardly any retail. Why do most people go to the loop in Chicago? There's lots of retail, parks, and food. Metronet runs downtown, which connect to Union Station, which is where all the fiber runs into. Theres some along the toll road but most of it runs along the railroad tracks and into the basement of Union Station. I wish Salesforce would have looked into SB instead of Indy, but I understand the reality of the situation too. I think an H&M would do well downtown. 

6) Without more retail and business downtown, I think it's tough to convince people still to come downtown. Sure, image is improving, but I'm still convincing people from the region (outside of SB) that DTSB is not scary and you won't get taken by a homeless man and abused. Things are changing but we need more still. I think more people living and walking around downtown will help, but when the new David Matthews apartments go up and theres a real sign of things changing and growing, only then will outsiders really begin to see the change.
