,homeless; unhoused,"I had originally scheduled to have the presentation from the [ORGANIZATION] program [ORGANIZATION], but due to some very unfortunate circumstances over [LOCATION],  that it had to be postponed. So now that it is official that they are cleared of any wrongdoing, and I must say that the shameful and senseless attempt at character assassination of this fine not-for-profit, as well as the upstanding individuals that run it,  is just unspeakable for a service and an asset that is so needed in this community. So I will be working to get them rescheduled to come before us, and I would ask my council colleagues to please treat them with the respect they are due for the exceptional work that they do with the homeless and the unhoused in our community."
,homeless,"Then there was, you know, some movement before then, before [ORGANIZATION] under the bridge dealing with the homeless. This council did step up and say, hey, we need to do something with [ORGANIZATION] presenting this stuff over there in [ORGANIZATION]. And there was discussion, there was some resolutions that were on before council."
,homeless,I'm not sure if they passed through or not. I don't remember that. But what I do know is that the language that was used and the ability to shame the homeless in that video by council president really set a really horrible tone.
,homeless,"And it has been substantially confirmed in the paper and in the media that people did not have running water, people did not have heat, and also it smelled like a urinal in the facility. And on top of it, while I was visiting, finding out that people were paying  rent out of homeless people, taking advantage of the disadvantage to be paying money out of their pocket on top of what the [ORGANIZATION] funds is being paid for. I was very upset about  It was a private conversation that was secretly recorded and leaked out and shared among some of my colleagues shared to different people in the community."
,homeless,"By the contents, in the context of what I said, very upsetting to see that homeless people being used by some of our own council that knew that that building was not properly zoned. For [ORGANIZATION],  did not share that information with council knowing that that facility was not zoned properly because it came before us you just keep lying painful so i"
,houseless,"At this time, our invocation will be given by [ORGANIZATION], At-Large Councilwoman. Thank you, President [PERSON]. Loving God, protector of all, we ask you to watch over our city and to watch the residents of our city, our children, our seniors, those who go hungry, the houseless, the strangers and immigrants in our midst, and those who are alone, creator of good,  Thank you for the men and women who serve our city in various ways, our staff members, public safety officers, those in leadership roles."
,affordable housing,yes uh first uh mr [ORGANIZATION] i think we quickly voted and your kids got a favorable recommendation they're pretty cute [PERSON] that that uh i just want to thank uh thank mr PERSON2 for his investment in the community and uh um was mentioned by [ORGANIZATION] earlier this is uh one of the ways we get uh more housing stock and more affordable affordable housing stock in the in the city thank you  councilman PERSON4 i would just like to say to mr PERSON2 to see the difference from [ORGANIZATION] and what you've done is impressive um you know these older houses they need to love and when people invest in them they invest in our neighborhoods we appreciate that we appreciate you  taking that opportunity to invest in the neighborhood. And it's going to be more than a multifamily opportunity.
,affordable housing,"The [ORGANIZATION] near [ORGANIZATION]west neighborhood itself had tried for [ORGANIZATION] to get tax credit grants in order to turn this into affordable housing, workforce housing or elderly housing, but were unsuccessful. So what we are doing is we're proposing a market based private initiative that will allow us to renovate this building and turn it into a commercial node. What we call a collaborative village that will allow us to offer space for businesses,  retail  professional offices, makerspace, cultural arts space, as well as folks like tax accountant, insurance agents, health and wellness."
,homeless,"We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All this is transparent and for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"Okay. But on that area, one corner is the location that is on dispute right now. And the reason that we are, that I am questioning that is because we got a lot of homeless people there."
,homeless,"Yes, and after discussion with the petitioner, there was more information that he didn't quite understand and different steps that needed to be taken. So we're still going to address it now. If it's additional information and you're speaking now about the homeless,  that is a different issue than still getting an alley vacation."
,homelessness,"At that time, it was just a few organizations doing a few things. But we said we wanted to create a movement. We want women entrepreneurs to see that they are somebody, that they can build a business, that they can overcome things like domestic violence and homelessness."
,affordable housing,"That becomes the policy for the city, and we make recommendations based on those changes when new development occurs. There are other things that neighborhood plans seek to address, and housing is a big one. As you know, our department has been pretty focused on delivering new housing of all types, but specifically affordable housing as well."
,affordable housing,"We wanted to do things to make the neighborhood safer, but we didn't want to sacrifice our ethos of affordable housing. To that end, [ORGANIZATION] is going to be one quick deliverable we can offer the neighbors. Our mobile tool library is another one that we're working on right now, and working through ORG1 and other affordable housing developers to teach how to fix your own homes, and how to access the right materials, and how to work with ORG2 locally as well."
,homelessness,"Thank you so much. And I would just like to say that thank you [PERSON] and the team city administration who Helped to push this plan forward [ORGANIZATION] is but a few blocks over from the third district and definitely impact us and you guys have been doing a lot of heavy lifting over [ORGANIZATION] and  with a lot of the homelessness and crime in the area and things like that. So it is exciting to see the city moving forward with development and revitalizing neighborhoods and what better neighborhood than [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] to have, um,"
,affordable housing,"We have been hoping that the near northwest neighborhood would be able to get a tax credit grant that would have allowed them to be able to  turned this into affordable housing or workforce housing, but they were never able quite to get there. And after they were unable to do it [ORGANIZATION], my partners and I came up with a plan that would allow us to do this without that kind of a tax credit group. And so now what we are doing is we're in the process of wanting to â€“  take this building, bring it back to life, and make it, turn it from an attractive nuisance that's been driving down property values in the neighborhood for [LOCATION] to a neighborhood attraction that will help to be an anchor for both our residential as well as reestablishment of the commercial node at this location."
,homeless,"We're a corporation representing 25 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as a greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government."
,homeless,All this is transparent and for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION]. I want to thank all of you council members except [PERSON] for meeting with us over [ORGANIZATION] to learn about our plans to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. We gained valuable feedback from their review of our efforts.
,homeless,We'll be down there feeding the homeless. We'll be down there passing out food to the needy. That's what we do.
,homeless,"All right, let me shoot. The first request I would ask is that if we, as the council could have the [ORGANIZATION] updates, at least [ORGANIZATION], I don't know if that would be more that you're getting with the healthcare facilities  business and the mayor's office for us to be able to share with our constituents and to be able to lead uh accordingly is the first request that i have um and some other questions uh [ORGANIZATION] tell me if i'm going too fast you're fine if there any uh communication that you've had with any of the black uh leaders or uh community as far as outreach since it's um  hitting the black community worldwide more than any other population. The second question, I want to know the update on the homeless population status that they talked about with [PERSON]."
,homeless,"On the homeless, we have talked about an isolation slash quarantine facility. Initially, we had contemplated FAC0. We've decided on another facility."
,homeless,"This could be a wide variety of folks. It could be homeless who have tested positive, but it also could be somebody from your family who didn't want to come back to your house and potentially impact the other members of your family who instead will go to that. So by [ORGANIZATION], that should be up and running."
,homeless,"And then also related to communications, some questions that I'm getting as an at-large member  is frequency of either video updates or live updates, press conferences that you and the mayor may be having, and possibly a recommendation for more of those on a regular basis. And then finally, I appreciate you addressing quarantine sites for the homeless, but my question is really about if there's any conversation regarding temporary housing for the homeless during this time. Thank you."
,homeless,"And then the last one I had, the quarantine site for the homeless and then whether any temporary housing. We've not been talking as much on the temporary housing side. I think that the most immediate pressing need was on that quarantine site."
,affordable housing,"So I'll point out which ones are all publicly funded, public works projects versus economic development projects as we go through. So first one, starting with A, [ORGANIZATION] This was a 50-unit scattered site affordable housing development that was awarded tax credits through the state of [ORGANIZATION]'s low-income housing tax credit competitive award program."
,affordable housing,"There will be future phases. The foundations you see in the northern end of this photo are relatively deep, and so that will take a second phase to remove those and then remove the larger bottling house that you see on the right-hand side of this photo. FAC0 and FAC1, this is another affordable housing project that is paired with a market rate project."
,affordable housing,"So construction is expected to begin DATE0 on the 60-unit affordable housing building, which you can see an image of here. There would be two 45-unit market rate buildings that would come at [LOCATION], hopefully breaking ground DATE2, but those are a little more in flux with the developer as far as the exact date of groundbreaking. It could be [ORGANIZATION] as well."
,affordable housing,"This is co-located with [ORGANIZATION] on the east side. If you [STREET], well, you can't [STREET] on the site right now, but if you had driven on the site to access the self-storage where there used to be a target next to the site,  FAC0 is on the northern end of the site and then the southern end of the site is where [PERSON] is. FAC0 is a 54 unit affordable housing complex."
,homelessness,"The new center will expand the safe station shelter, so more shelter spots for youth experiencing homelessness, and then allow for expansion of programming. And really, it consolidates all of [ORGANIZATION]'s different services that are located throughout the city into one center at one site. The city did provide direct funding support through ORG1 and supporting infrastructure for this project."
,affordable housing,"And in particular about the program that we have for residents of [ORGANIZATION], those who want to live in the neighborhood. And so how our program works, [ORGANIZATION] has been in existence since [ORGANIZATION]. And so we not only address the issue of affordable housing, but we also try to do is contribute to our community's economic development."
,affordable housing,"Our goal is to prepare as many people as possible to be able to be homeowners. And so we want to expand our reach. I retired from my regular day job, and so I'm really working on this affordable housing project."
,affordable housing,"With this project and the two tax credit projects that were approved recently, it's  My understanding were up to about 190 new apartment buildings with apartment units with 120 being dedicated affordable housing. So it's exciting. This has been [ORGANIZATION] for the city trying to online more housing in general, which will address the affordable housing issue."
,affordable housing,We are still in  my notes right we are now going into new business is there any new business from council sure i just have a comment about earlier actions um i'm not going to spell out what this is but i'm going to say this council is becoming complicit in the idea of changing a narrative for the city of [ORGANIZATION] um i've noticed  a few housing developments that we are patting ourselves on the back about and calling it affordable housing really isn't what occurs when we or shouldn't occur when we're trying to build a community for all.
,affordable housing,"It just appears that now that we're running at this affordable housing thing, the wins that we're trying to achieve are wins through people who are connected to the local government and the heads of the local government. I'm not going to say that we shouldn't do these things, right? But when they're being lined up the [STREET] they are, one can only question where's the stuff coming from, especially when the dates of building are well after the primary all into [ORGANIZATION]."
,affordable housing,"As I mentioned, one of the arms of [ORGANIZATION] is [ORGANIZATION], which is their affordable housing development arm, what we would generally think of as the mission of most ORG2. What's interesting about [ORGANIZATION] is through the community development financial institution side of their team, they're actually able to originate mortgages for the homes that [ORGANIZATION] develops, and they can share more about the other items in their portfolio. Okay."
,affordable housing,"We carry out our work across four different initiatives under the [ORGANIZATION] umbrella. So [ORGANIZATION], which is the housing development subsidiary, ORG2, which is a CDFI that does small business lending, [ORGANIZATION], which is a CDFI that does affordable housing lending,  that we often pair mortgage products originated from with the houses we developed through affordable home matters and renew land bank the initiative that originally managed the city of [ORGANIZATION]'s land bank that now provides land banking technical assistance to [ORGANIZATION] communities  So we operate across a spectrum that we call comprehensive community development. And we really look at this as a [STREET] to layer our programming and our different initiatives and also partnerships and funding."
,affordable housing,"Okay, I would just like to say and to echo many of the comments that [PERSON] has made. This is a very exciting time. We have been discussing the need for affordable housing and infill and now to be at [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], to see the number of homes affected.  that have been projected for our community, especially in those areas that needs it the most."
,affordable housing,Anyone else? I like to say I'm very proud that we have people that want to go out and make sure that affordable housing come to all the districts. So thank you very much.
,affordable housing,It is really a testament and making it affordable so that people can have affordable housing. It is very important. And this is the reason why we serve on the council.
,homeless,"I'm here [TIME] as a member of [ORGANIZATION]. We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses, and we're still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government."
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], and [PERSON] and PERSON3 for meeting with us over [ORGANIZATION] to learn about our plans and to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants and surrounding states and communities. We're getting valuable feedback from their reviews of our efforts. We are also planning to meet DATE1 with Councilwoman PERSON4 and PERSON5."
,affordable housing,"Things that we particularly care about are new homeowners, affordable housing. There's a strong desire for a park, like [ORGANIZATION] said. [STREET] SCAPE, [STREET] SCAPE IMPROVEMENTS TO FLOW DOWN THE CARS AND IMPROVING THE BROWN FIELD."
,homeless,"I am here [TIME] as the president of [ORGANIZATION]. We're a corporation representing over 25 [ORGANIZATION] businesses and still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our government."
,affordable housing,And this is how we help to bring the affordable housing to our community. So I just wanted to point that out again. It's not that we're just handing out free money because we wouldn't be getting this money if a developer didn't come in.
,homeless,I have spent the majority of my time on the council working with the homeless in our city. And what I view this as doing is interrupting that. pathway for incarcerated individuals to end up on the streets and homeless.
,homeless,And it makes the job for the service providers and those of us that try to serve the homeless in our community a little bit easier to know that there are a number of folks that are being employed and that you obviously provide a great deal of care for these individuals. And they don't need to become part of that statistic in our community. And I want to thank you for that.
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], will you please give 4723 a first reading? 4723, first reading on an ordinance of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], adding the status of homeless to the protected classes of persons under GPE1 Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2, Article 9 of GPE1 Municipal Code in establishing the definition for homeless. Thank you."
,homeless,"And what happened [ORGANIZATION] was a show of complete lack and neglect of leadership in the city. Since the amnesty closed during the pandemic, these people had nowhere to go as no places were intaking homeless folks into programs because they were quarantined, ordered by the mayor. That left them no [STREET] to go and they went to the first tent city."
,homeless,"But on this occasion, the city of [ORGANIZATION] would not allow our donated porta potties or hand sanitation stations to be on the property. So these homeless folks had no toilet to use for [ORGANIZATION].  which is a health hazard in and of itself, even if we were not in a pandemic. I heard a lot of people congratulating the police [PERSON], but the police have force, they have weapons, and they have the power of color and government."
,homeless,"The only people helping the homeless in tent city number one and tent city number two are residents, unpaid volunteers, community members, activists, and church members. We've had not one person from the city visit tent city. We've had nobody from the local health department."
,homeless; homelessness,I am the community advocate at [ORGANIZATION] and work with people who are homeless or semi-homeless [ORGANIZATION] [DATE]. I want to applaud the council for inviting Mayor [PERSON] and I think the mayor gave a good summary of where the city's been over [LOCATION] with regard to homelessness. I applaud the quick and progressive stance that the mayor took in relation to the isolation center and his use of funds for that from funds that are available nationally and from the state.
,homelessness,"I also applaud the fact that he is not trying to kick this can down the [STREET]. Clearly, from the homelessness task force [ORGANIZATION], there are key recommendations that haven't been fulfilled, and rather than continuing to just  put this off, he is willing to take some emergency measures, again using funds that are going to be made available, in order to provide for housing for people, as [ORGANIZATION] said, is urgently needed for the sake of health and safety for the people involved and for our community. I'd like to address some of the comments made by council members."
,unhoused,"Member [PERSON] said that the timing of the mayor's interest in doing this is horrible, and I would simply say that it's especially horrible timing for people who are unhoused. So frankly, there is a lot of urgency around providing housing. PERSON1,  [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] said that he's concerned about the cost to the city."
,homeless,"Again, there's $2 million in [ORGANIZATION] money and emergency solutions grant monies that the city can use for this. I applaud [ORGANIZATION] Member [PERSON] for her advocating for a homeless services coordinator and a better plan than simply carrying out."
,homeless,"So I work as a client success manager for a company that helps maintain homeless management information systems. I'm also on the board of [ORGANIZATION], and my ethical duty as a citizen of [ORGANIZATION] requires me to speak out about the city's response to the homeless. So we know that eviction signs were posted on the city lot on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME], giving the homeless [LOCATION] to find alternative housing."
,homeless,"During this time, the homeless shelters were closed, they remained full, the weather amnesty shelter had closed down, and the mayor had provided no alternative options. So while you and I were out celebrating [ORGANIZATION] and honoring our nation's hero, the city was making plans to confiscate all the tents and belongings of the homeless who were residing on that property. The eviction was incredibly cruel, in my opinion, heartless."
,homeless,"It was also very unusual for a town to insist that homeless people are violating the law by the mere fact of them not being able to afford housing. It's also extremely shameful and shady that the mayor decided to perform this action [TIME] ahead of the city council meeting so that nobody from the public could even voice their concerns with evicting the homeless during a pandemic. It is not the homeless' fault that our economy is so bad, and it's not their fault that the city has failed to provide enough housing first beds for the chronically homeless."
,homeless,"[PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] decided that they would not overturn a ruling in ORG1 that basically ruled it's a violation of a homeless person's basic civil rights to evict them from public property when there are not enough low-barrier shelter beds available to meet the needs of the [STREET] homeless. ORG2 ruled that this type of eviction violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, is considered cruel and unusual punishment. Okay."
,homeless,"Now, I'm aware that [ORGANIZATION] does not cover [ORGANIZATION], but the [ORGANIZATION] decision not to hear the case means that they see no reason that the ruling was incorrect. By using such cruel and unusual punishment against the homeless here in [PERSON], the city has opened itself up to a lawsuit that they would surely lose. The only reason that the city took advantage of the homeless and treated them so cruelly is because the city knows that the homeless have no resources to fight this illegal overreach of the city and the police."
,homeless,The mayor and the city and [ORGANIZATION] all owe the homeless a major apology. and we need to work to make this right. [ORGANIZATION] must reopen the amnesty shelter until such time that the city establishes the low barrier gateway center for the homeless as was recommended.
,homeless,"So I also want to touch bases on the homeless issue [ORGANIZATION] and what happened. Unfortunately, three people did end up getting arrested. Although most of the officers that were there handled themselves very professionally, there was still some, I would call it disrespect to some of the citizens by certain individuals and officers."
,homeless,"Both the residents and the advocates were justifiably upset with the [STREET] the eviction process occurred, concerning the fact that it was the general feeling that the mayor had endorsed the gathering at the location. Advocates and residents alike feel betrayed by the mayor. The [INSTITUTION] is bearing the brunt of both the mayor's and maybe to a lesser extent, the council's ineffective leadership in addressing the problem of there being no home for the homeless."
,homeless; homelessness,And these homeless are some of the constituents that you are elected to be for. Thank you. Perhaps the arrogant will fix homelessness mantra that has become a campaign cry over [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION] that ignores the complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness and envisions homelessness fixed when those with homes don't have to look at them in time to be replaced with homes.
,homelessness,"We're not going to fix it, but we sure would like to be part of a team of care that spans more than politicians, government employees, and grant-financed care organizations to include faith leaders and advocates so that the effects of homelessness on our most vulnerable population may be lessened. Thank you. Thank you, sir."
,homeless,"I'm sorry, it's one of those days, violently on the seas and the air and the foreign shores to preserve our heritage of freedom and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting and enduring peace so that our efforts should not be wasted.  have been in vain and whereas locally get wet for a vet incorporated embodies the honor due to veterans in its mission statement we work with all you to benefit the community by helping local veterans who have fought so vigorously for our freedom and whereas since [ORGANIZATION] get wet for a vet has donated  Tens of thousands of dollars to veteran-oriented organizations such as [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] ORG6, ORG7, [ORGANIZATION], 14... That's three in ORG9 Chapter 118. And whereas it read for a vet is currently involved in the planning of the construction of tiny homes, villages for local veterans."
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] mentioned the construction of [ORGANIZATION], which will be the state of [PERSON]'s first and the fourth in the nation â€“  [ORGANIZATION] house veteran village for homeless veterans. That's something that we just cannot. But our reach goes a long [STREET]."
,homeless,"We help dozens of veterans DATE0 from anything from household furnishings to mortgage payments, utility payments, vehicles. The list goes on and on. Along with [ORGANIZATION], we're working with [ORGANIZATION], where we're going to be putting up a building here within hopefully [LOCATION] to where we can have a collection point for furniture and household items for homeless veterans."
,affordable housing,"DATE0, I would be out of town and Vice President [PERSON] would be in the chair, but also the dates for the [LOCATION] council meetings will be available and that the council will have opportunity to see those dates, after which they will be posted on our website.  is there any other new business councilman [PERSON] yeah i just want to invite everyone out to um another town hall meeting that we're having that i'm having and i'm hosting this won't be at FAC0 on FAC1 DATE2 from six to eight we're still talking about affordable housing we'll have a uh  A panel full of experts, actually, along with some developers as well as some contractors."
,homeless,"FAC0 and the naming of the four [ORGANIZATION] homeless [ORGANIZATION], a ORG2 minor league baseball team. Whereas and since [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] has officially recognized by the federal government as DATE2. And the [ORGANIZATION] Code [DATE] officially designates DATE2 as a legal holiday for the state of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"Yes, thank you. It's just a question I'm throwing out to my colleagues. I'm getting phone calls, emails about the homeless  [LOCATION] project over in [ORGANIZATION]'s district."
,homeless,"We'll go directly to the reports from the city offices. At this time, we'll have an update on [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], who is Deputy Chief of Staff. after his presentation the council members will have opportunity to ask two questions in regards to the presentation the last time we had update from the city officers i started with the first second and third district representatives first  I would just go in the opposite at this time."
,homeless,"I'll start with the at-large council members and move all the [STREET] down to the first district representative. This is an update, and there is no public input at this time. So at this time, I'm very pleased to welcome for an update on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], Deputy Chief of Staff."
,homeless; homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], Deputy Chief of Staff with offices on the 14th floor of [ORGANIZATION]. DATE0 I'm here to present before you three items. So the homelessness implementation group fund allocation of homeless services and then also the final recommendation list as it relates to the homeless implementation group."
,homelessness,"So, as we've been navigating through homelessness, I want to turn your attention to this regional comparison betweenâ€¦ That's great. Someone was just telling me [ORGANIZATION] that itâ€¦ I'm going to ask everyone to mute their mics. Mr. [PERSON], you're muted, sir."
,homelessness,"I would like to turn your eye to the regional comparison of [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]. As you can see, this is a point in time count. And so this tool is to help understand homelessness around the state."
,homeless; homelessness,"We had a total of 413 homeless individuals on the point in time count. And then as you can see, [ORGANIZATION],  that number has increased to 516 and so definitely want to continue to realize that homelessness is not going away and it's actually you know where those numbers are actually rising and we want to go in the opposite direction like our fellow regions that you can see here on this list."
,homelessness,"So in [ORGANIZATION], Mayor [PERSON] created [ORGANIZATION] with an outstanding group of diverse individuals and entities looking to navigate these uncertain times that we're living in and to continue to build a city that addresses our most population. And so that took [STREET] for until DATE1. And we're looking to reconvene DATE2."
,homelessness,"We really focused on issues surrounding homelessness, how we could be more efficient and effective as far as the service providers, as far as neighborhood and community support.  as well as city and county staff being a supporting cast as well in those conversations. We probably went on for [ORGANIZATION] in those conversations and then we all decided that it would be better to create subcommittees and be a little bit more laser focused on certain topics as it related to homelessness because there's so many different levels. And so within those subcommittees."
,homeless,"We divided into three groups, health and sanitation, weather amnesty and housing, as well as a more longer term item, which is permanent supportive housing. And so the reasoning behind the creation of this group was created, you know, post, after the post encampments around the city and just the news reports about around them. We really wanted to create an environment where individuals in the community could come and speak on how we could better address our homeless individuals."
,homelessness,"And then the last group was led by [ORGANIZATION]. and they did a phenomenal job in meeting [ORGANIZATION], having we split up our entirety group into those three groups. And so had roughly around, you know, seven to 10 for each group to kind of make sure we were focused and everybody had an opportunity to speak and to relay their ideas and suggestions around homelessness."
,homelessness,"So, in the first group, health and sanitation, their recommendations are as followed to create and monitor and maintain a database of all persons experiencing homelessness in our county to quantify the need for more affordable and permanent supportive housing, and that's more tailored to making sure that kind of hits on the last point there as far as having accessible  I'm sorry, my [ORGANIZATION] went away. Someone else controlling the one second here. I'll try to bring it back up."
,homeless,"So as I was saying, as it relates to the recommendation in health and sanitation, there seems to be making sure that we have ample  that we have ample housing during the pandemic so that individuals can maintain social distancing and health protocols. And so the next recommendations, we would like to study the population of people who prey on homeless individuals and develop and implement best practices to reduce the predators impact. I think this is something that we kind of talked about at the tail end of our conversations in [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"We realized that there, you know, that there are a lot of activities that go on around encampments and around our homeless individuals. And so if we can better understand, if we can better understand that arena, I think we would be better off in being able to protect our neighbors here in the city. We also want to continue to maintain and monitor chemical toilets, so porta-potties."
,homeless,"I think it's very important. I think we all think it's very important. And then lastly, tracking health insurance status of all homeless individuals."
,homeless,"I think this is an important one as we're in a health pandemic, in a health crisis with [PERSON]. And so if we had a better tracking system, I think it would be well suited for our homeless individuals. Next, within the weather amnesty and housing subcommittee,  The recommendation is to continue operations at [ORGANIZATION], and those sites are [PERSON] and ORG2."
,homeless,"I know that [ORGANIZATION], we had extensive conversations around rapid testing for individuals. And then also vaccine distribution. I know that that is a conversation of note now."
,homeless,And so that's something that we're gonna continue to have conversations around to make sure that our homeless individuals are in the best service of care. We also want to make available cold weather shelter locations. This is important especially during [ORGANIZATION].
,homeless,"There's been conversations around extending the current [ORGANIZATION] program, which was funded by a private donor to [STREET] homeless individuals into motels. That initiative has been going well as of late to make sure that homeless individuals have a roof over their heads.  and getting them off the streets. And so if we can continue to extend that program, I know a lot of people in the community will be excited."
,homeless,"I know conversations around a low barrier [INSTITUTION] with partners has been a topic of interest for quite some time. And so that it's still at the forefront here within the subcommittee and with the implementation group and our community as well. And then lastly, I think one of note is partnering with security companies to make sure, as we talked about homeless individuals being predators and preyed upon, being able to make sure that we protect and serve our most vulnerable population."
,homeless,"And it had a lot of conversation within the subcommittee and looking forward to having further conversation as we look to develop and potentially establish  a trust fund, whether it be within the county or the city. Also looking to establish a homeless contractor position. This would be very helpful for us to  to make sure that we're on par with our homeless services, building that trust between homeless individuals and service providers and the community, making sure that we have enough bandwidth from a city standpoint and a community standpoint, and think this would be beneficial in its entirety."
,homeless; homelessness,"And then [DATE] here, supporting an education and advocacy campaign. We currently,  We currently support this initiative in making sure that we have public support and community buy-in as it relates to homelessness and changing the narrative around what homelessness looks like and sharing the stories of these homeless individuals. And these are our neighbors, whether people like it or not."
,homeless,"I think it's important to change that narrative and to be able to support our homeless population. So I think the education and advocacy campaign will be a great tool to utilize here in our city. And lastly, emphasize the landlord and developer participation."
,homelessness,"And so the [PERSON], the Special Care Act distribution kind of kept us afloat during the pandemic and it allowed us to do more than we normally would and so with the additional funds. And so moving towards [ORGANIZATION], that's an acronym for [PERSON], which is designed to kind of broaden the existing emergency shelters, homelessness prevention activities, as well as rapid rehousing, and then ultimately helping individuals to be stable. here in our city."
,homeless,"And so for the [ORGANIZATION] services, we allocated just over $477,000 for that program with the motels. Next, the emergency services, we were allocated $450,000 in total with what's half of that, you know, $200,000 of that  that allocation went to ORG1 for hazard pay and operations as it related to food and [ORGANIZATION] equipment. And then the next went to the 250 remaining went to the live treatment centers for hazard pay as well, and along with their operational programming there."
,homeless,the weather amnesty. We allocated funds there as well. And so within the hope with hope they were capped at 50 individuals during weather amnesty and it's still ongoing at the moment and then [ORGANIZATION].
,homelessness,"OVERALL, WE HAVE 650,000 TOTAL THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. AND THIS IS, [ORGANIZATION], THIS IS A TENTATIVE BUDGET, BUT HOPING THAT WE CAN MOVE ON A LOT OF THESE ITEMS HERE. So next steps, you know, I think as we continue to work through our efforts and this concept of a shared ownership for both the successes and failures here in our city as it relates to homelessness, we want to continue weather amnesty."
,homelessness,"We want to continue to explore extending the [ORGANIZATION] program with the county.  again, establish and hire the city contractor position for homelessness. And then also we want to continue to â€“ we were awarded the selection into the ORG1, ORG2, [PERSON]. This was the same institute that had development for the FAC0 homes."
,homelessness,"Also, with the education campaign, we have partnered with the with [ORGANIZATION] and their marketing class, their senior marketing class. And they are going to to create. an education marketing campaign for homelessness for our city."
,homelessness,"We definitely hope to reconvene and reconvene the implementation group. I know [ORGANIZATION] wasn't enough. We know that we're gonna be within homelessness, be at this work for a long time with homelessness."
,affordable housing,"Just want to be clear that no site or location has been identified yet but definitely open to having those conversations. And then lastly collaborating with the county on affordable housing recommendations is going to be monumental in our approach. With that, that concludes my presentation, but I will add that I'm proud to be a part of this work."
,homelessness,"You know, I think we have an outstanding group of individuals here on the call [TIME]. The community that's watching and hearing, I want to thank you all. You know, understanding that, again, that we're going to be at this work for a while.  and understanding that ending homelessness isn't gonna end [TIME]."
,homeless,"And so I just wanna thank you all and know that we're gonna continue to make progress and create an empathetic bridge of compassion to continue to navigate these uncertain times and to continue to fight to build a city that provides support and opportunity for all of those who call [ORGANIZATION] home. So thank you and happy to answer any questions that anyone might have. Thank you, Mr. [PERSON], and thank you for your presentation, but also every person that was a member of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"Please know that we are deeply appreciative of not only your commitment to serve, but also the work that you have done and you continue to do to support our homeless population. At this time, we'll go to council members. Each council member will have opportunity to ask  Two questions, I'm going to start first with the at-large council members."
,homeless,I was supportive of having such a group move forward and that that group be people who are invested already providing services for our homeless population across the city because they would know what's the best [STREET] forward. And the list that you presented certainly shows  shows that and the wonderful work that has been done so far. The one question I have is wondering about what conversations or which committee have talks about creative funding sources.
,homeless; homelessness,"And I know in the weather amnesty and housing committee, we definitely talked about different funding sources and philanthropic efforts that could be beneficial to helping our homeless population. But I will be honest and say that, you know, that we still need to continue to talk through those conversations. And homelessness is undoubtedly one of the most multifaceted and complex crisis, you know, that impacts every urban core."
,homeless,"To my knowledge, that hasn't been discussed and it's still tentative. And so I will say as it relates to the point in time count, which is done [ORGANIZATION], I think that it's, I think it's important to note over [LOCATION]  despite an increase, I do think that overall we are seeing some decreases in some areas as it relates to youth and veterans. And so I do hope that, you know, as we were anticipating or assuming an increase, hopefully that total number doesn't encompass the full population of our homeless individuals."
,homelessness,"And personally, from my description of what a low barrier shelter or intake center would look like, it would deliver housing, health,  and hope to people experiencing homelessness. And of course, having those wraparound services. So not only that those individuals who were able to be there are not only surviving, but thriving as well."
,homelessness,"I just had a couple, well, actually one question I really have. When you talked about the homelessness coordinator position, what do you think the timeline is for that? And is that just a recommendation, or do you believe that's something that moving forward is going to be needed to help manage  to help manage what the implementation group is recommending."
,homeless; homelessness,"Okay, thank you. Thank you. okay thank you councilwoman [PERSON] we'll now move to the fifth district councilman PERSON1 thank you president [PERSON] um thank you for your presentation PERSON3 it was very uh thorough and informative uh it appeared that a lot of focus is being placed on assisting homeless uh individuals  One is being done outside directly providing housing to identify the root cause of homelessness in our area and to hopefully help reduce it."
,homeless; homelessness,"Yep, so what's being done? So I think it's important to know that the city does not provide direct services, but we are working with homeless service providers who are more on the ground and dealing. And a lot of the service providers are on the implementation group speaking to  kind of the need to understand the current status of the different levels of homelessness."
,homelessness,"And so that's given us a great perspective on truly what's happening at ground level. I'm not sure if that answers your question, [PERSON]. A little bit, but the recommendations and the ideas here seem to do a lot to assist people who are currently experiencing homelessness."
,homeless; homelessness,"My question is more, is the city taking a look and trying to identify why people are homeless and to try to implement solutions to prevent homelessness other than actually providing housing? Yeah, so I think the creation of the implementation group was definitely speaking to prevention and intervention as well. And so those conversations have been had within our conversations in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION]."
,homelessness,"I appreciated your regional chart that you provided at the beginning, and I couldn't help but notice that  Based on a quick review, it seems that we have a disproportionately high number of people experiencing homelessness in our area versus other parts of the state. Do you have an idea of why that might be? That's a great question."
,affordable housing,"Um,  I think I kind of had two takeaways from the listening to the meetings, and one of those was one that coordination is key. And even though providers kind of meet regularly, that even just having a coordinator to connect the dots between neighborhoods and services and food pantries and, you know, job training programs and  affordable housing opportunities and things like that. Somebody to just connect the dots for folks is crucial."
,affordable housing,"And so that was kind of the two takeaways. I do have a question, and I would like [ORGANIZATION] to answer this and kind of explain a little bit the housing trust concept. Really, I think building affordable housing for all levels of income folks is crucial."
,homelessness,"And that gets back to Councilman [ORGANIZATION]'s point was, okay, we've got folks that are already experiencing homelessness. How can we keep others from getting to that point? So, [PERSON], could you take [TIME] and explain the housing trust and how that would work and kind of what the benefit of that is?"
,homelessness,"And then you can put that in a housing trust fund, and that would produce maybe $400,000 a year to be used for services. And then if there's additional funds, people could put them, say we decide we're going to give a little of the gaming money away,  to homelessness [ORGANIZATION]. You could put it in there"
,homelessness,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON], for that thorough synopsis of our homelessness and where we are. It's been a pleasure working on [ORGANIZATION] since [ORGANIZATION] and glad that we have made a lot of strides. We definitely have a long [STREET] to go."
,homeless,"But my questions are, if there's a possibility to get best we can, the council, the breakdown of the homeless, as we know. I know I don't know if everyone is still operating in silos, but who is manding the homeless list as far as the motels for now? FAC0, [ORGANIZATION], FAC1."
,homelessness,"And that is going to be a major blow to our most vulnerable population across the state, including the homelessness. So and also mental health services have been cut. And I'm wondering if we are looking at ways and means to try to provide services for mental health and substance abuse that have been lacking."
,homeless,"So thank you, [PERSON]. I will definitely look into that list that you're referring to as far as tracking the different homeless individuals.  within different parties and organizations. And then also thank you for sharing the information as far as legislative affairs downstate as it relates to the cutting of funding for substance abuse and mental health services."
,homelessness,"I just know that a vision can be completed without funds. And the money that is going in for homelessness and the emergency funds, that's not going to support an active program that you guys are trying to deliver and also implement. I'm just telling you right now, I'm in favor of an increased funding  of funding for the programs that are desired and also needed in this community."
,homeless,"So I want to say thank you for doing a real professional job managing everybody and keeping the agenda moving. I only have a few, just a question of the chart that you showed that we had about 500 people that are homeless in the city. And of those 500, how many have been housed recently?"
,homeless,"substance abuse so those are big issues of why people end up homeless so I would just like to say that it would be good to know that or to form a group that will be looking into making sure that [ORGANIZATION] is getting their fair share of of that those monies and also those opportunities so  That's all I have. But again, thank you, [ORGANIZATION]."
,homelessness,And I really hope that these things will be implemented because I think we have the willpower to be able to end homelessness in [ORGANIZATION]. I think we can get it done. So thank you very much.
,homelessness,"Absolutely, and I can definitely, I can add that to my list of follow-ups, President [PERSON], as far as kind of, you know, the regional approach, those active conversations to join together on solutions and how, you know, how they see success and failure and how we've seen success and failure and to have a coordinated effort in our response to homelessness. Again, thank you for a wonderful presentation and we want to thank all of the members of the task force for your efforts, your expertise, your commitment to the work that is before us. And please know that we sincerely thank you as well."
,homeless,You moved so quickly after the homeless thing. I looked away for a second. I apologize.
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON]. Unfortunately, there was no public input. I sat through the hour-long homeless presentation."
,homeless,"And if they don't want to have a homeless center in their city, that's all fine and good. But all these things that we want to implement always come down to budgetary shortfalls and problems. So these homeless folks are  from our entire community."
,homeless,"But I think it's something that should have been done [DATE]. And hopefully somebody can reach out to [ORGANIZATION] and say, hey, look, can you implement the process and get it started? And maybe we can generate some funding to help this homeless issue."
,homelessness,"This is kind of to address the concern of [ORGANIZATION]. So basically, [PERSON], this is, you know, what we're trying to do is to build a pretty broad coalition, first with the city of [ORGANIZATION] and the county. I'm addressing [ORGANIZATION] to hopefully get them to agree conceptually to You know move forward to kind of reimagine how county government addresses issues like homelessness because we generally haven't been involved in things like that Before you know, we build bridges and roads and take care of ORG1 but this is something that I believe that we need to be involved in and  for a lot of different reasons."
,affordable housing,"These, where you see in red, [ORGANIZATION] will be building a low-income affordable housing building. It will have 60 units. dedicated to households earning 30 to 60% of the area median income."
,affordable housing,"The reconfirming resolution for the multifamily low-income housing, as you can see on your screen providing the tax abatement estimates, these are city-owned lots, but if they had been privately owned. The areas in red would be bringing in about $1100 a year and tax revenues for the city. After the completion of the project and taking into account that this will be a low income affordable housing building, the expected [ORGANIZATION] taxes will be about $40,000."
,affordable housing,"And I think it's perhaps even a little more ironic that [TIME], when we have great news about the professional sports  in convention development area but we have this project right across the [STREET] from the ballpark um you know that whole area is is um really doing well and we we believe the ballpark has had a lot to do with that there's been a lot of other things going on um and the fact that [ORGANIZATION] is involved in this affordable housing project  is very exciting for me. I'm on the board of [ORGANIZATION], and I'm very excited for the ball club and ORG2 to have some additional discussions as to how that space can be utilized by ORG2, that perhaps we can have some sort of joint effort."
,affordable housing,"We're in the very early stages of it, and, you know, there's nothing we can really say definitively at this point, but  So it's these kinds of things that when the city works together and the council and the administration and the very businesses down there, that really wonderful things happening. More affordable housing, you know, filling in empty spaces near the ballpark and helping individuals with special needs as well. So I wholeheartedly support this tax abatement."
,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] has done a lot of great work giving back to the community, [ORGANIZATION] and with the homeless and all of these wonderful opportunities to give back to the community. So thank you for developing and building a new [ORGANIZATION] in the first district. Thank you."
,homeless; homelessness,"The question was homelessness. That particular spot where you're at literally is a bed for many residents that are here in [ORGANIZATION], homeless residents. Has there been any discussion with the city on how that looks further on down the line after apartments come online?"
,affordable housing,"So I can't say that there's a definitive answer. plan in [STREET] for the encampments until the affordable units are online. And as we've heard [TIME], there's multiple affordable housing developments coming, but those take [ORGANIZATION]."
,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION] is sitting there as well. No one has been able to solve homelessness problems.  because there's so many issues that create it. But one thing that we can be is very, very intentional about our efforts and very sensitive to what's happening as well at the same time."
,homelessness,"It doesn't solve homelessness, but it would solve it go a long [STREET] to solving the problem you're currently experiencing with tents being erected on that property. Thank you. Any other questions at this time?"
,homeless,"[PERSON], will you please read Resolution 20-41, please? Yes. 20-41, a resolution of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], acknowledging and thanking Pastor [PERSON] for his kindness and advocacy for [PERSON] homeless. And I do know that we have a sponsor that sponsors ORG1 member PERSON2."
,homeless,"Okay, the resolution of [ORGANIZATION] acknowledging and thanking [ORGANIZATION] for his kindness and advocacy for [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless. Whereas the word doulos is Greek word meaning bond servant, and whereas [ORGANIZATION] has been living up to its name since [ORGANIZATION] by providing food, clothing, and short-term emergency housing for homeless veterans, families, and individuals And we're asking [ORGANIZATION] as a senior pastor at ORG2."
,homeless,"And we're asked [PERSON] has made his life's mission to minister to the needs and both physically and spiritually of the most vulnerable members of our society. And whereas [PERSON] is known throughout the community primarily for trying to meet the needs of the homeless by opening the facilities of [ORGANIZATION] to provide shelter, warmth during the cold.  or a [STREET] for rest when they are rejected by others. And whereas, [PERSON] again stepped up [ORGANIZATION] during the homeless crisis in [ORGANIZATION] area after city officials order homeless tents removed from a city on lot and no one else came to their rescue."
,homeless,"And whereas, Pastor PERSON0 and his congregation  Welcome the homeless to this chapel's property to provide a [STREET] for them to gather and find rest for a short time. I lose my [STREET] when you move it. Give me a second."
,homeless; homelessness,"Whereas, although these acts of compassion should serve as an example to those more fortunate, they have instead at times drawn scorn and criticism. And whereas [ORGANIZATION] understands that chronic homelessness is a serious problem with many causes and not enough solutions, it also acknowledges and thanks those like [ORGANIZATION],  who go above and beyond to ease the immediate conditions while continuing to advocate for just permanent solutions. And whereas, although Pastor [PERSON] pursues his ministry with no thought of  of earthly reward other than improving the lives of those he served, he deserves not only recognition and gratitude, but also [ORGANIZATION] continued commitment to find just solutions for the homeless."
,homeless; homelessness,"And now therefore, let it be resolved by [ORGANIZATION] of [LOCATION] as follows, section one. ORG1 acknowledges and thanks Pastor PERSON0 for the work he does to serve the homeless in times of immediate crisis. Section 2, [ORGANIZATION] commits to work with those like [PERSON] to continue to find long-term solutions to the crisis of chronic homelessness."
,homeless,"It was just seeing the best in [ORGANIZATION]. We recognize [ORGANIZATION] we were called that there was potential for harm, that police officers may have been harmed if they had acted to remove the personal property. And, of course, the homeless would have been harmed."
,homelessness,Just want to thank [PERSON] and Mrs. [PERSON] for your service and your work and stepping up and helping in the city's time of need. And there's a lot of work that we still have yet to do. And just appreciate your service and what you have done for the homelessness in our community.
,unhoused,"ONE [ORGANIZATION] WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH-BASED GROUPS AND UNNAMED [ORGANIZATION]S THROUGHOUT THE CITY OVER DATE0 WHO HAVE HELPED AND PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO THE [ORGANIZATION], INCLUDING THOSE SO VERY GENEROUS WHO WISH TO [PERSON]. There are so many we could name here, as you as you just said."
,homeless,"relief like just allowing for food, emergency food and shelter for individuals. And you know you've got a number of different issues that we're going to be dealing with.  with [ORGANIZATION]. And one of those is also providing housing assistance so that we can make sure that we don't have increase in homeless population and that we don't have folks that can't meet their rental income and get evicted from their homes."
,homeless,"Are there other sources of funding to do this instead of basically saying, hey, look, you residents who can afford to pay, we're just going to charge you more to.  to help the people who can't pay. And, you know, trust me, I've been out there with the homeless and needy people and doing what I can for anybody I can to help. And I know that help's needed, but we've got other places and other things we could look into."
,homeless,"We spent [ORGANIZATION], you know, doing the research, talking with key individuals throughout the state, but also looking at the best practices. And this is how this particular ordinance was passed. And we know that  just as we have a growing homeless population, we have the population within our community that are in need."
,homeless,"We were also awarded an additional allocation of CDBG of about $1.5 million. And you can see the various programs that went to support in [ORGANIZATION], as well as an additional allocation of [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] grant of similarly about $1.5 million. And the [ORGANIZATION] grant generally supports homeless initiatives."
,homeless,"And so that's where you see the bulk of the spending there. We also received a grant through the state, through [ORGANIZATION], for just under $600,000 to fund the homeless quarantine site. And then we also received an additional ORG1 grant, Justice [PERSON], through ORG2."
,homelessness,"We have a lot of initiatives going on for [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2 for the homelessness community and [ORGANIZATION]. And we also have food distribution that will be given out [ORGANIZATION] of DATE1 for ham and turkeys and a contribution to [LOCATION]. So just want to thank all of the council members for their support and participation in their concern and care for our community."
,affordable housing,"Thank you. Thank you very much.  [DATE], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for a recommitment to the partnership between [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] to work together to create and implement an affordable housing plan for low-income residents of [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you."
,affordable housing,"yes it is [ORGANIZATION] jr [ADDRESS] second district councilman uh whereas on [ORGANIZATION] the common council created the solvent housing authority  pursuant to the U.S. Housing Act of DATE1 and the Acts of [ORGANIZATION], and whereas the Mayor of [ORGANIZATION] appoints each of the members of [ORGANIZATION], and whereas [ORGANIZATION] declares it is the mission of ORG1 to provide safe and affordable housing assistance to individuals and their families in a manner  that is respectful, professional, and service-oriented. ORG2 is committed to maximizing its existing resources and working in partnership with the community to assist residents in reaching individual and family goals, including those of self-sufficiency,  through education, increasing employment and home ownership opportunities. And whereas the [ORGANIZATION] goal is to provide housing that saved desirable affordable housing with superior services."
,affordable housing,"And whereas the need for affordable housing is now greater than ever before, generally  due to COVID-19 pandemic, but also more specifically due to the need of relocation of residents at FAC0. Whereas effective as of [ORGANIZATION],  [ORGANIZATION] public housing wait list is closed for all unit size and [ORGANIZATION] will not be accepting applications to further notice. And whereas the city of [ORGANIZATION] has a history of cooperation agreements with [ORGANIZATION] for construction of low income housing units dating back to [LOCATION]."
,affordable housing,"And whereas the current.  unique circumstances and increased need and additional availability of resources mandates the recommitment of both [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 and a part two-[STREET] partnership excuse me to a partnership to work together via the consolidated plan for the city  And whereas consolidating planning process serves as a framework of community wide dialogue to identify housing and community development priorities that align and focus funding from ORG2 formula block grant programs, community development block grant program, home investment partnership program, housing trust fund. emergency solution grants program and housing opportunities for persons with aids program and whereas under federal and state legislation resulting from coven 19 pandemic additional funding for affordable housing will be made available to [ORGANIZATION]  and [ORGANIZATION] to create a set-aside allocation via the Consolidation Plan Annual Action Plan Amendments for ORG3 GPE1. Now, therefore, let it be resolved by [LOCATION] of [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION], as follows."
,affordable housing,"I would just like to say that we had great conversations with [ORGANIZATION] and. The vision and the new leadership and the direction that they're going is exciting. And as we all know that we need affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION], it's very important."
,affordable housing,"Just that I would like to welcome the new leadership at [ORGANIZATION]  [ORGANIZATION] needs committed and fair housing. And we have some pretty significant issues, as [ORGANIZATION] stated, with affordable housing stock in the city. So I'm hoping that we can make some very solid headway."
,affordable housing,"We greatly appreciate the partnership that's being presented here, the opportunity to work collaboratively with the city. We come to you as the largest affordable housing provider to the city of [ORGANIZATION], with over 800 units of public affordable housing and more than 2000 housing choice vouchers. We're engaging in a plan of growth within the city and we look forward to the opportunity to bring back  quality affordable housing, ensuring, as was indicated by the speaker earlier, that housing opportunities for low income persons are fairly applied through fair housing initiatives."
,affordable housing,"I want to thank the council for inviting us to see what they want to accomplish and how we meet in the middle. I think that often housing authorities are often shunned, sometimes forgotten. And so for this council in such a pivotal time, not just a pandemic, but the ongoing plight and legacy and need for affordable housing here in [ORGANIZATION], we are excited not only to bring a refreshed vision and a strategic opportunity to develop a  affordable housing."
,affordable housing,"and I would like to say as the first district council member in this area Um, I'm excited because everyone, everyone talks about affordable housing and all of that. But the only [STREET] that we as council people can advocate for it is when developers want to partner with the city to do it."
,affordable housing,So I  I'm excited when we talk about affordable housing and it being done in the first district. And so thank you. And I'm excited about it.
,homeless,"I think it'd be great to  make available at the community neighborhood centers, at schools. It's a workbook teaching kids how to deal with their emotions. And then I'm also talking to someone at [ORGANIZATION] about something that I found out that 40 to 60 percent of people in jail or homeless were in the foster care system."
,homeless,"So by the time people are shooting at each other, the problem's already well beyond where it should be. What we need to look at is how do we bolster up those foster care kids so they don't become part of the 40 to 60 percent for homeless and imprisonment."
,affordable housing,"I'm sorry. Don't you have to be fixed with just adding a few sentences of just the general substance? During this bill was raised and the topic of affordable housing was asked and answered, and this was asked and answered, and it could be fixed with just some general substance."
,homeless,"Where in terms of your care of the homeless that use the libraries for [DATE] centers, if you will. Yes. Thank you so much."
,affordable housing,"But over [ORGANIZATION], those homes will be built. We're also continuing to be the major funder of [ORGANIZATION], and we just established a community land trust here  here in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood to again, address the affordable housing component within the neighborhood. All right."
,affordable housing,"Thank you so much. PERSON0, could you read resolution 22-17, please?  [DATE], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for the cooperation of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] and developers to create fund and implement an initiative to remove barriers to affordable housing in GPE2. Thank you."
,affordable housing,"You have [ORGANIZATION],  you have this still dealing with and have been confronted with a thousand houses [ORGANIZATION] with the lights the lots excuse me and the overgrown fields and weeds that we have to take care of because of the houses being knocked down you have the container home projects that are going to happen on [ORGANIZATION] [STREET] there has been two rounds of federal funding that has gone to administration  There has not been any affordable housing plans put together. You have a third coming in [LOCATION] around the DATE2 mark, which is going to be more millions of dollars for us to help plan and reduce or to bring up the area as it relates to housing. None of these things have been put on paper."
,homelessness,"There's the expansion of the cameras and the real-time crime center operations, including additional analysts. There's continuing investments in our homelessness strategy, animal [INSTITUTION], and then of course, we've talked about the fire negotiations. In terms of neighborhood and infrastructure, again, we prioritize the Rebuilding Our Streets initiative, make sure that we stay on top of paving our roads."
,homelessness,"And we're also going to be opening up to citizens and join too. But basically, it's got a couple purposes. One, to help the city of [ORGANIZATION], but directly it's to help the homelessness solutions."
,homelessness,and really it's trying to address a couple  safety and crime we've actually done a deep dive we've gone into um it's taken some time to put this together um but it's we've gone into the the gangs a little bit we've gone into the drugs of how they're being flowed through here we've gone into the homelessness as far as the streets  talking to them. We talked to the panhandlers.
,affordable housing,"While [ORGANIZATION]'s not part of this because they're building a single-family home, [PERSON] and the ORG2 are excited to rezone these properties to be consistent with the neighborhood plan that showed these for you, too, to allow for a mix of housing in this neighborhood, and in particular, housing that can be built as and remain as affordable housing in a neighborhood that has ever-changing demand. We're excited to see that they're going to be doing two duplexes and then the quad here on these southern portions. The one on the far right, which is actually the northernmost lot for FAC0, is actually going to be a single-family home."
,affordable housing,"Back in [ORGANIZATION], I was part of a group that began the [ORGANIZATION], and one of the things that we wanted to do was to preserve the neighborhood and preserve affordable housing in the neighborhood. And as things have morphed over [LOCATION], it's become more challenging to do that. But we have instituted what I think is a very exciting component of our plan, and that is a community land trust."
,affordable housing,And the three blots that the [ORGANIZATION] own will be community land trust homes and will be preserved for affordable housing for the foreseeable future. And so we appreciate your consideration of this so that it will â€“  improve the housing stock for individuals who need the housing. Thank you.
,homelessness,"Thank you so much. Awesome, awesome, thank you. So DATE0 I'm here before you to present an update on homelessness here."
,homeless,"So next slide please. So here here we have a point in time, a homeless count and C list which stands for coordinated entry and the coordinator entry is a tool that is used to assess and prioritize individuals for housing and services. It also helps communities prioritize assistance based on vulnerability.  and severity of services and needs."
,homeless,"And in [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], we saw the totals of 413 and 516 homeless individuals that were accounted for. And so as as you continue to look at the the the next few bullet points here, you'll see that in that count DATE2 we we dropped significantly. And so I will."
,unhoused,"So the last time I was before you, before the council, I gave an update kind of on the mayor's implementation group, which convened in [ORGANIZATION] until [LOCATION] in which we put together a strong, robust, powerful network of peers that worked. As you can see, we had some elected officials, we had a few council members,  here as well on those on those [TIME] calls going into identifying and implementing or identifying and implementing strategies for both short term and longer term strategies as it relates to our unhoused population and also building a city that provides support and opportunity for all who call [ORGANIZATION] home. And within this implementation group, we felt that it was best to break it into subcommittees, which you'll see here at the bottom of the slide."
,homelessness,"But the subcommittee groups were much shorter, probably [DATE] for each subcommittee. Next slide, please. So within the culmination of the subcommittees and the mayor's implementation group, we came together to address homelessness and to recognize the situation."
,homeless,"So the last subcommittee we had, [ORGANIZATION], which the members came to expand some of the city's permanent supportive housing developments. They've also recommended to develop a housing trust fund to create a homeless coordinator position and then also support an education and advocacy campaign. Next slide, please."
,homeless,"So within what I when I just mentioned that we wanted to create a homeless, you know, a homeless coordinator position, we were able to do so and we were able to do so [ORGANIZATION]. This happened. This happened."
,homeless,"These are not city employees, but they, but it was a [ORGANIZATION] contract that we that we were able to [ORGANIZATION] and here are some of the. HERE ARE SOME OF THE DELIVERABLES HERE AS FAR AS COLLABORATING WITH VARIOUS GROUPS FOR THAT EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DISPELLING SOME OF THE [ORGANIZATION] AND REIMAGINING THE NARRATIVE AS IT RELATES TO OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. IMPROVING UPON THE COORDINATED ENTRY PROCESS, WHICH THAT TOOL IS VERY COMPLICATED, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, [PERSON] HAD A GREAT RUN AT TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"And then as well as research for funding opportunities related to operations and a development of prospective initiatives such as a low barrier shelter and the expiration of that. And then also drafting, more importantly, drafting a [ORGANIZATION] services plan to address some of these existing and planned services that our homeless individuals are experiencing. Next slide, please."
,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] slide, please. Here we have a funding breakdown of the [ORGANIZATION] homeless implementation budget. That 650 number, we wanted to, these things are happening and are in progress and have happened."
,homeless; unhoused,"And so wanted to note whether amnesty, permanent supportive housing, leasing, as well as low barrier shelter scope,  planning and preliminary design, as well as the homeless facilitators, the transfer bus passes, which for which which we have the dates there as well, and also still in denoting the countywide coordinator match as well, that that that's still in that that pot for the implementation budget. Next slide, please. So, so now we we get to [ORGANIZATION] and and we're we still have a line item for for these series of of initiatives, if you will, and recommendations and and making making note that that that most urban cores are contending with the increasing number of unhoused individuals, but this 650,000 total within implementation has been."
,homeless,"And we're hoping to have more detailed plans come forth in [ORGANIZATION] as far as the next steps for that project. Next, we have [ORGANIZATION], which we're continuing to look at funding for that project and outline the details on that plan. And then as well as [ORGANIZATION], the county has awarded them a million dollars for their renovation of their space."
,homelessness,"And and but it's contingent on a match, and so there has been a request from the city to match that that $1,000,000 for their for their for their renovations for their space. And so we will continue to have conversations with them in order to to accommodate that that request. I just wanted to make note here at the bottom that the [ORGANIZATION] includes 5.8 million of [ORGANIZATION] supported funds for county partnerships to address homelessness and mental health, which was mentioned in ORG2."
,homelessness,"And currently we're in [ORGANIZATION], which I was just me and a few other team members were just a part of in [ORGANIZATION].  in another session and hoping to compete for funding for another project similar or a little bit more innovative than the one at [ORGANIZATION]. So we're hoping to do more of a scatter site units, as you can see here, and hoping to kind of work towards that and have more updates here in the coming, in the middle of this  We're continuing ORG2, as stated before, and then also FAC0 with the county. We want to continue that and continue conversations to move that forward, as well as finalizing the community educational campaign, which is really going to be important that we've contracted with ORG3 in that aspect to put together â€“  a campaign that includes websites, that includes billboards, videos, just a [STREET] to be able to show the community truly what homelessness is and how to show our help and support moving forward."
,homeless; homelessness,"I was pleased to see that, at least based on the [ORGANIZATION] numbers, the overall local homeless population has decreased 50% over [ORGANIZATION], [DATE], 25% over [LOCATION]. What's your level of confidence in that number that it's a true reflection of a reduction in homelessness versus...  perhaps less effective tracking? So I will say, you know, like there were a few, as noted, the state report was there were some errors."
,homeless; homelessness,"So as far as confidence in the numbers, we have to go by what's accounted for. And I will say that there is a population of unseen homelessness or homeless individuals who aren't accounted for. So that number could very well fluctuate, in which we saw the fluctuation over [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION] and up until now."
,homeless; homelessness,I'll ask you the same question that I asked you [ORGANIZATION]. a lot of focus and I think wonderful work in assisting those that are homeless and a lot of attention being put into potential housing solutions either with partners or provided by the city one other than providing housing or making that connection to actual housing what efforts is the city doing to actually reduce homelessness rather than just assisting
,homeless,"So I will say that the city we do not provide direct service to the homeless, but also but will say that we will do everything that we can to continue to provide a social social net network for for vulnerable population. So as you can, as noted on on the presentation, we have a very we had we we took on those recommendations from the community. From from the from the members of the home the mayor's implementation group."
,homelessness,"And I think it encompasses the work that we've all put together to address this very complex issue. So I will say that a lot of the deliverables and actions that we have in the works address the reduction and prevention of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] to come. Great, I look forward to that."
,homeless; homelessness,"Thank you, Mr. [PERSON]. As everyone knows, I spend a great deal of my time working in this wheelhouse of providing for homeless. We have now had, I think at last count, three studies done as to what are the best approaches for [ORGANIZATION] to address the homelessness."
,homeless,"And in each of those studies, we have had three studies done. And I think at last count, three studies done as to  It has identified a full-time, permanent homeless coordinator position. And when [PERSON] was hired, she was actually doing research, not coordinating services."
,homelessness,"So I'm wondering why we are hesitating to fill a full-time, permanent position, as has been the recommendation now. in three different homelessness studies done in [ORGANIZATION]. The first two done under Mayor [PERSON]."
,homelessness,"I will say again that I mentioned in my presentation that homelessness will not be solved overnight, so I I'm happy to have those continue to have those conversations to push for a full time position so that so that we're all on the same page. Thank you."
,homeless,"Well, [ORGANIZATION], myself and my colleague to my left. Drafted, authored a resolution because [ORGANIZATION], which is in the second district, was taken over by folks who were homeless and just kind of like just staying over in that area. Um, we not only have that, but we also have the transient population that comes in and out from the center, from the homeless, which is the second district as well."
,homelessness,"So it just defies logical nature for something as critical as homelessness is and as sensitive as it is, because we're probably all one check away from it, that we will play.  uh with the idea or politicize the idea to where we're still trying to figure out the next step when we try to have this conversation [ORGANIZATION] we tried to have this conversation probably [LOCATION] and and probably DATE2 it just continues to go on and on um i hope it works i hope it works but i i i really find all of this to be very suspect at this point  Thank you for your comments. Thank you for your presentation."
,homelessness,"And I am honored to have been appointed to serve since [ORGANIZATION] on [ORGANIZATION] under former Mayor [PERSON]. So I commend the report and continue to look forward for us to work together on the low barrier, the crisis center that I was just appointed to by [ORGANIZATION] and also  continue to do this work. So I am hopeful that we'll continue to have a path forward through this very complex issue."
,homelessness,"So  As I mentioned, so it was essentially just with the reporting, we were getting mixed results. And you think about absenteeism and you think about tardiness, there are other things that affect that. So, you know, we're talking about homelessness, you talk about food insecurity, you talk about child care."
,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON]. Oh, with the homeless program specifically? Yes."
,unhoused,"Thank you. I'm also wondering, as we move into [ORGANIZATION] and [LOCATION], when temperatures tend to drop below 20 degrees, do we have any plans in [STREET] for a warming center for the unhoused?  in case those temperatures become unbearable on the streets? Yeah, I mean, the city has both a warming and cooling center in [DATE] protocol when temperatures get to a certain degree, and we can add clarity to that."
,homeless,"Thank you, President [PERSON]. I just wanted to read a statement from [ORGANIZATION]. In [ORGANIZATION], the point in time count for homeless individuals is occurring [LOCATION]."
,homeless,"The count includes homeless individuals, both sheltered and unsheltered. This is a [ORGANIZATION] endeavor carried out by [ORGANIZATION] in partnership with [ORGANIZATION]. The result of the point-in-time count are usually published by the ORG2 in [LOCATION] and are available for anyone who is interested."
,unhoused,"I just want to also state this number is a critical piece as we move forward in our planning for shelter and care for our unhoused in our community. So we'll have an updated count hopefully by [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, [PERSON]."
,affordable housing,"they discussed  you know, affordable housing issue of this or this was the broad discussion that was had and then that question was answered by whomever. Or, you know, citizen member [ORGANIZATION] asked a question on this and that was answered by whomever answered the question. Thank you."
,affordable housing,"and I think there needs to be a broader discussion with how we measure the public private role in these projects and I'm not ready to go forward at this point with that is there anyone else I just would want to say that  being on the end of working with the neighborhood association and neighborhoods, neighborhood associations want to improve their neighborhoods and want to take on the challenge of creating affordable housing. As we all know, it is a challenge and sometimes it does sounds good in theory, but when it comes down to trying to figure it out and get it done, it's a little bit harder, a little bit more challenging than you anticipate."
,affordable housing,But what I do like the fact is that this was an opportunity for people to see really how creating affordable housing is not as easy as what people think it is. uh given them more time to be able to get the capacity to be able to do it I sat in the meetings I met the consultants we went and looked at houses we looked at manufactured houses we looked at stick build houses we looked at all kind of different ways uh to build it and
,homeless; homelessness,"Okay. Thank you.  [ORGANIZATION], a resolution of [ORGANIZATION] of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], addressing the emerging homelessness crisis, strongly encouraging Mayor [PERSON] to promptly prepare and present to [ORGANIZATION] an emergency temporary aid and shelter program to respond to the emerging homeless crisis and to prepare an ordinance declaring a state of emergency relating to the current homelessness crisis.  authorizing the suspension of certain regulations to facilitate ORG1 and providing for approval of such emergency services contracts as are necessary to support this program. And what the next step would be is that you need to entertain a motion  to override the mayor's veto."
,homeless,"Yes. The only comment I have is that I am really a bit sidelined by the idea of this particular [STREET] of action. The resolution was put out there to, in fact, help the homeless and also the people in [ORGANIZATION] area, which is the second district."
,homeless,"The intent from the very beginning was to bring it not only bring attention to the matter, but find some resolve that will support the neighborhood, the residents over there and also the folks who need it most. And those are the folks that are homeless. I have no more to say."
,homeless,"Thank you. So my goal is to care for the homeless and the unsheltered and the community impacted by this horrible situation. To me, our issues that need urgent and immediate attention."
,homelessness,"Homelessness is another of these issues. I know that I have been very passionate in my approach and I will continue to be passionate about these issues. What I would like to say to my fellow [ORGANIZATION] members is that I'm open to working with anyone, whether it includes modifying this resolution or creating legislation to move these very critical issues and the solutions to them forward."
,homeless,"I believe that we must commit to immediate solutions as well as long-term planning. DATE0 that someone remains homeless, they are left victim to the elements, to criminal activity, and to extreme suffering. These are urgent issues in the short term."
,homeless,Voting no on the resolution was not a no vote for the homeless community. I had plenty to say at the committee meeting and the council meeting [ORGANIZATION] when voting on this resolution. So I'd just like to refer people to that recording and my public comments as well.
,homelessness,"I was never a sponsor. I voted in support of the resolution in terms of the need to begin to address the homelessness as well as other related issues. So at this time, there is no further comments from."
,homeless,"I'm wondering about the quarantine center. What are we planning to have in [STREET] moving forward to allow some of the homeless and those that cannot shelter or quarantine at home, where will they go? That's a good question."
,homeless,"When we got the one the first time, they were the only ones really willing to step forward. And now there's no hotel that we have found or motel that has been willing to step forward. And so the approach that the health officials have been pursuing is they  They believe in conversations with the shelters, [ORGANIZATION], that they would be able to manage and figure out quarantine for their populations."
,homelessness,This is an important part of our homelessness problem in the city. So anything we can do to support low-income housing units is a helpful piece. Thank you very much.
,homeless,"Thank you. Mr. [PERSON], you have [TIME]. Okay, anyhow, first I would like to just encourage every council member to continue the work on the homeless issue."
,homelessness,"Well, good evening, [PERSON] President and other members of FAC0. I'd like to take [TIME] also to speak on the homelessness situation that is currently taking [STREET] in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, and just very shortly also on the protests that were held on [ORGANIZATION]. First, I would like to say that I am sorry that I wasn't home when the protesters came by."
,homelessness,"We're faced with much greater stress. We're faced with people that have lost their jobs that are still unemployed, and we're faced with a situation of homelessness that to some extent we have always had. All I can say is that I just encourage all of us as a community, community partners, members of the council, the mayor's office, and myself, and the people that are so passionate and wanting to try to help these folks."
,homelessness,"And I would like to call the council and our [ORGANIZATION] community to not lose a sense of urgency about this pressing issue of homelessness and safe housing, especially with the uncertainty of the current tentative having to leave FAC0 on DATE0. And I hope that we can cultivate more creative thinking and a spirit of collaboration and increased communication to move forward. And as [ORGANIZATION] just mentioned some recent incidents in our neighborhood, I hope that  even if we cannot come to very swift action on the next steps forward with homelessness, I hope that we can have swift action to address the increasing violence and gun violence in our neighborhood."
,homeless,"As my housemate [ORGANIZATION] mentioned, [ORGANIZATION] that we know is a drug van is currently sitting in the spot on FAC0 where it always sits. We're pretty worried about the public health effects of having drugs and guns in our neighborhood. One thing that we'd like to reiterate though is that we're not interested in just kind of picking this problem down the [STREET] a little further by kicking all the homeless people out of our neighborhood."
,unhoused,"What we're looking for is a solution that really integrates people who are currently  unhoused or are participating in drug activity back into society. We're interested in whatever creative solutions that the council is able to put together in order to make some sort of dignified shelter situation possible as quickly as possible for the health of the neighborhood, but also for the health of the whole city. We are ready and willing to continue to provide support as a neighborhood association."
,homeless,"We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses and still growing. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government, and also fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All this is transparent for the genuine improvement of the City of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"I do see a hand, [PERSON]. Thank you, President. As a member of the joint committee on to the other two at-large council members as well as [PERSON], probably [ORGANIZATION] in regards to the next step solutions for the almost 500 homeless in our city, we're actively searching for a viable location to house these folks in need."
,affordable housing,"Thank you. The revitalization was great. You know, when neighborhoods and others work collaboratively together, you see all the results, and we know that there is such a need for affordable housing, be it duplexes or apartments within our community."
,affordable housing,"So thank you for your continued work and support of this effort. And I would just have to say that as the representative of the first district, that I am so proud that we're, that the [ORGANIZATION] is building houses and,  the policies and things that the administration has been putting forward is helping to spur more of that and um a duplex um in this area and affordable housing is so important and we need it we need as much as we possibly can so again uh thank you for your hard work thank you all right uh i will now entertain a motion regarding bill [DATE]."
,affordable housing,"What we have learned since [ORGANIZATION] when I left health planning to go to medical school are the following. Health is not simply a result of medical facilities or access to medical care. Affordable housing, food deserts, and jobs and recreational facilities located near that affordable housing has a lot to do with health status."
,affordable housing,"I urge you to appropriate additional dollars of [ORGANIZATION] for federally funds to be spent addressing affordable housing in our beloved city, enticing grocery stores and produce markets to locate near that affordable housing.  and encouraging jobs and recreational facilities to be near that affordable housing. I think this has been addressed not to my satisfaction or that of many of us in the medical community. Thank you."
,affordable housing,"This would be an [ORGANIZATION] mixed-use real property abatement with a commitment of $13.9 million in investment. And the proposed project is a four story 65,000 square foot mixed use and multifamily building. It would create eight new FTEs and would include a substantial portion of the building for affordable housing."
,homeless,"We are a corporation representing over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community.  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government."
,homeless,"All this is transparent for the genuine improvement of [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] sent an email to each of you requesting a meeting with us individually.  to hear our initiatives to help solve many of the homeless issues within our city. We have email receipts from you showing the messages were delivered to your official city addresses."
,homeless,"Therefore, I'm asking each of you to reconsider and meet with us one-on-one to hear what [ORGANIZATION] has identified as legitimate measures to save our city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. Please meet your obligation to our community as our duly elected officials and meet with us, your constituents, and hear what we have to say. Thank you."
,homeless,"The second thing I have been engaged to do is to participate with  the council and with [ORGANIZATION] for, with regard to the matter of the homeless intake center on FAC0. I am a land use lawyer, a real estate lawyer, and a state certified general appraiser now for a very, very long time. And this is my area of the law and my area of practice for [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"That includes the crime analysts, as well as the other pieces that need to make that run successfully. We continue to implement the homeless strategy, and there are new dollars to enable us to move forward on that strategy from [ORGANIZATION]. So, again, as we move forward, this is an issue that we must confront as a city, and we are continuing to do more than ever before."
,affordable housing,"And on the following slide are all three properties tied into this project, which are reflected in Bill 23-58. This bill designates the collective properties as being eligible for an [ORGANIZATION] multifamily real property tax abatement and  These properties will all be developed by [ORGANIZATION], which is owned by [ORGANIZATION]. The combined bills will help support what the developer has dubbed [ORGANIZATION], which is intended to increase the supply of affordable housing within the ORG1."
,affordable housing,"So, [ORGANIZATION] goal is to convert the two existing structures into affordable multifamily units, along with developing a new similar unit on the vacant parcel. The outcome will be the development of at least seven new affordable housing units within the ORG1. Total private investment to make the project occur will be a little over $900,000, and one part-time employee will be hired to maintain and manage the properties."
,homeless,"I'm on the board of a group called [ORGANIZATION] here, which is also on the board with [ORGANIZATION], who's the director of the community police review board. And [ORGANIZATION] I started volunteering at FAC0 to help the homeless, feeding them on DATE1 mornings. Hopefully you're thinking this is the kind of guy we're looking for."
,affordable housing,"We're not talking about anyone else. We're talking about black people. And so it's great to have an idea that, you know, we can celebrate the end of slavery, but it should be coupled with and should also be celebrated by  If we can see a brighter day within the African-American community, we're talking about affordable housing."
,affordable housing,"My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I live at [ADDRESS]. We're here [ORGANIZATION] on behalf of [ORGANIZATION], and we are requesting this alley vacation in order to build four affordable housing units on FAC0 in our neighborhood."
,affordable housing,And they have been such an agent of change for our neighborhood over on that side of town. And this project is something that is going to be very impactful for units of affordable housing. It's a big deal
,affordable housing,"At this time, we would move to resolutions. [PERSON], will you give resolution 22-17 a reading? 22-17, a resolution of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], calling for the cooperation of [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and developers to create, fund, and implement an initiative to remove barriers to affordable housing in GPE2."
,affordable housing,"Maybe it's a presenter, you know, maybe it's something personal going on here, but it's  It's only to further along the discussion about affordable housing, the need for affordable housing. No one said anything when Mayor [PERSON] knocked down 700 homes, mostly in [ORGANIZATION]. No one's really said anything about what this is going to look like in [ORGANIZATION] when it's redeveloped on FAC0, if or when that does happen."
,affordable housing,"Thank you. This was brought to us [ORGANIZATION], and we all do support affordable housing in our community. And we have had presentations by the administration about their work that they're doing with [ORGANIZATION]."
,affordable housing,"So I think it's been explained to us more than one [STREET] here. And it was pretty clear to me when Dr. [PERSON] said that this was a very pointed toward the housing authority, and it was basically telling the developer what they could and could not do. And then to give it [ORGANIZATION] and to come back before us again, um,  I mean, we all acknowledge here, including [PERSON], that we support affordable housing."
,affordable housing,Yes. Just a brief follow up to questions that came up during the affordable housing meeting under residential neighborhoods. I've been in conversation with the county auditor's office regarding the tax sale concerns.
,affordable housing,"And so to just kind of run through those,  if if we start with strong neighborhoods and look at affordable housing on the left side are our direct quotes from from council members on what what you wanted to see in the [ORGANIZATION] budget so uh an expansion of home repair a plan for for safe and affordable housing uh incentivizing new housing construction um and and incentivizing investment in aging housing stock  The [ORGANIZATION] budget responds to that. There's a fourfold increase in resources for housing compared to [LOCATION]."
,affordable housing,"So there's four times as much resources available. And we're looking to do exactly what council members suggested, looking at the issue of affordable housing from all sides, looking at access to funding for existing home repair. Also incentivizing the number of new homes by removing barriers to financing, and then providing home buying assistance directly to residents and continuing to leverage CDBG funding."
,affordable housing,"So really, really responding to this issue from a variety of angles to try and attack it. An issue as complex as affordable housing needs to be responded to at a variety of levels and council recognize that in there in your priorities, and the [ORGANIZATION] budget recognizes that as well. The neighborhood infrastructure side, [LOCATION] after [LOCATION], this is very prevalent in council priorities."
,homeless; homelessness,"So, uh,  the the bill [DATE] will jump start that [TIME] in [ORGANIZATION] and then [LOCATION] will be an additional nearly four million dollars we're expanding the successes of the [ORGANIZATION] to continue to to invest in FAC0 and FAC1 but also expanding that to other neighborhood corridors a direct response to [ORGANIZATION] priorities and opening up that to to FAC2 and investing in some of the neighborhood amenities  that make those business corridors great. And then exploring the startup of a land bank to really figure out how we can address not just dilapidated houses, but vacant lots that are in the community and looking to partner with a community partner on a land bank.  on the the second priority of safe community uh lots and lots of conversation around violence reduction and and uh recruiting and retention at [ORGANIZATION] um so ensuring the safety of residents by providing necessary resources reviewing the data on gvi and violent crime reduction um really looking at violence sort of from a holistic perspective and then also looking at our homeless residents and figuring out how we can really implement have  uh document and implement a a sustainable plan for addressing homelessness um and so the [LOCATION] budget continues to and expands actually investment in violence intervention programs through ORG2 both on the operational level by adding two staff members by continuing the investment in the save team and can and actually expanding the amount of resources available for violence reduction initiatives through the arp the total of all of those being about 1.8 million  um expanding investment into public safety technology to help the [ORGANIZATION] provide new and innovative ways and [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] provide new and innovative ways to keep to keep our residents safe and then on homelessness um having a really actually a historic investment in homelessness we talked about that in the context of the [ORGANIZATION] budget that it was a historic investment in homelessness we're continuing that in the [LOCATION] budget and then  adding to it with proposed partnerships with the county on homelessness and mental health initiatives to take care of everyone in the community. On the infrastructure side, as the mayor said, I don't think that there's been this much money available for infrastructure in [DATE]."
,homelessness,"Our fates are intertwined for better or worse. As I've sat here this [TIME] listening, I made a list of things that came up. [ORGANIZATION], transport, bus driver shortage, after school programs, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], housing, homelessness, circuit breaker, COVID relief funds."
,homeless,"We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All of this is transparent for the genuine improvement of the city of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"DATE0, I stood before you and noted that few of you had agreed to meet with us  to learn about our plans to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. At that time, only three of you had met with us individually. Since that last council meeting, [PERSON] and [PERSON] have responded with offers to meet with us and we look forward to sharing our plans with both of them directly."
,homeless,"We are a corporation of over 20 [ORGANIZATION] businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community.  as well as greater fiscal responsibility from our local government. And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government."
,homeless,"All of this is transparent for the genuine improvement of [ORGANIZATION].  from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities. And prior to the last meeting, only four of you had met with us individually. Since that last council meeting, [PERSON] and [PERSON] have since met with us."
,homeless,"And so that leads to about being able to house about 30 to 50 at the [ORGANIZATION] building, which is administered by [ORGANIZATION], and then 25 sheltered at ORG2. And other organizations are stepping up [ORGANIZATION] to provide additional options, given the pandemic and the protocols that are required. Then the county undertook a motels program to build off of the program established by ORG3 anonymous donors."
,homeless,"And then finally, as you know, and [ORGANIZATION]'s been a good participant and leader in our homeless implementation group, the three subgroups, as well as the full group, are working to finalize recommended steps by [ORGANIZATION], and we'll have more to report when they do so. So with that, I'll turn it over to any questions [ORGANIZATION] may have. Thank you, Mayor [PERSON]."
,homeless,"I'm always on that city county meeting [ORGANIZATION] and those that are working with the homeless in that program say that this has made a significant impact very  very positive impact. So I just wanted to thank you very much for moving on that so quickly. Thank you, that's great to hear."
,homelessness,"From homelessness to the police, you know, ramping up enforcement, etc. But I want to talk about [ORGANIZATION] that members on FAC0 was awakened by loud horns and folks banging on their doors. The folks that I'm talking about are contractors."
,homeless,I just wanted to jump on and make sure that we don't take our eyes off of the issue of the homeless. I heard [ORGANIZATION] that at least one person in the 10th city possibly had been hospitalized and at least one person over there had tested positive for [PERSON]. I had asked the question sometime back when they had [LOCATION] amnesty open if they had done any mass testing of the homeless people.
,homeless,"And basically, I believe the mayor had said that he has now left the quarantine part of it in the lap of the, um, county health department. So, you know, in light of the fact that someone has tested positive in that homeless encampment, um, I think it's,  something that's necessary that maybe we look into pushing the county to visit one of the places, maybe FAC0 or FAC1 or somewhere where the homeless gather and we try to accomplish a mass testing."
,homeless,"And a lot of them don't have masks and probably don't have sanitizers. I'm not sure if the,  hand sanitizer station is out there yet. I was told they were gonna take some [PERSON] and a hand sanitizing station out there, but I just wanna let you know that there has been some positive [PERSON] cases there and we need to stay on top of the homeless issue and keep pushing to find a solution."
,homeless,"City right now and the homeless population and the decisions that will be made, we ask God that you would look on our mayor, our police chief, all of our elected officials, and allow them to represent the people. We pray God for peace in our city. We ask that you will watch over families and young people."
,homeless,"Now we'll turn to special business at this time. Mayor [PERSON] will give us an update. On city-related issues as well as anything on FAC0, I believe the main concern from this common council has been the homeless tent city."
,homeless,"But we'll know how this opening is going in relative short order. So that's where we are and we continue to work with our health officials and [ORGANIZATION] and our partners in the county to increase testing, contact tracing, and the pieces that are going to help us contain further outbreaks without having to resort to stay at home or more extreme separation or isolation measures. I know the issue of our chronic homeless population has become front and center, especially [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"And in particular, there is an [ORGANIZATION] emergency solutions grant, which is federal funding, and it funds five shelters, [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], ORG2, [PERSON], and [LOCATION]. It doesn't fund the whole bit. They get other federal funding outside of this amount, as well as fundraising and other funding sources, but we do direct the funds that we manage as a city toward those.  those entities."
,homeless,"And we use the balance mainly for three agencies for rapid rehousing. And those are similar agencies, [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], and ORG2. And then [PERSON], which includes membership from [ORGANIZATION] and the county and [PERSON], administers another portion of those federal [LOCATION] funds, and some of those are directed toward GPE2 for tenant-based rental assistance to mentally ill and our homeless populations."
,homeless; homelessness,"But as you know, [ORGANIZATION], I believe [PERSON], [DATE], was when we had our, at least in recent memory, our first start of a type of encampment that happened under the bridge there on FAC0. And what came out of this was the report on chronic homelessness from the working group under the previous administration. And the chronic homeless individuals account for a small fraction of the total homeless population over the course of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"And that was found as best practices across the country. And with the thought that  Even though we have leading institutions for what we might call the non chronically homeless, you know [ORGANIZATION] has received a lot of accolades over [ORGANIZATION] for what they're able to provide relative to what other cities do. And we have a host of other agencies as well that provide services."
,homeless,"So the. So what we're really talking about are these chronically homeless individuals for the most part. And what the Housing First principle is about is there may be a host of issues why these individuals are chronically homeless and not able to â€“  not able to take part in the other services, or not able to move toward a more stable life with shelter."
,homeless,"And we also did work to help a consultant process to get us to join the balance of state piece. On the permanent supportive housing side, we were able to partner â€“  with different with I don't know the exact entities names but the corporation for supportive housing and their applications and Get the what we know is the [ORGANIZATION] apartments over there off FAC0, and that was 32 units of  And there was a second project that's been under consideration for [ORGANIZATION] that proposed 22 new permanent supportive housing units and up to 40 scattered site permanent supportive housing units, as well as vouchers. We've also separately worked with [ORGANIZATION] over [LOCATION] to coordinate different projects."
,affordable housing,"But that piece was not, I don't know all that went into that, but I think where we can get scattered site supportive housing units, I mean, the goal is to decentralize.  a lot of this and so that there's not any one built up issue or compounding issues by having you know more density in terms of these individuals  We're also working with [ORGANIZATION], who have agreed to offer at least five permanent supportive housing units. So that's all recent work to try to get some of these long-term solutions moving and get more permanent shelter options for our unsheltered population. At the same time, the city entered into arrangements that, again, were unprecedented with the formation of the FAC0 building over there by [PERSON] as a weather amnesty site."
,homeless,"I believe we used it for [ORGANIZATION] of two winters. [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], there was the option over there at FAC0 where [ORGANIZATION] operated weather amnesty  And then [ORGANIZATION], the ORG1 building over on FAC1 was a weather amnesty, along with ORG2 opens up parts of their facilities for weather amnesty as well. The other new thing [ORGANIZATION] was the partnership with ORG3 for a day center."
,homeless,"But it's not, that's not something we can do long term or if there needs to be an extension past this first period of the coronavirus crisis. The health officials are working to, you know, we know testing has been an issue across the board, but they are working to test our homeless populations. And they tested those in shelters and are working to test the unsheltered individuals."
,homelessness,"and You know at [TIME] There were still a number of folks there and both people who are experiencing homelessness as well as a number of advocates on behalf of those individuals I'm proud of the men and women in code and police and  for how they took on this difficult task [ORGANIZATION]. That was not an easy environment to go into, but for the most part, it went as smooth as we might have hoped. We, of course, would have hoped for a smoother transition, but all things considered and where it could have gone, it was relatively smooth."
,homeless,"So that's going on the short term. In terms of the long term, if this council  does support the [ORGANIZATION] approach and strategy. We'd be looking to strengthen that coordinated entry system and continue to expand the number of permanent supportive housing units for the chronic homeless individuals."
,homeless,"We'll continue to seek more regional partners because we do know that this is not â€“  [ORGANIZATION] hosts a lot of the services for homeless in our area, but it is a regional issue and certainly need to engage more regional partners. And the other piece is that some people have suggested, and this is up for discussion, is trying to decentralize the provision of existing services so that no one  area or a neighborhood has to bear the full brunt of our region's issues. And so that's something we heard when we were trying to site the gateway or the intake center, where the southeast neighborhood said, well, we have all these services."
,homeless,"Is there any [STREET] that you could find it somewhere else? But then the challenge is,  the people are going to gravitate toward where the services are so so unless there is a [STREET] to decentralize it somewhat we're always going to have this this challenge so whether we whether we adopt housing first or not if this if many of the services remain in the area  chronically homeless individuals are going to remain in the area whether they're sheltered or not."
,homelessness,"I think that is kind of a concern that I've had also, as you know, my voice to the media that we need to start those, that task force again, the homelessness task force that some of the council members, I know [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], were both a part of [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION] before we received a new council. Um, I know talking to a lot of these council members that they're, they're looking for that, um, permanent supportive housing and we really need to work on that."
,homeless,"I think some of the biggest issues that we had in the past was, it was hurry up, make a decision and this is what we're going to do, uh, which I believe a longer in, you know, um,  Timing is horrible all the time with this issue. There's always going to be a homeless issue, but we need to work on a long-term solution and bring everybody to the table to work on that."
,homeless,It's not the best case scenario. And we're not doing a very good job of running a [INSTITUTION] as it relates to [ORGANIZATION]. So I don't understand how we transition from there as a [ORGANIZATION] into something that's going to be downtown to help support the homeless when we are doing less than a good job there on FAC0 right now.
,homelessness,"The other question I have, and it relates not only to homelessness, but definitely the overall health of the city financially. I have some really deep concerns on how we're going to move forward in [ORGANIZATION] and also [LOCATION], not only because of [ORGANIZATION], but what is happening right now. The health of our city is dependent upon the school corporation, if I remember correctly, if I know that to be true."
,homeless,"So how are we going to continue to offer the services, [INSTITUTION] included?  to all of these people who don't have anything when we don't have anything coming in and so there's a lot more to that discussion but i would just ask those two right now because uh i think we're you know in a crunch for time right now"
,homeless,"But those instances have been relatively infrequent, given the number, and we've had a number of guests recover successfully in return.  back to [ORGANIZATION]. So, I mean, there's also been some positive stories about that. So, I would just contest the fact that it hasn't been run well, despite there is a concerted effort by, you know, by certain folks up in the general area of the isolation center that just don't like it, just like almost any homeless service that is provided across the community."
,homeless,"So if we're going to go back to the same type of framework, then what are we going to change up and do? And that's not necessarily hiring new people  I don't know if we want to be in the homeless, the homeless, the idea of being a homeless center, meaning [ORGANIZATION], the city of [ORGANIZATION]. Yeah, no, that's a fair point."
,homeless,"We already have the homeless is our most vulnerable population. We also coupled with the disparities study, coupled with [PERSON], coupled with the minority businesses and even the entire economy. So I definitely know that this is going to take a long time."
,homeless,"Mayor [PERSON], I would like to first start off with a question. And I don't know, I could be misunderstanding this, but it seemed that in the beginning you were talking about the potential funding for a city-run [INSTITUTION] being [ORGANIZATION] dollars that we  we get and currently distribute area service providers. So are we talking about discontinuing that district in favor of taking those dollars and putting them towards the city one run shelter?"
,homeless; homelessness,"I know we can't get into everything [TIME]. I also have some concerns about...  the model and, you know, if we're talking low barrier or no barrier, right, I think that, you know, to expect folks to give folks a roof over their head. over their head without expecting them to address any kind of root cause for for the homeless uh for the homelessness given that nearly 75 percent of unsheltered folks in the you know [ORGANIZATION] struggle with substance abuse i think that those are real things to address and what that looks like from a programming standpoint uh if the city were trying to take this and that's that's a big"
,homelessness,"I don't believe that it is a best practice for us to  be operating a facility like that when so many needs are there right the wraparound services I've had numerous calls [ORGANIZATION] in emails from people in my district talking about the downtown area the that comes with chronic homelessness is a drug abuse some of  my residents and their families bicycling downtown, witnessing some things that he wished his children had not witnessed. So we do know that there is a bigger reach than I think the city should be getting involved with."
,homeless,"I met with you, sir, in your office in [ORGANIZATION], and I asked you if we could please talk  put that task force back together, that it was critical that we get moving on the homeless issues in the city. And that was early [ORGANIZATION]. I reached out to [ORGANIZATION] in [DATE], talking to her about my concerns about closing the weather amnesty during the [PERSON] pandemic, asking if we could find ways to please keep that open so that we did not have a situation downtown like we saw [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"You mentioned in your opening that you have a coordinator for homeless services. I wonder if I could get their name and their hire date to know who that person is, because I've been on all of the [ORGANIZATION] homeless community meetings. and they are not aware of this coordinator."
,homeless,"Thank you. Thank you, Vice President [PERSON]. I'd like to thank you for coming before the council and sharing information not only in regards to [PERSON] but the situation with our most vulnerable population and that's the homeless  I agree."
,homeless; affordable housing,"One thing about being the last person, a lot of things that you would state have already been stated, but I believe it's very critical that we start having conversations in regards to a housing issue. We have a lack of affordable housing, safe housing for a large percentage of our residents. That includes the homeless."
,homeless,"I understand that this is a very tough, uh,  conversation and decisions that we have to make. But we want to make sure that all of our citizens, including the homeless, that they're safe and that they have healthy shelter as we move forward as a city. Thank you."
,homeless,"I just have a really quick comment about as we're leading into a new idea or a new, I guess, homeless situation. I guess this is going to be another advocacy group built out of community members or elected officials. One thing that I want to point out [ORGANIZATION] was really difficult out there for many members of the community, at least the whole nine."
,homeless,"But that's not what I got. I got phone calls about the activity and some of the violent nature in which it was handled by our local [INSTITUTION]. I don't know how ORG0 ends up out in front of some homeless people that we know that's unarmed, that is very vulnerable and need help."
,homeless,"It's back to me, full [STREET] again. I, Mr. [PERSON], there's maybe one population that we haven't  talked about in full and that our homeless population in [ORGANIZATION] and we've certainly invested in the quarantine site and to isolate persons who are homeless if they test positive or while they're waiting for their test. Do you foresee any other um uh  additional concerns coming with that particular population and potentially other assistance that may need to provide?"
,affordable housing,"preserve and expand affordable housing options within the neighborhood and identify homes needing repair through code enforcement. Built form and zoning, the main issue here was promote neighborhood scale corner store businesses on FAC0 and other amenities included things like the improvement of FAC1 and the surrounding park, improvements to FAC2, and to encourage development of neighborhood businesses. So out of all of that we we  started to formulate the neighborhood plan itself."
,affordable housing,And I'm quite sure that we'll begin to see some advancement in terms of having affordable housing within our community. And I would just like to just echo all the comments. I would first of all like to thank council woman [ORGANIZATION] for leading the charge on this.
,affordable housing,"And hopefully this will help to bring some hope to developers so that we can take care of the infill and be able to start building affordable housing because we need it. Thank you. PERSON0, I forgot that you were online."
,homeless,"Open ears and hearts that there may be clarity in disagreement and discernment in all decisions. O Lord, help us to cooperate with you in delivering all people in [ORGANIZATION] from poverty, prejudice, and oppression. [ORGANIZATION] the homeless."
,affordable housing,"IT WOULD BE, AND I KNOW THERE'S, IT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALK OF A DEVELOPER COMING IN SOMETIMES RAISES THAT THIS IS CHANGING FROM AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION TO MARKET RATE, BUT IT WOULD BE AN AFFORDABLE, THESE WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS MANAGED BY [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION]."
,homelessness,"So we'll look to come up with a financing plan with all of you and which projects are of highest priority and hope to move that forward [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] AND MENTAL HEALTH. AGAIN, STARTING WITH [ORGANIZATION], I KNOW THE COUNTY TEAM AND THE SHERIFF REDMAN AND [LOCATION]."
,homeless; homelessness,"If you recall, we appropriated just under $6 million for county partnerships on mental health and homelessness. The county has also moved forward with some support for [ORGANIZATION],  and ORG1. And so those are things we're taking a look at when we talk about county partnerships."
,homeless,"So [ORGANIZATION] and the intake center, there's not a concrete report  uh... thing that that's moving forward at this time even though it is uh... being worked on actively uh... but uh... [ORGANIZATION] in the center for the homeless uh...  PROJECTS HAVE GOTTEN APPROVAL FROM THE COUNTY COUNCIL FOR THEIR ARP DOLLARS AND SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT CONTEMPLATE AT SOME LEVEL CITY PARTNERSHIPS."
,affordable housing,"The lighting, I'm very glad to happy to see that lighting. And I'll be interested moving forward once they do all the replacements, what that looks like as far as identifying the other areas in town that  that could use that lining especially as a means of helping to tour crime and that type of thing and perhaps working with our law enforcement they work all over the city I'm sure they have a good idea and the housing affordable housing so key so just a couple observations from my end"
,affordable housing,"And that's important as we're looking to  address the issue of affordable housing. So, well, I will now entertain a motion regarding Bill 103-22. I move for passage."
,affordable housing,"The position would assist in the management and strategic leadership of [ORGANIZATION] and really help expand the reach of that executive director to address  What again and again during the budget hearings and during the budget cycle come up, and we heard from the mayor [TIME], come up as the most important or some of the most important things that we work on in the community, affordable housing, small business support, economic development, those kinds of things. And really important from the administration's perspective is that this establishment really mimics a leadership model that's proven effective. So almost every other city department, really every other city department has this leadership model where there's a department head and then a deputy to expand the reach of that department head and to assist in the strategic leadership of [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"The only criteria that they recommend is for you to be vaccinated to be able to be in person. As we did [ORGANIZATION], the council, we will be giving out hat, gloves, scarves, and toiletries to the homeless facilities that we have. I think there were six [ORGANIZATION]."
,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] program, [ORGANIZATION], ORG2, [PERSON], [LOCATION], and [ORGANIZATION]. And if you would like to be a part of that, please let me know. And I did contact the warming centers to see if we had any walk-ins and was pleased to know that there were not any walk-ins that went to any of our public locations that are deemed warming centers."
,housing crisis; affordable housing,"Before I finished with [ORGANIZATION] of [PERSON], we knew that the GPE2 housing authority had a problem [ORGANIZATION]. They were even raided by the federal government. So what I'm saying is because we do have a housing crisis, because we're now 6,000 affordable housing units, because of all these things that are going on, and knowing that the housing authorities here locally are taking on the same challenge, why wouldn't we, as elected leaders of this city, very clearly,  be sure that our dollars, that $6, needs to stay here locally by making sure that these devices were well underway working for what these gentlemen are doing."
,affordable housing,"And we put out an RFP. And these are the people who have responded. They're going to spend $14 million on one group and then $12.5 million to bring our lots back to,  back online so that we can have affordable housing happening."
,affordable housing,"DATE0. THE HIGH LEVEL 50 AFFORDABLE THE HIGH LEVEL 50 AFFORDABLE THE HIGH LEVEL 50 [ORGANIZATION] ACROSS 37 HOUSING UNITS ACROSS 37 HOUSING UNITS ACROSS 37 CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES AMIDST THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES,  Thank you. I just found the public portion is now closed."
,affordable housing,"The upstairs unit has a bathroom. So I think it makes for better affordable housing and also helps to offset the substantial funding needed to rehab this type of a house. I'm paying with it with my personal funding and  electrical needs a meter and I've taken the steps to implement that, plumbing upgrades and so on."
,affordable housing,"Well, thank you very much again for the investment in the first district and helping to provide affordable housing for individuals in that area. Council members, do you have any questions?  councilman PERSON0 yeah"
,affordable housing,"And I posed a question that came for my answer [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you, sir. Affordable housing definition that you wanted was housing is considered affordable when rent or mortgage plus utilities is no more than 30 percent of a household's gross income."
,affordable housing,"OK, but my question was the term that has been flipped around has been flipped on poor people and poor people. When they hear the word affordable housing, they think that they can afford it. But that's not true here in the city of [ORGANIZATION] with the [STREET] things are going."
,affordable housing,"Thank you. I'm excited about the build in this neighborhood and following the comprehensive plan and giving people an opportunity to live in decent, affordable housing. I'll yield my comments."
,affordable housing,"And being able to give affordable housing to people is one of the things that was brought out in the neighborhood plans. And so we're glad to see that it's going to happen. Okay, thank you."
,affordable housing,"[PERSON]. I just want to thank you very much, [PERSON], and [ORGANIZATION] for everything that you do for our community. You know, almost all of our problems in the community, you know, if we can get more affordable housing and more jobs, we can make a lot of those problems go away."
,affordable housing,"I'm always happy to support anything we can do for affordable housing. We'll be keeping our fingers crossed and saying prayers going forward, hoping this works. We get the blessing from the feds on it."
,homeless,We'll be down there feeding the homeless. We'll be down there passing out food to the needy. That's what we do.
,homelessness,"And so we're proud of all the work and thankful for the council helping us make funds, both grants and loans, available to our entrepreneurs and local small businesses.  as well as money for those who found themselves in a [STREET] of vulnerability where having trouble with rental and just paying the bills, making ends meet, and putting food on the table. And then finally, we were able to put a lot of federal, this was enabled a lot from the CARES Act dollars, but put those to making resources available for the most vulnerable of our residents who find themselves experiencing homelessness. So that's, we really had to adapt on the fly there and do as much as possible."
