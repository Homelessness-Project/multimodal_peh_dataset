 Public hearing on an ordinance of the Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, approving a petition of the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals for the property located at 802 East Ewing Avenue, Councilmanic District Number 3 in the City of South Bend, Indiana. Is there a committee report? Yes, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Chair.
 THE ZONI AND ADDOXATION COMMITTEE MET THIS AFTERNOON AND WE BRING THIS SUBSTITUTE BILL, BILL 3524, TO YOU WITH A FAVORABLE RECOMMENDATION. ALL RIGHT. IS THE PEDITIONER PRESENT? I ASK THAT YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AND SHARE WITH US KEY POINTS REGARDING THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US.
 Good evening, Carrie Myers with the Department of Community Investment with offices on the 14th floor of this building. I'm here on behalf of substitute bill number 35-24 for 802 Ewing and 801 Outgild. Verdugo Otenel is the owner and the petitioner is requesting a special exception for neighborhood assembly use in the U1 urban neighborhood zoning district to support the work of the LGBTQ neighborhood center.
 Bear with me, pardon me. Built in 1943 as a church, and up until about nine months ago, it's been used as a church. The special exception is required, since it no longer functions as a church, and a church use would also provide these proposed services. In other words, because it no longer functions, as I said, as a church, it has to request the special exception. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here this evening.
 The proposed neighborhood assembly use is consistent with the character of the neighborhood, as it will provide a variety of activities very similar to that of a church or other assembly uses. The proposed center will offer services such as after-school programming, support groups, and social activities such as yoga classes and adult board games.
 The proposed use should not adversely affect the use of any adjacent property values as the building has been historically used as a church and will provide a level of activity similar to that of a church or other religious institution. And I will mention that the property at 801 Altgeld is their associated parking lot that goes with the property.
 The proposed use is generally consistent with City Plan 2006 PF 1.2, Maintain and Enhance Essential Community Assets. The proposed use will provide social and community-based services that will benefit the neighborhood. The building was designed as and historically been utilized as a church.
 Its proposed use as a neighborhood community center will not be out of character for the neighborhood. It comes to the Common Council this evening from the Board of Zoning Appeals with a favorable recommendation. And the petitioner is here. Thank you. All right. Would that petitioner like to have anything to say? Petitioner? Nothing to add. Okay. All right. Council members, do you have any questions for the petitioner?
 If not, at this time we'll go to the public hearing portion. Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak in favor of Substitute Bill 35-24? I do not see anyone in person or online wishing to speak in favor of the bill. Is there anyone present wishing to speak in opposition of Substitute Bill 35-24?
 I do not see anyone in person or online wishing to speak in opposition. At this point, the public hearing on substitute bill 35-24 is now closed. I will now entertain a motion regarding the bill. Motion to approve. To the full council. Second. There's been a motion and a second. Clerk Toronto, please call the roll. Councilmember Gooden-Rogers. Aye. Councilmember Bolton-Simpson. Councilmember Warner. Aye. Councilmember Dr. Davis. Aye. Councilmember White. Aye.
 Councilmember Lee. Aye. Councilmember Tomas Morgan. Aye. Vice President Neskoski. Aye. President McBride. Aye. All nine. All right. Substitute Bill 35-22 will come before the full council with a favorable recommendation.
 I will now entertain a motion to rise from the Committee of the Whole and pour it back to the full council. So moved. Second. Second. It's been seconded and moved. All in favor? Aye. Any opposition? No. Motion carries. The full council is now back in session. This is the portion of our meeting where bills are given a third reading and action is taken regarding the bills that were heard during the Committee of the Whole. Clerk Tirado, will you please give Substitute Bill 3524 a third reading?
 Third reading on an ordinance of the Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, approving a petition of the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals for the property located at 802 East Ewing Avenue, Councilmanic District number three in the City of South Bend, Indiana. Thank you. Move for passage. Second. I have to go through the process first.
 I'm getting a recommendation first from the committee. Okay. So hold that. I'll come right back to you. No problem. Councilor Lee, is there a recommendation from the Committee of the Whole regarding Substitute Bill 35-24? Yes. Substitute Bill 35-24 was heard in the Committee of the Whole, and it comes to the full council with a favorable recommendation. Thank you. Dr. Davis? I'd like to move this bill for passage. Okay.
 SECOND. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. THE ROLL, PLEASE. COUNCILMEMBER LEE. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER BOLD AND SIMPSON. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER WARNER. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER GOODEN-ROGERS. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER WHITE. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER DR. DAVIS. AYE. COUNCILMEMBER THOMAS-MORGAN. AYE. VICE PRESIDENT NASKOTSKI. AYE. PRESIDENT MCBRIDE. AYE. NINE AYES. THANK YOU. BILL 3524 HAS BEEN ADOPTED. RESOLU
 Clerk Tirado, will you please give resolution 2425 a reading? A resolution of the Common Council of the City of South Bend confirming the adoption of a declaratory resolution designating certain areas within the City of South Bend, Indiana, commonly known as 711 to 713 Leland Avenue, South Bend, Indiana, 46616, an economic revitalization area for purposes of a six-year period
 Real tax abatement for Cooper Shutter's Family Trust. Thank you. Is there a committee report? Yes, President McBride. The confirming resolution was heard by Community Investment earlier this evening and comes forward with a favorable recommendation. Thank you. Presenter, welcome. Hi, Council Members. Thank you. Eric Lovitch, Director of Growth and Opportunity Offices on the 14th floor of this building.
 THE FIRST RESOLUTION FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IS A CONFIRMING RESOLUTION FOR TAX ABATEMENT FOR THE PROPERTY THAT YOU SEE ON YOUR SCREEN. THIS IS A PROPERTY OWNED BY THE OWNERS OF NUMBER SIX SCRATCH KITCHEN. YOU MAY RECALL LAST COUNCIL MEETING, THIS COUNCIL ADOPTED A DECLARATORY RESOLUTION
 THAT PROVIDED US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONFIRM A TAX ABATEMENT FOR REDEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPERTY. THE OWNERS PLAN TO REDEVELOP THE PROPERTY INTO A RESTAURANT ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND IN THE BASEMENT, AND THEN RESTORE RESIDENTIAL UNITS UPSTAIRS. THEY WOULD ALSO BUILD A CARRIAGE HOUSE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, TO THE LEFT HERE OF THIS OVERSCREEN SHOT.
 TAX ABATEMENT WOULD BE FOR SIX YEARS. IT'S A MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT REAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT. THE ANNUAL TAXES THAT THIS PROPERTY CURRENTLY BRINGS IN ARE ONLY ABOUT $2,700. WITH THE TAX ABATEMENT IN PLACE, AS WE'VE ESTIMATED, THE TAXES WOULD BE
 MUCH HIGHER. SO EVEN WITH THE ABATEMENT IN PLACE, WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS PROPERTY AND THIS PROJECT WILL BRING IN MORE TAX REVENUE TO THE CITY, AND THIS PROVIDES A GOOD TOOL AS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT TO IMPROVE THE AREA. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I DO KNOW THAT ANDREW CASPERS IS PARTICIPATING ONLINE. HIS WIFE, AMANDA SCHUTS, WAS UNAVAILABLE TO ATTEND AND SENDS HER REGARDS
 But Andrew is available to answer any questions that you might have, and I am as well. Thank you, counselors. Are there any questions of the petitioner? And I'll yield to see if they wanted to add anything. The petitioner's on. Are they online? You're muted, Andrew. You must have said all you had to say. All right. All right.
 I think that Mr. Andrew must be good with Mr. Glavage's presentation. Thank you. At this time, I will turn to the public portion. Is there anyone in favor of Resolution 2425, in person or online? I do not see anyone from the public or online wishing to speak in favor of the bill. Thank you. The same said, do you see anyone in opposition of Resolution 2425?
 I do not see anyone in person or online wishing to speak in opposition. Thank you. With that being said, the public portion is now closed. Council, do you have any comments? If not, I'll entertain a motion. Second. It's been moved and seconded. Clerk, to roll out the roll, please. Council Member Tomas Morgan. Aye. Council Member Dr. Davis. Aye. Council Member White. Aye.

Thank you. Is there a committee report? No.
 YES, PRESIDENT BRYANT. THIS BILL WAS HEARD BY COMMUNITY INVESTMENT EARLIER THIS EVENING AND ALSO COMES FORWARD WITH A FAVORABLE RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRESENTER? ERIC LAVICH, DIRECTOR OF GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY OFFICES ON THE 14TH FLOOR.

 THEY INTEND TO HIRE 15 NEW EMPLOYEES IN ADDITION TO RETAINING THE 112 EMPLOYEES THAT CURRENTLY WORK AT THE FACILITY. THE 15 NEW EMPLOYEES WOULD ADD AN ANNUAL PAYROLL OF APPROXIMATELY $780,000 PER YEAR.
 IT'S VERY EXCITING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND WITH THIS PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT, WE'RE ADDING 15 JOBS. CURRENTLY, WE DID A, WE LOOKED THROUGH TAX RECORDS, HOOSIER TANK AND MANUFACTURING THIS PAST TAX YEAR PAID ABOUT $90,000 IN PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX. WITH
 TAX ABATEMENT IN PLACE, WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT OVER THE FOUR FIVE YEARS OF THE TAX ABATEMENT, THAT THEIR TAX LIABILITY WOULD BE ABOUT $320,000. WE'RE ASKING THE COUNCIL THROUGH THIS DECLARATORY RESOLUTION TO ABATE ROUGHLY $228,000 OF THAT. HOWEVER, AFTER THE ABATEMENT EXPIRES AFTER YEAR FIVE, OUR ESTIMATES SHOW THAT THE
 THAT THE YEAR SIX THROUGH TEN OF THEM OWNING THIS PROPERTY, THEY WOULD PAY AN ADDITIONAL $140,000, APPROXIMATELY. QUESTIONS CAME UP DURING THE FIVE O'CLOCK MEETING ABOUT THE LIFETIME OF THIS EQUIPMENT,
 um according to hoosier tank the equipment would last 10 to 15 years given good maintenance they are anticipating that it would last about 15 years our tax estimates look at roughly about that time frame in terms of how they might depreciate the equipment so exciting project we're great we're grateful for their investment in our community i don't know i know that mr maddox had a conflict i
 I don't think anyone else was able to join from Hoosier Tank, but I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you for your presentation.

 Bob, I see you looking. I haven't had a discussion, so I don't know where we are with this. It's been on hold. Are you asking for it to be set for a committee meeting? Yes. Okay. That would be the rules committee. Okay.

 I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I said I'm open to it not being on a council day if necessary.

And when will I be able to – so we'll probably know at the next meeting? Yes, I'm sure I could be able to get with everybody and have a date by then. Okay. I'm at peace. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any unfinished business? Is that McBride? Yes. Thank you. Okay.
 I put this under the bucket of unfinished business because it deals with minutes. I just want to thank our clerk and clerk's office for the hard work that they have to, that they've been doing to catch us up on minutes. In the past couple of weeks, I approved 41 meeting minutes across three committees. So thank you very much for the work that you're doing to catch us up. Thank you. Anyone else at this time? I'll turn to see if there's any new business. Yes.
 Vice President Nieskowski. Thank you, President McBride. Just a reminder for everybody, the 2025 citywide budget overview is Wednesday the 14th at 530, right here in the council chambers. And you should have been sent that via email. Thank you. Anyone else? With that being said, I'll turn to the privilege of the floor.
 As a reminder, disrespectful, rude, or disruptive speech or actions will not be tolerated. Such speech and or actions, as well as verbal attacks on any person may result in the individual without notice for fitting the remainder of his or her allotted time. Individuals who wish to speak, please come up to the council, state your name and residential address. You are limited to three minutes. The maximum time for this portion is 30 minutes and individuals should not be permitted to address any topics which the council has heard previously on the agenda tonight.
 And any requests would be assigned appropriately by the clerk's office or the president to the proper administration or council person. Please state your name and address for the record. Thank you. Don Foster, 132 Chapin Street, South Bend. Section 2.2, adoption of rules and regulations by the Common Council and powers thereto.
 The council shall have the power to financially supervise and investigate all departments, officers, and employees of the city, and to investigate the affairs of any person with whom the city has entered in, entered or is about to enter into a contract. The Common Council has repeatedly attempted to silence discussions on the floor, claiming several reasons for their actions. One, they assert that the Common Council lacks oversight,
 over a state senator's office. They argue that the matters raised are not pertinent to the city of South Bend. Three, state that Damon Naskoski does not have a contract with the city of South Bend 2024. However, these statements reflect not only a misunderstanding of governance, but also a misrepresentation of facts to taxpayers and city residents. On February 12th, 2023, and in previous years,
 Vice President Naskoski signed and submitted a uniform conflict of interest disclosure statement to the State Board of Accounts. But we could not find one for 2024. In 2023, though, Vice President Naskoski wrote in the State Board of Accounts, I was an employee and minority owner of Naskoski Plumbing Incorporated. My interest in the company terminated in 2021.
 and I am not employed with the company. I have no involvement in management or operation of the company. My husband has a minor interest in the company. My question is, David Nieskoski owned a minority interest in the company in February 12th, 2023. Does David or Council Vice President Sheila Nieskoski own any of Nieskoski Plumbing in 2024?
 Do either of them have a pecuniary interest in the company as outlined in Indiana Code 3544114. If you look on page three and four of the Board of Public Works proposals between Nisgotsky Plumbing and the City of South Bend dated February 5th, 2024, Nisgotsky Plumbing submitted David Nisgotsky's signature and license.
 While David Naskowski is indeed a state senator, he is also a contractor for the city of South Bend, with his company having received millions in funding over recent years. It is imperative that these issues are addressed transparently for the sake of accountability and public trust. Thank you. Thank you. Please state your name and address for the record. Sarah Foster, 1138 College Street. Thank you.
 91 days ago, Vice President Sheila Nizgatsky assaulted, intimidated, and attempted battery on my husband, Logan Foster, and has yet to be reprimanded or take accountability for her actions. The South Bend Code Ordinances Chapter 2, Article 1, Section 2-2G says, the Council shall have the power to discipline Council members. When will the Council discipline Vice President Nizgatsky's behavior?
 This is not the type of behavior that should be condoned by our elected city officials. Vice President Nizgatsky, please do the right thing and step down from your position. Thank you. Good evening. Please state your name and address for the record. My name is Linda Bryant, 3220 White Maple Court, South Bend, Indiana.
 91 days ago, Vice President Sheila Naskotsky assaulted, intimidated, and attempted battery on Logan Foster, and Naskotsky has yet to be reprimanded or taken accountability for her actions.
 The South Bend Code Vary Ordinance Chapter 2, Article 1, Section 2-2G says the council shall have the power to discipline the council members. When will the council discipline Sheila Natschotsky's behavior? This is not the behavior that should be condoned by our elected officials. Vice President Sheila Natschotsky, please do the right thing and resign from your position today.
 Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Brendan Crumlish, 1091 Riverside, South Bend. I'm a local businessman with an office at 3215 Sugar Maple Court in South Bend. I'm here tonight as the president of Businesses United 4. We're a corporation representing 25 South Bend businesses. We are seeking fairness for the truly homeless in our community, as well as a greater fiscal responsibility from our local government.
 And lastly, fairness and freedom for all media platforms to share and report on the actions of our government. All this is transparent and for the genuine improvement of the city of South Bend. I want to thank all of you council members except Councilman Troy Warner for meeting with us over the past six weeks to learn about our plans to protect the city from being overrun by more homeless immigrants from surrounding states and communities.
 We gained valuable feedback from their review of our efforts. At the close of the May 13th council meeting, Councilwoman Sheila Niskadzki assaulted a legitimately credentialed member of the media after he addressed the council earlier that evening asking questions about local government contracting procedures. This was a fair inquiry from any citizen, business person, or member of the media. Thank you.
 His questions were badgered back by Councilwomen Nizgadski and McBride with belittling comments in an attempt to avoid his questions. Their contempt for the public speaker, Logan Foster, was reprehensible and a violation of all public procedural decency. No public speaker should be cross-examined for asking an open and honest line of questions.
 and Councilwoman Neskadski's subsequent assault on Logan was simply appalling. With that said, since then, this council has done nothing to sanction Ms. Neskadski for her actions. No rebuke, no censorship from her committee positions, not even an apology. And this makes all of you as guilty as she for ignoring her actions.
 Shame on you as a council for condoning her actions through your silence. Again, we are all here tonight to ask Councilwoman Naskowski to resign her position on this elected board of city representatives. This council must demonstrate stronger support for proper decorum and behavior. You have the greatest responsibilities to uphold the laws in our community.
 please exercise them by removing Ms. Naskadzki from this council and all of her committee assignments. Thank you. Thank you. Please state your name and address for the record. Yes, it's Logan Foster, 1138 College Street. This is an important moment for the floor to present its concerns, and it's not a time for cross-examination by the chair. As of July 3rd, 2024,
 Nagatsuki Plumbing has received over $400,000 in payments from the City of South Bend. This is the same Nagatsuki Plumbing for which Vice President Sheila Nagatsuki has previously been required to submit a uniform conflict of interest disclosure statement due to her pecuniary interest in the company. Notably, the State Board of Accounts has not received this required disclosure from Vice President Nagatsuki for the year 2024.
 raising serious questions from the residents and the taxpayers. While Vice President Nogazi publicly claims she is no longer affiliated with the company, her pecuniary interests persist.
 The documents I possess indicate that her husband, David Nagoski, is not only an owner of Nagoski Plumbing, but also submitted his signature and his plumbing license in the 2024 Board of Public Works application, which facilitated the disbursement of over $400,000 to the Nagoski Plumbing business in just six months of 2024.
 Ignoring the obligation to disclose such pecuniary interest would constitute a Class D felony, and it is critical for the Council to investigate why Vice President Nagatsuki failed to disclose her and her dependents' pecuniary interest in the year 2024.
 Why would the Nagatsky family have secured the contract with the City of South Bend in the Board of Public Works if David Nagatsky's plumbing licenses had not been submitted with his signatures in the 2024 contract? I think not. Additionally, despite claims that David Nagatsky is retired, he provided his active plumbing licenses to the Board of Works 2024,
 contract to receive plumbing contracts from the City of South Bend. This matter deserves thorough investigation as it raises significant concerns about potential fraudulent conduct.
 Bob Palmer, Sharon McBride, and Sheila Nagoski have publicly claimed that David Nagoski does not have an active contract with the City of South Bend. If that is the case, why is his signature and license throughout the 2024 submittal with the City of South Bend and the Board of Public Works? If David Nagoski is retired, as you all claim, wouldn't this be fraud? No.
 knowingly submitting the license of a person who has retired, who has no pecuniary interest in the company, so the company can receive hundreds of thousands of dollars from a government entity? That sounds like fraud. My last comment, as I stand before all of you, I am again asking that Vice President Nagoski resign from her position as she assaulted me in the council chambers as you all watched. Time, sir. Thank you, sir.
 Clerk Dorado, do you see anyone online wishing to speak at the purpose of the floor? I do not see anyone online. Thank you. With that, this meeting stands adjourned. Good night.
