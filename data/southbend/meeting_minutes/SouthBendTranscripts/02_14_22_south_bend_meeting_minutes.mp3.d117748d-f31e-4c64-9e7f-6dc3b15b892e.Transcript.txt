 and welcome again. At this time, reports from the city, we would like to welcome Mayor James Mueller for him to provide a statement of finances. Welcome, Mayor.
 good evening council members and happy valentine's day i know there's a lot of love in this room and online but uh i'm sorry you have to spend it with with me here but i'll be as quick as possible and uh there's a lot of good news and and things ahead and so hopefully uh that can at least make up and you can tell your significant others uh you know that the the mayor kept you longer than you would have liked so you can
 and feel free to blame me for why you're not able to be spending time with them right now. But it's also exciting to be here at the, you know, this is the third year where I've,
 come before council last year was virtual and so it's great that we're moving back into more normality and and hopefully this is uh you know we'll be more in person uh in the near future as well but uh city controller dan parker is uh is remote controlling the show here so if you don't mind moving to the next slide we can get started
 So we want to take a step back and just see where we are as a city and where we've come from over the past decade or so. And, of course, we were excited last year to confirm the fact that South Bend is a growing city once again with the official 2020 census results. And there you see the somewhat modest growth, but it picked up toward the end of the decade. Now, I did go back and look at last year's results.
 slide with the similar data. So the one with the projection for 2020 was actually shown to be a slight decrease from the previous year and yet you see a big jump there. So the models are still catching up to the growth that's happening and what's going on in South Bend. So we do hope that even though the models are projecting just a slight growth that we can continue that trajectory that we've seen in the past couple of years.
 Other good news is the medium household income, per capita incomes have also been going up. So not only are we getting more people, but we're also increasing the incomes of the people that are here.
 Similarly, our lower income brackets, our poverty rate has been dropping. We're still above the national average, of course, but we're going in the right direction and we want to continue to see us go in that direction and working on a lot of things to move that. Of course, there's also the macro economy.
 as much as I would love and you would love as city government to take credit for all of this. Past 10 years was a long expansion until the pandemic hit as well as we've seen rapid growth since the dip in the pandemic. So Dan, if you go to the next slide, we can see how we're doing on our recovery. So you'll all recall that when things first hit, we got some model,
 from Oxford Economics about what are two... They did a lot of different scenarios, but we thought these were the two most likely scenarios. So either a quick growth rebound, which is the top light blue line, or the muted recovery, which is the dark blue line. And you can...
 WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS JOURNEY OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS NOW, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD, WHEN WE MADE OUR BUDGET FOR 2021, WE ASSUMED, WE DID WHAT ANYONE GOOD WOULD DO, YOU JUST TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THESE ARE THE TWO LIKELY SCENARIOS AND WE JUST ASSUMED WE'D BE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. SO WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE FOR A WHILE, BUT NOW OVER THE PAST COUPLE QUARTERS, WE'VE STARTED TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT
 recovery line. So the recovery has been strong. We know that not everyone is feeling it. We've certainly seen public sentiment not feeling good and feeling sour about the economy. But by all means, in terms of what's been going on, not just here, but across the country, astonishing number of jobs being created at a record pace and certainly economic output following as well.
 And if you want to go to the next slide and the next one.
 WE'LL JUST QUICKLY GO OVER SOME OF THE 2021 HIGHLIGHTS. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE COULD FOCUS ON HERE, BUT BEING THE FINANCIAL UPDATE FOR THE COUNCIL, WE'LL FOCUS ON NUMBERS AND DOLLARS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE STATE OF THE CITY, WHICH WILL HAVE A BROADER LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY, I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT IT SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 26TH AT 6 PM.
 We'll have more of a broader look going on, but here we like to dive into finances and numbers. So on the economic recovery, some of the efforts of the team, if you recall, we received some CARES Act funding in 2020 from EDA, the U.S. Department of Health.
 economic development to provide COVID emergency funding for local businesses. And I believe the award was just over $7 million. And the team's been working hard and gotten $6.5 million of those dollars out the door already.
 We, it's hard to, time goes by pretty quickly, but we thank the council for helping us get our innovation grants for restaurants up and going. And if you recall, 138 restaurants partook in that program, and that totaled $276,000 to an industry that was hit particularly hard with all the safety measures for the public health emergency.
 We've also, we're able to move forward with, you know, we've had the facade grant program in corridors, and we've expanded the number of corridors that are eligible over the last few years. But we were able to do 10 projects last year with roughly one-to-one public-private match, going for half a million dollars of investment into our corridor facades.
 We also, if you recall, as part of the how do we bring the life back to the city and make outdoor dining and other things, in addition to the innovation program, we had a hit refresh in partnership with DTSB, 14 grants, and that leveraged private investment a little more than our normal corridor facade grants. And you see almost a million dollars of private investment going toward
 uh... off of roughly uh... just under a quarter of a million dollars of of public investment uh... tax abatements uh... still uh... thank you for your support of our one of our best economic development tools so that we have
 have. And it spurred $78 million of private investment, 441 jobs. And I know you guys took a look recently, but it's just phenomenal how great this tool has worked for us over the past number of years. And of the 35 active real property tax abatements
 We've seen an increase in total assessed value from $18.4 million to $122.1 million. And so that means three more million dollars in property taxes that we're collecting because of those investments. As you know, we also thank the council for approving the expanded utility assistance program that will help
 uh... those uh... most vulnerable households uh... manage uh... their utility bills uh... as well as uh... you know get through some of the will talk it in this short order of about uh... about relief of bills that that are overdue uh... in addition we uh...
 We embarked on an ambitious three-year rebuilding our streets initiative last year. And again, thank you for approving the financing for that. We were able to deploy $9.9 million in 2021 and touch over 129 lane miles, and that's just under 10% of our lane miles.
 SO THAT PROGRAM IS MOVING FORWARD AND THIS YEAR, THANK YOU TO THE COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO SIT ON THE REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION FOR THE STRATEGY DOES INVOLVE SOME REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM. AND SO WE'RE EXCITED FOR ANOTHER GOOD YEAR IN 2022.
 Can't stress the significance of this development enough, but we finally were able to finalize the new long-term control plan for the combined sewer overflows in our city. And the new plan with innovative and green infrastructure will save our ratepayers $437 million.
 AND THEN FINALLY, SOME OTHER GOOD NEWS THAT WILL CONTINUE ON AND BE A THEME OF 2022, BUT WE WERE ONE OF A FEW REASONS IN THE STATE OF INDIANA TO GET THE MAXIMUM $50 MILLION AWARD FOR THE SOUTH BENNETT-HELCART REGION.
 LAST YEAR WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THE APPLICATION OF THE STATE, THEY DID A PRE-AWARD REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF PROJECTS IN OUR REGION WERE SUBMITTED. SO WE ACTUALLY EXPECT, AND WE'VE HEARD MORE SINCE THAT REQUEST, SO WE ACTUALLY EXPECT THERE MAY BE MORE DEMAND FOR PROJECTS THAN THERE WAS LAST YEAR. SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS, A LOT OF THINGS POTENTIALLY IN THE PIPELINE HERE, AND THAT'S GOING TO
 We're still getting the details from the state on how that will be structured, but similar to regional cities that we had a few years ago, it was usually a 20% match from the state, 20% match from the localities, and then the rest would be private investment. Dan, you got the next slide? All right, so now we're deep into how we did on the finances.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT, JUST THE NET, HOW THINGS WENT, YOU'LL SEE
 For the most part, we're not only not in the red, we are strongly in the black. And if you remember how we budgeted for 2021 a year and a half ago, there was a lot of uncertainty about where the economy was going. There was a lot of uncertainty about what kind of assistance would come from the federal and state levels.
 And so in the end, in the top line, the General Plus funds, which are basic operations funds for the government, ended up with a $9.9 million surplus. There are other factors too. Property taxes, again, rebounded. Property values and property taxes went fairly well, especially compared to our longer past.
 as well as incomes did rebound faster than we would have thought. And as you saw in the line of our recovery, we assumed we were in the middle of those two lines, and whenever we go above those two lines, we're doing better than expected.
 The other piece of it is on expenditures. We also, there's a lot of things, there was a lot of uncertainty in terms of what big projects were coming up and, you know, just some of the other major projects that didn't fully get their dollars expended in 2021 or even move forward in 2021.
 So whether we were waiting to see what would happen with the infrastructure bill or rescue plan dollars or whatever, as you know, there are a lot of projects in the pipeline. Some of those didn't happen in 21. Or sometimes some of the expenditures literally just didn't get out the door before December 31st. So they've been spent, but they just haven't left the door by the cutoff here.
 Finally, you know, on the bottom there, you'll probably also notice, well, there's two things. The going first in the middle, the enterprise funds, wastewater sewer and waterworks and solid waste. If you recall, we did a transfer of ARP dollars to, one, to make solid waste, you know, get out of the hole and make sure that we didn't have to raise rates as soon as possible.
 AS WE NEEDED TO IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT TRANSFER. AS WELL AS THERE WAS THE TRANSFER IN THE ARP FOR THE RELIEF AND THE UTILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO WATERWORKS AND WASTEWATER AND SEWER. SO THAT'S THAT'S A PART OF IT AS WELL. AGAIN, THERE
 From our rates discussion last year, there's a big capital plan in the near term where a lot of these dollars will get spent. But those take a lot of time for planning, design, and all the rest. So those will be coming up in the next year or so.
 And then finally, you look at the redevelopment funds, and again, it's good news in terms of a rebound. And these are mostly property taxes that came in last year a lot stronger than we had anticipated. So there's, again, it's similar to some of the other ones. It's partly, there are more, the property taxes probably account for almost a third of that surplus. Another piece is just the timing.
 When I was executive director of community investment, I said we take a pretty conservative approach to accounting. And, you know, I said I didn't want to be the first director to go bankrupt as the redevelopment. So we don't... If dollars are programmed, even if they're not out the door, we don't program dollars twice. So that leads to a lag in terms of when they get spent. You know, you could argue, you know...
 In maybe another operation, you might say there's a sweet spot where you try to overspend on program dollars and you catch up over time and get to more of a balance. But we've taken a conservative where we have our estimated revenues and we don't double program those dollars once they're programmed. Dan, if you want to go to the next. All right.
 And so, yeah, you know the drill by now that you've probably seen this. Now you've seen this presentation, this format a couple times already. So we start with the liquidity, the cash balance and where we are. And here you see a similar story with the total cash on hand, which does include the ARP dollars. We are substantially up from 2020, so $363 million versus roughly $300 million.
 IT'S OKAY. AND THEN SO MOVING TO THE GENERAL PLUS FUNDS, WHICH IS OUR CORE OPERATIONS FUNDS, YOU SEE THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE NUMBER HAS WE'VE BEEN INCREASING OUR CASH BALLOTS. THERE'S A FEW REASONS FOR THIS.
 When you think back to the first slide about our growth in the past few years, we've seen a growth in property taxes and income taxes that we hadn't necessarily fully expected. So the good news is when we do grow, you see revenues do follow and sometimes in a happy, unexpected way.
 THE OTHER ONE WAS WE WERE PREPARING FOR, IF YOU RECALL, WE WERE PREPARING FOR THE 2020 FISCAL CLIFF, THE PROPERTY TAX, WHERE THE FULL CAPS WENT INTO EFFECT, AND WE WERE EXPECTING, AGAIN, A MUCH BIGGER HIT TO OUR REVENUE THAN WHAT WE ENDED UP EXPERIENCING. BUT, YOU KNOW, SO THE SUMMARY HERE IS JUST WHEN WE THINK OF THE BUDGET, WE HAD A BUDGETED DEFICIT IN 2021,
 And you see at the end of the year, we have more cash. Even in the general plus funds, not including the ARP, we have more cash on hand than we did at the beginning of the year. But that's, again, some of these dollars are spoken for. You know, they're just waiting to get out the door. They just weren't out the door on December 31st. Dan, do you want to go to the next one?
 So here this shows where we fall within peer cities, and we are clearly moving toward the top. So this is a happy place to be, but this is not a place we necessarily want to stay where we're just, you know, have cash and not putting it to good use.
 City Controller Dan Parker has shown you the return we get on our deposits. It's not very high. So we do want to put this capital to use, but of course we want to maintain a good, healthy reserve to stay fiscally strong and maintain our bond rating. Dan, go to the next slide. So now we get to debt. Go ahead. Thank you.
 And you'll see that we have a majority of our debt is in economic development. So that's when we go out to the market to get debt, we try to...
 to invest in things in a smart way that will have a return over time. So that's one way in which we use debt. We also use debt to push the cost of expensive infrastructure over time. So when we had our rates conversation last year, the
 astronomical differences if we tried to fund the capital we need on a cash flow basis versus finance it with debt. And so the plan that we passed was able to keep rates modest almost
 well, at this point, less than the rate of inflation to fund these critical capital projects, but they will be financed over a number of years to keep the rates from having to spike up for those investments. Dan, go ahead.
 And as you see here, roughly the debt service that we pay off of all of our debt has remained relatively flat, and this is in nominal terms. So if you consider the inflation and the real costs
 of that debt service. It's actually been going down in recent years. And that's what you can see in the yellow line is that the percentage of expenditures as our expenditures and revenues go up and costs go up, if you have the same level of debt service, the percentage is going down. So in real terms, we have less debt service annually now than we have in some time.
 And similarly, if your debt's not going up and your population is going up, your debt for capital is going to go. Not trying to get math on Valentine's Day, but just very basic here. This is good where your debt is staying roughly the same and your population is increasing. So that number has been dropping as well.
 And where we are relatively, we're kind of middle of the pack here in second-class cities in terms of debt, whether it's per capita or, you know, that's probably the most important measure or how to compare between different cities. Because even second-class cities can vary pretty substantially in the size from $35,000 to I think even what's the highest there.
 WE GOT 264,000. SO, IT CAN BE BIG VARIATIONS THERE. SO, DEBT-PER-CAPITA, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK. BUT NOT ALL DEBT-PER-CAPITA IS EVEN THE BEST MEASURE OF HOW STRONG OR WELL YOUR DEBT IS. SO, IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HIGHEST DEBT-PER-CAPITA, YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE
 A FEW CITIES THERE, HAMMOND, FISHERS, EVANSVILLE. AND ON THE NEXT SLIDE OR TWO, YOU'LL SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH FISHERS AND HAMMOND HAVE, YOU KNOW, AMONG THE HIGHER DEBTS PER CAPITA, THE STRENGTH OF THEIR FISCAL POSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT. SO IT'S JUST ONE PIECE TO LOOK AT WHEN LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF OUR FINANCES. GO AHEAD, DAN.
 So here we go with the bond rating. We're proud of our AA bond rating. And I think I've said it before, and Mr. Parker's probably said it as well, that we're not going to bring something that clearly jeopardizes that bond rating, because it's important to keep our strong position financially, as well as make sure that when we do go out to finance something in debt markets that we get a good rate.
 But as I just mentioned, toward the higher debt per capita, Fisher's was one of the higher ones, and it's got one of the best bond ratings. And Hammond was up there with them, and on this chart, they've got one of the worst bond ratings. So it's really the whole picture of how the debt with the economy and where things are going, how the markets will see, and really where the city falls in its financial position. Go ahead, Dan. Thank you.
 Now we'll move to capital assets. So all of the things that the city owns, that's of value. So currently this is the total purchase prices of when they were purchased, not necessarily adjusted for inflation. But the total purchase price cost to either get them or build them is over $1.1 billion of the city's assets. And...
 When you account for a depreciation of those assets, our net book value is just under half of that, so $506 million of value. And the useful life is over 17 years. So this is actually a little bit of an uptick in terms of useful life than what we had last year. And I'm
 I had to ask our controller why that might be. And the more we invest in things that last longer, it makes sense. So whether we're investing in buildings or streets or sewers and things that have longer lifespans compared to our normal business operations like police vehicles and other things, that useful life is.
 uh... will take up so with the level of investment that were contemplating from the rates plan on on sewers uh... and water pipes and are continuing a rebuilding our streets i would anticipate this the continue to move up uh... in in the next uh... few years and here's a a uh...
 the line of capital expenditures by year and clearly 2019 was a strong year with 74 million. A lot of that was our parks, my SB parks and trails program. And we've said with the level of depreciation of our net of our assets that we just saw, it depreciates about 30 million a year. So if we average somewhere between
 30, 35 million, we would be able to maintain the assets that we have. Now, if you add capacity or you have growth, then you would want to be investing above that over time. So, again, there are a lot of capital projects that we have contemplated and discussed and are before us. And so we'll expect over the next couple of years for that to increase as well. All right, finally get to operations.
 So here's how the funds did. So at the beginning, we saw kind of how the large buckets went, but here's another view of individual funds and how they ended up from the beginning to the end of the year. You know, obviously in the motor vehicle highway, we're trying to spend the dollars to get streets built and repaired. And so there's no reason to be sitting on cash in that kind of capital account.
 The DCI operating fund, that was an intentional drawdown of reserves that had built up over time in that fund above the reserve level that the controller has set for operations. And then moving down to, again, to the waterworks and sewer works, the transfer from ARP as well as
 anticipating major capital investments, there was a surplus at the end of last year. But again, there will be drawdowns in the years to come.
 So back to good news. Here's the chart of the property tax and how it's gone. So you see the first half of the last decade, property taxes remain more or less flat. There weren't major increases or, you know, just kind of up and down. Then the second half of the last decade, we started to see increases. And in many ways, the way we were always –
 didn't always know whether these were going to continue into the future or whether these, again, were some of the up and downs that we had seen previously. And so in many ways, when you saw our cash reserves increase over the 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, it was in anticipation of the fiscal cliff as well as a conservative forecasting of what to expect from property tax revenue. So with the big...
 big jump in 2021, and that's before even some of the, you know, we all saw the housing prices move up and other property prices move up last year. That's not...
 INCLUDED IN THIS YET. SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE, BUT WE COULD ANTICIPATE POTENTIALLY ANOTHER INCREASE OF REVENUE GOING INTO THIS YEAR, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE KIND OF LEARNED AS THE CASH HAS BEEN ACCREWING, WE'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE PROJECTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. SO THE 2022 BUDGET DOES INCLUDE WHAT WE THINK IS A GOOD
 A GROWTH OF PROPERTY TAX INSTEAD OF WONDERING WHETHER PROPERTY TAXES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE. WE DID ASSUME THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE. AND AGAIN, WE'RE IN A STRONG CASH POSITION TO MAKE THAT KIND OF PROJECTION, AS OPPOSED TO IF YOU'RE CLOSER TO YOUR RESERVE LIMIT, YOU WANT TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE WITH YOUR
 So local income tax, this was all, if you remember, when we first started the pandemic, we always knew this was going to be the year where the lag in income taxes was going to hit us the most. And that's what we projected in the budget. Nevertheless,
 the hit that we took last year, and we did anticipate some hit, was not nearly as bad as we had contemplated. So still too early to tell, but we know wages are increasing at a rate that they haven't in at least some time. And so there's a lot of hope that the income tax revenue will also rebound strongly in the next year or two.
 So here's the breakdown of our full-time employees. And as you know, half of our workforce is public safety. Another quarter is public works. And then the final quarter plus is split between our general government operations, so our
 the admin finance, our legal department, our elected officials, and our technology and innovation teams. And so all the ones that come into the internal operations and then the other two that are outward facing venue parks and arts and the Department of Community Investment.
 AND SO WE, AS A TOTAL, WE HAD 1,075 EMPLOYEES. AND THE NEXT CHART WILL SHOW HOW THAT COMPARES. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THERE, NOW THIS CHART HAS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE,
 axis on the left, it's not a big difference in numbers, but it shows, you know, a change or a drop in the number of employees. And I think just like every employer, it's been labor, it's a tight labor market and it's been taking longer and longer to fill certain roles when they do become vacant, whether retirement or someone going on to make, you
 money elsewhere or moving out of the area. Whatever the reason may be, it's just been taking longer and longer to fill these spots and find candidates. And we're seeing it also in our, when we put out application or job openings, the number of candidates replying is much lower than it had been in the past.
 HERE'S THE HEALTH INSURANCE TREND AND OUR CONTROLLER WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED THIS, THAT SINCE WE OPENED UP THE ACTIVATE CLINIC, OUR TREND OF COST HAS BEEN GOING UP 2.73% ANNUALLY COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS SEVEN YEARS THAT AVERAGED 6.61 ANNUALLY.
 We know that's an important piece of containing our costs on health care. There are probably other reasons that go along with that, but this is a big reason that we can point to. And so we hope all employees that are taking advantage of this clinic and helping us keep costs down while we're providing good health care to our workers.
 And so we wanted to summarize, kind of bring this down to what this would mean for a household. And this would be, so if you had an average income of $40,000, this would be a pretty healthy position to be in. You would have cash in the bank more than what you bring in during the year, and you're
 you have assets other than cash, so maybe you have a mortgage or something that's netting that's $64,000 and then maybe you have a nice car or a couple car payments or debts that's $27,000. So you're doing, if the city were a household, you would say we're in a pretty strong position.
 Of course, we want to see, we want to continue to leverage what we have, so we want to continue to leverage interest rates and our debt position to make strong investments and increase the growth here.
 YOU CAN'T SAY, AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY BE, WE WANT TO INVEST, IF YOU WERE THIS HOUSEHOLD, WOULD YOU KEEP THE CASH IN THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR WOULD YOU TRY TO START INVESTING THEM IN HIGHER RETURN PORTFOLIOS? SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING TO DO AND SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE, DAN. THANK YOU.
 Just to remind the discussions during the budget process, we're here at a moment in time where we really do feel that this can be a generational opportunity for transformation of our community. And at the top there, you see the priorities from the budget, strong neighborhoods, safe community for everyone, robust, sustainable infrastructure, equitable access to opportunity, youth and workforce development, and then a leading city team.
 And then below you just see all the things that are going, you know, kind of wind at our backs propelling us forward. The macro economy, I know, again, sentiment, public sentiment isn't as strong as what the numbers actually show. Record job growth.
 record growth just across the board lots of things to be excited about, but know that it hasn't fully hit home yet. We do know that the headwinds are that inflation prices have gone up faster than they've gone up in a number of decades.
 and there is a potential of the Federal Reserve to pump the brakes with raising interest rates in the next year or so. But nevertheless, as of now, things are moving forward. We see growth here in our population that we haven't seen in a long while.
 WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOW INSTANCE RATES WHILE THEY'RE HERE. WE MAINTAIN OUR HEALTHY RESERVES AND THE FEDERAL AND STATE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRICKLE DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF RESERVES.
 YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE US, ALL OF THESE RESOURCES, THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT THE DOOR ALL AT ONCE. AND SO EVEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SPENDING OVER SEVEN YEARS OR SO. SO THOSE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO COMMUNITIES AND SOUTH BENN. AND THEN THE SUMMARY OF WHERE WE ENDED UP, IF YOU CAN RECALL, BACK TO OCTOBER, NOVEMBER. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO
 You know, we know essential operations form a large part of what we do, so a third of our budget is just going to maintaining the essential services. You could add debt service, things that, investments we'd already made, paying those off 10%. Inter-fund transfer is really fun, you know, the internal operations, employee health, liability, other pieces of the operation, so again, pretty critical. You can't do too much with that.
 the self-insurances over there in purple too. Then just maintaining what we have to make sure that our equipment and other things are functioning the way we want. And then the final quarter plus is strategic spending. And this year we were blessed to have more strategic spending in the form of American Rescue Plan dollars.
 A lot going on there and of course a big focus on our neighborhood, $78.1 million worth 64% of all strategic spending going toward our neighborhoods.
 SO I'M ALMOST DONE. WE'LL JUST QUICKLY GO THROUGH SOME UPCOMING ITEMS. WE'RE GETTING NEAR, IF YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING OUR NUMBERS HERE LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY, THE CASES ARE DROPPING RATHER QUICKLY AND THE TRANSMISSION RATE OR WHAT THEY CALL R-NOT, SO THE SPEED AT WHICH CASES ARE SPREADING, WE ARE MOVING TO THE LOWEST LEVELS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PANDEMIC AS WE DROP OFF THE NUMBER OF CASES.
 In the coming weeks, we'll anticipate an end of the declared health emergency and deal with the related measures for that.
 I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE RECEIVED THE $50 MILLION AS A REGION FOR READY, AND THAT PROCESS SHOULD GET GOING HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. THE STATE IS STILL SORTING OUT SOME DETAILS, BUT ONCE THAT GETS GOING, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF THINGS OF INTEREST, AND WE'LL HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO COME UP WITH OUR 20% MATCH FOR A NUMBER OF WHICHEVER PROJECTS DO SUCCEED.
 WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE SCHOOLS CAPITAL PROJECT, SO OF COURSE THERE'S THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING MOVE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, BUT ALSO WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS ON THE CAREER CENTER THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REFERENDUM CONVERSATIONS, AND SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, SO THAT WILL BE COMING DOWN THE LINE. LIGHTING.
 will be AEP in partnership with our electric company will be replacing their bulbs to LEDs later this year. Later this month or early next month, they will do a, for a week, they'll have up kind of a
 a few blocks to see the new lights. And so we'll want to get you guys out there and our neighbors out there to see the new lights, those who are interested. And then they'll move forward on the full plan to change out the rest of the lights. Once we...LED lights are able to provide more light or, you know, you can change the color
 There's, you want more light and then until you have too much light and then you don't want as much light. So, you know.
 We're trying to get that right balance, but because it has the potential for more light, we want to see these get in place before we see where the gaps are in our existing light infrastructure. So the first step will be this kind of pilot at the end of the month, early next month. We'll get details, have you guys come out, have encouraged others to come out to see it.
 Then they'll go, I mean it's pretty crazy how many lights going around, changing them all out in the city in a matter of a few months. But then the next few months they'll spend changing them out and then we'll look to see what gaps we have and see where we need to be adding more lighting. So lots on lighting.
 BUT IT'S AN EXCITING YEAR FOR LIGHTING, AND SO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LIGHTING, THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD YEAR FOR YOU. SIMILARLY, REBUILDING OUR STREETS. WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WE ANNUALLY DO THE RATINGS. WE'RE GOING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY STREETS
 if they've maintained their rating or whether they've deteriorated. I've heard from a couple council members about streets that weren't supposed to be in bad condition yet, that already are in condition that need attention. The other piece of this is we've talked about all the great things about expanding, you know, the recovery, expansion, all these dollars.
 THE RISING PRICES ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES HERE. SO WE'LL WANT TO DO AN ASSESSMENT. EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT COST PER LANE MILE WILL BE UP FROM WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED WHEN WE BUDGETED AND WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THE PLAN. SO WE MAY HAVE TO COME BACK LATER THIS YEAR AND REVISIT WHERE WE ARE AND WHETHER WE PUT FURTHER FUNDING TO DO THAT.
 keep the schedule that we put forth. The Housing Authority Development, if you read the paper this morning, they're looking at an ambitious project over where the Rabbi Shulman building sits, as well as the Monroe Circle housing. It's still...
 They did an RFP. I think we've talked about that for a developer to come in to help them work out the details. And I believe they're close, if not having selected a developer. And then it comes down to putting the pieces together. You know, what is the gap? There was hope that there would be...
 At one point, there was hope that the Build Back Better plan would pass, and there was a lot of housing funding within that package. With the future of that uncertain, obviously the moniker Build Back Better is dead for better or worse, but –
 YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF POPULAR PROGRAMS IN BUILD BACK BETTER THAT MAY FIND A NEW LIFE IN THE COMING MONTHS. SO WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY. BUT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE NORMAL, YOU KNOW, IN A NORMAL FEDERAL BUDGET THAT HOPEFULLY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY CAN TAP INTO THAT AS WELL AS LOOKING AT HOW THE CITY CAN BEST PARTNER WITH THEM TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
 IT WOULD BE, AND I KNOW THERE'S, IT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALK OF A DEVELOPER COMING IN SOMETIMES RAISES THAT THIS IS CHANGING FROM AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION TO MARKET RATE, BUT IT WOULD BE AN AFFORDABLE, THESE WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS MANAGED BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY.
 WE'LL ALSO, WE'RE WORKING ON REVISING THE HOUSING PROGRAM STRATEGY FOR 2022. AND THIS WAS, WE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A RELOOK AFTER THE SALARY ORDINANCE AND WE THANKED THE COUNCIL FOR TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SALARY ORDINANCE AND MOVING ON THAT, BUT WE
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST, WE TOOK THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S SUSTAINABLE AND WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS. SO WE'LL WANT TO COME BACK TO YOU AND TALK ABOUT OUR HOUSING PROGRAM STRATEGY THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WASN'T ABLE TO GO FORWARD IN THE BUDGET PROCESS.
 The neighborhood plan implementation, so we're looking to find how to finance all the different pieces of our neighborhood plans. And as you know, there's three that we did last year.
 that will be finishing up the final reports and look for action. And we'll do more this year as well as begin the comprehensive planning process for the city. But those plans come with, you know, discrete ideas for how to move these neighborhoods forward. So we'll look to come up with a financing plan with all of you and which projects are of highest priority and hope to move that forward later this year.
 COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS ON HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. AGAIN, STARTING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CENTER, I KNOW THE COUNTY TEAM AND THE SHERIFF REDMAN AND DR. BOB EINTERNS AND OTHERS AND OUR HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE WORKING ON THIS.
 And so this is moving forward. We don't have an exact idea of what the city's contribution, but it seems somewhere in the two, two and a half million dollar range. If you recall, we appropriated just under $6 million for county partnerships on mental health and homelessness. The county has also moved forward with some support for Youth Service Bureau,
 and Center for the Homeless. And so those are things we're taking a look at when we talk about county partnerships. And then, of course, the intake center is something that's moving forward. We don't have all the details on capital or operations, but I know there are a lot of folks working hard on trying to get those details. But the county has passed. So the Mental Health Crisis Center and the intake center, there's not a concrete report
 uh... thing that that's moving forward at this time even though it is uh... being worked on actively uh... but uh... the youth service bureau in the center for the homeless uh...
 PROJECTS HAVE GOTTEN APPROVAL FROM THE COUNTY COUNCIL FOR THEIR ARP DOLLARS AND SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT CONTEMPLATE AT SOME LEVEL CITY PARTNERSHIPS. THOSE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH AND DISCUSS AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE SOME SORT OF COUNCIL COMMITTEE MEETING ON THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. KOVALESKI UPGRADES
 As you recall, we got the state to form the professional sports development tax. And so that started, we started collecting revenues toward the end of last year. And we anticipate getting about $2 million a year from that.
 the first order of businesses take care of the pieces that allow us to maintain our minor league team. So we're upgrading lighting right now, and then there are a number of other improvements to maintain our status. But then there's also conversations about whether we're
 whether to expand the seating and the structure at Kovaleski. So that's a little bit longer term, but that's on the radar and we'll continue working through that.
 And then finally, we talked about in the rate conversation that there are a lot of capital improvements that have to be made. So on the sewer side, we've got to meet our new requirement. We're saving money from the old requirement of the long-term control plan, but there is still a substantial amount of investment we have to do over the next 20 years. And so the next phase of it...
 will be funded and we'll need to finance it based off of the most recent rates. Similarly, water, we'll be looking to move forward on water capital improvements in the next year or so as well. So the list is kind of in chronological, rough chronological order. But with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you so much, Mayor, for your presentation. Very thorough.
 and easy to follow. At this time, I'll turn it over to council. You have two questions for the mayor. I'll start with Councilwoman Rachel Tomas-Morgan. Do you have any questions for the mayor? Thank you, President McBride. Thank you, Mayor, for being with us this evening and for your presentation report today.
 I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. I JUST WANT TO ABSORB ALL THIS, AND I MAY END UP WITH ONE AFTER I HEAR WHAT COLLEAGUES HAVE TO ASK. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL MOVE TO COUNCILMAN TROY WARNER. THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME.
 I think back to two years ago when we sat here right before the pandemic and we knew that the economy was shrinking and crunching and none of us had any idea what was really coming, but we kind of, uh, you know, through that year braced for back to the very first slide from Mr. Parker, that kind of very worst case muted scenario. And, uh, it's, I'm amazed at where we are. I, uh,
 you know we've been very fortunate and uh have handled the finance as well um it's a those excited to see those numbers and um the arp to add to that and the ready grants and the opportunity to kind of use that to leverage uh additional investment which could
 potentially just bringing even more growth. It's very exciting, but I don't have any questions. It's just good to kind of see those. And I kind of, as the chair of personnel finance last year, got a little, you know, I spent almost as much time with Mr. Parker as my wife. So I got a little insight of what was going on, but to see it all put together now is great. Thank you. Councilman Wax. Yes.
 THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MCBRIDE, AND THANK YOU, MAYOR MUILLER, FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I OVERALL, WHILE WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON HOW THE CITY SPENDS ITS MONEY, I DO APPRECIATE IN THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE CITY IS CLEARLY SHOWING THROUGH ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT THE
 DIFFICULT OR UNCERTAIN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. SOMETHING THOUGH, AND YOU BROUGHT IT UP A COUPLE TIMES IN SPECIFIC CASES, WE'RE SEEING A NATIONAL PROBLEM OF INFLATION, YOU KNOW, A FEW MONTHS AGO. THE HOPE WAS THAT IT WAS TRANSITORY. IT'S SEEMING MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT THAT ISN'T THE CASE. AND I THINK THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS IS OVER 7%. SO IF YOU...
 While the current economic forecast just from the dollars and cents looks good, especially if you were comparing it to other years, I worry that at least in the short term, it may not be as rosy as it looks right now. And so you discussed how you would address or that you need to look at it again with specifically with streets, but is there a broader conversation happening as
 more holistic on how we're going to address this issue? Yeah, I mean, as you said, there was a hope that this was more temporary and a growing pain of our recovery. And to some extent, you know, obviously this.
 It will correct... I mean, it's going to correct one way. There's a number of different ways that this corrects, right? And the Federal Reserve does seem poised to put on the brakes if it doesn't, you know, start sorting itself out. But this will go... You know, so there's the rosy side of where we are from our cash position and across the board on our financial position. But the good news in this kind of problem is...
 Our revenues will increase because of the inflation. We won't see the increased revenues from the inflationary effects of wages, property values. We won't see those for a couple of years.
 So in this case, it's actually, you know, a positive from our cash and financial position that, you know, whatever happens, we're going to see, you know, we'll see those impacts down the road, and that'll be a positive way on the revenue side. In the more nearer term, you saw our...
 worker account and you saw and we'll see what kind of bids come back when we go out to bid for different projects and services. And that's something we'll have to navigate. I think prices are going to go up, wages are probably going to, if we're going to stay competitive and fill spots, we'll probably have to keep looking at that just as the private sector has been looking.
 Right now, I think we're trying to see the level of the impact that it's going to have on us, and it does feel like...
 GETTING CONTRACTORS TO DO PROJECTS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS, AS WE HAVE ALL THESE PROJECTS THAT WE HOPE TO DO. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A PIECE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME. OUR COMMUNITY INVESTMENT DEPARTMENT IS FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE GET MORE FOR THAT SPECIFIC PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE PIPELINE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE LABOR ISSUES.
 on the contracting side. On the hiring side, as an employer, I mean, that's going to, as we do, you know, some positions are more competitive than others. And, you know, particularly IT and, and or financial services where, you know,
 you know, you can kind of do the same job no matter whether you're in a public service industry or not. You know, those will probably be harder to compete with. We'll have to look at those more closely. Where there's...
 where there's more of a feel of the public service and what you're giving back. That's something that the pandemic has helped in the sense of workers that are leaving a lot of jobs are looking for meaning, are looking for more fulfillment. And so the reward, the more that a job is connected to the reward of being in public service,
 you know, the less issues the money is. But on those positions where it's more, you know, they could be doing roughly the same thing, don't feel, you know, the same level of connection to the public service mission, you know, those are going to be more challenging. And that's something we're really going to have to look at, see how bad this labor shortage for us gets. And we know it's bad broadly. The question is how bad does it get for the city of South Bend?
 THANK YOU. I'LL RESERVE MY OTHER ONE FOR NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COUNCILMAN LEE. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MCBRIDE, AND THANK YOU, MAYOR, FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND JUST BEING ABLE TO SEE THE IMPACT THAT THE DECISIONS THAT YOUR OFFICE AND THE DECISIONS THAT COUNCIL MAKE AND HOW IT'S HELPING SOUTH BENN TO COME THROUGH ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC SITUATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN A GENERATION.
 Can you tell us what kind of impact the innovation grants gave to businesses? And I know that from the ones that I spoke with, but what is your office, what input has your office received from those innovation grants? Yes.
 Well, it's it came. I mean, it's hard to remember because that was almost a little over a year ago now already, believe it or not. But it came at a time that was really critical for I mean, if you remember back then, we had that was our biggest wave of infections over the winter last year.
 The federal aid wasn't, it wasn't obvious that there was going to be help coming from there in addition to what had already come. And so it was, to some, it was just the timing and the critical where they just needed help to make their business make it through that period of time. I know a lot of them have said it was critical and critical.
 and appreciated the city and council and everyone coming forward to make it happen. And we also appreciate all the help getting the word out. You know, what's crazy sometimes is, you know, whether it's programs to assist residents or programs to assist businesses, you know, we have it. We think we're getting the word out. And it's just that sometimes unless you go there and talk to the individual personally,
 IT JUST DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO AN APPLICATION. AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THAT APPLICATION AS EASY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THAT, BUT DO THINK ALL THE EFFORTS TO GET THE WORD OUT, I THINK THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE. OTHERWISE, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOLKS WHO NEEDED IT THAT JUST DIDN'T GET CONNECTED TO IT. JUST THE IMPACT FROM OR INPUT FROM PEOPLE WAS THAT THAT WAS THE EASIEST TRANSACTION TO DO WITH THE CITY.
 And it made an impact. And the other thing is, you know, everyone criticizes tax abatements, but I was just really wanting to make sure that that number is right, is that the 2021 tax abatements spurred, is it $78 million of business and 441 jobs? Yeah, I mean, that's the number. But then the other number of active tax abatements is –
 EVEN MORE STARK. THANK YOU. I WILL NOW TURN TO THE COUNCIL ON LINE. COUNCILWOMAN KAREN WIDE, I'LL START WITH YOU.
 Thank you, President McBrien. Thank you, Mayor, for your presentation. I can't wait to read through the slide presentations. The only question that I have, I do recall in 2020, when we started the budget process, there was a slide that indicated that it will take us into 2023 to reach structural balance. So,
 So where are we at now based on all the information and all the gains, which is very encouraging? When you look at where we are from a financial perspective, is that year 2023 still realistic or are we still going to be somewhat cautious moving forward? Well, that's a great question. I'm trying to think how best to answer this question. Sure.
 The 2022 budget, as you recall, had a budgeted deficit. In the general plus funds, I think it was close to $6 million or so.
 And then the other funds, some of those are capital funds that is, you know, that's a deficit. You want to spend down your capital funds. Added, you know, a large debt on paper, but really is just the spend down of capital funds. But if we just focus on the general operations, general plus funds, we budgeted a $6 million deficit. But we actually budgeted a deficit in 2021 and ended up with more deficit.
 cash at the end of the year than we started, even if you exclude the rescue plan dollars. And so, now, we also talked about how we've been conservatively budgeting for revenue on those property tax increases of the past few years. We weren't always certain that they would continue in the same way for a number of reasons. But now, because we're
 Every time we make a conservative assumption, we get good. We've been getting good news, even in the even in the, you know, even in the worst of the past couple of years where there's an additional. We get an unexpected additional income tax distribution or property tax receipts come in much stronger than than we are anticipating. So we are so we are, you know, so now that we have the six million dollar budgeted deficit for twenty twenty two.
 and we're making more, I mean, I don't know if it's aggressive, but more we're confident that there's a growth trajectory here in our revenue streams, then that means that $6 million deficit is more real than when we were conservatively budgeting for revenue, we ended up with a surplus. So in actuality, we had a surplus last year, even though we had a budget deficit.
 Thank you, Mayor. I really appreciate your response and also the presentation. And we'd like to thank all of the city employees for all the hard work and the time that they have committed, especially during the pandemic. And as you begin to look at where we're at financially, it really took the whole team working together. So very appreciative.
 Clearly, individuals, they love to work with figures and it shows good information. Thank you so much. At this time, I'll turn over to Councilwoman Laurie Hammond. Thank you, President McBride, and thank you, Mayor, for your presentation. It's a wonderful amount of information.
 The only question that I would have, as the Federal Reserve is now toying with the notion of increasing interest rates, I know that that will help to increase our returns on our investments. But I'm also wondering if there is a negative side to that that we would see on any of the bonds or anything along those lines.
 Yeah, that's a great question. And especially when we're considering a number of capital investments that would require bond financing. In an ideal world, we'd have all of the design and pieces together to be able to go out sooner rather than later, knowing that the Fed is likely to increase rates. But I mean, to put this in historic perspective, though,
 even over the course of the next six months to a year, when you're talking about what kind of interest rates, they're still very low historically. So, you know, the difference of, you know, even a one, let's just say it goes up by a percent over, you know, the next 10, 12 months. One percent, it has an impact for sure, but it probably,
 If you want to compare it to the impact of if costs don't start, if the inflation doesn't come down, every moment of delay of a project or anything is going to well out swamp the increase of cost of interest by a percent. So they're not going to impact our existing projects.
 our existing debt that we have, but they could make it, you know, more costly for future financing. But we don't anticipate anything, you know, anything crazy. Then, of course, you know, if interest rates go, you know, skyrocket, then that's something maybe debt is not a good tool for us. So that's something that we need to monitor and see what the rate is and what the project is and does it make sense to use debt financing. Okay.
 Thank you, Mayor. Have a good evening. Thank you, you too. Councilwoman, Vice President Sheila Nisgatsky. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mayor Mueller, for giving us the presentation this evening. A lot of good information, a lot of numbers. Mr. Parker must have been very busy putting everything together as well as yourself, I'm sure. It's all it's all Mr. Parker. Yeah. Yeah.
 As Councilwoman White had alluded to or spoke to, what a challenging year it's been the last couple years. So I really don't have a question other than to say it has been very challenging. I know it's been challenging for all of the city employees that work for the city, especially our firefighters and police officers, as well as the council. You know, when we all came on here, we was only started for a couple months and then we're in a pandemic.
 So the city finances, it looks like the decisions that were made has kept us very solvent and strong to help have us a strong community. The lighting, I'm very glad to happy to see that lighting. And I'll be interested moving forward once they do all the replacements, what that looks like as far as identifying the other areas in town that
 that could use that lining especially as a means of helping to tour crime and that type of thing and perhaps working with our law enforcement they work all over the city I'm sure they have a good idea and the housing affordable housing so key so just a couple observations from my end and I really thank you for your presentation and for mr. Parker's hard work thank you so much and I
 Councilman Wax kind of touched on my question and you answered it. It was talking more about the closing the gap about the economic recovery. So I know that you guys have plans for that. And so I'm looking forward to hearing that in the future. With that, I will ask if the council have any additional comments before we move on.
 Councilwoman Tomas-Morgan. Thank you, President McBride. Thanks for circling back. I did have a question as you were speaking, Mayor, that came back to me. And that kind of setting aside the financials, although your answer may include it, I was wondering what efforts there are to –
 to brief, evaluate, and pull lessons learned from emergency response during the pandemic with the county, with the COVID response team in order to help us for future disasters and plan forward. Are there any conversations or efforts underway? Well, there are,
 There are a lot of things that we've learned and some that, unfortunately, the pandemic has divided our ability to respond. So there's the response itself. I mean, I think there are a lot of lessons learned there, and the county is working with cities and others to tune up that response.
 that machinery for potentially other disasters. So that's a big piece, whether it's our emergency management agency in the county or our health department or just the other units of government that need to come together in emergencies. So that's one we did...
 IT WAS A GOOD CRASH COURSE IN HOW THOSE ENTITIES COME TOGETHER AND ARE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THROUGH AN EMERGENCY. THERE'S THAT. THEN THERE'S ALSO, I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER RESPONSES AND MAYBE EVEN SOME OF THE ECONOMIC RESPONSES. I KNOW OUR INNOVATION TEAM HAS BEEN TRYING TO TRACK AS BEST WE CAN, YOU KNOW, OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.
 I think, and again, this is not quantitative, but if you talk to our...
 Our downtowns got hit pretty hard by the pandemic, downtowns across the country. But if you talk to our downtown business owners, you know, it's not, no one's happy about what's, you know, the economy getting hit and all these things. But I think they would agree that we've weathered the storm about as well as anyone across the country. And we did take, you know, it's,
 We took the public health emergency seriously here, but we also made sure that we were able to do things as we could. And so I think those were important lessons to learn. And how do you balance? How do you balance things that are sometimes in contradiction as you go? I don't know that there, you know, there's some things that are hard to, you know, there were playbooks for pandemics.
 And we took some of those, but some of them, it's not obvious of what was the right decision. I think along the way, a lot of these were impossible decisions. And in my view, it's unfortunate a lot of the impossible decisions got punted to local health officers to a large extent. And I don't know if that was necessarily the fairest way to...
 approach management of a global pandemic, but that's how it turned out. You know, you would hope for a little more of a coordinated response at higher levels, but by and large, you know, a lot of good, you know, there's a lot of positive things that came through in our response and hopefully we'll be able to respond to the next one just as well, or if not better. Thank you, Mayor.
 Councilman Lee. Yes, I just my final comments is this. I think a lot of times we allow we we don't give ourselves the the benefit of the doubt or the credit for making it through one of the toughest times in in our country's history. So for us to go through a pandemic first time mayor, new council members and be able to stand here today and say we have a surplus of
 when it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be. It says a lot. It says a lot to all of the many people who have worked in our community to keep it going. And I just believe in us operating as a team and celebrating the fact that it took all of us working together and all of the city employees working together to put South Bend in this position. And I just want to say that
 you know, it should be, you all should be commended on the work and the effort to keep our city from going under and we can actually look and see that things are getting better. So I just want to say, I appreciate that. And I appreciate everyone who's had to work on the council and the administration and throughout our city to get us to this point. And if we continue to work as a team and work together, we can do it.
 There's so many other great things that's going to happen for our city, so I'm optimistic. Thank you. Finally, I echo that. I remember sitting here and was talking about the fiscal cliff, and it turned out to be a fiscal curve, and that took a lot of intentional planning and strategic planning, and I, too, there are unprecedented dollars that
 has come and then continued to come into our community and still going through all of this and maintaining order and to still provide services to our citizens is unfounded. So I, again, thank you for that. All right. Well, thank you. And, you know, I think you've heard me say it in other contexts that, you know, we've made it through. Like I said, the emergency is coming to an end. We've made it through a public health emergency.
 We've made it through the economic emergency. Now, you know, we have other issues, but we've made it through that initial emergency. But the social emergency is going to continue on, and we're going to have to work through that for some time to come. Unfortunately, you know, the public health, there's, you know, science, and there's different pieces that are kind of clear of what to do, what not to do. It's very tangible. You know, eventually you get a vaccine that works.
 The economics, it's a good field. People know how to, we've had recessions in the past, you know, figured out how to boost the economy through tough times. But social emergency, these are things that have been tough for us to tackle.
 in the best of times and certainly the last couple years have been difficult for a lot of people. And that's going to, we're going to have to continue to be all hands on deck to tackle those challenges together. But I thank you all and if that's it. I think, Mayor, lastly, I'm sorry I forgot to say, I'm glad to see that we had the mental health piece up there in the partnership with the county.
 because you're talking about a lot of people during this time that suffered mental health issues and trauma and grief even just being closed up in
 during a pandemic or have lost their jobs or loved ones. So to see that the city is in partnership, because there's a lot of things that I think that administration with the council and the community can work together to try to reach some of those people to tap into mental health resources and to get them counseling or help or having similar
 seminars for the public. Those are things that I would hope that we could do to reach out to the ones who are still going through pain. Because I know even with ourselves, we get cabin fever and caught up in this time that has happened because it has affected all of us. So I'm just glad to see that that was on there. Thank you again. Thank you. Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Thank you. All right.
 We will move right on. At this time, I would like to entertain a motion to rise to the Committee of the Whole. Second. It has been moved and seconded. Clerk Jones, could you take the roll? Yes. Council Member Lee. Aye. Council Member Warner. Aye. Council Member Wax. Aye. Council Member White. Aye. And I did have my hand up for a question, but I'll wait until after the roll call. Thank you. Council Member...

Yes, I was just wanting to say that we do have our youth council members on board, and they are high school students, and I don't know how long we would want them to remain.

 All right, with that being said, I'll turn it over to you. All right, the Committee of the Whole is now in session. This is the portion of the Council's meeting where bills are given a second reading and public hearing. I wish to share with you that bills that will be given a second reading and public hearing have been given a first reading and set for a committee meeting and public hearing prior to this evening's meeting. In addition, you will hear from the chairperson of the committee,
 where the bill was discussed and the results of their discussion. If the proposed ordinance is a zoning ordinance, a report from a staff member will be given. In all other situations, the formal presentation of the proposed ordinance will immediately follow the committee report. The formal presentation shall be untimed. We had on the docket Bill 132-21, and it has been tabled indefinitely.
 So we're going to move on to the next one. Is that correct? Correct. All right. Bill 103-22. Clerk Jones, will you please give Bill 03-22 a second reading?
 0-3-22, public hearing on an ordinance of the Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, approving a petition of the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals for the property located at 1701 Kendall Street, Councilmanic District No. 6 in the City of South Bend, Indiana. Is there a committee report? Yes, Chair. This bill came before the Zoning and Annexation Committee earlier this afternoon.
 And it comes to the committee as a whole with a favorable recommendation. Is the petitioner present? And I ask that you state your name and address and share with us key points regarding the bill that is before us. Yes, thank you. Yeah. Joseph Molnar, Zoning Specialist, offices on the 14th floor of the county city building. Could you please speak up, Mr. Molnar? Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.
 Joseph Molnar, offices on the 14th floor of the County City Building. I know most of you saw this earlier today, so I'll try to be brief. This is for a special exception to allow for a duplex at 1701 Kendall Street on a vacant lot about a block north of Our Lady of Hungary School.
 Here is the population trend for the neighborhood over the past 50 or 60 years. It's been relatively flat with a slight decrease and down about 20% since 1970, which has left some vacant lots, unfortunately, including this one here, which is the lot in question today. The house that was on this lot was demolished in 2006. Here is another view of the lot.
 And this is a potential site plan submitted by the petitioner. They're looking to do the duplex, but keep the zoning U1, Urban Neighborhood 1. It was the opinion of the staff that the proposed construction of the two-unit dwelling will further complement the existing housing stock in the surrounding area and fit into the existing setting.
 as long as as well as reactivating a vacant lot and providing needed housing to the Rum Village neighborhood. The staff had a favorable recommendation to the Board of Zoning Appeals and the Board of Zoning Appeals is sending it to you as well with a favorable recommendation, and I know the petitioner, David, is on the line as well. Be happy to answer any questions. Petitioner, would you please state your name and address and share with us? Yes, hello, can you hear me? Yes.
 Okay, yes, my name is David Njeroghe. My address is 3131 Springbrook Drive, South Bend, Indiana. Yes, I think the summary you've heard is accurate. We're looking to put, you know, possibly a duplex in that corner.
 we are looking at the design to make sure it works well with the with the area so yes I think uh I think it would be a good addition and I think once we have a good design then we'll decide whether to stick with a duplex or just do a single unit thank you
 All right, thank you. Council members, do you have any questions of the petitioners? Nobody? Any of our council members that's virtual? No hands. No hands, all right. At this time, we'll go to the public hearing portion. Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak in favor of Bill 03-22? Okay, I have Jason Bonicki. Jason, if you would unmute yourself, state your name and your address for the record, please.
 Uh, Jason Benicki, 3822, uh, Ford street, just similar to the property over on Ford street, just a few, about a month ago or so. Um, I'm a big proponent of these duplex type housings in urban neighborhoods. And I guess I do have one question about this process. Cause I'm just, I had pulled up the, uh, updated, uh, zoning ordinance.
 And I'm reading in section 22-303.03, and it shows that duplexes are permitted building type in urban one neighborhoods. So I was just wondering why we're – this is the second time we've had to do a special exception for those when they're permitted uses. But otherwise, love this kind of addition to these neighborhoods. I think they add character. I hope they – believe they help keep housing costs down and just provide neat uses for – good uses for empty lots. Yeah.
 All right, petitioner, would you like to respond to that? Yeah, I'm happy to answer that for Jason. He's right. So the zoning ordinance is kind of split up in two different ways that you can build on your property. So under U1, duplex is an allowed building type. But in order to have the use of a two-unit multi-dwelling, you do need to go through the special exception process. We do split up duplex.
 into both building types which have their own then transparency rules and so forth and then the use itself so it's a little complicated we are though as Council uh during the zna committee meeting about a week ago we we are uh starting discussions on on maybe allowing uh the duplexes and u1 by right so they won't have to go through this process and that's uh that's a conversation we're looking forward to expanding with Council as the year goes on okay
 Clerk Jones, is there anyone wishing to speak in opposition? I don't see anyone in the audience that is expressing interest to speak in opposition of Bill 322. I thought I saw someone type in the chat to speak in favor. Actually, it's Mr. Kane Kantorjewski, but I believe he wants to speak on 2203. I don't think it was Kane. I thought it was a female. I saw it.
 YES. OKAY. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO CLERK JONES, YOU SAID THERE WAS NO ONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION? NO, THERE ISN'T. AT THIS POINT, THE PUBLIC HEARING ON BILL 03-22 IS NOW CLOSED. COUNCIL MEMBERS, DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING BILL 03-22? IS THERE ANY COUNCIL MEMBERS ONLINE?
 Vice President Niesgowski. Thank you, Councilman Lee. Yeah, I just wanted to thank the builder for investing in the 6th District, bringing new housing to the area that also really complements the neighborhood plan that we just haven't quite all finalized. But I can tell you through the discussions we've had, this really fits in with the neighborhood plan there.
 So just really excited about this project and bringing new homes to the 6th District. So thank you very much. Anyone else? President White has her hand up. Okay. Councilwoman White. I would like to thank the developer for his commitment.
 to not only our city but the 6th district. If I heard correctly, this lot has been vacant and since 2006 and we know that it's very as we begin to look at our neighborhoods and from a housing perspective, economic perspective that as we look at our vacant lots, they do
 great opportunities for us for infield. So I just want to thank him and look forward to the project as it moves forward. Thank you very much. And I would just like to say that it is important to acknowledge the fact that we have a piece of land that has been vacant, and now it's going to be an opportunity for two families and a duplex to live and share in that neighborhood. And that's important as we're looking to
 address the issue of affordable housing. So, well, I will now entertain a motion regarding Bill 103-22. I move for passage. Second. Clerk Jones, please call the roll. Yes. No, I don't. I'm sorry.
 0-322. We have to have it sent to the full council with the recommendation. Move to send to the full council with the favorable recommendation. Second. All right. It's Valentine's night. Everybody's on it. It's been the motion and then second. Clerk Jones, will you call the roll? Yes. Council Member Warner.
 Aye. Councilmember Wax. Aye. Councilmember White. Aye. Councilmember Tomas Morgan. Aye. Councilmember Hammond. Aye. Vice President Nieskoski. Aye. Councilmember Lee. Aye. President McBride. Aye. Eight ayes. All right. Bill 03-22 will be sent to the full council with a favorable recommendation.
 Next bill is Bill 06-22. Clerk Jones, would you please give Bill 06-22 a second reading? Yes.
 06-22, public hearing on an ordinance of the Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, amending ordinance number 10817-21, which fixes maximum salaries and wages of appointed officers and non-bargaining employees of the City of South Bend, Indiana.
 for calendar year 2022 to establish two new full-time positions and amend various titles and salaries of existing full-time positions. Is there a committee report? Yes, there is, Chair. That was in Personnel and Finance Committee today, and it was given a favorable recommendation to the Committee of the Whole.
 Is the petitioner present? And I ask that you state your name and address and share with us key points regarding this bill that's before us.
 Yes, thank you, Chair. Dan Parker, City Controller. My office is on the 12th floor of the County City Building. I am going to run through a short presentation. I think council members, most council members, have now seen this presentation twice, so this will be the third time. So it'll be very, very brief, but for the public and anybody else who's present, I will just highlight what this Bill 622 does.
 Bill 622 is a proposed amendment to the 2022 non-bargaining salary ordinance. And in summary of what the bill and the adjustments that it makes, the all proposed position titles and salary amounts that are proposed in this bill were contained in the originally filed non-bargaining salary ordinance back in August or September of 2021, with one exception, which is a proposed increase for the chief innovation officer.
 to mirror a proposed increase for the executive director of community investment that we'll talk about in just a second. All proposed changes relate to existing operations and serve the goal of good government. So this is in contrast to some of the proposed
 proposed positions that were in the initially filed salary ordinance back in the fall of 2021, which related to the positions that related to the implementation of ARP programs, all of the proposed salary changes, title changes, and new positions in this salary ordinance relate to just our existing operations and
 serving the public in the ways that we already do, making sure that we're able to retain and recruit employees into positions that are already in existence. The really important thing about this bill is that all of the changes in this bill are already included in the past 2022 budget. So no budget amendments are required for this bill. And in terms of the changes specifically present in this bill, there are two proposed new positions
 that don't exist currently in the 2022 salary ordinance, and then 19 adjustments to existing positions, new titles or salary adjustments. For those 19 positions, the reasoning behind those 19 changes that we made
 as opposed to looking at any of the other 420 or so non-bargaining positions that we have in the city. We really looked for these specific positions as equity retention and recruitment concerns, so making sure that we were staying competitive both
 in the free market as competitive as we can be, as well as being equitable with positions within the government. And then also there's a number of positions that went through a consolidation or reorganization of responsibilities over the past year. And we would like to update the titles and the salaries to reflect the new responsibilities of those positions.
 On the new position side, there are two new positions. The first one is the Deputy Director of Community Investment. The 2022 salary cap for this position would be $103,691. All of the numbers in here are salary caps, not actual salaries, so that's important to note. This is the maximum amount that this that this position would be eligible for. The position would assist in the management and strategic leadership of the Department of Community Investment and really help expand the reach of that executive director to address
 What again and again during the budget hearings and during the budget cycle come up, and we heard from the mayor earlier today, come up as the most important or some of the most important things that we work on in the community, affordable housing, small business support, economic development, those kinds of things.
 And really important from the administration's perspective is that this establishment really mimics a leadership model that's proven effective. So almost every other city department, really every other city department has this leadership model where there's a department head and then a deputy to expand the reach of that department head and to assist in the strategic leadership of the department department.
 And it's proven to work and it works well. And so this would be essentially just continuing that proven track record into the Department of Community Investment.
 The second new position in this proposed bill is a neighborhood grant specialist with the 2022 salary cap of $53,341. This is really all around grant management. So the Department of Community Investment receives a multitude of federal state and local grants, and then there's also new opportunities that we're expecting to come at both the federal and the state levels. The mayor talked about the really historic amount of funding that we're expecting to get from the federal and the
 funding that's available and that we expect to continue to become available over the next number of years. And so this position would really focus on researching, identifying, and applying for that new funding and making sure that we are able to bring those dollars into the city and have a centralized place and source
 for coordinating that research and application process. Once the applications have been submitted and if we were awarded the funding, it would also be technical assistance to departments as well as associated organizations that we work with to administer the grants and get the money out into the community. And then also working on compliance monitoring and reporting for those grants.
 So those are the two new positions in terms of the revised positions. There are 19 of them and again I will go quickly through them because we did talk about them in committee earlier today supervisor accounts payable. This is essentially bringing that position up to roughly.
 close to, not quite at, but close to where we've seen the 20th percentile of similar positions out in the marketplace. So this CFS 20th percentile is referencing a report from Creative Financial Staffing that they put out every year that looks at the salaries and salary positions in the marketplace for financial and IT positions.
 And it's geographically adjusted to our geography. So this is in our area. This is 55, 625 for this AP manager position is what their report suggests is the 20th percentile of earnings. That means that 80% of people in that position earn more than that amount.
 And so really, again, we're not trying to be competitive with the private sector, but we are trying to get close to that 20th percentile number so that we can at least be in the ballpark of what people would expect to see in these types of positions for retention and recruitment.
 In the fire department, there's a prevented maintenance coordinator two position, which is essentially not only to allow for some growth in that position, which is currently a coordinator one and allow for an expansion of responsibilities, but also get us a little bit closer to where we see other maintenance positions in the city in the upper 40s, low 50s range.
 And then in venues, parks and arts, there's a proposed increase for the director of facilities and grounds to 84,000. This is really looking at the other division director salaries in the city. When I say division director, I mean one level below department head, so leading large, large divisions.
 very important operations for the city. The average division director salary is 82,261. So the director of facilities and grounds is a little bit low there. And this is also a very large department and a very critical one that takes care of all the parks throughout the city. And so just trying to establish some equity there.
 uh in innovation and technology there's three proposed changes chief innovation officer is to bring that salary up to be a little bit more commensurate with other department heads so you can see other department heads are in the 120 to 130 range and so the the increase in both the chief innovations officer and you'll see in a second in the executive director of community investment is really to make sure we're able to recruit and retain the top talent at those higher level positions and make sure that there's equity among department heads
 For the other IT positions, again, going back to that creative financial staffing report on the manager of applications position as well as on the applications developer positions, these increases help, but they really don't even get us the same amount of
 don't even get us to the 20th percentile of the CFS report. These are very in-demand positions, and it's very difficult to get even people to even look at these positions at the salary levels that they're at right now, let alone want to apply and come join the city. Again, we're not trying to be competitive with the department.
 with the private sector, obviously, because these are not getting us towards the midpoint by any stretch, but at least get us to a point where we're in the ballpark of what people are looking for from a salary perspective.
 And then on the Department of Community Investment, again, same thing as I mentioned earlier in the Executive Director, getting that position a little bit closer to where other department heads are. And then for the two project managers, just making their position salaries equal to what the citywide project manager title is, which is a title that we use in a variety of different areas. Okay.
 On the other side of the equation, the consolidation and reorganization of responsibilities, admin and finance went through a reorganization over the past year where we actually had a net decrease of one FTE and saved money overall, but with that came differing responsibilities for especially our division director level. And so we wanted to really make sure that those new responsibilities and new positions scopes were aligned with salaries
 And so that's the reasoning for the proposed changes on the admin and finance side. On the Department of Community Investment, this is simply a flip from the chief planner statement
 salary cap to the building commissioner salary cap. That's to reflect a new organizational structure where the building commissioner actually reports up to the chief planner, and therefore their salaries should reflect that responsibility shift. And then lastly, on the public works side in water,
 This is the shift of an existing system specialist position into a more expansive role for cross connection and water loss and asking for a slight increase in the salary there to reflect that expansion of responsibilities. So that's what's in the bill, but I'm certainly happy to answer any questions that council members have. Council members, do you have any questions of the petitioner? No. Okay. All right.
 At this time, we'll go to the public hearing portion. Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak in favor of Bill 06-22? I don't see anyone from the public wishing to speak in favor of this bill.
 Is there anyone present wishing to speak in opposition? There is one person present wishing to speak in opposition. Her name is Allison Mindsburger. Allison, if you would unmute yourself and state your name and your address for the record, please. Thank you. My name is Allison Mindsburg and I live at 2633 Arrowhead Drive.
 I have a couple concerns with the bill. One is that the listing of staff that is provided is not up to date. It includes positions that no longer exist, and it includes I think it's actually missing some positions that are currently filled at the city. As to the pay itself, there are many soft skill positions at the city that do not have private sector equivalents and are currently being compensated in the city at levels higher than are typical for civil service.
 Some of these are compensated at higher levels than hard science or tech positions requiring similar or greater education and or experience. For instance, the sustainability director, I believe, is compensated or has a maximum compensation in the 70,000 range. And yet we know that IT is, as Mr. Parker mentioned, not compensated anywhere near the 20 percentile for pay. And those positions are hard to maintain, recruit and manage.
 It's also obviously important that those stay filled. There's also concerns I have that a very large differential between management and staff responsible for implementing those changes that management identifies can reduce employee satisfaction, particularly when management communicates poorly with general employees.
 For example, code enforcement has recently lost additional employees, and I hope that council will look at what the culture might be that's contributing to that beyond just wages. IT is also substantially raising director salaries, too.
 to make things more equitable, but not putting similar dollar amounts into the positions that actually do the work to help departments with their IT needs. I think that as Mr. Parker mentioned, it is critical to bring those IT positions up. And I question why those are not being brought up and instead those dollar amounts are being devoted to raising the salary cap for the director. Why not focus first on the compensation for critical hands-on staff,
 reduce turnover for those key positions, and help stabilize the ability of the city to do its job, keep its inventories, and have its Excel spreadsheets up to date, and the ability for city residents to get on to a council meeting on their first attempt instead of their eighth. Thank you. Mr. Parker, would you care to respond? Yes, absolutely. So to the very first comment, the attack, the
 presentation that I went through was simply a summary of the changes in the salary ordinance. The attachment to the bill itself is the most up-to-date position listing, and it reflects what council passed during the 2022 budget process with just these changes included. So, I'm not sure what the concern was there, but that is the most up-to-date version of that. If I may interrupt, point of order.
 Your time is exhausted and for the petitioner to respond. Thank you. In terms of the concerns with IT positions and wanting to make sure that we're remaining competitive with those, I couldn't agree more. And so we actually do look to try to see which of the positions that we have, particularly in information technology, but really across the board,
 need to be more competitive in terms of wages. And there's a lot of data that goes into that. The CFS report that I mentioned is one piece of that. How difficult it is to recruit when positions come open is another piece of that. So there's a lot of different analyses that go into the proposals for increases.
 One of the driving forces behind bringing this bill before council is to address the very concern that you mentioned or that Ms. Feinsberg mentioned. So that I do agree with that, that we need to make sure that we're compensating the individuals in all departments, especially the competitive departments where it's difficult to recruit like IT appropriately. Okay.
 AT THIS POINT THE PUBLIC HEARING ON BILL 06-22 IS NOW CLOSED COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING BILL 06-22 COUNCILMAN WAX THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO UH THANK MR PARKER FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I JUST WANTED TO UM EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW THE
 SALARY ORDINANCE DIDN'T GO EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WANTED IN BUDGET SEASON LAST YEAR. AND AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I APPRECIATED THAT THEY TOOK A FRESH LOOK AT IT AND CAME BACK WITH PRIORITIES IN THAT RATHER THAN TRYING TO STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. SO I APPRECIATE THE COMING TOGETHER TO HOPEFULLY FIND AN AREA THAT WE THAT EVERYBODY AGREES ON. SO THANK YOU. VICE PRESIDENT NISGOWSKI?
 Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to thank Mr. Parker for the presentation, the third time, bringing it before the council, and actually revisiting it, meeting some of the questions that were had by the council, as Councilman Eli spoke of.
 And in reference to recruitment and retainment, bringing pay equity to these positions. So I just want to let you know I'm really in support of the bill. I want to thank you for taking the time to really think it through, comb over everything, and then bring it back before the council. So thank you so much. Any other statements from council members?

 60 million in new construction of greenhouses and also 118 million in equipment. The project also will create approximately 110 jobs. DCI staff
 reviewed and recommended a tax abatement for real property for nine years and five years for personal property. And as Paul Mastronati just presented himself. So, Paul, if you have anything to add, any additional information about the project, please feel free to add it.
 yeah no it uh yeah i know we're excited to potentially uh develop uh and construct the greenhouse down here in south bend and this is one of the the criterias will help make the project successful down there uh so we're looking for the approval on this
 Thank you so much. And I want to clarify, Angelina, thank you so much. You're with the Department of Community Investment. So for the record, I misspoke and said ZNA, and I knew that. So thank you so much. Yeah, sure. At this time, I would ask for public comments. It will be open up to the point of order. I'm sorry.
 Just questions from the council first. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Thank you, Attorney Palmer. I would like to see if there are any questions from the council regarding Resolution 2203 and or Resolution 2207. Councilman Warner? Yes.
 Yeah, it doesn't appear, Ms. Bilo, that any of the numbers or commitments have changed from when we heard this two weeks ago. Is that correct? Yes. Nothing changes in our recommendation with regard to tax abatement, tax abatement scheduled, and all other terms. So everything remains the same. Thank you.
 Yes, President McBride. Ms. Bilo, could you just clarify for us, as you did in committee this afternoon, the clarification of the relationship between Gem Farms and Red Sun Farm? Well, yes. Petitioner provided a letter providing some with some clarifications on the org structure and all.
 Gem Farms South Bend will conduct or will have a business here in South Bend, and they don't have any relationships with Red Suns, which is a Canadian entity.
 This is just clarifying. This is Santiago Garza, Executive Director of the Department of Community Investment with offices in the 14th floor of the City-County building. As we mentioned during the committee, and just reemphasizing what Angelina is saying, there is a relationship between Gem Farms and Red Sun Farms. In the case of this project, Red Sun Farms is not involved in the project.
 And Paul issued an apology about the confusion and then they resubmitted with making sure that the references to Red Sun were not there. But as we mentioned during the committee, there is no impact on the analysis on the construction. And as we mentioned during the committee as well, the tax abatement is an incentive that by virtue of how it works,
 there is no benefit provided to the recipient unless they construct what they have agreed to. So again, it has some inherent safety mechanisms that allay our concerns and based on the information that Paul presented that we feel that nothing has changed substantially and we recommend the tax abatement. Thank you. Thank you. Any other council? We see any hands in the chat from council.
 I don't see any hands in the chat. Thank you. I will turn it over to the public portion. Clerk Jones, do you see anyone wishing to speak in favor of Bill 22-03 or 22-07? Yes, we have two speakers, the first being Kane Kantorjewski and the second being Jeff Ray. Mr. Kantorjewski, if you could unmute yourself and state your name and address for the record,
 Hi, Kane, Kane Jaszewski, 514 West LaSalle. And I just wanted to speak up and say that I really hope you guys approve all the three of these resolutions, actually. I've worked on the South Olive stretch there where these projects can be located, and I think it would be phenomenal for the area. So, yeah, anything we could do as a city to support this would be phenomenal. Thank you. Thank you for your comment. Mr. Ray? Thank you.
 Hi, good evening. Jeff Ray, President and CEO of Southland Regional Chamber with offices at 101 North Michigan Street in downtown South Bend. Just here to voice approval really of proposed bills 2203, 2207, 2205, and 2209 related to GEM and Greenleaf Holdco.
 Generally, I feel like these are phenomenal projects. The Mastro Nardi name in this case is well known in the produce industry, have built a strong reputation in Canada and in the US in the projects they've done. The staff, I think, has done a great job and due diligence in understanding this.
 is one of the largest single investments in the community in quite some time. We think it's great. It puts South Bend on the map. It's a great generator of new jobs and capital investment, and we think could be a real catalyst to other activity here. No tax abatements aren't always easy to consider, but I think that the recommendations here are prudent and urge your support of those four bills as you're considering those tonight.
 Thank you so much. Clerk Jones, do you see anyone in the chat wishing to speak in opposition? No, I don't see anyone wishing to speak in opposition of this. Thank you. At this time, the public portion is now closed. Counsel, final comments on Bill 2203 or 2207? President McBride, do you wish for a committee report at any time? Or would you like me to include that in my comments?
 You can add it now. Okay. Yes. Great. President McBride, both these bills came, were heard in community investment this afternoon and were sent to council with a favorable recommendation. Additionally, I just want to share, I couldn't be more excited about both these projects, GEM Farm and the expansion at Pure Green Farm, Green Leaf.
 South Bend was home to innovation with the Studebaker plant, and it's exciting to think that, again, South Bend could land
 this gem farm project and the expansion with green leaf and look to grow lettuce and tomatoes and strawberries 12 months of the year, who would have thought decades ago that that would be the case in South Bend, Indiana. Thank you so much. And thank you for having my back on your committee report.
 I appreciate that. At this time, I would like to entertain a motion for... You have another hand? Vice President Naskowski. Oh, Vice President Naskowski. I didn't see you there. Thank you.
 THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MCBRIDE. YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT, BEING THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE FOR THIS PROJECT AND HOW MEANINGFUL IT REALLY IS TO NOT ONLY THE WHOLE CITY OF SOUTH BENN IN THE MIDWEST, BUT SPECIFICALLY THE SIXTH DISTRICT. IT'S CREATING A NEW INDUSTRY, AS WE SAID, NEW JOBS, $240 MILLION OF INVESTMENT IS VERY, IT'S JUST AMAZING.
 And for us to be able to have any type of input in generating economic development for this project, to me, it's almost, to me, it's once in a lifetime. I don't know, I'm going to see another $240 million dumped into the 6th District. And I say dumped because we could be the salad bowl of the Midwest forever.
 But I would like to thank Mr. Paul Mastronardi for selecting our city, this location, and for his substantial, hopefully his substantial investment in moving the project forward. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Nizgatsky and 6th District Representative. We need separate motions, correct? Uh-huh. Councilman Lee. Thank you.
 I just want to echo what Councilwoman Naskowski said. This is exciting. South Bend was the place of Studebaker Singer Sewing Machine, the South Bend Stove Company. The city used to make stuff, and so for us to be in this position, to be able to bring such great technology and innovation to our city, this is a very exciting moment. And...
 I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN DO A LETTUCE JOKE, BUT I GUESS I WILL. LET US SEE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN IN THE 6TH DISTRICT AND IN THE CITY OF SOUTH DEN. LET US ALL... ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO. YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER. THANK YOU, COUNCILMENT LEAD.
 That's great. At this time, I would like to entertain a motion for Resolution 2203. I move for passes of Resolution 2203. I second. It has been moved and seconded.

 President McBride. Aye. Eight ayes. Is there a committee report? There is, President McBride. Both bills 2205 and 2209 were heard in Community Investment Committee this afternoon and comes to council with a favorable recommendation. Thank you. Clerk Jones, could you read 2205, please?
 2205, A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BENN, INDIANA, CONFIRMING THE ADOPTION OF A DECLARATORY RESOLUTION DESIGNATING CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN THE CITY OF SOUTH BENN, INDIANA, COMMONLY KNOWN AS 3820 WEST CALVERT STREET, SOUTH BENN, 46613, AS AN ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AREA FOR PURPOSES OF A NINE-YEAR REAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT FOR GREEN LEAF HOLE COMPANY.
 Thank you. Clerk Jones, could you also read Bill 22-09?
 2209, a resolution of the Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, confirming the adoption of a Declaratory Resolution designating certain areas within the City of South Bend, Indiana, commonly known as 3820 West Calvert Street, South Bend, Indiana, as an economic revitalization area for purposes of a five-year personal property tax abatement for Green Leaf Whole Company.
 Thank you. Is the petitioner present? Yes, this is Joe McGuire, 3820 West Calvert Street. I am the CEO of Greenleaf Holco. Thank you. And the sponsor, Ms. Biller. Yes, Angelina Biller.
 director of business development of 14th floor uh county building uh this project it's a addition to the existing facility located at culver street uh
 company, a petitioner, Greenleaf Holter, proposing to invest additional 12 million for building new greenhouses and also purchasing and installing new equipment. The total private investment for purchasing equipment is about 68 million.
 In addition to 25 existing jobs, the company is planning to hire about 75 additional jobs. DCI staff reviewed our petition and recommended nine years for real property tax abatement and five years for personal property tax abatement. And we do believe that this project
 upon completion will be a great example of economic recovery. And also it would add diversity to our economy here in South Bend. And as the petitioner stated, you know, he is here on a call. You know, Joe, please feel free to add any additional information about the project that we are presenting tonight.
 Sure. Yeah, so we're currently operating on three and a half acres and we're at about 50% capacity producing extremely beautiful lettuce. I've been working in this industry for 32 years and I've never seen such beautiful lettuce. And so we remain very confident. I couldn't resist.
 This is the future. It's innovation in how we can grow and provide local food supply and not just food supply, but very healthy food supply.
 and give an alternative to the legacy supply chains from California, Arizona, and Mexico. And the market is definitely indicating that, and the investment dollars are starting to follow suit.
 And so, yes, we're very excited about being here in South Bend. Like I said, we're already up and operating. Product is in retails, especially Martin's and Kroger around here. And we're having good success. And so we look forward to expanding. Thank you so much. At this time, I will turn to counsel if you have any questions. So it's going to end up bringing in 100 jobs total and another $80 million in investment
 THAT'S AWESOME. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU. ANY OF OUR COUNTS ONLINE WITH THEIR HANDS UP? AT THIS TIME, AS PUBLIC COMMENTS, CLERK JONES, DO YOU SEE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR? I DON'T SEE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL, OF THIS RESOLUTION. 2205 OR 2209? NO. IS THERE ANYONE?
 SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF 2205 OR 2209. THERE IS NO ONE EXPRESSING INTEREST TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL TURN BACK TO COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS.
 Councilman Warner. Yeah, my comment, Joe, I've been out there for a tour twice and Joe is a great ambassador for the produce industry. This is very exciting between these two projects that right here in South Bend on the west side in that field we could become the supplier of produce for the Midwest.
 And, you know, he's already producing 2 million pounds a year of lettuce. I buy a container at Martin's every week. Everybody should. It's beautiful, as Joe said. And Mr. Ray, if you're still on, Joe is a great ambassador for what he does and for the community. He has a strong...
 you know a passion and wants to do this here in our community and uh i feel honored that we have this opportunity to be able to support him with this little bit of incentive it's exciting thank
 Thank you so much. Councilwoman Tomas Morgan. I couldn't agree more with Councilman Troy Warner. Mr. McGuire, I also want to add, you gained the vote of our family. I have a husband and a son who don't care for salad and lettuce, quite honestly. But a couple of weeks ago when I told them, when I asked if they'd have a salad, and they both said no, thanks, Mom, and...
 And I said, well, I have pure grain farm lettuce. And my son Benjamin said, oh, I'll have that. So that is the only lettuce I'll be buying from now on. Thank you. Councilman Wax. Thank you. And I'll also refrain from any puns, but I just want to thank the petitioners for their
 ONGOING INVESTMENT, PREVIOUS INVESTMENT, CONTINUING INVESTMENT. I ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. FASCINATING, REALLY EXCITING. AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAMPLE THE PRODUCT AND CAN AFFIRM THAT AS WELL. SO I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND WANT TO WISH YOU ALL THE BEST OF LUCK GOING FORWARD AND SUCCESS. IS THERE ANYONE FROM COUNCIL ON THE VIRTUAL THAT WOULD WISH TO SPEAK?
 I would, President McBride. Yes, ma'am. Yep, thank you. I would just like to echo everything that my fellow council members would have said and how excited that I am about this project. Fresh produce grown locally can be sourced locally, buy local, shop local, and the amount of jobs that it's going to create and the new industry, right?
 And Mr. McGuire is a wonderful advocate and representative for the lettuce in the area. And to think they're going to possibly grow strawberries and tomatoes and just expanding the hydroponic farming, it's just exciting. So I just...
 I would like to give my sincere thank you for investing in our community and again for investing in the West Side of South Bend. Thank you so much. Thank you, President McBride. This is just for Councilman Lee and Councilman Wax. Let us prepare to vote. I'm a horrible joker.

Clerk Jones, is there anyone from the public wishing to speak for the privilege of the floor? Yes, there is. We have Sharon Bonicki.
 Sharon, if you would unmute yourself and state your name and your address for the record, please. Sharon Benicki, 3822 Ford Street. My concern is mostly aimed at Karen. I believe we were the recipient of lights down Chicago and Illinois and light up the streets. Chicago, I went out there one night. It was wonderful. It was so lit up. But it only lasted one night. And then all the lights went out.
 who do we contact to get those lights back working? And they didn't put one right close to the corner of Chicago and Ford, and I kind of understand it. Unfortunately, that leaves a very dark spot on the street, and that just so happens to be where all our drug dealers like to go and do their drug deals. So I don't know if there's a way to get one more light.
 There, I mean, there is one right on the corner of Chicago and Ford, but it's aimed on Ford Street. So Chicago's dark. Does that conclude your question, Ms. Benicki? Yes. Okay, thank you. We will make sure that we get a response to you. All right, thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else, Clerk Jones? No, that exhausts the list. Thank you. With that, I call this meeting adjourned. Thank you. Thank you.
 and i'll work good night good night and i'll work with you so i'm the um president my bride on the lights uh because i know that they were uh requested and they were installed so we'll work on that and get back with mrs uh and nikki thank you so much everybody happy valentine's day
