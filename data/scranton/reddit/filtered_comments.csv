It provides the basis for funding for local organizations working to end homelessness. In Lackawanna County, the next count will take place on January 30, 2025.

It misses many individuals due to safety concerns, weather, and limited outreach and more. It also only captures those homeless on a single night—not everyone who experiences homelessness over the year. There may be fewer homeless individuals on a cold night in January because they find money to buy a hotel or stay with a friend when that is not a long-term solution.

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Policy has a 2017 Report that lays out all the flaws but even still it should be able to show trends since the methods don't change year to year.

Lackawanna Housing Authority's Section 8 vouchers list is closed, however the Jessup project list will open 12/9 and close 12/13. Their public housing lists are closed.

Homeless is defined as not having a permanent address. If you are couch surfing, you're homeless. If you are sleeping in a car, you're homeless. If your living situation changes frequently, you are homeless. While families and charities \*may\* be taking the brunt, they are a very thin safety net for homeless people.

You should not narrow your definition to only those living on the streets because it ignores a much larger issue of housing insecurity in this country and our own area. While the people on waiting lists may not be unhoused - in any of the definitions we use - they are still on the list which means the unhoused - no matter the definition - can not be helped.

There was a homeless camp in the wooded area in Kirby Park and they were largely harmless and minded their own business. The WB Police Department raided the camp and forced the people to other places in the city, including Public Square.

The only proven solution to ending homelessness is to give displaced people homes, free medical and (if needed) drug counseling, and job training, and treat them like actual people. According to a 2018 UofS study, there were less than 200 homeless people in Lackawanna County (this probably has increased slightly since the pandemic). The county, boroughs, and especially the state government has more than enough money to give these people the proper care they need. 

The short term solution?

Contact and volunteer at local organizations that help homeless people recover. In my experience, even just helping out at a soup kitchen and talking to people, and truly understanding their experiences, can at least make their day.  You're showing that there are people who care about them and want them to get better. 

The long-term solution? 

Contact and seriously lobby local politicians, especially Scranton city council members and the mayor, as well as county commissioners. Call them every day. Show up to every meeting. Push for free, semi-permanent housing and expanded rehab programs. Once politicians see that homelessness is a problem that is 1) easily solvable and 2) a common concern of their constituents, they'll start supporting funding for social programs in the area.",23,2023-05-19 02:27:49 UTC,"homeless, homelessness, soup kitchen"

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.
