https://stfranciskitchen.org/volunteer/

As someone else noted many places where you may have contact with children and disabled people may require you to get clearances prior to volunteering there, it's a Catholic charity, so they're probably taking no chances with anyone these days.  Clearances are not difficult to get and can usually be gotten for little or no cost to you.  I would check with the particular charity first, to see what (if any) clearances they require.",10,2021-10-18 16:05:06 UTC

That said, 1 is too many. We need more public housing. The 1998 Faircloth Amendment bans HUD funds from being used to construct additional units, but the incoming regime is unlikely to allocate any funds anyway.

It provides the basis for funding for local organizations working to end homelessness. In Lackawanna County, the next count will take place on January 30, 2025.

It misses many individuals due to safety concerns, weather, and limited outreach and more. It also only captures those homeless on a single night—not everyone who experiences homelessness over the year. There may be fewer homeless individuals on a cold night in January because they find money to buy a hotel or stay with a friend when that is not a long-term solution.

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Policy has a 2017 Report that lays out all the flaws but even still it should be able to show trends since the methods don't change year to year.

Lackawanna Housing Authority's Section 8 vouchers list is closed, however the Jessup project list will open 12/9 and close 12/13. Their public housing lists are closed.

Homeless is defined as not having a permanent address. If you are couch surfing, you're homeless. If you are sleeping in a car, you're homeless. If your living situation changes frequently, you are homeless. While families and charities \*may\* be taking the brunt, they are a very thin safety net for homeless people.

You should not narrow your definition to only those living on the streets because it ignores a much larger issue of housing insecurity in this country and our own area. While the people on waiting lists may not be unhoused - in any of the definitions we use - they are still on the list which means the unhoused - no matter the definition - can not be helped.

There was a homeless camp in the wooded area in Kirby Park and they were largely harmless and minded their own business. The WB Police Department raided the camp and forced the people to other places in the city, including Public Square.

The only proven solution to ending homelessness is to give displaced people homes, free medical and (if needed) drug counseling, and job training, and treat them like actual people. According to a 2018 UofS study, there were less than 200 homeless people in Lackawanna County (this probably has increased slightly since the pandemic). The county, boroughs, and especially the state government has more than enough money to give these people the proper care they need. 

The short term solution?

Contact and volunteer at local organizations that help homeless people recover. In my experience, even just helping out at a soup kitchen and talking to people, and truly understanding their experiences, can at least make their day.  You're showing that there are people who care about them and want them to get better. 

The long-term solution? 

Contact and seriously lobby local politicians, especially Scranton city council members and the mayor, as well as county commissioners. Call them every day. Show up to every meeting. Push for free, semi-permanent housing and expanded rehab programs. Once politicians see that homelessness is a problem that is 1) easily solvable and 2) a common concern of their constituents, they'll start supporting funding for social programs in the area.",23,2023-05-19 02:27:49 UTC

The solution is affordable or subsidized housing. Look at Utah’s success combatting homelessness with Housing First.

Oh great then we don’t have to mistake you for a serious person. 

You don’t want to be uncomfortable seeing someone whose life is infinitely harder than your own, and who- in our current system- you are only a few missed paychecks away from becoming? But you don’t have a solution, and you don’t care where they go as long as you’re not inconvenienced? 

I’ve seen the camp at Olive St, nobody is choosing to live there over other options. We need affordable public housing and social service outreach to help those people get off the streets.

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

This is the larger theme that this reddit community seems to be missing--it's okay to be poor and struggling! Most people in Scranton are poor! 60% of SSD students live in relative poverty!

Also the avg occupancy per house has decreased, in the 1930s there could be 3 generations in a 2 bedroom home. Now we have single occupancy homes such as a widow living alone. Or in most cases a retired couple occupying a home, which is likely to be forfeited to a nursing home in the near future.

His argument may be that these two developers are creating new units of housing and then charging significant monthly payments, often notably above market rates. As they are the ones buying vacant properties, and some of the only folks making new housing, they create upward market pressure to charge more while removing potential sites for others to create more affordable spaces. There is some logic to this line of thought, but it’s pretty obtuse IMO. It ignores facts like Basalyga renovating otherwise destroyed and useless buildings and there not being a ton of entrants vying for every opportunity.

In the medium term, further consolidation of the regional planning codes. The valley is one big urban unit and should be treated as such.

In the short term, up zoning the entire city to allow for multiple units, legalizing single room occupancy, allow accessory dwelling units (ADU) and accessory commercial units (ACU) by right .

In the short term, a Vancouver style vacancy tax to encourage developers, landlords, etc. to actively fill their properties instead of leaving vacant eye sores (like the old Army Navy store on Penn Ave with the apartments above it)",8,2024-03-29 03:00:24 UTC

&#x200B;

Can we dig into the second and third ones for a second, how do we go down that road without turning into a ""slums"" type setup? especially with the single room occupancy and ADU's that are barely inhabitable? are there best practices / cities that have done that which are similar and turned out well?

&#x200B;

When I've looked into it in the past, just out of curiosity, I haven't done any in depth research, but from what I've seen, it generally resulted in unhappy neighbors, rich people benefiting, and still no affordable housing. Would these be like rent stabilized units by law? How do we prevent what the Lehigh Valley is seeing now, all the available areas turning into luxury and its doing nothing for affordable housing",4,2024-03-29 03:11:47 UTC

Currently if you want a rental license in Scranton you need to meet certain standards, and I would expect the majority of those to remain in place while others (setbacks and parking minimums) could be revised or eliminated.

SRO or boarding houses used to be extremely common in Scranton at the turn of the last century. Having a shared bathroom and cooking space would need to be allowed (it is not currently), but otherwise the expectation of the landlord would be the same. 

I prefer owner-occupied rental properties because I dislike big corporate landlords, but there are downsides to that model as well. One way I would combat that would be to exponentially increase the cost of rental licenses >3. 

Currently if you’re renting to an immediate family member the license fee is waived. For everything else ~~there’s Mastercard~~ a fee schedule.  Up to three units cost $45, 4-9 costs $150 flat fee, up to 50+ a $450 flat fee.  I would aggressively increase that for 4+ by charging it PER UNIT.

Now, that’s probably not great for affordability because landlords and property management costs would want to recoup that, but the motive is to keep the housing stock locally owned and locally controlled with lots of smaller landlords. Monopoly is always bad, so I’m willing to sacrifice some affordability in favor of preventing large landholders from snapping up properties",3,2024-03-29 03:39:08 UTC
Scranton faces affordable housing crisis,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/1bpwcpd/scranton_faces_affordable_housing_crisis/,2024-03-28 14:01:44 UTC,"on the fees point, if the goal is more affordable housing, wouldn't it make sense to charge less for license fees the more you have as long as the rent is locked?

&#x200B;

The more small landlords you have, the narrower the margin (especially with current interest rates) so they would need to charge more rent, in theory.

&#x200B;

I agree with your statement about monopolies being bad, but if the goal is entirely focused on low income housing, it seems like the solution should be whatever pushes the rent down, as long as they are still meeting code?",2,2024-03-29 11:01:04 UTC
Scranton faces affordable housing crisis,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/1bpwcpd/scranton_faces_affordable_housing_crisis/,2024-03-28 14:01:44 UTC,"You’re right, but my goal with the license fees is not to increase affordability but to limit large institutional investors ability to control property in the city.

Keeping the <3 rate the same, maybe even up to 6 units to allow for fourplexes, would support the ADU/duplex market and keep those prices down. I’m picturing primarily owner-occupied small landlords- but allowing up to 3 means if you moved you could rent the primary home and the ADU to two different tenants.

The vacancy tax would also act as pressure to keep rents affordable-ish so that landlords lose money holding out for unreasonable rents.

We have a county [land bank](https://www.lackawannacounty.org/government/departments/land_bank/index.php),  which I am very much in favor of.  I wonder how feasible it would be for the land bank to rehab some of the vacant and rent them at a low price.

I’m not in favor of rent control in the form of a hard cap on rent payments, but I do support a maximum increase per year. I feel that rate should be tied to some sort of index like COLA.

My concern with rent control is that if it is means tested then landlords will rent to tenants with higher incomes to avoid it.  If it’s not means tested, it will subsidize high income tenants who could otherwise pay market rate.

Having many small landlords gives all tenants more choice and flexibility.  It will also keep costs down at the macro level because landlords will have to compete for tenants, rather than dictating prices from a monopoly position. 

What are your thoughts on section 8 vouchers? One idea I’ve kicked around is making it illegal for landlords to refuse section 8 vouchers. Currently landlords in PA may do so. If the money is green they should have to accept it.",1,2024-03-29 11:30:46 UTC

In Scranton itself, 350k will buy you a beautiful home. Outside of Scranton, in most towns, it will still get you a very nice home but a little bit less bang for the buck. However, the trade off is that all the other towns and cities have notably lower taxes, and in many cases, utilities. 

There aren’t many unsafe areas in the wider area. In Scranton you’d be looking for a few specific particularly good areas, everywhere else blends from “not that unsafe” to “meh.” However, moving out to the surrounding towns results in lower crime rates. The entirety of NEPA (Northeast Pennsylvania) is pretty safe, though. 
With that said, if school district is a major factor, you’d want to look in the Abington School District (15-25 minutes north of Scranton) or Dallas School District (35 minutes southwest of Scranton). Mount Poccono is also a decent school district. Everything else ranges from “not bad” to “eh, I can tolerate it” outside of Scranton, Carbondale, and Wilkes Barre. 

If you’re cool with working in a grocery store, there are opportunities aplenty. A ton of companies are building warehouses in the area, so that work is available, too. 

Lackawanna County is very purple. We usually elect dem lawmakers but that’s because the population is more old school style democrats versus the newer face prevalent out west or in big cities. Luzerne County is a bit further red, but not overly Republican either. 
If you go half an hour from Scranton, you will find what you describe. However, there’s a significant gradient and it does evolve from “suburban homeowner” to “rural homeowner” to “where the fuck am I” along a political gradient.

We have a lot of hiking in the area, so that’s exciting. 
We have excellent bar food - maybe some of the best. Other aspects of the culinary scene are lacking, though more has been coming online in the last five years. There is a bit of an art scene, a bit of a music scene but not a ton of either. I’d definitely recommend checking it out before you move here - there’s a decent bit to offer but it’s a vibe sort of all its own",17,2024-07-16 20:21:24 UTC

Depending on which part of Scranton you’re in. It’s about 15 minutes away.  It’s the safest neighborhood around here. 

I’ve lived in Scranton most of my life and I’ve been fine. Worst thing that happened was I didn’t lock my car door and loose change was stolen from me. 

We used to be one of the safest communities for gun violence. But recently there’s been a shooting each month. Which is concerning. 

The  Trump stuff is about 50/50 ratio here. But honestly no one really engages in politics at work and both sides are respectful to me. So it’s a non issue for me.

My favorite part is the food. Pizza is king in this area. Really good hot wings with bars making their own homemade sauces too. I would say that’s #2

I’m a little more pessimistic on the job market, though. There’s a real dearth of skilled work opportunities outside of healthcare, and most of the jobs that pay decent are high turnover warehouse jobs in industrial parks. Customer service and retail positions are plentiful-ish, but you’re fighting with literally EVERYONE for positions, and they’re by far the lowest-paying in the area, often at or barely above federal minimum wage. 

I will second that the idea that area is pretty safe though . It’s nowhere near as bad as the (mostly older /!: conservative) doomsayers make it out to be.  It’s night and day between here and Seattle where I lived for a bit.

It's a great city, but lots of people only see the negative aspects.

I'm really into the outdoors (trail running, downhill and cross country skiing, camping, kayaking, etc.) And there are sooooooo many opportunities here. Clearly the mountains are tiny compared to the Rockies but they're still physically challenging and it's amazing what's hidden in the forests here if you take the time to explore.

The cost of living is another massive benefit. So far this year I've traveled to Spain, Georgia, Montana, and Alabama and will go back to Europe to Spain and Switzerland in a month. I wouldn't be able to travel that much living in one of the country's expensive outdoorsy locations.",26,2022-08-15 15:03:40 UTC

I grew up here, left for college and then spent ten years post college living in various places (Miami, Zürich, Singapore, California). It is what you make it. It's very much a small city with some small town mentality, but in my experience is undergoing some significant change for the better. More people are staying here after college and the younger generations are making an effort to move away from the old ways. A lot of my friends (mid 30s) have all moved back here to start families. We have a young female Mayor trying to make it a better place. 

1. Downtown has quite a few small businesses and restaurants including a refillery that just opened, coffee shops, boutiques and cafes
2. Many farms/orchards etc just outside the city that offer fun weekend activities 
3. Tons of hiking opportunities just obviously not the same elevation as you will find in CO, all within an hour or so drive
4. Two hours from NYC and Philly
5. Not a LOT of ethnic food options but they exist (Wandas Mofongo House, tons of Mexican food, The Garden Mediterranean, Thai).
6. Yes there are big box chain stores but technically they're mostly on commerce Blvd in Dickson City, not Scranton ;-). And we all need a Target everyone once in a while
7. Scranton city tax is stupidly high and it's a mystery where the money goes but you can look at living on Dunmore or Clark Summit
8. If you want to be involved in arts/culture scene there are opportunities.
9. PIZZA. So much good pizza.

I've backpacked in Europe, Asia, and Australia. You get the idea.

I met a woman from Scranton (born in Philly but lived most of her life here) and we decided I would make the move across the Atlantic. We've been married over 20 years.

I like it. Where I was from, Yorkshire? Used to be a big industrial and coal mining area before WW2, saw a bit of decline in the post-war era but has recently started to bounce back again (and has seen some small sporting successes with the Leeds Rhinos in rugby and Leeds United being back in the Premier League). People like to have a beer, they say what they mean and mean what they say, and they have slang words for a few things that identify them. Nestled in a mountainous area and just two hours from London too.

Swap out the Rhinos and LUFC for the WBS Baby Penguins and the RailRiders / Yankees, and have NYC instead of London. Same difference.

I've developed a love for Thai food to replace my Indian food love. The Chinese food is great because both places seem to have people that were from Hong Kong and Kowloon (just look at the big picture on the wall of the Great Wall on Monroe in Dunmore, technically still part of the Hill Section in my mind). Before the pandemic I saw David Bowie, Suzanne Vega, and The Crystal Method live in the city. I have my coffee shop, my go-to restaurants, and places that keep me entertained. 

Negatives, once you manage to find a good area of the city to live in (I'm in the Upper Hill, close to Dunmore), is the naysayers that like to bash the city without having been anywhere else.",9,2022-08-15 22:44:15 UTC

My both sets of my grandparents were raised here, and both of my parents were born and raised here, and so was I. That is the case for most people I grew up with. My family has been in Scranton for 100+ years, and I grew up surrounded by my entire extended family. A lot of people’s social circles consist of people they went to grade school with. It is insular.

That said I really had a very enjoyable childhood.

The cost of living can't be beat, and there is good food here (except the weird local-style pizza. I tried.)  What has really struck me is the friendliness of the people. My neighbors are all sweethearts who will stop their car in the middle of the road to ask me if I need anything from the store. People are kind.

I get the vibe that more young people are coming here; I think that will continue. It feels on the verge of ""up and coming"" somehow that I can't tangibly describe.

It seems like some of the people who grew up here can be incredibly negative about it. I get it, but I wonder if they've lived anywhere else as a bill-paying adult and what their expectations are because I don't really see the doom and gloom reflected in daily life. Every place has downsides; you just have to find the downsides you can live with.

As others have mentioned, building a social life from scratch here as an adult can be hard, especially if you don't have kids and aren't coupled up. Most people have their families and social circles already, so I am finding this part challenging.",3,2022-08-16 00:32:29 UTC

1. There are jobs but very few that pay well
2. It is largely safe

4. Politics in the area are just......well a mess and as a result change is often slow and promises aren't kept.
5. Not much to do in terms of night life but there are some good bars and restaurants. 
6. There's an undying, often mentioned history of coal mining that often neglects to include the Coal Barron's of the day that exploited the workers and the town then left when the best coal was gone.
7. The hill section has many of the mansions/houses that the coal Barron's owned and some are really nice...alot have been converted to apartments/student housing and have been neglected to various degrees 
8. The University of Scranton (the U) seems to be forever expanding and taking more and more of the downtown area each year. This brings students from other states during the school year which can be seen as both good and bad depending on what you're evaluating.

I landed in the street in the path of a Scranton Police car. Most places Police would render aid but not in Scranton. The officer arrested my co-workers for telling him he had seen the whole thing. I was taken to the hospital where hospital staff began treating me like a criminal asking for me to submit to alcohol testing. I tried to remind them that I was brought there by ambulance, not a police car. They refused to render aid for a broken wrist and head trauma till I submitted to alcohol testing. I  had to call 911 from the hospital to finally get police to take a police report on what actually happened. The bouncer turned out to be an off duty police officer. I wasn't his first victim. I made the mistake of retaining a local law firm who made me believe they were on my side but as soon as the flood project was completed and I was in a different city they dropped my case for unknown reasons.

I grew up there, moved away in the early 2000s, moved back during the Great Recession, then got out as soon as I could. I currently live outside Philadelphia.

The NEPA region is best summarized as 'bleak'. It isn't ruin-porn (like Detroit), but it feels as though the hope has been sucked out. People are generally negative, there is a huge racial divide (this isn't helped by the large old and white population), and there is a very large contingent of Small Town People (their parents were born and died there, their parents' parents were born and died there, they were born and will die there...).

Employment options are limited, and pay is certainly adjusted to the cost of living of the region. The largest employers are the city itself, higher education, then mostly warehouse and call center jobs. 

The weather is nice, it gets four seasons and minimal natural disasters. The education is ok, better than you would find in a Philly city public school, and certainly better than you'd find in the Southeast US / Texas, but the trade off is the sort of public acceptance of casual racism you'd expect in the deep south. 

If you are a recovering addict, I'd suggest against the region.

I don't know the current data off the top of my head but in 2009 - 2010 something like 80% of tax revenues paid for salaries, benefits, health insurance and retirement for the city police, fire and DPW workers.  The fire contract (negotiated in the 90s before the dot com bust) is insane.  I believe they keep their health insurance for their entire lives **and can will their coverage** to another family member upon the insured's death.  Jimmy Connors is a nice guy, but man, what an atrocious deal to saddle the city with.  I've been consciously not paying attention to these issues since Courtright won his election, so this may have changed, but it was (at least at one point recently) the case.",1,2022-08-18 13:13:48 UTC

2. Abington school diatrict and North pocono are both good 

3. Scranton is fairly low on violent crime to my knowledge. Certainly much safer than any of the surrounding cities like wilkes barre, Hazleton, binghamton.

4. I dont know if there is much of a Chinese population, but there is a Chinese market right by providence square and also a small one in the hill section of scranton 

5. Scranton is not historically conservative, its historically democratic and has a long history of workers rights, unions, and labor disputes dating back to the coal mines.

I live in Scranton, and used to live and hang out in the north-of-London area (Stevenage is 20 miles from the outskirts / 30 miles from the touristy middle of London).

1 - not as institutionalized as other places, it's down to the individuals being racist. I live next door to a Mexican (now naturalized American) and his family, there was a retired black couple that lived the other side of us (before the husband died and she sold the house to live closer to family). Scranton itself is pretty diverse. But I'm Harry Potter white so there's that.

2 - the countryside would have more rednecks, but I'll leave the school districts to someone else with experience (no kids).

3 - I walked around London fine for years, and Scranton is a serene paradise compared to outside Kings Cross station at 11pm on a Saturday night. If you're in a poorer part of town like South Side at 2am on a Sunday, your chance of being a victim of crime is higher than if you're in the Steamtown Mall at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. 

4 - Thai Rak Thai restaurant runs a Thai store downtown next to their restaurant on Adams Avenue, [it used to be the Panda Chinese Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/cqXFgX4rwHHCifqW6). The Hill Section has [F & F Oriental groceries](https://goo.gl/maps/AmQ9pUNWYmUAYbDS6) and the [Great Wall Chinese Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/6nfBCvXYMQJ1YExa8) on Monroe Avenue.

5 - Scranton (and Lackawanna County) trends more left-of-the-aisle. Senator Bob Casey (Democrat) still lives here. The county is part of Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district (Matt Cartwright, Democratic Party). On the state and national levels, Lackawanna County has strongly favored the Democratic Party for the last ninety years with over 65% of registered voters being registered Dems. And, as has been mentioned, Joe Biden was born and spent his formative years in the city's Green Ridge section.

I would say racism is about on par with any other medium sized city in the country. Overt racists are uncommon but you will see casual racism here and there due to the older population. In the surrounding rural areas I'd imagine you're more likely to encounter real bigotry.
2. I'm willing to bet any statistic saying Scranton is unsafe is including Wilkes-Barre, which is about 20 minutes south. Violent crime is rare in Scranton, perhaps 1 or 2 shootings a year that are either gang-related or some argument or domestic dispute. As for non-violent crime, the opioid epidemic has taken its toll here but we're beginning to make progress against it. NEPA has a long standing history of corruption so you'll see things like our previous mayor being indicted for bribery and stuff.
3. I'm not sure about the specific Chinese population, but there is a significant Nepali population who have started a number of businesses such as restaurants and grocery stores.
4. The saying I always heard growing up was ""Philadelphia has the Eagles, Pittsburgh has the Steelers, and Scranton has politicians."" People can be very opinionated about politics whether it be about the president or their local county clerk. It's our blood sport. Lackawanna county is traditionally a Democrat stronghold due to the importance and history of labor unions here. People may be more socially conservative but again, it's an old population. Confederate flags are uncommon in Scranton proper but can often be seen in surrounding areas.

1. I have had what I would call racists encounters with 2 police in 25 years. Removed from car, pat down, passengers asked if they were in any danger. Once for speeding, once for lane change without a blinker. 

 I have run into an openly racist person 1 time; a teen who claimed his boots were good for stomping niggers. 

That is the worst of my experience. However, there are A LOT of microaggressions. It's ok to hate on indian people for their curry smell and your inability to understand them. Open season on Hispanics, there's even a nearby town whose politicians openly campaigned on lowering the Hispanic population (they'll say illegal immigration). I've had people tell me.that Mexico must be beautiful, I've never been, I'm not mexican, I was born in Indiana. So there is a lot of what I would call limited worldview. 

2. This is tough because I believe the best school districts in the area are suburbs. Your Valley Views, Mid-Valleys and Dunmores (all school districts servicing areas just outside of Scranton).

 I'd suggest you research this point heavily. But realize that the more rural the more of '1.' you're going to encounter. You're definitely more likely to find confederate flags in the country side than in the city. As for rural towns to check out: Hamlin, Lake Ariel (Western Wayne school district) or Wallenpaupack school district.

3. I would say the city is safe. I've never felt threatened or in danger anywhere but my car has been robbed 4 times and I live in what would be considered one of the best neighborhoods. I've always been told to avoid the hill section and southside but again I've never really had bad experiences there. 

4. There are 4 asian stores including Nepali and Thai specific but the other 2 are general asian, none specifically chinese. While I think this sounds awful I cant remember a time I've run into a chinese person outside of a chinese restaurant. The one family I know commutes from NY. 

5. Lots of campaign signs but no one is in your face about it. That changes the farther out from the city you go. Friends who work in Tunkannok area say they often have to deal with political conversation. 

Again, just one brown person's take. Hopefully you get more responses. Best of luck!",2,2020-07-09 16:25:15 UTC

I'd like to say the comments sum up scranton fairly well.  Current day scranton is vastly different than say the scranton of the early 80's I grew up in.  It took the city a fairly long time to grow out of its coal cracker roots but it's progressing to say the least.  The city has been in financial distress for decades now and the political corruption didn't help.  The Univeristy of Scranton continues to buy up property and doesn't pay a dime in property tax.

1. There is no overt racism against orientals in NEPA. There are no KKK cells in NEPA. However, you would be hard-pressed to find a region that is more prejudiced against people who aren't white. I applaud you for being aware, but your wife and children will feel alienated. If you want to get an idea of actual racial makeup start googling the local high school graduation lists.
2. Abington Heights & North Pocono.
3. Overall safety isn't bad. But I live on a ""great"" block in a ""pretty good"" neighborhood and our cars get broken into every time we leave them open. There are many parts of town where if you are a white retiree just going for a walk in broad daylight (i.e. my parents) you will get heckled by people on their porches which to me is an indicator of a place you definitely don't want to go at night.  
There are swaths of slum housing in virtually every neighborhood, which brings a wildly unpredictable element of crime and decay. However, the police are fantastic.
4. Not really. There is a small first-generation population who are mainly working in services and unskilled labor. We employed many of them and they were great people, but there is no community to speak of, assuming you're mainly imagining entrenched, college-educated Chinese.
5. People are *absolutely insane* about politics in this area. In my experience, both sides can be ravenous. It's more of a democratic stronghold, but along with the agenda of the MSM, it has devolved into super-pro-Trump vs super-anti-Trump. Depending on where you are from and your level of education, you will find Scranton to be comedic at best.",-2,2020-07-09 20:07:14 UTC

lived in WB during a shot stint at kings, then bounced around various places in the country. ended up in a nice neighborhood in luzerne county bc of family stuff a couple of years ago (more progressive and inclusive vs most places in the county.) though i dont want to stay for more than another year or two.

that being said, i spend a lot of time in lackawanna county and find it preferable for pretty much anything be it people, restaurants, things to do...

are you crazy for wanting to come back? eh, maybe. comparing scranton to a big city like austin makes it look like theres nothing to do. but when you factor in all the outdoor activities available to us here like hiking, fishing, camping, etc it makes an argument for moving back, if you partake in such things. you still have entertainment venues like the cultural center, montage, moheagan sun arena that draw big acts you wouldnt get in many smaller cities. then theres the short drives to philly and nyc which makes weekend getaways easily achievable without the burden of making plans weeks in advance bc of distance.

price wise, id say rents are average vs other similar cities. i wouldnt consider it expensive. it really is how well you make out finding a place. homes too, you arent gonna end up in the poor house finding a decent house in a good neighborhood.

i think if you grew up here and never left, you absolutely should bc there is so much more to see and do. but for someone like yourself, if youve seen a lot and done a lot and are ready to settle back in, youre probably good and will adjust fine. will make a good life here but might still travel around to get a taste of whats missing here. the ones that dont just live here miserably, complaining about places theyve never been to and proclaim nepa is the best place in the world despite never leaving.

I was born in a big city (Leeds), my family moved closer to dad's side of the family (the Home Counties, just half an hour from central London), so I like big cities and what they have to offer. I'm not a country boy AT ALL. In fact, one of the best things that happened for me was when electronic music caught up with the rave scene in Europe about 15 years ago!

Since moving here - I like Scranton. I have none of the ""ugh, it's small and two hours from anywhere big"" mentality. I don't go to music events as much as I used to but I did see David Bowie at Montage Mountain, Suzanne Vega at The North, and The Crystal Method at Stage West (that last one was 2019 - so happy to see other old ravers there). I've been to a few Electric City FC games, a load of Baby Penguins games, and a LOT MORE Red Barons / AAA Yankees / RailRiders games locally. Plus there's the bus trips to Yankee Stadium with the cookouts which I love. I've seen Lewis Black, Mitch Hedberg, and Stephen Lynch do stand-up in the city. I've seen Michio Kaku give a lecture. Stuff happens here that happens in bigger cities - not as often, sure, but enough to notice that Scranton matters in that regard.

There's an art scene, a coffee scene, a music scene, and i think it works because when you're in a huge city you're not actually occupying a 40 by 40 block area. You're experiencing the bits around you. So with Scranton it's like I'm hanging out in an area of a bigger city. And when it gets to be time for us to travel (Vegas for a wedding, London or Paris to visit family or to be a tourist) going from Avoca is hassle free compared to checking in at the bigger airports and worth the extra cost and a few hours layover in Philly, Chicago, or Charlotte.",6,2021-03-25 15:46:35 UTC

Our current friend group consists mostly of people we've met since moving back.  More and more of my friends and classmates that moved away after school has come back to the area.

The cost of living is incredibly low.  Yes, taxes are high in the city compared to the surrounding towns but are still well below states like NJ or NY.  We're 2 hours from NYC and Philly, 4 from Boston and DC, and 3 1/2 from the shore.

I love having four seasons (sometimes in one day).  I love the ethnic diversity.  I love the food.

It's one of the most educated, productive, and diverse cities in the US. I have spent time there myself and have had a few friends move there since college. Nobody has ever even mentioned politics, they all seem to be busy building their social and business capital which is easier in Texas than in pretty much any other state in the country.  


Your perspective is way off, almost to the point of hilarity, if you associate ""very red"" with ""very racist."" Not even going to go into your opinions on Covid but if you really think state-level politicians have an effect on your daily life, I would rather leaders who actually lead rather than follow trends (i.e. media and whiny people on the internet), even if they're ultimately wrong.  


Being honest--that's what I get paid in downvotes to do--if you're pushing 35, are single, and are looking to move to Scranton, you need to be honest that you might end up childless or with having to seriously ""settle."" The dating pool is awful and if you're not finding a fulfilling dating life in Austin, of all places, it's going to be a nightmare if you move to a place where you're a demographic anomaly (born there, college education, no kids, 30+). That's more important than whether you end up somewhere red, blue, purple, or magenta.  


Cost of living in Scranton has increased but the good news is that there have been ton of ""out-of-town"" developers who are investing and making previously shitty apartments liveable and desirable for young professionals.

I grew up here and ended up moving back. I lived in Florida and California. It was quite an adjustment when I first got here. Felt really weird. I would go out for walks at like midnight like I would in California and nobody was around but police driving in circles through different parts of town. Things close early. People eat early. People sleep early.

There's not a whole lot to do here, but I'm a software developer and I make a lot of money for the area. In California, my rent was \~3000$s. Here you can get a really nice apartment for like 1000$. It doesn't have as many amenities of course.... The night life is pretty bogus, but I'm in my 30s now so that's not that big of a deal for me. When life was more normal and I lived here years back, we would typically go out to bars and socialize. I'm feeling pretty nostalgic for that at this point.

There is hiking and a lot of great things to do outdoors that I mostly ignored growing up here. There's also a Scranton social sports league that runs when COVID isn't going on.

I am surrounded by mostly Trump people and I do think that the education level here is MUCH lower than I remember, but the area is CHEAP. Food is all bar food... Not much healthy to eat. Scranton is mostly pretty liberal, but the suburbs (where I live) are very much red now. See more confederate flags, Trump signs, and stupid shit like that than I ever remember.

Summary: It's cheap here. Everyone will tell you the taxes are crazy... It's nothing like Los Angeles. People here are getting more uneducated over time and that's really unfortunate. Public transportation is non-existent. High paying jobs are pretty much non-existent. I believe this area has the potential to be a great area, but political corruption and anti-worker laws have pretty much kept the place suppressed. There's unfortunately a lot of hatred that hurts the community as well.

While I'm happy to be here because my family still lives here, I would move away in a heartbeat if they weren't around. I would suggest you take a peak at Asheville NC.

Honestly, the past year in a place like TX felt pretty much like being home. Although Texas has been mostly open since last April, for those taking the pandemic seriously, it's been pretty much like living in a small town. I have to say that except for the ability to see my friends and go do outdoorsy things safely, I haven't really missed much. 

I almost moved back about 6 years ago but stayed because of the music scene here. It's a great place to be in your 20s and early 30s. But now that I'm getting to my mid-30s, I just look around and wonder what I'm paying for with the premium of living here. Not to mention, the housing market is absolute insanity. Even though I have a good job, I'd never be able to afford a home here. Houses that went for $300k ten years ago are now valued at 600k. 

I started looking Around at places and noticed the same market for any ""desirable city"" anywhere. 

I always liked Scranton and love the outdoors and the mountains. I also miss being NEAR stuff. In Austin, you feel you're very much landlocked with not many places to go. You can't just pop over to NYC or Boston. Anywhere close isn't somewhere you actually want to go, anyway. Not to mention living in this climate is like living on the moon for anyone from the Northeast. It's very bizarre, very flat, lots of huge cacti and succulents everywhere. Not to mention trees that cause hella allergies. 

I know NEPA isn't the best place but in regards to the quality of life in Scranton, the access to the outdoors, the centralized location to larger cities, I have to say it's very appealing.

I do think your perspective is bogus if it's rooted in political beliefs, which is how you started your post. Anyone who spends their afternoons (or, really, any part of the day) engaged in Reddit or Facebook diatribes isn't really representative of the populace. You need to be seriously privileged or seriously unproductive to do so. I embrace that I am one of these people but it also means I actively try to provide a different, useful perspective when I do participate in such discussions.

I've lived/worked in and visited tons of awesome places over the last two years and *every single place* from the capitals of Europe to ski towns in the western US and other trendy ""Zoom towns"" has a sub (or neighborhood FB forum) that contains a bunch of people whining while wearing their political views on their sleeves. It gets really, really old once you realize that we just live in an age where mobs of people channel their frustrations about their personal shortcomings into politically-charged negativity. Concisely: the internet trends cynical.

Sorry that you're uncomfortable that I made assumptions about your life but that is what people do when you post on Reddit asking for *life* advice. It's just weird that you muse about a ""strong community,"" don't mention romantic/dating life at all, and then get uncomfortable when I assume Austin isn't getting the job done for you. Not implying you're failing at anything but I will not hesitate to say that already having a long-term romantic partner is the single most pivotal decision point for myself and any other friends considering moving back to Scranton.",0,2021-03-25 15:45:36 UTC

We aren't working in factories or as Uber drivers, we aren't working as investment bankers or lawyers or executives. I self-identify as a yuppie who works remotely in tech--also one that regularly engages people on the internet while writing a blog--and this brings me fulfillment.  


When you aggregate all these people who tend to post about their communities and their politicians on the internet during the day--it skews toward a certain worldview. You were hoping to be coddled by people sharing your view when you decided to vent about Texas politics here. If you didn't, I would hold the mirror up and ask why you even mentioned it.  


Anyway, to respond to your edited post above, I would agree that if your income hasn't kept up with your ability to afford housing or other necessities, that's a problem and it's a totally viable reason to move. But we could debate all day as to whether it's a problem that needs intervention and that actually merits complaint. If people are paying to remain there or are okay with paying inflated Airbnb prices (like I did) then it sounds like the demand merits it. Every cool non-major city in the US has a Reddit page filled with people complaining about affordability and housing supply.",1,2021-03-25 17:04:26 UTC

From Utah to Scranton,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scranton/comments/mmqglx/from_utah_to_scranton/,2021-04-08 12:14:21 UTC,"Welcome to Scranton!

You should know that the people who grew up and Scranton and have never lived anywhere else tend to be pretty miserable.  Despite the tendency for native Scrantonians to speak negatively of their hometown, Scranton is a great place to live. Our low cost of living coupled with our proximity to larger cities, our abundance of natural resources, and strong ethnic communities are just some of the reasons I love living here. 

I recommend Dunmore or the Green Ridge section of Scranton.  You'll be within walking distance of campus.  There are a couple of great coffee shops and a new brewery also within walking distance.

Below is a great resource for things to do in the area.

All I have to offer is what I've heard from friends who moved to Utah. The cold and snow are a lot different here. It's humid, so the cold feels a lot colder and the snow is often slushy. Something to keep in mind when dressing and driving in the winter.

Also, it super humid in the summertime, so the hot is a lot more uncomfortable than desert climate. A/C is recommended even if you don't mind the heat. Good luck.",15,2021-04-08 12:45:33 UTC

The area has a long history of exploitation, and currently, some of the biggest companies are exploiting the area (ie the landfill and powerplant). 

However, there's a lot of beauty here, too. There are beautiful hiking areas. If you're looking to make friends I would check out if there are any meet-ups that you are interested in. Scranton also has a strong arts scene, First Fridays are always a good time (well, at least they were pre-covid, and I expect them to be back to fighting shape in a few months when things open back up and there's more people vaxed). I'm not sure if you have any type of spirituality or religions beliefs, but there's a pretty great interfaith community as well that seems to be growing :) 

There are people like myself who have found themselves having to stay in NEPA (I have an elderly father to stick around here for :) ) and we want to make the area better. There are positive people around. There are people who want to make changes (hey anyone reading this, consider Marlene Sebastianelli for the 22nd District Senate Seat in May!).

It would maybe be a 5/10 if he didn't include the Steinbeck passage that he so blatantly copied the writing style from.

Especially this part:  


>The forests are littered with broken beer bottles and rusted rebar jutting defiantly from crumbling concrete foundations. Every hike promises a reminder of what we've done wrong and rewards with unapologetic glimpses at what makes the Scranton area a tarnished Eden.  
>  
>Don't believe me? Take popular hikes and walks to the Nay Aug Gorge, Lackawanna State Park, and Lake Scranton, or head off the well-traveled trail to climb West Mountain (or Bald Mountain if you're from my neck of the woods).

  
Not true ... at all. I've run hundreds of miles in these specific locations and their surrounding trail systems. Litter and ""crumbling concrete foundations"" are really rare. I cannot envision what this guy is talking about aside from homeless encampments if you know where to look.  


Also, the ""stink"" part, I've never thought that and have never heard someone from Scranton ever mention it. Not a fitting descriptor.

I grew up here, and I love the area, but if you go anywhere in the woods you are going to to find trash and broken bottles.  The heritage trail is pretty clean and the City/County has cleaned up the parks a bit, but if you take the trails i assume he is referring to on west mount, bald mountain, or east mountain you can see crumbling foundations in the woods.  

Ore Mine Road and the #5 on East mountain are trashed for example. Campbell's Ledge to the South has a great view, but the are broken beer bottles and dilapidated buildings right on the trails. Have you been to Rocky Glenn, place is a mess?

EDIT::

In case it wasnt clear.  I LOVE it here. There is so much to do, there are great bars and several brewery's(groove, SBC), the food scene is really pretty great.  There are parks EVERYWHERE.  You can camp, Mountain bike, Hike, Kayak, XC Ski or ice skate.  There are several minor league sports to watch (PNC field is great, and i love the days i can bring my dog).
