0,2023-05-19 00:38:51 UTC,23,2023-05-19 02:27:49 UTC,[ORGANIZATION],"What is this something you want to do? There was a homeless camp in the wooded area in [ORGANIZATION] and they were largely harmless and minded their own business. [ORGANIZATION] raided the camp and forced the people to other places in the city, including FAC0.

The only proven solution to ending homelessness is to give displaced people homes, free medical and (if needed) drug counseling, and job training, and treat them like actual people. According to a [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 study, there were less than 200 homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] (this probably has increased slightly since the pandemic). The county, boroughs, and especially the state government has more than enough money to give these people the proper care they need. 

The short term solution?

Contact and volunteer at local organizations that help homeless people recover. In my experience, even just helping out at a soup kitchen and talking to people, and truly understanding their experiences, can at least make their day.  You're showing that there are people who care about them and want them to get better. 

The long-term solution? 

Contact and seriously lobby local politicians, especially [PERSON] city council members and the mayor, as well as county commissioners. Call them every day. Show up to every meeting. Push for free, semi-permanent housing and expanded rehab programs. Once politicians see that homelessness is a problem that is 1) easily solvable and 2) a common concern of their constituents, they'll start supporting funding for social programs in the area.","homeless, homelessness, soup kitchen"

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

The more small landlords you have, the narrower the margin (especially with current interest rates) so they would need to charge more rent, in theory.

Not true ... at all. I've run hundreds of miles in these specific locations and their surrounding trail systems. Litter and ""crumbling concrete foundations"" are really rare. I cannot envision what this guy is talking about aside from homeless encampments if you know where to look.
