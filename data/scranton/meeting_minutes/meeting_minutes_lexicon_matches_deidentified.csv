05_28_2024,homeless,"If you haven't gone down that path of being homeless , if you haven't gone down the path of being maybe not in a gang but know someone that's in a gang or try to help someone to get out of that situation , I don't understand how you can help someone and develop a plan. So that's what I was looking for in the papers. I did not see it."
05_28_2024,homeless,"And we will investigate so the issue is covered up and never reported on because investigation s are blocked from exposure by the right to know law. Last, I did receive the listing of the unsheltered task force. I understand that all of these groups have knowledge of the homeless , not unsheltered in the community ."
05_28_2024,homeless,"So that's one solution there. As far as the gang-banging goes, I spoke about this I think [ORGANIZATION]. You know, we can have a city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] community event -- listen, this woman right here, she said that how can you understand to reach the gang-bangers , right, or the homeless people if you've never been in that situation ."
05_28_2024,homeless,"Well, I have on both ends. I've been homeless . You guys know that from [ORGANIZATION]."
05_28_2024,homeless,they all shake my hand. The homeless people all shake my hand. They all respect me because I give food and clothes to them all the time.
05_28_2024,homeless,"The meeting that I was at, they didn't have the full task force there. I don't know, maybe there was like 15 people present .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] There were certainly people of color who were there. I don't know if anyone there was homeless or if they previously been homeless ."
05_28_2024,homeless,"But as I mentioned [ORGANIZATION], there were a lot of people who were a part of the organizations , the non-profits who are providing services to the homeless and unshelt ered. So I don't think it's wrong for those people to be there because we're trying to figure out what other services are needed, who's going to be providing them, you know, figuring out additional shelters . So we need those people there too."
05_28_2024,homeless,But I do agree that we need to find ways to include the homeless and unsheltered population in the conversation s to make sure that we are meeting their needs. It was the first meeting that I have been to. So that might have been a part of the conversations before that I might not be aware of but to see a plan put in [STREET] for how to do that.
05_28_2024,affordable housing,"I know it's a lot for 5-D. DR. [PERSON] : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] just wanted to add that I have many of the same questions -- although I think it's exciting that this could be used towards a potential , you know, affordable housing project . But I think we need more detailed information about what the project is going to be to help us with this legislation ."

04_02_2024,homeless,And this is for everyone in the room. Raise your hand if you've ever been homeless or are currently homeless ? Now raise your hand if you want to be homeless .
04_02_2024,homeless,"I was also working at the time which made things more complicated . Do you know how hard it is to find a shower when you're homeless or to even use a bathroom when places won't let you, how to stay warm without having your car running all night or even worse, being lonely in a tent? If I hadn't had a job, where would I get food?"
04_02_2024,homeless,"I have been delivering food and supplies to these people for [ORGANIZATION] now. And I've heard their side of things for this long. I've seen people get jobs, move into apartments and at the beginning of their unfortunate homeless journey and many of these homeless people do have jobs."
04_02_2024,homeless,"Many of us are feeling this [STREET], people that have homes. We have come together 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] to make sure these people are having their very basic needs taken care of for them because places that are suppose d to be doing this are not allowed to just due to the fact of facing the backlash from those above them. Shelters are not allowed to help the homeless because heaven forbid you give a homeless person a tent since they have no other options left."
04_02_2024,homeless,"People in the homeless community have told me themselves that this would be a big improvement and it would give them a chance to feel like more than just dogs that it would give them a [STREET] to have a little bit of their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] dignity back. The people that took away these things from them can keep their pat on the backs and their smug comment s. I have watched good people in [ORGANIZATION] regardless of religion , political views and economic backgrounds come together ."
04_02_2024,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION]. I'm a citizen of [ORGANIZATION] . Currently at this present time I am homeless .
04_02_2024,homeless,"And it's kind of hard for us to voice our opinions or to go out to meeting s or to ask for help without the proper resources that we are requesting for. Some of these things is just needed for us to actually move on so that we are not stereotyped so that we all could come together as a city and be able to work things out. [LOCATION] homeless people, many of us have diplomas , have skills, have worked, have lost jobs under a nature that was not asked for us to."
04_02_2024,homeless,"And by everyone being equal, it will cause less stress, less depression , just by less everything . Some of these homeless people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] and me and others that's in this room that may be homeless would like a job, would like to be part of the development , would like to donate funds to help onto our own brothers and sisters . I really think that we should really just all come together and make sure that the homeless people are cared for as those, [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION], and all the other organization s, [ORGANIZATION] ."
04_02_2024,homeless,"The funding, we can't really focus too much on funding if we can't focus on that. We have the homeless that's capable of doing these jobs. One thing, I'm employed ."
04_02_2024,homeless,"Yes, that came from FAC0 . And I did the next steps myself to go over here to FAC1 and fill out that paperwork . And I would like for all the homeless people to be able to do that and have a chance to fill out those paperwork s and be able to be moved up on a list."
04_02_2024,homeless,DATE0 I talked about the garbage down by FAC0? It was left from I guess the homeless were chased out of there. Was [ORGANIZATION] informed about that?
04_02_2024,homeless,"And one of the things is the homeless population . You know, as I sat there and listened to the presentations that were made, my church works with the homeless people. We work with [ORGANIZATION] and we do meals there."
04_02_2024,homeless,And we do what we call our sleeping bag project . And we make sleeping bags for the homeless . We do it on [ORGANIZATION].
04_02_2024,homeless,For this young lady to stand up here with a board with the numbers of homeless -- I guess that's what it was. I couldn't read it all. But do we have a coordinator that's a city representative and paid by the city that oversee s and meets with all the different agencies in the city so that we know what's going on with the homeless population ?
04_02_2024,homeless,"I don't know. I just know what my church does for the homeless . And I think, you know, I read the budget."
04_02_2024,homeless,Maybe I should look in the budget and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] see if there's a line item in there for a homeless coordinator that could coordinate with all the cities and the churches in [ORGANIZATION] . What I came to talk about -- that took up [TIME] of my time. But what I came to talk about [TIME] was [ORGANIZATION].
04_02_2024,homeless,"We can't cave into their demands anymore. Enough [DATE] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 2[DATE]2 23 [DATE] is enough of them. And one thing about the homeless , [ORGANIZATION] knows that [PERSON] and me been since [ORGANIZATION] try to help PERSON2 in our own little [STREET]."
04_02_2024,homelessness,Continuing from [ORGANIZATION] on my odyssey of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] . [TIME] I was walking around in front of FAC0. And there's all of these cars.
04_02_2024,homeless,"And one of the homeless shelters , a specialized [INSTITUTION] on FAC0 -- there's two of them. They call them halfway houses. People that get out of jail"
04_02_2024,homeless,"and they put them in there. At some point in time somebody made laws, you know, like, we're caregivers -- probably was [ORGANIZATION] , I guess, because his picture is on there. But all of these [INSTITUTION] s they're really just 5013Cs like everything else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] like [ORGANIZATION] ."
04_02_2024,homeless,"I also saw the same night, you know, a guy being led into FAC0 shelter , which is on FAC1. And it gets very confusing because it's in the same building as FAC2. And it's the same building and in the back of that same building is another [INSTITUTION] for people that -- halfway got out of jail."
04_02_2024,homelessness,"They don't even present the real lease in their legal papers. There's no reason that I should have been taken to [STREET] in the first [STREET]. In fact, it was illegal because [ORGANIZATION] main duty as a federal housing authority is to stop homelessness and provide safe housing for the elderly and disabled ."
04_02_2024,homelessness,"[ORGANIZATION], you know, all of the things that they set up to take care of the homelessness , I mean, I go down there. It's the same people out of the halfway house. And they come there and all of these charities , you know, good people."
04_02_2024,homeless,"After Mayor [PERSON] we got Mr. [PERSON] . And one of the incidents we had a homeless advocate here talking about how they showed up along, the trail to be -- the river trail and tossed everybody 's belongings into the river along with the current police chief. So, you know, we have a long history here of not treating people right and certainly wallets and papers should never be thrown away."

08_07_2019,homeless,"I understood what challenges were facing downtown [ORGANIZATION] at that time, parking , a lot of the blight issues that are not -- now being solved. Quite frankly , I think there is a homeless issue in downtown [ORGANIZATION] that I happen to see [ORGANIZATION] because I have a large window facing my office; the mercantile tax, the trying to get and retain good employees in the City. I saw firsthand the challenges that we faced."
11_22_2022,homeless,"And if I'm evicted and homeless , I'm finished . I just turned [ORGANIZATION]. And I have been living in [ORGANIZATION] since [LOCATION]."
06_18_2024,homeless,"One is what we're doing to ensure our city employees are kept safe, especially those on [ORGANIZATION] workers , maintenance , [PERSON] and [PERSON], that their outdoor activities are tempered in such a [STREET] that they're not going to be victims of heat stroke, number one. There is nothing so essential that we have to make employees sick. Number two is, what about our homeless community ?"
06_18_2024,homeless,"Do we have the equivalent of a code red for people who are looking at these temperatures ? I mean, they are bad and with the humidity and with the heat. So what are we doing for the homeless ?"
06_18_2024,homeless,"That was from the smoke from [ORGANIZATION]. Homeless , we don't want them, not willing to fix the issue. Let's look at the [ORGANIZATION] 's report on the books [TIME] in our effort for humanity ."

07_23_2024,homelessness,But I hope to have some conversations on our fire billing process . I got another bill from an individual who got a reply from his insurance company about why they're not going to cover the bill that was sent out by the city for a fire that had occurred . So I think it's something that we do need as a [ORGANIZATION] to address and the other issue is homelessness .
07_23_2024,homelessness,Some -- [ORGANIZATION] issued their -- where they stand on homelessness with municipalities . [ORGANIZATION] has stated what their plan is going to be at least a start of their plan. I did notice that the Mayor said that [ORGANIZATION] -- from what I gathered from the article isn't going to be doing anything at this point as far as I could see.
07_23_2024,homelessness,"So I would like [ORGANIZATION] to start to discuss what we're going to do in terms of our municipality and homelessness . Any other comments I'll reserve for on the question . And that's all, Mr. [PERSON]."
01_09_2024,homeless,"There's no record of the thousands of people that were made homeless by this [ORGANIZATION] in an improper prosecu torial setup by the district attorney and the magistrate judge. There is just no record. I mean, there's a record of the complaint and the judgment ."
01_09_2024,homeless,"It's up in [ORGANIZATION] but therein again, I pointed out [ORGANIZATION] that county gave them a tax abatement so somebody from [PERSON] theoretically would have to replace that money that they wouldn't have received from a 20 million dollars building . And some other food for thought , in [ORGANIZATION] , which you see their homeless problem constantly on the news, 42 percent business occupancy . This is what some of our [ORGANIZATION] and whomever decide to build all of these properties and they turn a handsome profit at it and they disappear and [LOCATION] you have a 20 million dollar office building ."
09_10_2024,homeless,"It disappeared . But no one is talking about that. They're talking about law enforcement and, you know, a lot of talk about law enforcement and getting rid of the homeless with law enforcement ."
09_10_2024,homeless,"But this is the key thing because the powers that be run all of these non-profits . They own the courts through outside influences putting people in office as attorney generals , as district attorney s, and these are the people that are running [ORGANIZATION] . They get 153 million dollars and all of a sudden I'm homeless after DATE0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE]."
09_10_2024,homeless,I also asked for an update on homeless encampments that are being -- if they're being addressed by the city and if the homeless task force committee may advise if there's been any notable increase in the number of homeless since other municipalities outside [ORGANIZATION] have been taking action. And I got a one word answer. That one word answer was no.
09_10_2024,homeless,"Mr. [PERSON] , can we ask if the answer no is from -- is -- if there is a notable increase and if that's the case, can we also make sure that at the next homeless task force meeting it be brought up if there is an influx in the number of homeless coming into the city with other municipalities taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] action on it? MR. PERSON1 : I'll get clarification and ask those questions ."
09_10_2024,homeless,"Getting back to the homeless task force, can we ask who runs the actual task force? Is it someone from [ORGANIZATION]? It seems like a lot of [ORGANIZATION] is involved with that, but who is running the actual task force."

06_04_2024,homeless,"Somebody is answering my questions , my concerns . So I'm not the only one in [ORGANIZATION] who is concerned about our population , our homeless population . One of the things that they said [ADDRESS] to count and see just how many homeless people that we do have in [ORGANIZATION] ."
06_04_2024,homeless,"I also know someone that I've been helping during [ORGANIZATION] to collect clothing and underwear and things for the homeless in [ORGANIZATION] . And what she does is, she's a young lady. And she fills her truck with things that she's collect [PERSON] and takes it down to [ORGANIZATION] where a friend of hers has a mobile shower."
06_04_2024,homeless,And they give showers to the homeless people. And lo and behold [ORGANIZATION] I was watching the news. And there is another person in [ORGANIZATION] who is doing the same thing.
06_04_2024,homeless,They take these old buses and they get them converted into showers that the homeless can take a shower and feel that they are better -- a part 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] of the community . So I'm hoping that someone out there has that ability and has that kind of knowledge and that I could always volunteer to help clean up or help wash the towels afterward s of these homeless that take these showers. So that's just something that's dear to my heart is the homeless population .
06_04_2024,homeless,MR. PERSON0: I believe they purchase -- they do purchase vouchers and hand them out to the homeless so that they could do that. MR. PERSON1 :
06_04_2024,homeless,It's on FAC0 close enough to FAC1 for on routes and all that. Somehow I think that would be a really nice [STREET] to consider for a [INSTITUTION] . It has separate rooms.
06_04_2024,homeless,But it's a derelict building that has quite a lot of what's necessary to work as a [INSTITUTION] . It's just rotting away a short walk from [ORGANIZATION]. It's just sad that it's in the condition that it's in considering it is a nice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] building .
06_04_2024,homeless,But I think that a bathhouse would be a relatively productive thing to put in certain parts of the city. I don't know how that would be done. But it does give -- makes it a little more human for the homeless .
06_04_2024,homeless,"And, you know, we have a homeless problem and a housing problem . And from what I see of the use of the [ADDRESS] building , it's hard to get a handle on who exactly is doing what and under what name of agency. So I'm wondering if you -- you seem pretty positive this is not a sanctuary city."
06_04_2024,homeless,"But there's all of these different agencies . And most of them are [PERSON] and just to try to start to figure something out, I mean, we're talking about showers and all kinds of different things to deal with the homeless . And we have all of these charities , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] you know, that seem to be the official point of focus on the homeless ."
06_04_2024,homelessness,"And DATE0 I gave you copies of my certificate of homelessness which I, you know, that I have to get.

So in [ORGANIZATION] since their last DATE1 fest, we've hosted the following free events: A kids DATE2 party, tree lighting and [ORGANIZATION], breakfast with the bunny.

It's kind of amazing when the city needs more breathing room when the citizens are fighting for their last breath.

02_14_2023,homeless; soup kitchen,I'm a citizen here. I went through a lot and it took [ORGANIZATION] to get me through what I've been through and to see us squander funds that have been coming from the federal government and even they can't even cooperate and us locally we're not supporting our citizens even our children and there is multiple amounts of homeless people up here. I go to the soup kitchen [ORGANIZATION] for [LOCATION].

03_04_2019,homeless,"The homeless problem is happening all over the country but that does not excuse us from allowing that situation to continue , but I will applaud the residents for showing the passion and caring they have for their neighborhood and that tells us a lot about the citizens of [ORGANIZATION] and how they feel about their homes and their neighborhoods and their blocks so hopefully we will do our very, very best to try to help them solve that problem . Again, as was mentioned earlier , the long-term solution is to move them, rezone the area so it doesn't happen again, but we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] really have to do right by them now as best we can."

09_03_2024,homeless,Let's see if we could get an update from [ORGANIZATION] as to some of our neighboring communities have addressed the issue in their communities . Are we getting an influx of individual s that are coming from other communities that may have cracked down on camping out of doors? And maybe we can get that info from the task force.

10_10_2023,homeless,So we could finally put that one to rest without anymore nonsense. All right. So we also sent a request to city administration on [ORGANIZATION] asking if [TIME] of the lady's swim club at [ORGANIZATION] may please be alternate d with the rest of the public at the indoor pool and this is referring to the vouchers that were issued to the homeless .

Poor thing. It must break her heart."
07_16_2024,unhoused,Arrogance is met with arrogance . First time I actually introduced myself to the Mayor was right here through the unhoused commission . They didn't even say the pledge of allegiance .

05_09_2023,homeless,"The 600 block of FAC0, homeless encampments , debris and trash and also FAC1 near FAC2 homeless encampments along the expressway . And I also asked you -- I know that I believe code enforce ment went out to [ADDRESS]."
03_12_2024,affordable housing,"And what I was hoping to discuss DATE0 was this affordable housing issue that we have in [ORGANIZATION] , not low income but affordable housing . So as a person that runs a lot of social programs , juvenile reaffirmation, emergency rent payments , bereavement services , we find that there's a lot of commonality in a lot of the issues and it seems to lead back to housing and security . So according to the data, the average single -- the median single income in [ORGANIZATION] is $23,000 a year and the median household income is $44,800 a year."
03_12_2024,affordable housing,We don't need 20 percent affordable and 80 percent luxury. What we need is true affordable housing . So how do we get there?
03_12_2024,affordable housing,"Thanks to [ORGANIZATION] man [ORGANIZATION], his vision, he wants to see green affordable housing with partnerships with [ORGANIZATION], which is finally here in the [ORGANIZATION] area. And we would like to do this right here in [PERSON] . We don't want to look to other cities to figure out our issues."
03_12_2024,affordable housing,So all we're asking for is for the [ORGANIZATION] people to please consider supporting our efforts to do real affordable housing here. We are going to peg them to median incomes . We're not going to let -- allow it to be market rates.
03_12_2024,homeless,"So I first want to say I'm speaking on my behalf, not on behalf of the entire board. I spoke here [ORGANIZATION] regarding the homeless camps on [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. I first want to ask [PERSON] has anything been done to address this issue?"
03_12_2024,homeless,"Okay. I also attended a meeting with Police Chief, Fire Chief, administrators from the district and representative s from [ORGANIZATION] . I did ask to look into maybe an ordinance banning homeless camps at least maybe a thousand feet from school property ."
03_12_2024,homeless,"And unfortunately it was brought to my attention [TIME] that either [ORGANIZATION] or [LOCATION] one of our cross country members was harassed and almost assaulted by an individual around the homeless camps. The safety of our student s have always and will always be my number one priority . And I know the safety of our resident s and our student s are definitely , you know, everybody 's priority up here."
03_12_2024,homeless,"MR. PERSON0 : Because of contractual -- an event that I had to stay [ORGANIZATION] at work, I was unable to go to the homeless meeting . Was it discussed about -- because I know we've thrown this around about creating an ordinance -- and, guess what, cities across the county have done it with success creating an ordinance that prevents homeless camps near [DATE] cares, schools. And I agree with you, it's not if."
03_12_2024,affordable housing,"And hopefully , [ORGANIZATION] bless, it will never will be. Another thing I know we talked -- somebody spoke about affordable housing . I completely understand ."
03_12_2024,homeless,"So, Mr. [PERSON] , you may or may not know this. So I've been asking questions about homeless encampments for [ORGANIZATION] now. I've been getting different answers all over the [STREET]."
03_12_2024,homeless,SCHUSTER : A task force to address the homeless . MR. PERSON0 :
03_12_2024,homeless,"Courts are actually a business -- became a business around the time [ORGANIZATION] came in around the time of the 14th Amendment , around the time when big setup for equality was being set up which is going onto [ORGANIZATION]. I'm [PERSON] homeless . And it's freezing to death."
03_12_2024,homeless; homelessness,"Yet, the main rule of [ORGANIZATION], of the field office of [ORGANIZATION] is to make sure that people are not homeless and to find funding for them if they can't afford homelessness . And I guess I'm out of time. So I hope the movie theater comes through ."
03_12_2024,homelessness,We did have a meeting DATE0 about -- that I had called because I was speaking with the railroad about addressing homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] . They did say they were going to go back. There was a task force that's been formed that we found out about I'd say [LOCATION].
03_12_2024,homeless,"Yeah, I have a few. So to start off, we've been talking about homeless for [ORGANIZATION]. It's not an issue that just happened [LOCATION]."
03_12_2024,homeless,"So with that said, I would like to make a motion for Solicitor PERSON0 to explore and research an ordinance that prohibits homeless camps within so many feet of education facilities , like the high school, of course, day cares and any other educational facility related to that. I know it's been done. I've read a couple articles about it."
03_12_2024,homeless,I have been doing some -- just a little research myself. You may find that there's a lot of protections out there for the homeless and they have been challenged . So we need to tread lightly .
03_12_2024,homeless,It doesn't matter where you go. There are homeless and there is homeless encampments . And it does seem to be growing .
03_12_2024,homeless,"And it seems like it's working to address the issues of encampments near our waterways. You know, hopefully there will be some ordinances out there that have, you know, hold up against any challenges to prevent homeless camps near and around the schools . I'm all for that as well."
03_12_2024,homeless,Anyone else? No? I'll say I'm also for anything that will try to alleviate the problem we're having with homeless people.
03_12_2024,homeless,"I don't believe anything would hurt having Attorney [PERSON] research and see if there is anything that we can do or find to actually try to keep our students safe from all of this and our neighborhood also. So with that said, we have a motion and second. All those in favor of having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] Attorney [PERSON] research an ordinance for the homeless signify by saying aye."
09_05_2023,homeless,Why weren't they offered hotel rooms? Were they not worthy of hotel rooms? But you'll give vouchers to the homeless to use [ORGANIZATION].
09_05_2023,homeless,"Now, I don't speak on this too frivolously . Actually on [TIME], that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] marked the 12th anniversary of a devastating flood that wiped out my own house DATE0, rendered me homeless and my family homeless for some time. And I'm very aware of what it's like to lose everything to a flood, a flood that by all accounts shouldn 't have happened ."
09_05_2023,homeless,"And further consideration , that's how easy it is to become homeless. So when we approach the homeless people in our community , think about one bad storm, one car accident , all it takes. But we as a city need to do what we can to prevent as much as we can adverse weather and extreme weather conditions which we all know are tied to climate change."
09_05_2023,homeless,"I said three words. And the last time -- you know, my last eviction which I'm still dealing with with [STREET] process ; but it's -- it's the number one thing that's making people homeless ."
12_13_2022,homeless,"And for anyone who is homeless or needs a [STREET] to stay, they can find FAC0 house over on FAC1 to be open for them to be housed there. That's [TIME], in the morning . And I also just wanted to wish everyone happy holidays as we approach [ORGANIZATION] , [LOCATION], and DATE2 ."
12_14_2017,homeless,"Code Blue was put into effect [TIME] on [DATE] , and that's going to run until [ORGANIZATION]. Code Blue, again, for us who forget and don't want to remember , it's when the forecast ed temperature in [ORGANIZATION], including wind chills, is expected to reach 20 degrees [PERSON] or lower. The goal of this is to notify as many people as possible about the cold and extreme conditions and provide information related to the health and wellness in cold weather , and publicize locations of emergency homeless shelters that are operated by area social service agencies ."
12_14_2017,homeless,"During a Code Blue alert, homeless individuals can access emergency shelter at following location : FAC0, [ADDRESS], [ORGANIZATION] . [TIME], and [ORGANIZATION] at [ADDRESS] and that is [TIME] Thank you. MR. PERSON0:"
11_19_2024,homeless,"And I don't have to know everything . But I think we owe it to the citizen s of [ORGANIZATION] to know that there is something in the works to take care of our homeless population . When they called it the unsheltered plan, you know, just say it like it is, homeless plan because that's what these people are."
11_19_2024,homeless,They're homeless . I still look for that young lady that was here the [TIME]. And she was so concern ed about her safety in the streets.
11_19_2024,homeless,"And I know that if you go down to the [ORGANIZATION] at [TIME] you see a lot of homeless people down that [STREET]. It just breaks my heart because , you know, all they could do is talk about it and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] all. But then I think, yes, there is, [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homeless,"If there's anything at all that I could do to help move this plan along, you know, I'm willing and I think I'm able to do research and to see exactly where we are. I had spoke about [PERSON]. I spoke about [PERSON] and all the work that they're doing down there for the homeless and here we are in GPE4 and I can't seem to get anything ."
11_19_2024,homeless,"Also, I wanted to talk about [TIME] I'm going to be leaving again early because I don't know why the [ORGANIZATION] meetings are calling on [ORGANIZATION] [TIME] now. But [TIME] they are talking as well about the homeless population . And they have been in discussion with the Pastor at [ORGANIZATION]."
11_19_2024,homeless,"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] It's no longer operational , but I understand that there's some conversation that's going to go on [TIME] about the homeless population in [ORGANIZATION] . And I'm not sure what -- how [ORGANIZATION] is going to be involved with it, but I do know that the ORG1 is going to be involved ."
11_19_2024,homeless,"This has been brought to your attention [ORGANIZATION], crickets . Proper signage for trucks near our low bridges in our neighborhood s, crickets . Homeless people sleeping in culverts , crickets ."
11_19_2024,homeless,"Anyone else? Mr. [PERSON] : -- PERSON1 , you guys 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] know my name. So we talk a lot about the homeless population ."
11_19_2024,homeless,"But there is two things with the homeless population . For one, a lot of these people -- okay, so how could I say this?"
11_19_2024,homeless,"I just got physically assaulted by two of them. I told you guys this at the last meeting , you know what I'm saying? So I think that we have to think about that when it comes to helping the homeless ."
11_19_2024,homeless,"Like, there's only a portion of the homeless that want help. The other portion we need to get them off the streets and lock them up honestly , you know what I'm saying because there's a lot of criminals out there that are just smoking, drinking down there at the pavilion . I told you guys I went down there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] trying to do community service trying to clean it up."
11_19_2024,homeless,"So I'll just end it off by saying this, can you please send some police down there to police the pavilion how you guys used to do [ORGANIZATION], like, stop giving the homeless people their [STREET] because a lot of these people are criminals . And that's all I got to say. Thank you."
11_19_2024,homeless,"We did fight to get that eight [STREET] section also up at Nay Aug and can't wait to see it complet [PERSON] although it's going to take some time. The homeless question was brought up [TIME] . Mr. [PERSON] , if we could reach out to the administration to see if there is an update with the homeless task force."

11_28_2023,beggar,And to hash it back and forth is utter silliness because you're just a beggar begging your government to respond to you and tell you something they want to keep secret. And it's also time for these residents to realize that you have to start watching these meeting s. You have to organize .
03_26_2024,homeless,"But we haven't had any relief from the 2.4 wage tax that the city levies on people. And, you know, you wonder what's going on with our country when you have homeless encampment s around every city and every population center in the country . And all the jobs are in [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON]."
03_26_2024,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] gets away with murder. Lastly, a lot of people have been talking about the homeless situation . And coming down to FAC0 getting off the FAC1 exit going towards FAC2 if anyone is familiar with that, about 100, 150 feet from the red light where FAC2 on the right-hand side it looks like there was a homeless camp there."
03_26_2024,homeless,"So we have [ORGANIZATION]. And we have a temple of gold, a sacrosanct walking trail of gold. So in the spirit of [LOCATION], we eject the homeless and the unclean because a walking trail is a treasure that might bring us 30 pieces of silver."
03_26_2024,homeless,There is lot to unpack [ORGANIZATION]. We supposedly have a committee for the homeless that was announce d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] in here. How many times have they met?

We heard that it exists out there but we have absolutely no website , public exposure , anything set up for it to say that it exists at all other than knowing that the police put do not trespass for the homeless on that path -- on that walking trail. Can we get some information of who is on that committee and what it actually entails and when they meet?"
03_26_2024,affordable housing,"Let them buy their own. You know, the town has one of our fire engines and they get free trash removal and there's hardly any taxes. And [ORGANIZATION] somebody was here about affordable housing ."
03_26_2024,affordable housing,"Well, how do we have affordable housing when we put up a [DATE] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 million dollar building , not in [ORGANIZATION] . It was the [ORGANIZATION] -- ORG1 . And it gets tax free for [ORGANIZATION]."
03_26_2024,homeless,That's exactly what we did. I don't think we took any belongings from anyone that was homeless because the items we picked up were frozen clothing and just garbage . It didn't belong to anybody .
03_26_2024,homeless,"But if we add all that stuff together , we really did save the city a lot of money. We made the trail look prettier . And I actually think the homeless people appreciate d"
03_26_2024,homeless,I lived [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION] . I was recently evicted on [LOCATION] . I got a lot of information about the homeless situation .
03_26_2024,homeless,"When I first got homeless , I couldn't get any information because I couldn't get my mail. And, you know, I couldn't get a lot of things because I didn't have my license . I had to renew my license ."
03_26_2024,homeless,And I found where the money goes. And I also found out about the homeless situation . There's nothing for me because I'm over [ORGANIZATION].
03_26_2024,homeless,"You got to go to [ORGANIZATION] and get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] printout . Well, the most absurd thing I got and I showed this to [ORGANIZATION] , you know, because she's telling me about, you know, there's the [ORGANIZATION], which is where everybody is complaining about all the people homeless people being."
03_26_2024,homeless,That's not all the homeless people. I'll tell you that. And then there's another -- FAC0.
03_26_2024,homeless,"[1] - 47:17 Holy [1] - 11:9 Home [1] - 58:15 home [1] - 46:23 homeless [13] - 18:15, [TIME], [TIME], 35:25, 36:8, 52:7, 53:19, 56:16, 56:17, [DATE], 59:5, 59:7 homeowner [2] - 19:8, 49:20 homeowners [1] - 24:15 homes [2] - 15:9, 70:20 honest"
10_22_2024,homeless,"[TIME] , I want to talk about the homeless community . After being unable to attend [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION], I have been watching it on the [ORGANIZATION] which they do a great job. And I wanted to know the status of the homeless community ."
10_22_2024,homeless,"Since I had not heard of anything , I'm sure that myself as well as the city residents want to know what's going on with our homeless population . As the nights have gotten colder, most of us go to our wall and turn our thermostats up. Or we say, oh, I'm not going to turn it up [TIME] because I don't want my bill to go up and they get another blanket or they put on their flannel sheet on their bed."
10_22_2024,homeless,The homeless population don't have those choices . And I wanted to know about that. So I kept listening to see if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 [DATE] 24 [ORGANIZATION] or if something was going to be in the papers about where the committee that was develop ed for the homeless committee and what the status was.
10_22_2024,homeless,"I did not hear anything . So I always think about my church and we do a homeless project of sleeping bag project . And if anyone wants to know about that, they could Google that."
10_22_2024,homeless,We do about four or five a month. So previously I've asked about showers . And I was told that the homeless people could take a shower at FAC0.
10_22_2024,homeless,"So then I started reading about the different things in the paper between GPE0GPE1GPE2, [PERSON] . They're doing great jobs in other cities, but I don't see anything in the papers about [PERSON] . In GPE0GPE1GPE2 they've begun to renovate buildings to house the homeless ."
10_22_2024,homeless,"And [ORGANIZATION] has a facility in [ORGANIZATION] that houses [TIME] people. And if I recall, they give them [TIME] meals, showers , and a [STREET] to sleep and breakfast [TIME] . Headlines for [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON] on FAC0 in [ORGANIZATION]."
10_22_2024,homeless,I did see -- I was home and I saw the young lady come up to the podium. She was homeless .
10_22_2024,homelessness,And she was concerned about her safety. In [ORGANIZATION] they have a [STREET] called FAC0. And it's a shelter for women that are experiencing homelessness .
10_22_2024,homeless,"I don't know. So then, Dr. [PERSON] , maybe you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] could address this in Fifth Order. We have talked about the number of homeless in the city, the list of facilities that are available so that I thought we were going to have a homeless czar or someone to oversee all the facilities in [ORGANIZATION] so that they could work together -- I'm sorry, I'm over my time."
10_22_2024,homeless,"And lawfare goes [STREET] up to the top. I mean, people -- yeah, they got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] everything going through the phones in the legal community . And, you know, people are talking about the homeless problem ."
10_22_2024,homeless,"The homeless problem starts with housing , [ORGANIZATION] . That has to be a communication between this body and the Mayor and [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] because I have been going to the meetings . And it -- I mean, it just doesn't seem like democracy to me."
10_22_2024,homeless,"So, I'm sorry, if [ORGANIZATION] wins, you're liable to have 40 million people roaming around the country homeless and without anything to back up on. And it's just a shame. But actually , you know, if people don't familiarize themselves with what the issues are and they run out and vote on a bunch of junk that they heard off the television ."
10_22_2024,homeless,"So that is still where we stand on the [ORGANIZATION] test. And then to respond to Miss [PERSON] and her question regarding the unsheltered and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] homeless population within [ORGANIZATION] , I haven't received any additional updates .

07_28_2020,affordable housing,PERSON0 [ADDRESS] (PERSON1) I read the paper about [ORGANIZATION] 's chief marketing exec that some people call mayor. She's marketing [ORGANIZATION] to big city people with big city paychecks to come here and work remotely in what she calls affordable housing .
07_28_2020,homeless,"Get rid of the flag and then get rid of the people. We don't need people from [ORGANIZATION] coming here to live in our “big affordable houses so they have room to stretch out like” our marketer in chief says. The people who need more space are the homeless families crammed into tiny motel rooms like [ORGANIZATION], etc."
07_28_2020,affordable housing,Everyone is building luxury apartments when families need affordable housing . We need to take care of our own. PERSON0 4:1.
07_28_2020,homeless,"I believe all taxing bodies are allowed to participate . Finally , I would ask Dr. [PERSON] to report on what the [ORGANIZATION] will provide to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] address the Homeless situation . Surely between the [ORGANIZATION], federal ORG1 funds, and far-too-many empty buildings a plan should be in [STREET] before the frigid temperatures arrive."
07_28_2020,homeless,"Incidentally , are you able to obtain current [ORGANIZATION] figures for the number of homeless in the City? ([ORGANIZATION]) I am asking for you to get a full report of every penny ORG1 spent with money they received from grants and from [ORGANIZATION] and from The University of [ORGANIZATION] ."
12_03_2018,homeless,"You can visit www. Facebook .com/ friends ofshannonmcdonough if you are interested in learning more about this event. Also, received an announcement [ORGANIZATION] about a [LOCATION] coat [STREET] at FAC0 and it reads, ""Did you know there are almost 600,000 homeless people in [ORGANIZATION]?"
12_03_2018,homelessness,"Did you know 15,000 of them live in [ORGANIZATION] ? Did you know homelessness exists in [PERSON] ? Did you know even some of our friends at FAC0 are in need?"
12_03_2018,homeless,My name is [ORGANIZATION] . I am a third grade student at [ORGANIZATION]. I recently saw many homeless people struggling to stay warm on [ORGANIZATION].
12_03_2018,homeless,"I realize that not just homeless people need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 259 our help but a lot of people in our neighbor hoods do, too. My goal is to collect [DATE] items to donate to babies, children , teenagers and adults all over [ORGANIZATION] . Please help me help those in need by donating gently used winter coats, hats, gloves, scarves and blankets."
11_09_2021,unhoused,Just to answer I think it was Miss [PERSON] 's question [ORGANIZATION] about the temperature s that are now getting into the teens and I think it was [ORGANIZATION] that you had mention ed. So Mr. [PERSON] did check into it. The City employs a [ORGANIZATION] for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] unhoused persons when the temperature reaches 20 degrees and below including windchill at FAC0 on FAC1 in [ORGANIZATION] .
05_30_2023,homeless,We did see one homeless person I think just because he was out in the middle of nowhere . And we did not see any loose dogs [ORGANIZATION]. So I was pretty happy with that.
05_30_2023,homeless,"Also, DATE0 I did ask it was also brought up in public comment about our health coordinator , our health individual . It's been I'd say [PERSON] now. I don't know where we are with the homeless population s along the expressway and other areas of the city."
05_30_2023,homeless,"I ask that we reach out to her to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] see what her take was on the homeless population that this could be or -- a health issue in [ORGANIZATION] so that's something we could also follow up on. MR. PERSON0 : I will, sir. MR."
01_31_2024,homeless,I'm officially homeless now. But I'm going to keep working on what I've -- what I know. I just know too much.
01_31_2024,homeless,"And [ORGANIZATION] used to be a very great city. But I know clearly why we have a homeless problem , why we have all the gangs here, why things don't go anywhere . It just keeps going on and on and it's readily heading toward bottom."
09_19_2023,homeless,"The [ORGANIZATION] Director also stated that the homeless are issued vouchers to use the facility at FAC0 and that they are vetted properly . Who exactly is on site if there is an issue with one of your vetted people? Mr. [PERSON], do you know the specific s of this so-called program and how it came about?"
09_19_2023,homeless,"Can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] you explain the vetting process and who does the vetting ? With the rumors swirling regarding some of the conduct inside [ORGANIZATION] with their employee s and their directors , we would feel very uncomfortable if these same people were vetting the homeless that are using FAC0. It's evident that the vetting process in [STREET] is highly lacking right now."
09_19_2023,homeless,"Let's imagine if the homeless person wasn't taken into custody selling drugs apprehended with $7,000 in our city. Imagine the violent activity that goes on in our city due to homeless population with no crime stats. We have no idea."
09_19_2023,homeless,Imagine if a homeless male didn't stab another homeless male in our city. Imagine if a homeless woman did not bite an innocent female passerby in our city. Imagine if ever a police officer visited a homeless encampment he or she didn't leave with someone in handcuffs due to outstanding warrants in our city.
09_19_2023,homeless,"Imagine if a police officer 's safety wasn't an issue, wasn't at serious risk when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] visiting a homeless camp because we have no clue now who lives here with our stellar vetting process in our city. Imagine a city where our children walk to and from school not exposed to dangerous predators living in their backyard . Imagine a city without a drug unit."
09_19_2023,homeless,Imagine a city without specialized units in its [INSTITUTION] . Imagine the homeless now using the facilities at FAC0 along side paying resident s in our city. Imagine that you have city official s currently in office facilitating these decisions putting all of our lives at risk.
09_19_2023,homeless,But [ORGANIZATION] I sent a letter to the Mayor's office regarding the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] homeless issue over on FAC0. [DATE] to and from school our [ORGANIZATION] students have to walk by that area under the pavilion . And I got a lot of reports of concerned parents about that route.
09_19_2023,homeless,"So if I have to have my own town hall there or a photo shoot there that gets people there from the city I will do that because the safety of our kids is my number one priority . DATE0 I believe it was DATE1 around 2:40, somebody was walking by and one of the homeless people bit somebody . Our student s get out around 2:50."
09_19_2023,homeless,"There's a whole little village back there from what I'm told. I spoke with one of the homeless members there. You know, there's a little village back there where they basically said you do not want to go back there."
09_19_2023,homeless,"Of course it should be -- of course city government 's number one priority . As an educator and a former board member, it's always been my priority one and also as a father. So can I sympathize with the homeless problem ?"
10_08_2024,unhoused,"[TIME] I'm bringing it. In the city where we respond to things in [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], and the case of FAC0 pool complex DATE2, we could do better. I showed up [ORGANIZATION] along with a few other people that cared to the unhoused commission meeting ."

01_18_2022,homeless; homelessness,That's for the [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] funds will be for emergency shelters for the homeless and other program s to prevent homelessness . And this is the time of year certainly where we need emergency shelters .
01_18_2022,affordable housing,"And then at [ORGANIZATION] provides funds to expand the supply of safe, decent affordable housing for low income Americans . And for any questions regarding those program s you can contact PERSON0 at PERSON1 [USER] .gov or [ORGANIZATION] [USER] .gov. That's it."
12_03_2024,homeless,"But unfortunately we don't have people to coordinate for those in need. We have homeless advisory boards that the public isn't allowed to attend who advise that they're going to do something in the future. While people suffer under the burdens of these fees, it would be nice if our local government took action to coordinate what resources are physically out there for a population in need, actually made a [STREET] where they could come together and see everything that's out there."
12_03_2024,homeless,"It serves as a [STREET] to inform the community about things such as H2O Help which are important . I talked about the food resources in the budget and the mud funds for the homeless that were $10,000 a piece that were on that list as unspent . Whether they were unspent or not, as of [ORGANIZATION], 27,111 has been spent for recycling that has been rejected and charged the higher rate by the landfill ."

05_23_2023,homeless,We're tearing houses down in neighborhoods . There's blight ruling everywhere . We've got homeless encampments everywhere.
05_23_2023,homeless,Are we going to make any provision s for homeless camps that seem to be growing around the city to get them out of the heat as we do in the cold? We put them into [ORGANIZATION]. Thank you.

05_23_2023,homeless,"And this is like torture , you know, and it's not good for the homeless situation because if I get kicked out of there, I'm homeless . And there's no two ways about it. But I would like to get in writing , you know, exactly about who owns that building 400, you know, because -- [ORGANIZATION]."
04_18_2023,homeless,"I'm here [TIME] in regards to some public health issues regarding the homeless camps. Well, first of all, the lack of running water and no toilets makes definitely an unsanitary living environment . Here's [ORGANIZATION] 's chance to step up to the plate and check and see how many children are living in those homeless camps, how many sick individual s are in need of care."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Most frequent diseases are due to the unhygienic conditions , [ORGANIZATION], HIV, AIDS, [PERSON], which spread very quickly -- the doctor can attest to that, blood born pathogens . There are large amounts of trash left behind, aren't just [ORGANIZATION] household items. Leaving these materials unattended can result in tremendous risk to both the homeless population and the people living nearby."
04_18_2023,homeless,"Check the pavilion on [DATE] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 2[DATE]2 23 [DATE] FAC0, see if you want to sit there and have a drink and a hoagie from [ORGANIZATION] or [ORGANIZATION]. Guarantee you won't. There are few of these homeless camps with propane tanks."
04_18_2023,homeless,One was discussed in public comment . DATE0 I asked Mr. [PERSON] to reach out to [ORGANIZATION] or any other members of the administration about the homeless camps that were visible along the express [STREET]. I do know that there's others.
04_18_2023,homeless,"And then I do remember [ORGANIZATION] there was a problem with the homeless camps that Mr. [PERSON] just brought up. I remember it was a huge issue on FAC0, the trail, that the big pavilion where there was a lot of needles and a lot of, you know, some unsanitary stuff and starting around [LOCATION]. And I know that there's a process for that and that was cleaned up."
04_18_2023,homeless,"But to your point about the, you know, the homeless , you know by going down there cutting all of those weeds and picking up all that garbage and cleaning up that area and kind of opening it up a little bit more, it kind of helps to open up the area so that it would lend itself to make them more visible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] which would then prevent I think from things like that happening . So and I just want to thank everyone for helping out. And I know that's going to continue ."
07_11_2023,homeless,"Thanks for the offer for an Irish coffee, maybe an Irish coffee but no beer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] for me. Now onto [ORGANIZATION] issues, we had a reference here about the health concerns and code red. Homeless and smoke health concerns by [ORGANIZATION] are City [ORGANIZATION] 's power to meet public emergencies affecting life, health, property and the public peace verified by Section [ZIP], the power and authority of the Mayor, not to enact but to enforce any emergency powers that [ORGANIZATION] may establish by ordinance to preserve health, welfare , and the safety of the citizen ry."
07_11_2023,homeless,"Fire property list, [ORGANIZATION] member Dr. [PERSON] asked the current fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] damage property list need to be expanded to include a current status, any pertinent notes, dates, timelines as available. She expressed concern over the long periods of time that the fire damage properties remain in city neighborhoods . Code red notification assistance , the city homeless population ."
07_11_2023,homeless,"City resident [ORGANIZATION] asked that the administration establish a process or protocol for assisting the city homeless population during code red declarations related to extreme heat or the recent air quality issue related to the Canadian forest fires. [ORGANIZATION] asked what the administration currently has in [STREET] and also additionally to talk to Dr. [PERSON] and see, you know, if there's a plan now that we have been through this, make sure there is some type of plan for the homeless in the future should this come out. MR. PERSON2 : I will, sir."
07_11_2023,homeless,"MR. PERSON0: Homeless camps, residents and [ORGANIZATION] ask for an update and next steps on how [ORGANIZATION] is addressing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] growing number of homeless camps along the heritage trail downtown and now extended to city neighborhoods bordering the trail if we could send over a request to the administration .

04_24_2024,homeless,"He's going to be doing PERSON0 covers. So if you're into that or if you like [PERSON] or if you just want to the support [ORGANIZATION] , please go out and attend. Speaking of which, I see a lot of great conversation with [PERSON] who is the Executive Director for [ORGANIZATION] and, you know, visit some -- some of the areas that they -- a property that they had purchased and get to know more about what they have been doing recently ."
04_24_2024,homeless,"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 [DATE] [DATE] 258 I also attended the talk that they had at [ORGANIZATION] [DATE] [TIME] regarding the homeless population in northeast [ORGANIZATION] . And that was great and learned quite a bit from that presentation too and also plan on going to the ORG1 and ORG2 to discuss more with them to see, you know, what our local organizations are working on what services -- exactly what services they offer and provide that are helping the homeless . And so I'm taking it upon myself to do that and to, you know, tour these centers and have those discussions with a lot of the people who are already doing the work."
04_24_2024,homeless,"It's sad that you get persecuted for doing the right thing and legal thing and you have to prove that you are innocent because there is a preponderance in the city that you are -- that you are actually guilty. Moving on, the homeless committee I asked [ORGANIZATION] now. I believe this is the fourth, who is on it, how long has it existed and are there minute meeting s."
04_24_2024,homeless,"And so I'm homeless . I lose [ADDRESS] it works is, these judges know that they make a ruling and it's just a matter of [ORGANIZATION] before the county sheriff comes and, you know, locks you out."
04_24_2024,homeless; affordable housing,So the city's final Home ARP Plan was submitted to and approved by [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION]. The plan includes funding additional housing and additional [INSTITUTION] s. The study did find there is a need for affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION] and multiple local and nonprofit organizations are exploring to create new shelter s including emergency shelter s and family shelters .
04_24_2024,homeless,"[1] - 57:13 home [6] - 33:22, 46:1, 46:8, 54:20, 57:11 Homeless [1] - 7:17 homeless [6] - 7:21, [DATE], [TIME], [DATE], 36:3, 57:17 homeowner"
02_18_2020,affordable housing,"So when they graduate , they need to find affordable housing . They are not getting loan money anymore plus they have the loans coming in. And if they don't get the great job and just get a regular job, they can't afford what they were paying in college ."
01_12_2017,affordable housing,"There was a number of 2[DATE] neighborhood groups, officials from the [DATE] county, and other people that are interested 1 and have a stake in [ORGANIZATION]. 2 I mentioned this before, but if even 3 furthered my understanding that this program [DATE] is going to make a major impact in this city 5 in the areas of blight, neighborhood 6 stabilization, affordable housing and 7 economic development."

07_25_2023,homeless,But the Lord said that there's nothing wrong with a wise [ORGANIZATION] . So I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] wanted to skate a couple things and ask some question s on behalf of the homeless portion of the population out here. So there has been [ORGANIZATION] some running s of officers coming and kicking people off private property which is private property I get that.
07_25_2023,homeless,"And then, you know, these program s that they offer you have to be homeless for [ORGANIZATION] and like this and that and the other third and you don't get in sometimes for [LOCATION]. And, you know, they're saying they're offering all of this stuff"
07_25_2023,homeless,"I just was really wondering because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] it's a very big concern and to put them in places like [ORGANIZATION] which is over full to start with, you know, there is not program -- programs in there, like, once you are homeless -- and I personally know once you are homeless in the system over there, like, you go get lost in translation until [STREET] down the [STREET] they find a spot open somewhere for you. And that is also an overflow with rehabs and everything is there is a lot of overflow with all of that right now and there is a problem going on with people needing new places. So I was just wondering if there is any type of counsel I can get from you guys of anyway to go about this or if there is any other -- other ways that you guys could help?"
07_25_2023,homeless,"and then they finally got me into a program that only houses about 16 resident s. And like, you know, but, you know, then the turnover rate on that is on the person when they are able to get out and everything and move on from there. But the point is, is these places, these organizations are supposed to be helping in ways and that's the reason why some homeless [ADDRESS] they are being treated ."
07_25_2023,homeless,"If we have rehabilitation in this city, that would help these homeless people get clean. That's part of the solution . Two, we need more space in the shelter ."
07_25_2023,homeless,"And don't judge a book by its cover because the messenger -- it says this in the Bible. The messenger , God can use anybody . God can use a homeless man off the streets."
07_25_2023,homeless,I'm homeless right now. Do you understand ? But I have a lot of influence .
07_25_2023,homeless,"But I need you guys to work with me as [ORGANIZATION] to make it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [TIME] happen for these people because what's going to happen is, if you guys don't listen to the homeless people, it's not just going to be three homeless people in this crowd. It's going to be like dozens of us coming up here to ORG1 . And a lot of them are angry and upset, you want to know why?"
07_25_2023,affordable housing,"But there was a little bit of confusion in the beginning like Mr. [PERSON] said. But also like Mr. [PERSON] said, there is a possibility for us to use that, so it's still something that is still on the table. PERSON2: To follow up with the last two speakers I have been doing some research what the [ORGANIZATION] funding can be used for and one of the things was for affordable housing ."
07_25_2023,affordable housing,"Well, I just want to know if that is being address ed in any ways, any of the funding being considered for affordable housing . Is that even an issue that this city has considered ? DR."
07_25_2023,affordable housing,So there are various programs . But we do need to do a better job of creating more affordable housing in the city because it is definitely a problem . PERSON0: And especially with the [STREET] that the prices have gone up.
07_25_2023,homeless,"DATE0 I saw a little light coming from up there. Mr. [PERSON], I did appreciate the fact that you pointed out that homeless people are people. And we have a lot of problems in our country ."
07_25_2023,homeless,"And when I see somebody I -- that's homeless , I start thinking , gee, you know, that looks a lot like somebody whose job was just handed out [ORGANIZATION] with an excuse like you could go to school or do something -- pays the bills while you go to school. We really need to pay more attention to fellow Americans and bring them up. Dr. [PERSON] , I sympathize with you with a lot of the gut you take."
07_25_2023,homeless,"And [PERSON] and I both met with Chief PERSON1 earlier . And we had a good conversation , a good starting point to address the issue of the homeless population within [ORGANIZATION] . And, you know, I certainly do feel for the people who are homeless and we're not unique in this problem in our city."
07_25_2023,homeless,"I, you know, do certainly agree that the police should be respectful of people when in the community and the homeless community Chief PERSON0 did assure us that they are being respectful in handling it in the best possible [STREET] that they are not targeting people but they are just working to address when crimes or complaint s are brought to them. And it -- drug prevention and trespassing , you know, people are on private property . So those issues they are working to address and not, you know, they're not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] just kick people out of their tents or take away their things."
07_25_2023,homeless,So I do agree that we need more shelters and we need more opportunities to help get people out of being homeless and interested in seeing what [STREET] we could help as a city to do that. I don't have a clear answer on that [TIME] or the best solution for it. But it is certainly a priority of mine.

10_17_2023,homeless,We have three homeless guys threw a women in the river DATE0 who was bringing food. Anybody address that? You might want to look into that because you all seem to think that it's okay for the homeless people to be in our town.
10_17_2023,homeless,"MR. PERSON0 : Thank you, Mr. [PERSON] . Mr. [PERSON] , can you, please reach out to the [INSTITUTION] and inquire about three homeless people throwing a women in the river who brought them food?"
10_17_2023,homeless,"We're protecting the children , that's why there is no record. Why is there no videotaping of [ORGANIZATION] meeting DATE0? Why is there no record of what happens in the magistrate [STREET] because hundreds and thousands of people are being evicted and they become homeless"
10_17_2023,homeless,"and then it becomes another problem . What are we going to do with the homeless and the police? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] We need new leadership locally , city and county."
10_17_2023,homeless,"You know, you guys are doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] the best you possibly can. Number three would be safety. There's a little village by [ORGANIZATION] of homeless individuals ."
10_17_2023,homelessness,"But I did hear of the lady biting somebody around our kids. And as an individual who does want to stand for the city and I am despite everything , that gentleman deserves to be protected if he's -- he's getting paid from us to protect and serve. You know, but our children deserve to have a safe educational environment to thrive in, you know, without all that homelessness ."
12_06_2022,homeless,So I'm not sure what the gentleman said about the safety. And one of the things was that they -- I hate to call them [STREET] people but the homeless people there -- I could pick up a little bit of what he was saying but I'll have to wait until I get home I guess to hear that.
11_09_2023,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], I'm not sure if that's going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] be used again for the emergency shelter . But I'm very involve d with that. Although I'm not [PERSON] but I have closer relationship s with the homeless all over 24/7."
11_09_2023,homeless,And [ORGANIZATION] is a beautiful area where we've done service s with the homeless . We've actually taken -- many of them have been baptize d them in the river. But to put church aside we don't push God on people.
11_09_2023,homeless,"So if you're building a thousand units, a hundred of them have to be set aside for low income or you don't get to build those building s.[ADDRESS], you've got to put in teeth in there to make people actually force builder s who make the money to put some of it back in. Thank you."
07_27_2021,homeless,"We lost everything . It took [ORGANIZATION] of legal wrangling before the [ORGANIZATION] bought the property . Now, during that [LOCATION] period, my parents who were homeless continued to pay taxes and insurance on a condemned building ."
07_27_2021,homeless,"So this should have been put out to bid. Like I said, the money I think would be better spent, you know, instead of education awareness I'm all about that. But I think the money would be better spent towards the mental health and homeless ness issues that were brought forth from the pandemic instead of the education and awareness piece that could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] possibly -- or probably be done in kind by the three big hospital s in [ORGANIZATION] that already serve our community ."
07_22_2019,affordable housing,"I lived on [ORGANIZATION], which I guess you figured out from my accent. I lived in [PERSON]. And I see the one thing that [ORGANIZATION] has that the other places don't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] is beautiful affordable housing ."
04_28_2020,homeless,THIRD ORDER. 3-A.

MINUTES OF THE [ORGANIZATION] BOARD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 255 MEETING HELD DATE0.
10_29_2024,homeless,"But that doesn't stop us from tabling it for [ORGANIZATION] to see where this actually plays out. Remember the [ORGANIZATION] health manager, $140,000 a year from [ORGANIZATION] whose contribution was to print or have ORG1 put up links from other agencies , attend the Mayor's meeting s as a health 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] showpiece while ignoring the homeless , still a thing. For $210,000 did we ever have one recommendation from our and not a handout of other people's work?"
10_29_2024,homeless,"We've -- I mean, at least over the course of [ORGANIZATION] had many discussions about the homeless and unsheltered population within [ORGANIZATION] . And it's particularly important to me that we do everything as a city to be able to help them and to house the homeless and to identify the issues that we have in the city, you know, the primary one being just like a lack of shelters and enough places for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] homeless to be able to go."

07_18_2023,homeless,"I know that she goes and takes stuff from federal sites, pamphlets and has them posted for employee s because obviously those informational pamphlet s from [ORGANIZATION] or from the ORG1 can't be found anywhere else and need to be pulled by a $120,000 per person to be put up on the website to say, look, I'm doing something . My question is, rather than going out to these Mayor health meeting s and talking about cigarette smoking , alcohol use and [LOCATION], has she gone out and actually visited the homeless ? Has she gone to the food shelters ?"
07_18_2023,homeless,"How are these homeless people going to get the web pages? How are they going to look up the information for when a code red is? As far as I know, the homeless down there don't have internet connection s."
07_18_2023,homeless,The homeless are still running rampant . The guy that escaped from the prison on the murder was found in a homeless camp. We don't know who is in the city.
07_18_2023,homeless,It's not fair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] for our police officer s to have to go down into a homeless camp and not know what they are up against . It's not fair for any one of us. When are you going to address the homeless issue?
07_18_2023,homeless,"That might offend people so we can't -- now the government owns all the media. This is it, you know. So I'm mad that it just keeps going on, especially the homeless thing."
07_18_2023,homeless,"And you hear people talking about the homeless . And this body is most responsible for it because you are the body that decides [ORGANIZATION] and they've been the same commissioners for [ORGANIZATION]. And they -- it all comes down to what they're doing to the people in [ORGANIZATION] , which is, oh, you disobeyed your lease's terms."
07_18_2023,homeless,"Well, does anybody look at the lease terms, not Judge [PERSON] in the magistrate [STREET], not Judge [PERSON] in [LOCATION] because they don't even know. They don't even know about the [DATE] Landlord Tenant Act. We got homeless people."
07_18_2023,homeless,"They get evicted right away because that's a setup with the district attorney being the [ORGANIZATION] attorney and this judge that, you know, that he has right in their pocket and thousands of people and they are homeless . There's -- it's a shame on the city."
07_18_2023,homeless,"So I hope that helps with that. The other thing is the homeless situation , [ORGANIZATION] has been dealing with this constantly . I spoke to Chief PERSON0 about it."
07_18_2023,homeless,"And I flat out asked him, you know, what are you guys doing about this? And he explained to me how they do provide the homeless people with places that they could go to. They advise them of all the health risks, especially with the smoke and stuff."
07_18_2023,homeless,They do try to help these people all the time. This is through the entire country . This isn't just [ORGANIZATION] where homeless people come.
07_18_2023,homeless,There are a lot of things that we can do and the city is providing the homeless people with as much as we can right now. But there are plans to do even more. But we just can't go down and push them around.
07_18_2023,homelessness,And [ORGANIZATION] does just have the code blue for those experiencing homelessness . The wild fires are relatively a new issue to address . But it's their understanding that there are two drop-in shelter s within [ORGANIZATION] for displaced persons and those include FAC0 at [ADDRESS].
07_18_2023,homeless,"I don't know with regards to if she's visited the homeless shelters or homeless camps but we could certainly ask about that. MR. PERSON0: Thank you, Dr. [PERSON] . Mr. [PERSON] ."
11_12_2024,homeless,"And, you know, Mr. [PERSON], I'd like you in the next meeting to tell all the residents in this city how much money out of the sale of [ORGANIZATION] went to pensions , let all the people in this city know and exactly where that money went, okay? Let's really know how much really went there. And let's not talk about borrowed money that went there, okay, let's really talk about the beating that the residents took and now, you know something , there was a conversation here about the homeless having to pay $2.50 to take a shower at FAC0 I believe it was."
11_12_2024,homeless,"I see in the budget that care continues for the unsheltered as we have in the [ORGANIZATION] budget, 10,000 unspent for the hunger initiative and 10,000 dollars for the homeless outreach initiative . Nothing spent. I see why people are upset when they look at the numbers , especially the unions."
11_12_2024,homeless,Are you also aware that the homeless camps are back? Do you know anything about the rescues lately of the homeless people that have been in the underground culverts ? There is probably six of them within [ORGANIZATION] that are stuck in the underground culverts .
11_12_2024,homeless,"[6] - 5:14, 5:21, [DATE], 6:2, 6:6, 6:12 hold [1] - 64:15 hole [2] - 14:22, 24:1 holidays [1] - 11:23 home [1] - 21:1 homeless [4] - 20:22, 26:9, 33:5, 33:7 homeowner [1] - 14:20 honest [1] - 12:11 hope [6] - 18:10, [DATE], 25:10, 35:4, 35:8, 35:12 hopefully [3] - 7:10, 23:4, 40:6 horrible [1] - 34:1 hospital"
06_06_2023,homeless,"And then, of course, there's the homeless which we all try to ignore. They're outside 24/7. I would very much like to know if only [ORGANIZATION] what the administration decided to do and what they did to protect the public because I think this is a public health issue and a serious one."
06_06_2023,soup kitchen,"And we're either -- well, 37 percent is [ORGANIZATION] figures for tax exempts . And if somebody is unable or unwilling to provide a pilot -- and I don't want to see people going hungry turned away from the soup kitchen or something just because they donated a couple of bucks to [ORGANIZATION] that they would sign on to petition the state to begin to replace some of these tax losses. It's too much."
06_06_2023,homeless,"Indemnity escrow with [ORGANIZATION] is $4,416,954.99. A request was submitted to city public health coordinator for [ORGANIZATION] department report. [ORGANIZATION] also asked if the office would assist in any [STREET] regarding the city homeless population , which I believe that Mr. [PERSON] had asked about that."
11_26_2024,homeless,"But it is the initiative as well as the character that makes a great leader. As we all know, there is a homeless pandemic not only in [ORGANIZATION], but across the whole country . Now, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] lived with these people so I could never look down on them."
11_26_2024,homeless,"They are human just like you and I. I've come up with a solution to fight against the poverty in our country . As a musician and an activist , I've chosen to use my gifts and talents to raise funds and be able to provide the proper resources needed to help the homeless population ."
11_26_2024,homeless,"So when we talk about that snow storm hitting , my question -- the question that comes to my mind is what about the homeless ? What are we doing? Do you understand ?"
11_26_2024,homeless,"So one second -- [ORGANIZATION] is [LOCATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is upon us. Again, if we say we are leaders and we are here for the people, then please expand and build bigger shelters until we are able to deport some of the illegals in our country . I thank you for your time."
11_26_2024,homeless,"So, ma'am, if you ever want anyone to help the homeless , we do have that outside of the [ORGANIZATION] and all of that. So thank you guys for your time. MR. PERSON0: Thank you."
11_26_2024,homeless,And I am standing here [TIME] as well about the homeless population as well. I have to thank Dr. [PERSON] for the information that she did pass onto me. And I was able to look into that and do some more research on it.
11_26_2024,homeless,Someone asked me why do you do what I do. I've never been homeless . But I have been hungry.
11_26_2024,homeless,"So maybe pause I was hungry growing up that I have such a desire that these people that are homeless , you know, find someplace . When it snowed [ORGANIZATION] someone asked me, [ORGANIZATION], what happened when the people, you know, that were in the [STREET] when it snowed? I said, I don't know because I didn't see anything about a Code Blue."
11_26_2024,homeless,"But they continuously ask me about the homeless . And they're quite concerned . So, Dr. [PERSON] , when you sent me the informati on, that information has to get out to the public."
11_26_2024,homeless,"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] You know, I didn't want to read everything that you had sent because I wasn't sure exactly how and what I should do with it. So anything that has to be said about the homeless should be said from the podium so that all of the people in [ORGANIZATION] can hear what is being done or if there's nothing being done. You know, I can't say that anybody that wants to know get in your car and go down to -- down by FAC0 down there on FAC1, is it?"
11_26_2024,homeless,"And you will see. Your heart will break. So as we prepare to go for [ORGANIZATION] and we probably all have our turkeys ready to go, there's quite a few meals that are going to be passed out on [ORGANIZATION] to the homeless population or someone who just doesn't want to or have the facilities to have a dinner with someone ."
11_26_2024,homeless,But the difference in the homeless people and most of us here is that we'll enjoy our meal. We'll enjoy the turkey. We'll enjoy the stuffing .
11_26_2024,homeless,"But we'll get up and we'll pat our bellies and we'll go in and we'll sit in [DATE] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 2[DATE]2 23 [DATE] the warm living room and watch football , put our feet up in the recliner . But the homeless do not have that luxury. So, you know, I can't stop thinking about it, maybe because like I said because I did go to bed hungry when I was young."
11_26_2024,homeless,"And we just need to do something about the homeless population , not just give them a meal, but to provide a roof over their head. So the second thing I wanted to ask you about and, you know, Mr. [PERSON], maybe this is addressed to you. I do get text messages from residents up on [ORGANIZATION] about the park that's going up."
11_26_2024,homeless,We're looking at [ORGANIZATION] and we're looking at [LOCATION] . And everyone is somewhat aware in the back of their mind of the homeless and the hungry in the city. It's always been an issue here.
11_26_2024,homeless,"And some of us might be going out for dinners and sitting down, it is true that some of us are going to be unfortunate and not have that capability . I ask during the Recovery Act funds to take a look at putting more money to the homeless at the food kitchens because not only through [ORGANIZATION] but through the entire period of time afterwards there's been a great demand in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] this community . It seems that a tiki bar at FAC0 is more important than feeding the hungry."
11_26_2024,homeless,And that's an unfortunate statement to have to make about his city. [ORGANIZATION] had mentioned that she wasn't aware of how the homeless sleep. They sleep on cardboard that they scavenge when they could scavenge it.
11_26_2024,homeless,"And they weren't being taken for the use of tooling around their entire worldly possessions . They were taken back into the woods, turned sideways so that the homeless can put wood and logs inside of them and then cook on top of them. They became a portable cooking stove for the homeless who had nothing to cook on."
11_26_2024,homeless,"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] It allowed them to not have to try to light a fire in the dirt and mud and to control that fire by having a metal shopping cart to keep those flames and to have something to cook on or to put a pot of water on to make hot tea, hot coffee or hot ramen soup. It's an unfortunate situation . And unfortunately the homeless -- [ORGANIZATION], the unsheltered task force has done virtually nothing except say we have a plan that was presented by the county groups."
11_26_2024,homeless,"But the greatest gift of all comes from [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] for our 33 percent tax increase for [ORGANIZATION] that none of you elected official s commented on or questioned . Regarding the homeless , maybe someone could reach out to a local realtor . We have enough of them in the city, ask if anyone has a warehouse space that they could contribute for [LOCATION]."
11_26_2024,homeless,"Does that also pertain to loitering and the homeless and will that follow state [STREET] ruling that we have on file for that now? Have [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] . MR. PERSON0: Thank you."
11_26_2024,homeless,"All of these situations as far as the homeless are concerned , like, I was almost homeless because the house burned. It was a rental. But the point in being that everybody heads towards the city when they become homeless ."
11_26_2024,homeless,"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] So we did ask about the unsheltered homeless situations in the city, particularly I asked about the [ORGANIZATION] corridor , FAC1 on FAC2 and [PERSON] . And I asked do we have an update and when is the homeless task force meeting ? And the answer that I got back was that [ORGANIZATION] constantly monitors areas where these individuals gather."

03_19_2024,homeless,DATE0 I was disturbed when Mr. [PERSON] explained how the homeless have to get paperwork to verify their homeless . DATE1 we saw a man who used to be somewhat coherent but he tended to ramble while trying to get some help. DATE1 he stood here for [TIME] trying to focus on a single 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] thought .
03_19_2024,homeless,"No one cared. But that's the Christian thing to do to the unclean . We suddenly have a homeless advisory committee , but we have no idea where and when the meetings are and who's on it."
03_19_2024,homeless,"Oh, or was that someone else who decided it was easier to use the law to wash his hands of the matter. Last, we have a group of another nonprofit who came in who wants to take free land from [ORGANIZATION] and make it nontaxable to help the homeless . Why would they do that?"
03_19_2024,homeless,"Because there's a lot of money in funding in sheltering the homeless . Why is the city not using the land or securing the land for homeless building the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] equivalent of a hotel of tiny structures .

09_12_2023,homeless,Why weren't they offered hotel rooms? Were they not worthy of hotel rooms? But you'll give vouchers to the homeless to use [ORGANIZATION].
09_12_2023,homeless,"Now, I don't speak on this too frivolously . Actually on [TIME], that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] marked the 12th anniversary of a devastating flood that wiped out my own house DATE0, rendered me homeless and my family homeless for some time. And I'm very aware of what it's like to lose everything to a flood, a flood that by all accounts shouldn 't have happened ."
09_12_2023,homeless,"And further consideration , that's how easy it is to become homeless. So when we approach the homeless people in our community , think about one bad storm, one car accident , all it takes. But we as a city need to do what we can to prevent as much as we can adverse weather and extreme weather conditions which we all know are tied to climate change."
09_12_2023,homeless,"I said three words. And the last time -- you know, my last eviction which I'm still dealing with with [STREET] process ; but it's -- it's the number one thing that's making people homeless ."
04_25_2023,homeless,"So, Mr. [PERSON] , please send correspondence to the administration that we need to get the playground fixed there. There's a slide with, like, a crack 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] in it. There seems to be, you know, maybe a homeless person that took up shelter in part of the playground too."
04_25_2023,homeless,"The new auditor [ORGANIZATION], per [ORGANIZATION], City Finance Director , [ORGANIZATION] office advised ORG2 that we'll have the contract by [ORGANIZATION]. PERSON1 , enforcement , [ORGANIZATION] , [PERSON] were notified of the increase in homeless issues and encampments in the areas of FAC0, FAC1 and FAC2, FAC3 in addition to other known areas and will increase visits and enforce ment in those areas. PERSON2, [ORGANIZATION] was schedule d to visit the 900 block of [PERSON] for ]preliminary work on [LOCATION]."
04_25_2023,homeless,"MR. PERSON0 : All right. Mr. [PERSON] , I'm just going to make one more request . For [ORGANIZATION] we've been asking about the tents and the homeless camps."
03_05_2024,affordable housing,"And I heard them talking about affordable housing , which was my big thing when they were ripping down all the houses. One of the questions I might want to ask is if anybody thought of if they're going to build smaller homes on some empty lots of looking into maybe modular homes. I think modular homes are much cheaper ."
03_05_2024,homeless,"I've been homeless now for [ORGANIZATION]. And I'd like to report to the city about what it's like. These are the same clothes I had on [ORGANIZATION] ago, same thing."
03_05_2024,homeless,"They're asking, you know, provide the papers. I was amazed. There's actually a paper that you have to provide when you become homeless ."
03_05_2024,homelessness,It's called proof of homelessness paper. And I got one. It took a long time to get one.
10_06_2020,affordable housing,Please have the mayor stop telling New Yorkers (and everyone within the sound of her voice) that [ORGANIZATION] has affordable housing . It’s not true. Any financial advisor will tell you that your housing should not be more than 25% of your income.

01_07_2019,homeless,"I also would like to discuss the vaping epidemic and what we might be able to do legislative to curb that so I will ask my colleagues if we can schedule that meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] with [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION]. Mrs. [PERSON] brought up [TIME] two points, number one, the homeless population and what the city's policy is or the [INSTITUTION] 's policy, and the opioid crises. I think at this point we should probably invite, if my colleagues would agree, Chief [PERSON] in to discuss both of these topics, especially the opioid crises, we have had, as has been pointed out in the newspaper , multiple tragic overdoses over [LOCATION]."
01_07_2019,homeless,"so if we can get a status on when we should receive something and if even if it's not a final living document is there anything they could share with us that we could explain or leak out to the public because , you know, this isn't going away and that bolder is only getting closer. And echoing what Mr. [PERSON] said about Mrs. [PERSON] 's comment , I think that's an excellent idea to get Chief PERSON2 in here on both issues, the homeless issue that we have is no where near the epidemic that is some areas, but that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] doesn't mean we don't have one and that doesn't mean that what we have we can't do better, so it's a good starting point to know where we are at and what we actually do about it current ly. And the opioid epidemic , you know, I was one of the first people on the record saying this [ORGANIZATION] about how that devastates not only families but communities and our entire area and, you know, any life we can save is worth all of the efforts that we can put into it because it's an awful situation ."
01_07_2019,homeless,"And while we are waiting for Chief PERSON0 to free up a chunk of time to come and meet with us if it's not too much to ask of him could he send us the policy that he currently has and enforced with [ORGANIZATION] for caring for, managing our homeless population in the city as well as the policy for administering [ORGANIZATION], kind of centraled around the training , how we log it once it's used and do we have any follow-up in [STREET] for the recipients .

09_26_2023,homeless,Can we please have an update on FAC0? When can the public tour the facility and will the homeless people also be given vouchers to use this particular facility ? Can I present some pictures ?
09_26_2023,homeless,"And I did speak with him out in the hallway . And in listening to him I kind of understand what he's talking about because I'm also concerned about a lot of the prevention aspects of things, especially where homeless is concerned . I did go to a meeting a while ago because it was listed in the paper on [ORGANIZATION]."
09_26_2023,homeless,"So some of the rules of safety are developed through foundation al development of basic skills to support a transit ion to a larger and higher risk skills. And the reason I bring this up is, I believe if we can have a foundation on the ground with the homeless encampment s that it would provide a better transition to living as a productive and contributing member of society . So if as resident s who pay taxes and live by rules, why should the homeless be exempt from rules and laws?"
09_26_2023,homeless,"I believe that when the subject of who is responsible and who has jurisdiction and whose land is it and this one is going to call that one and then none of that helps with the homeless and the residents are keeping the city safe. So in light of the nature to care about people and seeing so much online with hardships within the city and paying more attention now to [ORGANIZATION] meetings , etc., you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] know, it's very hard to see the deterioration of my once wonderful city. You know, I went to high school here."
09_26_2023,homeless,and it's community across the board. It's an initiative that could possibly be an answer in part and bring collective agencies truly together for the common good all of people regardless of beliefs . It's a development of community between the homeless community and the residential community .
09_26_2023,homeless,So what I would like to do is to -- so how do we get there? There is video program s being utilize d to help homeless in similar areas.
09_26_2023,homeless,And it's basically out of [ORGANIZATION] . And my interpretation would be something like a rehabilitation homeless camp. The first thing you would have to do since they are where they are that you would need to meet them on the ground.
09_26_2023,homeless,"And you can't have drugs or alcohol . Your campsite has to be clean and tidy for inspections , etc., because if it's not their land, then they could go unless they want to play by rules. And if you make your [DATE] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 2[DATE]2 23 [DATE] homeless encampment more of a rehabilitative type encampment , then that word is going to get out because right now it's a free-for-all in [ORGANIZATION] ."
09_26_2023,homeless,So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] can we look into whether the city is providing voucher s for the homeless to use FAC0 facilities ? MR. PERSON0 : I will. MR.
09_26_2023,homeless,"Also, maybe we could have [ORGANIZATION] , they're our numbers experts since they stated [ORGANIZATION] they really don't have anything going on until DATE1 with their third rollout in [DATE] to go over there to the city's legal department and give them a math lesson, five times eight equals forty. Next, so during [ORGANIZATION]'s meeting it was made mention of vouchers being issued to [ORGANIZATION] 's homeless populations for the [ORGANIZATION] shower areas. I believe it was stated by someone here that the homeless people utilizing these voucher s were being vetted."
09_26_2023,homeless,Do they sympathize with the homeless and their struggles ? Yes. I sympathize too with the homeless and their struggles .
09_26_2023,homeless,"Why can't there be a schedule for this after the swim schedule ? So is there a [STREET] to schedule it where, you know, they have -- they pay their membership in, they do their swim time and their therapeutic and their exercise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] piece and then, you know, rotate that with the homeless that are using the facilities . And a final question , how long are these vouchers good for, [ORGANIZATION], [LOCATION], DATE2?"
09_26_2023,homeless,"Number three, a few resident s came to me -- so to piggyback on that, residents ask [ORGANIZATION] to advise on what vetting process is used for the homeless population that are allowed to stay and use the FAC0 facility . The answer we got back because this was posed [ORGANIZATION] is, please stay tuned for an answer to this question . I don't know what that means."
09_26_2023,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] reached out to the administration per request of [ORGANIZATION] ORG1 Director in addition to parents and ORG2 student s that are -- ORG3 please concentrate regular patrols on FAC0 between FAC1 and ORG2 due to the growing amount of homeless on the blocks in addition to code enforce ment reviewing the properties and yards along the blocks.

04_11_2023,homeless,In my lease it is written that all the county and city and state amenities are suppose d to be unbiasedly handled by my landlord and yet it is not. They have the magistrate judge right in their pocket. And they take me and they've taken hundreds of other people and people become homeless .
04_11_2023,homeless,"And I just got the appeal in [ORGANIZATION] . I'm trying to move it to federal [STREET]. But there's a big problem with [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION], ORG2 colluding to make old people and disabled people homeless ."
02_11_2019,homelessness,"MR. PERSON0: Just two brief items. The homelessness was brought up, and I did receive a memorandum from the mayor."
02_11_2019,homeless,"This meeting was taking [STREET] -- the timing kind of got thrown off from some of our meetings with a couple of items getting changed , but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] it's been reported that there currently isn't a shelter in the city when it gets cold because of a couple of shelters did close so this memorandum states that [ORGANIZATION] will be available for use as a [INSTITUTION] by [ORGANIZATION] in adverse weather condition s when the temperature is below 15 degrees and when they anticipate having to shelter 20 or more individuals . The facilities will be open for the [ORGANIZATION] from [TIME] until [TIME] The [ORGANIZATION] will be required to have adequate staff on hand for the entire duration of the stay and the rules, regulations for the mission will be implement ed and enforced ."
04_17_2024,homeless,"and it's still there. It's a former homeless camp that was broken up, I guess. And it's a mess."
04_17_2024,homelessness,There is no -- things have been wrong for too long. And the people talk a lot about the homelessness problem . I will say my opinion is that it's all [ORGANIZATION] fault.
04_17_2024,homeless,"First off, I had asked [ORGANIZATION] since there is evidently a homeless group and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [TIME] meeting s that were held, I had asked and Mr. [PERSON] said he would look forward to finding out who was on these actual Mayor's homeless group, where they meet, and if there were any minutes from that. And if you've gotten a response back, you could give me that in Fifth Order. Off to -- off the paper."
04_17_2024,homeless,"MS. PERSON0: Hi. I'm [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] resident . And I'm here to put my two cents in for the homeless problem that we've got going on."
04_17_2024,homeless,"So this a my plan, [ORGANIZATION] recover y campground by [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 2532 resident . I believe we as a city have the capacity to fully address the homeless blight that is currently in our town. While we have service s and resources available in the city, it appears there is something missing between the services provided and a positive result on the end of the homeless person."
04_17_2024,homeless,"I was happy to hear one success story DATE0 at the meeting . I believe if we have a foundation structured within the existing homeless encampments, it would provide a better transition for when they become a contributing member of society . I believe this should be a goal that can be met if structure d properly with the existing services currently on hand."
04_17_2024,homelessness,"We are living with the awareness of catastrophic results when rules and laws are not applied if its residents who pay taxes and live by rules and obey laws then we should all be held accountable to the same sets of rules and laws. And the question arises and the debate continues to this land it is and jurisdiction in regards to enforcement . But in the interim , there is nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] being done to alleviate the homelessness and help the resident s or keep the city safe."
04_17_2024,homeless,"The plan I see is a visionary long-term developing inclusive and it promotes a community in the city. A pilot initiative for [ORGANIZATION] , this will further utilize collective service s, collective agencies working in tandem for the common good of all humanity . A natural development of community between the homeless and the residen tial community can be establish ed with a comprehensive plan."
04_17_2024,homeless,"People with skills can help with small project s within the city. Examples of those are painting , grass cutting , shoveling elderly sidewalks, etc. There are endless opportunities for the homeless to give back to the community that is helping them."
04_17_2024,homeless,"This allows better insight into the city's homeless as to what is needed and in what capacity . This affords efficient ways to allocate funds to be most effective in resolving or providing tangible solutions to alleviate this plight. The natural progression is the trickle down of a program that once the word is out it will deter illicit behaviors and actions and more importantly signal a [STREET] for the people, especially women with children , and unfortunately , children can be safe and receive meaningful help, a [STREET] one can go to recovery ."
04_17_2024,homeless,"It gives the city a better direction on how to bridge the gap between homeless and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] returning them to productive members of society and part of the community and resident s will know who is here, where, and clearly why. And rules and structures equal success . MR. PERSON0: Thank you."
04_17_2024,homeless,"So a lot of people out here being homeless don't know what to ask for. And sometime s they stay homeless because they don't know what to ask for. But I figured it out, you know, but it took me a long time."
04_17_2024,homeless,"I'm still waiting to get my license . It's been [ORGANIZATION]. So I just, you know, my question is that if there is any, you know, maybe we could work together or something on this because I think it is a big project for a lot of homeless ."
04_17_2024,homeless,"Maybe some people won't be homeless if they had an idea of where to go to stop the homeless . MR. PERSON0: Perhaps if you -- it sounds like you're familiar with some of the local support groups, [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and some of the other groups in town."
04_17_2024,homeless,"PERSON0: Yeah, that's why I'm here because , I mean, I was homeless for a long time. But some of it was my fault because I didn't know what to ask for."
04_17_2024,homeless,"And that's how I'm a success story. But I would like to find out -- since you guys have these programs if there is any other program s that maybe would make it easier, you know, for some of these people to not be homeless anymore because I know that's our goal, right, is for people not to be homeless because it really knocks you down to a point where some people don't ever come back. But I came back because I was strong to do it."
04_17_2024,homeless,It may be [ORGANIZATION]. We're planning to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] caucus to meet with some of the local representative s to really discuss the homeless issue to try to come up with some thought s and ideas on how we as a community may be able to address some of the issues facing the homeless in our area and try to look for positive solutions to the problem . MR.
04_17_2024,homeless,"On it says, our third [ORGANIZATION] talk is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] away. This is [PERSON] so sorry for the post date. This [ORGANIZATION] talk will explore the root causes of homeless and poverty in [ORGANIZATION]."
04_17_2024,homelessness,"It's a multifaceted problem . And with multifaceted problems such as homelessness , such as issues with gangs, there's got to be multifaceted answers. So those are my thoughts [TIME] ."
04_17_2024,homelessness,"And, you know, it seems like some of the major issues in our city right now are both violent crimes and gangs and then also with the homelessness . And I just wanted to say I really appreciate the people that come here and that do offer suggestions and they want to find ways to help. And we have just such a strong community and to have people do that, I'm really appreciative of that."
04_17_2024,homeless,And I don't know was he -- is he already going to be present for the caucus where we will be discussing the homeless ? MR. PERSON0: I believe we're just going to ask them for their opinions -- DR.

The question I had about the homeless population during the heat wave, [ORGANIZATION], I believe this was yours. The response from the administration is there are many nonprofit organizations that assist with unsheltered population s and have supplies at their location to help mitigate the heat."
07_02_2024,homeless,"[4] - 11:9, 23:8, 26:9, 35:7 homeless [1] - 59:3 honor [2] - 21:25, 22:19 honoring [1] - 19:13 hope [8] - 5:6, [LOCATION], [DATE], 19:3, 48:19, 50:3, 60:13, 66:7 hopeful [1] - 9:8 hopefully [2] - 40:24, 56:15 hoping [2] - 8:12, [DATE] hose [1] - 28:8 hospitals [1] - 33:15 hot [1] - 32:17 hotel [1] - 20:25hour [2] - 16:13, [TIME]"
03_10_2020,homeless,And that's great. But one element of our community that I think is not often considered and is virtually invisible is our homeless population . And those are the ones I would worry about.
03_10_2020,homeless,"I don't know how many we have. I'm sure we have quite a few. Let me ask you something , where does a homeless person go to wash their hands."
03_10_2020,homeless,"So I want to thank them for that. But in addition to that, they did a great presentation . But with regard to Mrs. [PERSON] 's question , I'm sorry her question and for seniors information can we, you know, forward that and say what's the plan -- maybe there is a plan that we don't know about and Mrs. [PERSON] 's question or concern about the homeless ."
03_10_2020,homeless,"I know, you know, there are a couple events cancelled [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] being one of them [LOCATION] and a majority of them are homeless . So it's an issue maybe it is addressed I'm not aware of, just relay that to the Chief and, if not, they could address that for us. Testing kits, I don't know about testing kits."
02_25_2019,homelessness,"The reschedule d caucus [ADDRESS] [ORGANIZATION], at 5:15 to discuss the topics of homelessness in the city and the opioid epidemic . Also, [ORGANIZATION], at [TIME] we will hold a public hearing for Item 6-A on [TIME] 's agenda, the installation of ""No Parking "" signs along FAC0 along the bike lanes at the trail crossings near FAC1 . MR. PERSON2 : I have one additional ."
02_25_2019,homelessness,"I'm sure you guys don't have an issue with moving it from out here. Let them know that we want to move our [ORGANIZATION] to chambers and that if you want to make [ORGANIZATION] aware, [ORGANIZATION] aware if they can be here to get that televised for everybody to seen. And, again, that meeting is going to be regarding the homelessness and the opioid situation and kind of how many the city police and [ORGANIZATION] what they plan -- not what they plan to do but what plans are [ADDRESS] and how they handle things along those two fronts."
05_21_2024,unhoused,"The last several murders in the city have not been committed by any military veterans . They have been committ ed by [STREET] gangs. On [ORGANIZATION] -- and this is what this handout is all about -- DATE1, at [TIME], [ORGANIZATION] held an unhoused task force meeting at FAC0 ."
05_21_2024,unhoused,"Will the public be notified of the next meeting , date, time, and location ? And will there be any public participation or public comment permitted during any of these meetings? Can the city also provide resumes and experiences for all the board members on the task force to show how they tie in with unhoused individuals ?"
05_21_2024,homeless,"Can the city provide a mission statement and what the goal is and what they're looking to accomplish ? Well, we attended this meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] and were surprised to see that there was no representation from local [ORGANIZATION] man, [PERSON], [PERSON], State Reps, [PERSON] or ORG2 officials . Shockingly , no one who is experiencing homeless ness or anyone that has benefit [ORGANIZATION] in a positive [STREET] by any of these nonprofit agencies are on this board."
05_21_2024,homelessness,"But there were people who represent the many local nonprofit s that make up the board. Can you inquire as [ORGANIZATION] if there is any data available to how the issue has been address [PERSON] and the breakdown of all funding to these agencies on this task force and what and how they spend the funds and how do they try to correct the issues of homelessness ? A city with 70,000 people and that's not including the county and this is what we have available ."
05_21_2024,homeless,And that's not mentioning any of the shelter or no shelter for homeless families . It's about time we start questioning why we have these shortage issues with housing . And where is all of this funding going?
05_21_2024,homeless; unhoused,"We have more than we should probably have in nonprofit s that work under the guise of helping the homeless and unhoused . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] time we start checking into that. [ORGANIZATION] skate park located at FAC0 and FAC1 , is there a log, is there anything that could be provided regarding the last time it was visited or inspected ?"
05_21_2024,homeless,"Good [TIME] , [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] . First of all, I was going to speak but some of my first comment s was going to be of asking about [PERSON] about who was on the city's -- Mr. [PERSON] after [ORGANIZATION] about who was on the city homeless committee and you said you were going to get back with that because you were going to ask someone in the administration . And have you gotten any luck 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] with knowing who is there so you could report it?"
05_21_2024,homeless,Thank you. And it might be nice to actually have it in [ORGANIZATION] session so anyone can actually take a look and understand who is part of this homeless commission rather than just giving me a list. MR. PERSON0 :
05_21_2024,affordable housing,"And they build a building and it's up for [ORGANIZATION] and the tax break's over in ten, the company moves out and tears it down. And you wonder why we don't have affordable housing ? You know, I'm starting to get real estate people sending me letters they would like to buy my house as an investment ."
05_21_2024,homeless,"they said there were 22 members but not all members were able to attend. It looks like the majority of the people that were there were representing those nonprofit organization s that serve the unsheltered or the homeless population . So, you know, I think it's certainly appropriate that those are the people that are a part of it since they are the ones serving those communities and can help us in identifying the gaps in services which is something that we had discuss ed."
05_21_2024,homeless,And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] that is completed [ORGANIZATION] to assess how many people are homeless . And that was one of the things that we were provided numbers on. We also discussed what is needed with the shelter .
05_21_2024,homeless,"A few comments , yeah, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] during caucus the homeless task force meeting came up. And I asked for is there [TIME] and for us, for not just [ORGANIZATION] but for all of you and especially if it's not going to be open to the public so we know what's going on."

11_14_2023,homeless,"PERSON0 : Yes, just a few things. First I failed to mention it earlier but I was reminded when Miss [PERSON] was [DATE] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 2[DATE]2 23 [DATE] asking her question about the veteran homeless population ."
06_11_2024,affordable housing,And it said it was to redo a building in [ORGANIZATION] and make it into affordable housing for low income at-risk veterans . I believe that's the building they are speaking about. I don't know anything else that large in [ORGANIZATION] that we would be able to remodel with that much money.
06_20_2023,homeless,"And I recall when we had the code red on the air quality , I saw in the paper that refuse pickup was delayed by [ORGANIZATION].

When we have a code blue in [DATE], we get them inside."
06_20_2023,homeless,"But it would be nice to know if we want to make this a permanent position , what's her value added. And we have an obligation to our homeless population to think about things like another code red. It bothers me that nothing happened ."
06_20_2023,homeless,"Well, to change my usual approach up here, [ORGANIZATION] when I was walking my little puppy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] in the area next to FAC0, it's all big grassy area if anybody 's ever been there, quite a few homeless living back there too.

If they don't have the money or if somebody is going to have to go without a meal down at the soup kitchen then sign up on a petition to be delivered to the state because all of this talk about swimming pools and stuff like that, I'm mainly concern ed about taxes. If somebody wants to have a park and make a bunch of rules I don't want to abide by, I don't get off on arguing with a police officer about the law, I just don't go, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] know, and that's it."

04_09_2024,homeless,"So I'll ask again, how many people in this room if you could stand up are homeless or have -- MR. PERSON0: Ma'am, you have to address [ORGANIZATION] , please, not the audience . Thank you. MS."
04_09_2024,homeless,PERSON0: Okay. So the people that are standing up are the ones that have been homeless or are currently homeless .
04_09_2024,homeless,"Now if they are not homeless , they could sit -- if they don't want to be homeless they could sit down. So all the people that sat down decided they did not want to be homeless . But at this point they really don't have much of a choice."
04_09_2024,homeless,Can you tell me how many people are homeless right now in this city? Any idea? MR. PERSON0:
04_09_2024,homeless,"How many shelters are there for the homeless people in the city, night shelter not day shelters . MR. PERSON0: Well, it depends on what you consider night shelters."
04_09_2024,homeless,"And I'm not sure if anybody remembers what it said. But for those who aren't here or didn't see it, [ORGANIZATION], the county that we are currently living in has 126 homeless children 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] in [ORGANIZATION] , 16 homeless children in [ORGANIZATION], 25 homeless children in [ORGANIZATION] and 14 homeless in [PERSON]. And this is according to [ORGANIZATION] ."
04_09_2024,homeless,There's more homeless people on the [STREET] and obviously not enough shelters with that many people that are homeless and 26 beds. The math doesn't add up. And how many is the city going to assist me and other members of the community to do the jobs and take care of the people who we are taking care of that the city should be.
04_09_2024,homelessness,"MR. PERSON0 : Good [TIME] . I understand that the homelessness and the need for, you know, intervention with the city is very important ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"But it's -- there's very small needs that can be address ed that could eliminate most of those issues like zoning in different areas where they could put their tents, you know, in certain times or certain [DATE] and so it doesn't cause and overabundance of garbage or whatnot because that's a lot of the issue is that a lot of the homeless just what I have noticed don't have anywhere to put their tents or somewhere to sleep at [TIME]. So it could be something that could be solved with a very minimal impact to the city or to other people it would just be these are the areas, you know, during these times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] that you could set up or where you could set up your tents."
04_09_2024,homeless,DATE0 I was here and I spoke upon our family members that's actually homeless . It's not just me.
04_09_2024,homeless,"So also within the [ORGANIZATION] which is Section Eight housing I believe there's a protocol somewhere in [STREET] homeless prevention . So when you're trying to provide homeless prevention , you're going to provide resources which means we're not going to let this person go homeless . We're going to try to step forward and overcome this so that this person does not go homeless ."
04_09_2024,homelessness,"I'm currently in that shelter , that one shelter here in [ORGANIZATION] and my time is almost up. And I asked, and I asked, and I pled and I wanted housing assistance , preventative of homelessness ."
04_09_2024,homeless; homelessness,"And then there was nothing stated about the homelessness that's going on from the Doctor. I think the Doctor should also oversee what's going on and can that budget be fulfilled? And also, there's people that's on the waiting list of [ORGANIZATION] housing , homeless prevention ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"Also, DATE0 I witnessed that there was a parent that had a child with them and cannot go into the shelter because the child was not [PERSON] or older. So there is not just adults that's homeless . We have children that is homeless and where is homeless prevention ."
04_09_2024,homelessness,"Again, where I go back to. There is no answers. In the last meeting no one address ed the homelessness ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"So if my day comes up within [ORGANIZATION] and I'm homeless , this is public streets. I should be able to allow to walk all the through these streets , around FAC0, put a tent next door and sleep their peaceful ly or go next to the police station and walk around that until I pass out correctly , right? And if the sidewalk s is not paved right, so now I'm going to get stagnant and continuing doing the same thing and get weak."
04_09_2024,homeless,"And I thought it was against the rules that I was being harassed which in several meeting s said leave the homeless alone. Can I get that officer 's number -- badge number because I want to make sure that the homeless is not going to be harassed just because I'm a man walking down the [STREET], an alley. There's not a sidewalk there."
04_09_2024,homeless,I'm not going to berate you over the treatment of the homeless even because that's already been -- you've already got that. Last time I was here it was mistaken my anger for passion . Do not mistake my anger for my passion .
04_09_2024,homeless,"I am very passionate about who I represent . And if you did not notice, I was one of those ones that stood up when she asked if you had ever been homeless stand up. I stood up."
04_09_2024,homeless,I was homeless in [ORGANIZATION] . I was homeless up here. And I was given the right opportunities to get my life right.
04_09_2024,homeless,We don't want to put the horse in front of the cart. But I haven't heard any plans on what to do about this homeless situation here in [ORGANIZATION] . I haven't heard anything about plans to deal with the teenager s that are homeless out here that go to school and then go back to the streets .
04_09_2024,homeless,"Let's take a closer look. Before you are even homeless , some of this is outdated because it changes over [ORGANIZATION]. I will pretext this on whatever you ask a utility for help or to use a program like a credit card company , they avoid the help path and try to put you on back billing and payment plan to catch up with your current bill."
04_09_2024,homeless,"PERSON0 : PERSON1 , [ORGANIZATION] resident . And again, I have to say that it's just very enlightening to hear the information that was presented by the homeless people. I've never been homeless ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"It's been very enlightening to, as I said [ORGANIZATION], to work at [ORGANIZATION] that we do meals down there to do the sleeping bags for the homeless . So would I be involved with that if I wasn't volunteering , probably not because I would go to lunch with those people just like me that could afford those things just like I could afford. So it gives any me greet opportunity to look around because but for the grace of God there go [ORGANIZATION]"
04_09_2024,homeless,"I'll continue to do those things that I do to help not only the homeless and there's a lot of people that have the food insecurities out there as well. So that's, you know, I wasn't going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] to speak about that."
04_09_2024,homeless,"But I understand and we have a national problem with homeless . And before [PERSON], there was 55,000 children attending school in [ORGANIZATION] -- homeless , out of homeless shelters . And now it's exponentially more like three maybe four times, who knows and the shipping people up from the border isn't helping either."
04_09_2024,homeless,I'm here to speak about how we were homeless and there was things for us. All I keep hearing about what you guys didn't do. There is things that you did do.
04_09_2024,homelessness,"Hi. My name is [ORGANIZATION]. And I -- I'll tell you, homelessness is like [ORGANIZATION] of wrestling practice in spades."
04_09_2024,homeless,It's just hell. And the homeless thing is based on the homeless person's behavior . And because all the things -- it's a behavioral thing.
04_09_2024,homeless,"It's been messed up here for [ORGANIZATION]. There were about five mayors, a lot of bad things have happened, kids for cash and all kinds of stuff. And anyway, I'm homeless ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"Speaking of that, I feel like something is really changing in the city. I feel like the dark is coming to light. And I just feel a movement happening , the homeless , the garbage and other issues in the city are finally being exposed."
04_09_2024,homeless,It was overgrown leaves and all types of things. So [TIME] and three people and it wasn't that hard. So my husband [ORGANIZATION] and DATE1 -- [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] actually picked up a homeless woman and took her to pick up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] trash.
04_09_2024,homeless,And across the [STREET] are a big bunch of cinderblocks out in the middle of the [STREET] for as long as the hole on the other side has been there. But you got to come up to this podium and pick your battles . You can't -- I wanted to talk about the homeless .
04_09_2024,homeless,"She displaces people that are living together like a family, the homeless . She just scattered them all throughout the region, not just in the city but throughout [ORGANIZATION], all right, with no plan in [STREET]. A good administrator would have a plan in [STREET]."
04_09_2024,homeless,"And if anyone has a problem with it, tough. And the next thing I'm going to address is with regards to homeless and displaced community . First off, I want to say I absolutely sympathize with those who are homeless or displaced ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"And, you know, I hate to see that happen. I hate to see that we do have many who are homeless here within the city. And I previously spoken about the issue in past [ORGANIZATION] meeting s."
04_09_2024,homeless,"But at the time when we spoke I was told that people were not being actively removed from homeless encampments or their properties were not being destroyed . But maybe some of that has changed now, which I definitely want to address . And they also expressed to me that their primary concern were if there were crimes being committed then that's when they would step in and intervene ."
04_09_2024,homeless,"He also explained that the officers do try to help provide resources to those that are homeless . I'm only relaying what, you know, some of the discussion that we had in the past was. And that's, you know, what I would hope would be happening ."
04_09_2024,homeless,So having a director for [ORGANIZATION] would be additional ly very helpful . And that would be another [STREET] where we could work together to find some more solutions for the homeless community . I understand wanting to see action.
04_09_2024,homeless; homelessness,"[2] - 76:24, 77:12 home [1] - 38:22 homeless [59] - 13:11, 15:6, 22:24, 22:25, 23:4, [TIME], [TIME] [DATE], 23:21, [DATE], [DATE]5, 25:1, 25:2, 25:3, [TIME] 25:12, [TIME], [DATE], [TIME], [TIME], 28:20, 28:23, 29:21, 30:6, 30:7, 30:14, 31:8, [DATE], 34:19, 6 [DATE], 35:12, 35:15, [DATE], 42:24, 42:25, [TIME] 43:22, [TIME], 46:16, [DATE], [DATE], 51:14, 51:15, 52:6, 55:5, [DATE], [TIME] [DATE], 73:9, [DATE], 74:8, 74:18, 75:19 homelessness [5] - 26:18, 29:6, [DATE], 30:9, 51:12 homeowner [2] - 15:4, 55:1 homes [1] - 23:19 Honor [1] - 4:25 honor [2] - 67:3, [TIME] honored [1] - 67:2 hope [6] - 7:6, 18:19, 22:4, 26:2, 47:7, 74:21 hopefully [3] - 44:20, [DATE], 66:22 hoping [4] - 8:10, [DATE], 67:14 horse [1] - 35:10 horses [1] - 58:8 hour [5] - 9:9, [DATE], [DATE], [TIME]"
12_12_2023,homeless,"I know that might bother someone or it might, you know, you might look at that in a different [STREET]. But we really believe that it's happening . So that being said, I want you guys to understand and everybody in the city to understand that when I say that I help homeless people and we as a group help homeless people, I promise you we do whatever we can to not enable them."
12_12_2023,homeless,"We now have a couple dumpsters set up in the area where the homeless live. Yeah, we're going to go fill them up. We're going to put all the garbage in it, especial ly around [ORGANIZATION]."
12_12_2023,homeless,We want to do that. You think I'm going to do it without homeless people? Not a chance.
12_12_2023,homeless,"The homeless people are coming with us to clean it up. Now, it may not be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 2539 homeless people that made the garbage but this is a process . And they are going to get on the other homeless people when they see them, you know?"
12_12_2023,homeless,"[ORGANIZATION], an inspector for the city came down to a big event and thank you for letting us down there where we were to go right into where the homeless live in the cold weather and just dump love and tons of clothes and food to them. And for you guys to allow us to do that, it means a lot to me, man. It really, really does, man."
12_12_2023,homeless,"So we're inside the woods and we're offering the city to clean up the whole area, all right. There's so many reasons why these people are homeless , okay? Don't go into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] woods and be sneaky about it and get up in these women's faces and call them scumbags ."
12_12_2023,homeless,"I have audio of it. I have many, many homeless people that you hurt and scared and made suicidal . Please, I'm begging someone to step in and stop any officer -- as we're trying to go through and work with the city and spread love and pick up all the garbage -- you know, the last time we did this was [ORGANIZATION] ."
12_12_2023,homeless,"Good [TIME] , [ORGANIZATION] , [ORGANIZATION] . I'd just like to mention that when [PERSON] took office in [ORGANIZATION], three out of five homeless people were veterans of [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON] probably . So I would just like to mention that."
12_12_2023,homelessness,"And I'd like to talk to [ORGANIZATION], you know, because when I read articles I like to know where the information comes from. I've done a lot of research on homelessness and how things work. And I discovered that -- that [ORGANIZATION] is being run like a private hotel over [ORGANIZATION]."
12_12_2023,homeless; homelessness,"But the solution is with the persons that are focused that will provide critical support for older adult victims of abuse, neglect , and exploitation as well as those facing homelessness . And I listened to everything about, you know, how the police are chasing the homeless . The people that run [ORGANIZATION] are [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] ORG2; [PERSON], [PERSON]."
12_12_2023,homeless,"But, you know, then it goes onto this [ORGANIZATION] Judge [PERSON], you know, on ORG1 in the courts.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] I mean, most of those people that are homeless , they shouldn 't have even gone to [STREET] because ORG2 is federally subsidize d and they are constantly sending inflated bills to everybody which is under [ORGANIZATION] law a retaliatory eviction and much more stuff than that. I mean, they're aggressively moving people out so they have their own little dominion and they control it with the fear of eviction , the fear of the District Attorneys coming to prosecute you."
12_12_2023,homelessness,"And when they come, the District Attorney , he's the witness and the prosecutor and everything . This is the problem with the homelessness thing. And I would like to see some of the good things that I've seen happening enforced like, hey, they have to have a license to rent to people because there is no oversight ."
12_12_2023,homelessness,"And also, homelessness came up a couple of times [TIME] if we could also reach out to ORG0 about the update on homelessness , what, if anything , is being done at this point in time and that the voucher program -- I'm sorry, the voucher program it's under [STREET] I think through ORG1 and ORG2, ask for an update on that. Thank you."
11_10_2022,homeless,"We really need to as I have stated a long -- many times in the past we have to get compensation from the state for institutional properties . We have grant tax exempt institutions , can't have it any other [STREET]. A homeless person winds up in the hospital after [ORGANIZATION]."
07_07_2020,homeless,"So as Chairman of [ORGANIZATION] , I would like to applaud ORG1 and their detective s for the apprehension and arrest of the juvenile male for the homicide of the poor young lady that, you know, was killed in [ORGANIZATION]. Great works guys. Secondly , it was brought to my attention by a few concerned citizens the activities occurring under the pavilion at FAC0 trail on FAC1 that entail homeless people."
07_07_2020,homeless,"There's fighting , yelling , cursing , urinating in public, drug deals going down and overdosing , a couple people. So, of course, I sympathize with our [ORGANIZATION]'s homeless population . But this appears to be a public safety issue that needs to be addressed or at least assessed by the [ORGANIZATION]."
03_03_2020,homeless,"Well, he was only Mayor of [ORGANIZATION]. And by the [STREET], there is 55,000 kids that attend school in [ORGANIZATION] City from a [INSTITUTION] . So that's how bad things have gotten."
07_02_2018,homeless,"This one is going from [ORGANIZATION] until [LOCATION], which is DATE2, until [TIME]. Obviously , we want to make sure we are in an air conditioned room, you stay hydrated , don't do anything excessive outside for any long periods of time, and during a Code Red alert homeless individuals can access emergency shelter at the following locations : FAC0, [ADDRESS], [ORGANIZATION] . [TIME], and the Community 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 255 [PERSON], [ADDRESS] and [TIME] are [TIME] to [TIME] Thank you."
07_05_2023,homeless,"What are you going to do about the homeless population ? Now, I looked at the information that Dr. [PERSON] put on [ORGANIZATION]. And I looked at her page on the website ."
07_05_2023,homeless,"The question still stands, what are you going to do for the homeless ? You have a code blue in [DATE] where you allow them to come indoors when it gets so cold. Code red, the guidance that the government is giving is you stay indoors ."
07_05_2023,homeless,The homeless are outdoor s [DATE]/7. You need a plan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] 259
07_05_2023,homeless,Those people are not throw away people just because they are homeless . And I want to know. I've asked before.
07_05_2023,homeless,"I have asked over [ORGANIZATION] for an inventory list of all city-owned property , a list of all city vehicles , take-home cars and by who, a list and cost of porta lavs that are all over the city. I've asked about the homeless camps, the updates . I brought to attention about the propane tanks."
07_05_2023,homeless,"Now there is an electric cord running down on FAC0 from FAC1 -- and I'll show you the picture soon running into a homeless camp with the electricity out. Two people have been burned over [ORGANIZATION] with the propane tanks, one person was stabbed [PERSON] and when the police went to the camp to find the other individual , propane tanks were exploded inside the tents before the police were able to go in or the [INSTITUTION] to address it. This is an issue."
07_05_2023,homeless,"I don't want to be appease d. Something needs to be done. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] [ORGANIZATION] said, these homeless people are human beings as well."
04_30_2024,homeless,"And I came here [ORGANIZATION] to speak about the homeless . Well, right now what I want to speak about is pretty much the air pollution in the city.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] Like, the air is so polluted to the point to where as though, like, when you are walking outside you could barely breathe . And I think that has to do with, you know, like, the littering ."
04_30_2024,homeless,"And it was completely unfair because people don't understand what the [STREET] system is. They don't even understand what law enforcement is. I hear, you know, the police are going after the homeless and everything ."
04_30_2024,homeless,"But, you know, after I -- it almost killed me being homeless . I lost most of my [ADDRESS] to live."
04_30_2024,homelessness,"But they're not [ORGANIZATION]. They're not following the [ORGANIZATION] rules whatsoever . And what was crazy is, like, you need a Certificate of Homelessness ."
04_30_2024,homelessness,Recently we had the people here that were concerned about the homelessness . I went to a seminar at [ORGANIZATION] on the homelessness situation here in [ORGANIZATION] . It was very informative .
04_30_2024,homelessness,So we have the issue of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [DATE] 18 19 20 21 22 23 [DATE] homelessness . We have the issue of gang violence . And as I sit and I think when are we as citizens of [ORGANIZATION] going to be given an update?
04_30_2024,homeless,"Number two, if we could set up an executive session to discuss the situation with [ORGANIZATION] in the near future. Number two, I know that we talked about having a caucus concerning the homeless situation . We were trying to coordinate with a woman."
04_30_2024,homeless,"I'm just wondering where we are with that and when we could possibly jump on that issue and have a public caucus dealing with the homeless situation . MR. PERSON0 : I'll look into that, Mr. [PERSON]."
04_30_2024,homeless,"First off, I just wanted to touch on some of the updates and issues with the homeless population . So [PERSON] and myself, we went along with [PERSON] who's been here before to speak and wanted to have a group of -- I think they said maybe 70 people who take different [TIME] during [ORGANIZATION] and contribute food and different supplies for the homeless . So we had the opportunity to go along with them to several locations where they gave out meals to the homeless and then offered many different supplies to be able to help them."
04_30_2024,homeless,"I believe [ORGANIZATION] is the next date for a meeting that they're holding . And [ORGANIZATION] , they had a fund-raiser on [LOCATION] at [ORGANIZATION] that I attended . And it was very well-attended."

11_03_2021,homeless,Is this program still in effect and is the City looking towards taking care of our homeless because this is a sudden drop in temperature ? MR. PERSON0 : That I don't know.
