MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Here. The purpose of today's meeting is to interview candidates for the position of Mayor. We do have a set of questions that Council came up with. All the applicants are going to be offered a five-minute period to give a pitch on why they should be selected . Following that, there will be questions from members of Council , possibly follow-ups from each individual member. I would remind the members of the public to be quiet during the interviews . If you need to have a conversation or make a phone call, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 please step out and show the respect to these applicants that they deserve . Our first applicant is Wayne Evans. The floor is yours. MR. EVANS: Good afternoon . First, I would like to offer -- MR. ROGAN: Mr. Evans, I'm sorry. Before you begin, there are two questions that we're going to ask every applicant prior to their opening statement . We do know the answer to the first one but we're going to ask it anyways. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. EVANS: Yes, I have. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for a full term? MR. EVANS: No, I won't. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. EVANS: Good afternoon . First of all, I would like to offer a brief recap of my experience with Scranton City Government , two years a member of the Golf Commission ; 10 years as a member of the Scranton City Planning Commission ; two years as a member of the Home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Rule Charter Study Commission ; two years as a member of the Ethics Commission ; three years as a member of the HARB; and five years as a member of Scranton City Council , a total of 24 years in service to the City of Scranton . Today, my focus will be on my time on City Council . On July 24, 2014, I was appointed by the then majority -- Democratic majority led by Bob McGoff to a seat on Council , a decision that was notable for the seismic shift away from partisan politics by making a completely nonpartisan decision based on the qualification s of the candidate . I'm very proud of my record for the past five years and you should be too because with very few exceptions , it's your record as well. Together we watched closely over the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority and the monetization of the Scranton Parking Authority . Most importantly we made the best and right decisions post sale and monetization . Besides remaining accountability , we resisted the urge and pressure to use sewer proceed s mostly for pension and funding by shifting priorities to paying down high interest debt. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 As a Finance Chair for City Council , I was an early adopter for that decision . On the parking side, we helped foster as situation that went from receiver ship to a system that today is being rebuilt every day with cleaner , safer garages and soon we will add a new on-street parking system that will take us into the 21st century . This Council demanded the creation of a downtown resident parking plan will not only give residents a monthly discount , it will get more cars off the street every single night to allow the downtown business es to flourish with more available parking spaces. We also had the foresight and the fortitude to reduce the real estate transfer tax from 4.4 percent to 3.7 percent creating an environment that continue s to meet budget expectations while reducing the financial pressure on new homeowner s in our City. We as a Council played a vital role in creating the Scranton Homeowner ship Assistance Program taking money earmarked for the Foreclosure Registration Program and directing it to SHAP to help new homeowners 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 repair and update the exterior s of their new homes improving their home as well as increasing their values of adjacent properties . This unique partnership in NeighborWorks is so successful it now has a waiting list. Another partnership in NeighborWorks is underway, the Beautiful Blocks Program . I discovered a similar program in Oswego, New York and that became the model for Beautiful Blocks where a group of neighbors compete for matching grants of up to one thousand dollars each for beautification blocks or project s on their blocks. We are bringing neighbors together and improving our neighborhood s at the same time. Of course, transparency should also always be important . We brought Granicus to City Hall and now each week our agenda and backup information on important legislation is available to the public online and for free. We created a three-year tax abatement program . When that simply did not do enough to spur economic development , we led the charge for ten year all encompassing citywide LERTA. We stand on the cusp of a dramatic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 increase in new construction and growth. Of course, we had our idea sessions and from there developed an internship program for City Council 's office. We have led the way and we should be very proud of what we all have accomplished together . So what does the future hold? Well, first of all, as interim Mayor, I will not require on-the-job training . Quite frankly , we do not have time for that. On day one we must begin to restore the trust and confidence of all of our citizens . So during the next five plus months, I expect to get things done, a lot of things done. In my first week, I will create the Mayor's Leadership Council bringing all City Hall -- bring to City Hall business and community leaders along with the key members of the administration and hopefully some members of City Council as well to brainstorm about current and future initiatives . In my first week, I promise to begin to address the LIPS situation , the NRS situation , and explore new relationship with the Tax Claim Bureau. When you return from your August recess, we will begin to work on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 moving forward with the Walkability study, the LIPS study, the expansion of the downtown historic district , a plan and strategy to restore this building , a shift to a payroll prep tax. We will continue to press for regionalization of stormwater management , the total revamping of the Quality of Life Ticketing Program ; and finally we expect to implement See, Click, Fix and clear gov dot com. We will do all of that together . We are here today because politics ran amok. I will commit to you again today that if appoint ed I will not run in November . And within one week I will dissolve my campaign committee and disburse my remaining funds to take away further the stench of politic s from this process . You have a difficult choice to make. So I offer a little advice on how sometimes I might approach these moments . I think I have pretty good instincts for getting things done the right way. But at times we all struggle with certain decisions . When I do I -- especially in the world of government and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 politic s. I simply ask myself, what would Bob McGoff do? And it all becomes a little bit clearer . Thank you very much for the time and I look forward to your questions . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Evans, thanks for coming out. Thank you for putting your letter of interest in. This is a big tipping point in our City. Again, like I said during our meeting last week, I appreciate everybody who stepped up to the plate to take leadership and help guide us right now when we need it really the most. I have done my fair share of interviewing in business . And one thing I always want to find out first is where the person's heart is and where their motivation is for the job at task. So what motivate d you? Why would you like to be interim Mayor and what separates you specifically with the rest of the candidate s that we're going to be talking to today? MR. EVANS: Well, first of all, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 guess my motivation is, you know, I have a track record of 40 years of community service . So my time on City Council was basically an extension of that and this is an extension of that as well. We're in a tough spot right now. You know, we are basically in some ways just trying to keep the lights on. I'm trying to look beyond that, trying to actually get more things done. But in my heart I know that this is the time, this is the place for me to be. I feel -- as you know, we're all Council men. If anybody is qualified to be in a position to be interim Mayor is a Councilman . For five years I lived, breathe d this entire process . We had a tough five years but we've got a lot accomplished . We saw ourselves through the worst economic times. We were on the brink of bankruptcy in 2014. And now we're exiting Act 47. So I believe in my heart that I have the tools, the intelligence , the integrity to move this thing forward . And as you know without question as you all do, I love this City with all of my heart.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. EVANS: You're welcome . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Evans, for applying . The criminal information outlining federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators , associated with the City of Scranton or City employee s to put it simply, were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contribution s and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator who is currently employed as a City employee , but also, to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. EVANS: That's a tough one because , as you know, the investigation is ongoing. And the coconspirators have not been identified yet. So we will continue to work with the FBI. All the employee s in City Hall should absolutely cooperate at all times.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 I have to tell you, I'm like you, Councilman Donahue , because I know how mad you are. I am mad. You know, I'm mad about what happened what. I'm mad about what was left behind. I'm mad about the political cesspool . And when these people are identified , they will be dealt with swiftly and quickly . And if we can, they'll be removed from their positions . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. As you know, one of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City is the archaic business privilege and mercantile tax. Both the Recovery and Exit Plan include the recommendation of replacing the business privilege and mercantile taxes with payroll prep tax. And that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So it has to be done this year since we're schedule d to exit Act 47 next year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax? MR. EVANS: Well, again, I'm an early adopter to that process as well. I've been pushing for the payroll prep tax as soon as we first discussed it three or four years ago. And you're right. The business privilege 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 and mercantile tax is a tax that hurts businesses at every level. So not only am I in support of it, it has to happen this year or into 2020 because the clock is ticking . Act 47 we're exiting it. Once we exit it we can't do it again. But the key to all of this, by the way, is the school district . The City of Scranton is fully on board with a payroll prep tax because it's broader , it's fair and will actually grow. The school district has not made their position known. So I will reconvene all the leaders of both the City and the school district and once and for all get a commitment from the school district to move forward on this. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Evans, if you're appoint ed, you will be the Mayor of the City of Scranton for approximately five months. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in that short time period and what are your goals and visions for the City? MR. EVANS: Well, Councilman , as you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 know in my opening remarks I laid out quite an extensive list of things that I would like to do. Maybe I could expand on a couple of them just for -- not to repeat myself. One of the things I've been very vocal about is the failure of the Quality of Life Program , the Ticketing Program . There is 29 different items on that ticket. That is absolutely ludicrous . I want to reduce that to less than ten. The fines are 150 to $200. I want to reduce those fines to 25 or less. I also want to put a warning on there so first time offenders and property owners will have a chance to clean up their property before they are ticketed. We totally blew that program . And I want to get it back on track. Another thing -- one of the things that I'm very interested in and you all know this is the walkability study. I think that is a game changer. Walkable downtowns across the country see increase d tourists , increased commerce , increased traffic in pedestrian s, not necessarily cars. And that's a way for our City to grow and continue to grow. We have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 lot of momentum happening in the downtown right now. And a walkability study will only enhance that. Is there something in particular that you want me to key in on, I would be happy to. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Donahue mentioned it a little bit. But from a city ethics perspective , we were trying to get the Ethics Commission up and running . Can you just talk about your stance and your views on that and what you think needs to change inherently in City Hall to kind of get rid of the stench as you called it and what would you do in the next five months to start that process ? MR. EVANS: Well, first thing I would do is appoint the fifth member of the Ethics Commission so we get this thing started. But that's been delayed from the very beginning not having that last appointment . I was fully supportive of that. I served on the Ethics Commission so I know how important it is. There's a culture in some portions of this building that have to be changed . And it's not just the employee s, of course, it's the culture . And also it happened to be part of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the administration which we found out recently . I'm fully support ive of the ethics. Our new code has guidelines in there for people that run for office as well. So it's really extensive . It's based on what happened in Reading . And we were proactive in that, by the way. You know, we did that prior to any knowledge of what was happening with the Mayor. So I think that says a lot about what this Council has been trying to do over the last five years. Other than to say I'm fully supportive and I will put that within -- as soon as I can, I will take applications and get that fifth member in there and we'll get the Ethics Commission started once and for all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And finally , can you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervision and managing employees ? As you know, as the Mayor of the City of Scranton , you're going to be in charge of a budget of roughly 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of City employees . In addition to that, are there any additions or cuts that you would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. EVANS: All right. Well, first of all, I'm the Finance Chair of City Council so I've been involved in all the major financial decisions over the last five years. And I worked very closely and have a very good relationship with the Business Administrator , which means a lot in this current environment . I'm a small business owner. On a personal level, I usually have roughly 12 to 14 agents that I oversee . I'll wait for that. But it's important beyond just supervising employees . When you're a small business owner, it's all of that. It's understand ing what fees are, what fines are, what it takes to run a business . You know, 80 percent of the growth in America right now is through the small business sector. So it's very, very important . But I also have experience in large business . I worked for 30 years for a Fortune 500 company . As an engineer I oversaw 10 million dollar budgets on construction in engineering . So I have a vast experience in the private sector as well as the public sector.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Two question s, and thank you for applying . First one is, what are you are specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MR. EVANS: Well, as I mentioned earlier , we're on the cusp of doing some great things. I really believe that. The 10 year LERTA I think is a game changer. The reason it is, when we had the three year tax abatement it never got off the ground. And one of the reasons is the City does a poor job of marketing those types of programs . The difference with this one is we're partners with the Chamber of Commerce . They committed to marketing the 10 year LERTA as much as they can. And we expect big dividends from that. So that's very, very important . We used to pick winners and losers with the LERTA and now we're only going to be picking winners and that's important as well. I think that in conjunction with the LERTA we had the federal opportunity zones. That's another opportunity for us to expand our base 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 -- our growth and our new construction base. And the walkability as I mentioned earlier is also about commerce . There's been studies shown that if you do a simple thing like reverse a one-way street to a two-way, it increases commerce on that street by 35 percent . So these are little things that can be done. Something that doesn't get talked about much I mentioned it earlier in my opening remarks is I would like to expand the historic district for downtown . Now what that does do for you is allows you to finally market downtown Scranton as historic downtown Scranton , a major marketing tool for all the stores, all the shops, all the restaurants downtown . And it's something I think that we can't minimize . So that's part of things we can do on the economic side. Also I mentioned earlier the Mayor's leadership Council , they're the kind of things what we'll be talking about in that group. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. And lastly, there's no question that Scranton 's current 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 refuse billing system is broken. What solution s would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MR. EVANS: Well, as we know, the system is broken. It's been broken for a long time. We have over 16 million dollars in delinquencies . So do we try to repair the broken system or do we scrap the broken system? I happen to be in favor of scrapping the system. What I would like to see happen is, take those 16 million dollars , package them as receivable s, sell them to a collection agency for a lump sum. If we get 5 million or 7 million, we take that money, we're out of the business . Then we take that money and we use that as a basis for the first two or three years and we rollover from the garbage bill and, you know, getting a separate refuse bill and you're vetting that back in your taxes. The truth of the matter is, we're collecting the refuse fee at a rate of 70 percent . We collect property tax at well over 90 percent . So right off the bat we're increasing our collection rate. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 The other side of it is on the refuse fee, we don't even know the amount of property out there that we're not collecting the refuse fee for. You know, we have a rental registration program that has always struggle d because we don't have the resources to really do what they need to do. But by expanding -- you know, we expanded that. We tried. But we still don't know all of these apartments , all of these landlords , they are not paying the fair share as far as the refuse fee is concern ed. So the best thing to do in my eyes, at least look at that. Vet that, see if that is the right way to go. If the numbers don't work, it's going to be too difficult for the homeowner we'll look at that as well. But everything 's on the table. But that's one thing that I want to look at right out of the gate. MR. ROGAN: Well, thank you. We're going to move onto our next applicant if you want to come up to take your seat for the rest of the interviews and we'll call in the next applicant . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 ( John R. A. Tarantino ) MR. TARANTINO : Good afternoon . MR. ROGAN: If you could state your name for the record, please? MR. TARANTINO : John R. A. Tarantino . MR. ROGAN: Before we turn it over to you for opening remarks , two quick questions . Number one, are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. TARANTINO : I'm a resident , never been arrested. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected would you run in the special election to fill the full remainder of the term? MR. TARANTINO : No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours for opening comments and then we'll turn it over to the Council members for questions . MR. TARANTINO : I wanted to be here to be considered . I have a big stake in Scranton . I moved here about three years ago. I have three properties in Scranton . And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 love the City. It's a beautiful city. Even this building is beautiful . I see so much potential . But I really don't see it being used to the fullest . I'm not going to lecture you on how to make the City better. But I would do my best to make it better. I'll work with you. I don't owe anybody anything . My allegiance is to the City and to myself and to the people. Everything I do will be strictly above board. I'll have an open-door policy. Anybody could come in and talk to me. I understand it's four or five month term. But even if I just open up your eyes and allow you to -- a vision of what I have of what the City could be. It may not get done but it's a start. That's what I'm looking for is to be able to have Scranton become what it used to be because I have been reading up on it. It was a glorious city. And it could once again be a glorious city. I love it. I live by the Moses Taylor Hospital . I could go out 2, 3:00 in the morning . My wife could go out 2, 3:00 in the morning . I feel safe. It's a safe city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 It's got wonderful people. It's peaceful . And it just -- it makes me feel good to say I'm a resident of Scranton . I love this city so much that if you read my letter of intent, I won't even get paid for the job. I'll donate that to some organization . I want to do the job because I feel it in my heart to do the job. That's about it. I mean, I really love this city. I'm retired. I could devote all my energy, all my effort to make it better. I could talk to you. We can discuss things. I could discuss things with anybody . I don't have all the answers . But I may have some of the answers -- even if I had one answer. And my job as a mayor I believe is to bring the City together and to work out the differences . I understand it's a fiscal crises where even that could be worked out. So is there anything else I could say? This is all coming from my heart. Nothing is prepared . I hope you understand what I'm saying. I hope you understand what I feel because I really feel this. If I have to go down to Harrisburg every week to talk to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Governor I'll do that too. There is no limit to what I'll do. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Tarantino , thank you very much for putting your letter of interest in. I've read it over. And, you know, you already answered the first part of my question which is why you wanted the job. And, you know, I could feel the passion and dedication that you do have for the City and I thank you for that. That being said, what do you feel like you bring to the table that separates you from the rest of the candidates that we're going to talk to today? MR. TARANTINO : Okay. Well, that's a good question . And I've lived in Pennsylvania . I lived in the Poconos . I had business in Dallas. I lived north of Pittsburgh . I lived on Long Island, which I guess you figured out from my accent. I lived in New York. And I see the one thing that Scranton has that the other places don't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 is beautiful affordable housing . The housing up here that -- they are like mansion s. If you put these houses in those cities that I mentioned , it would be two, three, four times the price. I think we should be drawing people here. If it was up to me I would start an investigation maybe see if there's a bus route that could go from -- leave from Scranton to Philly with a stop in Allentown , maybe get communities coming here. People will do anything for their kids. They'll travel two hours if it's a better life for the kid because I did it. And other people will do it too. The neighborhoods , it's a clean city. It's clean. And the buildings -- even this building if you look at it, it's magnificent . St. Peter's Cathedral a few blocks away it's gorgeous . This is what we have to offer. I have a vision too with the baseball team, Scranton /Wilkes-Barre. They should be involved with the community , teach these kids something . Let the kids look up to them. MR. PERRY: Very good. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And finally , what do you think the biggest challenge is going to be as interim Mayor and how do you plan on dealing with that challenge ? MR. TARANTINO : Biggest challenge I believe will be to work with the City Council and to alleviate the misconception that people have that the government you can't work for the people. This government should be working for the people of Scranton -- not me, not you. It's the people. And they have to feel like they are part of it. They should not be neglected . And this is what I see happening . It's like I drive through downtown Scranton 4:00 in the afternoon on Friday and I say, Is this Sunday morning ? There's nobody out. You have to get the people walking . You got to get volunteers in here, get the kids involved . It's a wonderful city. How many times did I tell you that. I just love it. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 applying . The criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators , associated with the City of Scranton or the City employees to put it simply, were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments, campaign contribution s and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator who is currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to being to restore trust in City Government . MR. TARANTINO : Well, if they did something that's against the law if -- we have attorney generals . I'll work with the state. I'll work with the state police. I'll work with the City Council . You can't. If people have your trust, your word is your bond. You don't live up to your trust, I have no -- I have no compassion for you. Whatever happens to you should be done to the fullest extent of the law. Like I said, I have no allegiance to nobody. Nobody. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I live by me -- I basically live by myself. I stay by myself. I'm happy. I want to see people held accountable for their actions . You just can't shake it off. I'll do everything I can to make sure these people are brought to justice . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. One of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City of Scranton is the archaic business privilege and mercantile tax that are levied on gross receipts . Both the Recovery Plan and the Exit Plan include the recommendation of replacing the business privilege and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . We're on track to exit Act 47 in the next year. So that has to be done this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile tax with a payroll prep tax. MR. TARANTINO : Again, with taxing the people, every time I turn around you can't keep reaching into people's pockets . Maybe something else could be worked out because from personal experience I had a leaking roof in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 house that I wanted to get it fixed. I had to. I called contractors and they don't want to come out when I tell them Scranton . I said why not? They say you got to pay for a permit. They have to fill out permit papers. And then they got to wait for the permit to be completed and given to them. It's just a hassle. People have a bad -- sometimes you have a bad feeling when it comes to working in Scranton . That's got to stop. You have to make it friendly for people to come here. You have to make it inviting . Like I said in my letter, this should be a destination city, not just the Electric City. It should be a destination city. That's what I hope to make it. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. If appoint ed, you will be Mayor of the City of Scranton for approximately five months. What do you plan to specifical ly accomplish in that time period? What are your goals and your vision for the City?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. TARANTINO : Okay. In those five months, I'm hoping to reach out to the baseball team. I'm hoping that they work with the City to have some exhibitions , have the players meet with the kids. I'm also hoping to have a moratorium , make it like I said on these permits , these building permits , maybe have a moratorium . See how that goes. You know, see, if people improve their house, they improve Scranton . Things hold them back when you have to pay extra money. You're hit with a bill for fixing a roof. Now you have a bill to get a permit to allow you to fix the roof. That doesn't sound like the American way to me. I'm also thinking about, like I said, investigating maybe Martz Trailways , maybe a private bus line that will start a bus route from Scranton to Allentown to Philadelphia . People will commute if they find it better. Better mousetrap at the end of the bus route. I believe that mouse trap is Scranton . I believe we should get the kids volunteering at the schools. Maybe they could help with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 trash days, you know, clean the yards or something or visit elderly people that are locked up, you know, in their homes. This is just a few of the things that I believe in. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. As Mayor of the City of Scranton , you will be in charge of a budget of roughly 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of City employees . Can you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising or managing employees and what additions or cuts would you plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. TARANTINO : Okay. Well, I used to have a restaurant in Dallas. I was on a tight budget. I employed about eight to ten people. I cut back there as much as I could. Unnecessary spending was stopped . And I ran a taxi garage. I had five workers there. In New York City, talk about regulations , it was -- and same thing. It just kept, you know, getting hit with bills and bills and bills. And I cut back where I could over there. As far as cutting back in Scranton with the budget, well, I'd have to see it first. I just can't make a blanket statement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 cut everything . I have to see if there is waste, it has to stop. My decisions are based on business , not on feeling s, not on emotions . That's how I operate . If I make a decision based on business aspect, I don't have no regrets . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. I don't have any questions at this time. So we appreciate you coming in. And we're going to go onto the next applicant . Thank you. MR. TARANTINO : Thank you very much, gentlemen . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. ( Brad Foley ) MR. ROGAN: If you can you state your name for the record and then we'll have two quick question s and turn it over to you for an opening remark. MR. FOLEY: Sure. My name is Brad Foley. MR. ROGAN: And two quick questions , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. FOLEY: Yes, I have. MR. ROGAN: And if selected , would you run in a special election to fill the remainder of the term? MR. FOLEY: No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. FOLEY: Okay. Thank you. Well, first of all, I would like to thank Council for the opportunity to apply for this job. Again, my name is Brad Foley. I live in the Green Ridge section of Scranton . I'm a retiree from the federal government . I currently am an employee of Pennsylvania State University . I teach -- I'm an adjunct instructor up there and I teach business . The courses I have taught before are management , human resources , negotiation , marketing and every other core course that they have up there all but accounting . What you'll expect from me is some honesty , some integrity , and I will do my absolute best at the job for the next five months. I realize right now you're not going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 to change very much in the next five month. What you'll get from me at the very end is some recommendations , maybe an organizational structure that may be more efficient . You will get some recommendations to the next mayor on maybe who should be here and who should not be here, okay? Also, what you won't get from me is any sweeping changes , okay, you will not see me try to reinvent any wheels or anything like that. I consider myself sort of a bridge between our time right now, our next five months and the next mayor who will fill out the ex-Mayor Courtright 's term. So I am a business person. I am not a politician . I promise you that. I have no ambition of being in politics after these five months. What I do bring to the table -- and I believe I think the City needs this is a business sense, okay? I know we have a business manager here. But I think we need maybe some more business experience out here. And again, I'm not a politician although over the years I have politiced in my jobs with the federal government , okay? Prior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 to this, I worked at the highest levels within the Department of Defense . I worked for the Army Materiel Command and I worked for the department of -- I worked for the Secretary of Defense , okay. So I have some awards from them and things like that. But I have worked for them. And again, right now I'm a teacher at Penn State University . And I'm an adjunct instructor . I think that's pretty much it. Feel free to ask any questions that you feel comfortable asking. MR. ROGAN: Councilman Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Foley, thank you. Thank you very much for putting your letter of interest in for this position . Again, I can't tell you how much that means to the whole City to have this many people that are actually willing to step up to the plate. That being said, whenever I interview someone and as businessman yourself , I'm sure this is one of the very first things you ask somebody . You want to know what their motivation is and where their heart's at.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 What made you decide to put pen to the paper and actually send in a letter of interest for this position . And secondly , what do you bring to the table specifically that separate s yourself from the other candidate s that we're going to talk to today? MR. FOLEY: Well, one of the things that separate s -- I'll start from the very end, okay? And if I miss a question , Mr. Perry, let me know. MR. PERRY: The floor is yours. You're fine. MR. FOLEY: But what I bring to the table is I have good social responsibility . I understand what I'm suppose d to say, what I'm supposed to do, okay? I have good emotion al responsibility as well from the standpoint of I don't lose my cool, okay, I could handle those kind of things. What sets me apart from other candidates ? Maybe my enthusiasm . I look forward to new challenges . And this would certainly , certainly be a good challenge for sure what we have here, okay. Again, my honesty, my integrity -- and I'm sure every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 single person in the other room, the other 15 candidate s certainly have the honesty and integrity that they have. What motivates me? The idea of doing something good. I really appreciate the opportunity to do this. But what motivates me certainly is not money, okay. I don't have any -- I don't owe anybody . And nobody owes me anything either. But money does not motivate me with anything like that. But I think just the idea of doing a good job, being part of a transition . That's what I would look for myself as a transition person and a bridge to the next mayor. That's what kinds of sets me apart. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And finally , I'm sure you follow the news and you're familiar with our City. Obviously you are for showing interest . What do you think our biggest challenge is right now and how do you plan on dealing with that challenge once you become interim Mayor? MR. FOLEY: Okay. The first thing I think that the City lacks is respect , okay. Of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 all the places -- of course, people talk, okay, people give you advice and all of those kind of things. But I think the reputation of the City is really in peril for lack of any other thing. How I would address that? I think I would ask the staff and the people that work here -- I'd instill some professionalism into them, okay. I think that is what they lack here is professionalism . I walk through the halls here and I don't see anybody dressed for the occasion of working , the privilege of working for the City. So I think that is what I would do, okay. Yeah, I think I would just instill professionalism . Again, five months is not a very long time. People might think it is. My grandson who I was with this morning , he thinks five months is an eternity . He thinks one week is an eternity . But five months is really a very short period of time. And I think that's what this City needs right now. Also one of the things I think that they need quite a bit of is automation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 There's a lot of things here that aren't automated. I know the minutes are put on line and things like that. But I think some of the things could be automated a little bit more than they are. I would like to see at least the ball will start rolling in that direction . MR. PERRY: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, thank you. Mr. Foley, thank you for applying . The criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton or for lack of a better term, the City employees , were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments, campaign contribution s and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator s that are currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 order to begin to restore trust in City Government . MR. FOLEY: Well, first of all, I'd let the FBI do their job, okay. Of course, I would not want one of those people whoever they may be to work for the City or work for me if I was the one that was selected . I certainly wouldn't want that. I would want proof, of course. But no union can, you know, protect somebody that has done something that wrong for lack any other word, okay? So did I answer your question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. FOLEY: The bottom line is, I don't think they should work -- I know they shouldn 't work -- not that I don't think, I know they shouldn 't work for the City. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you very much. One of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City is the archaic business privilege and mercantile taxes. So in our Recovery Plan and our Exit Plan they give the recommendation to convert those taxes into a payroll prep tax. And that's only available to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Act 47 municipalities . So given the fact that we're on track to exit Act 47 in 2020 next year, that would have to be done this year. What are your thoughts on, you know, replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax. MR. FOLEY: Well, I've read the Recovery Plan that Mr. Ambrose came up with or his company came up with. And I find that there is no problem with what they have to say, okay? I think that you have to follow a plan no matter what it is. And I believe that that plan is working . For now right now, you know, for the City to be in a business of, for example , sewer authorities , I think that's more of a private industry type event, okay. It may not be everybody 's opinion , but that's at least mine. I don't think the City belongs in those kinds of businesses , okay. But from a tax standpoint , I'd have to support what the Recovery Plan brings. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, what do you plan to specifical ly accomplish in the next five months if you are appointed as Mayor of the City of Scranton and what are your goals and vision for the City? MR. FOLEY: What I would plan to accomplish , number one, I would take some advice from Council on maybe some project that can be finished within the next five months. I don't think that, you know, again, five months is not a very long time, okay. What I would like to accomplish is, number one, I mentioned before that professionalism and within the building and within the City Government . I think that is lacking for lack of any other word than that. And professionalism , how would I attack that? First of all, I would make sure every department chair -- I think there is 15 of them, would wear a tie that comes to work would look the part, okay? That was one of the first things that I would start off with is being professionalism . Like I mention ed before, I think the automation , certain functions within 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the organization whether it's internal or external , I believe they could be automated in the next couple of months or at least a program and a plan ahead for that, okay. What else, again, organization . I think to take a look at the organization from an outside view. And I think what I would bring into there is a nice outside view from it. Again, not being political or any ambition of being political , I think that's kind of a plus for this next five months at least for that, okay. But that's what I would try to accomplish in the next couple months and also I would like to bring out some recommendations for the next whoever that may be Democrat , Republican , Independent whoever that may be and I would like to bring out some recommendations on how I feel that it should work, whether they take them or not is up to them. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. As Mayor of the City if you are appoint ed, you would be in charge of a budget of roughly 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of City employees . So can you tell us what your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees and a look towards the 2020 budget that you will be crafting along with the Business Administrator , what additions or cuts would you plan to make? MR. FOLEY: What kind of cuts? MR. GAUGHAN : Additions or cuts to the 2020 budget. MR. FOLEY: Well, I'll start with the first one what is my experience in working with budgets . I've always worked with budgets. Working for the federal government that was kind of my job was working with budgets . We've gone up to probably 40 or 50 million dollars per year, probably never 110 but probably 40 or 50 million dollars a year I've managed . The people, you know, I mean, I'm sorry, Mr. Gaughan , too many questions I think. But just what is my experience of working with budgets , I have worked with budgets and its allocation of what resources you are going to use and those budgets went for materials , went for labor hours, went for travel and numerous other things, office supplies and things like that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 So our budgets were in the government at least where I worked were pretty close to 50 or 60 million dollars . So I have some experience working with that. It seems like it always balanced . You know, we always had a little bit of extra money at the end of the year for bonuses and things like that. But that's a whole different lifetime . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: What are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MR. FOLEY: First thing I would do is I would take a walk around personal ly and I would always take somebody with me. I've never gone anywhere without taking somebody with me. But I would take somebody with me. And I would go around to some businesses out there and find out what's working for them and what's not working for them. And I'd ask. Again, not being part of the economic development world out there I would ask where people work what would make them want to be in business here. And I would definitely entertain people that would come that want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 invest in here. And I would also -- it all depends on the budget, of course. But I would attend some conferences outside of the City, find out what's in Northeastern Pennsylvania and make recommendation s back to them and kind of promote . And that's kind of really what you have to do is you market yourself. Okay, you market yourself to other places. And what I would do personally , I would definitely look to Council for guidance on some of these things. I'm not -- you know, I don't have every answer for every thing and nobody does. And so but I don't have the answers , but I would look for help with those kind of things. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , there is no question that Scranton 's current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MR. FOLEY: I don't personally think that $300 is too much to throw your garbage out personally . Some people do. But I would let the courts decide whether it was legal or not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 legal to charge 300. I think it was 175 before, okay, and now it's 300. And if you pay it early it's 270. And I always pay mine early. But I just don't think that that's too much to pay. I think our garbage men, I'll call them garbage men or sanitation workers or DPW workers , whatever words are the right words to use. I think they do an excellent job. Every Tuesday my garbage gets picked up. That's kind of what I care about, okay? It's a cost of doing business . It's a cost of living in the City. You could live in Moscow. And I lived up there 20 years -- we're actually Roaring Brook Township . But I lived in Moscow for those years. And we paid by the bag. It added up to $300 no matter what. So I kind of think the $300 is a fair assessment for the service s that are provided . And you just can't give things away. I don't believe the City needs to give things away. But I think they have to have value added to it. MR. ROGAN: Well, thank you very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 much. We thank you for your time and for coming in. This will conclude our interview . We'll bring in the next applicant . MR. FOLEY: Thank you. Thank you everybody here for coming. ( Stephen Tunis ) MR. ROGAN: State your name for the record and we'll have two questions for you and then the floor will be yours for opening statements . MR. TUNIS: Stephen Tunis. MR. ROGAN: And two quick questions . First, are you a resident of the City and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. TUNIS: Yes. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election to fill the remainder of the term? MR. TUNIS: I will. MR. ROGAN: I want to ask my colleagues , do we want to continue with the interview at this point because I know that we said that we're not going to entertain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 applications for those who wanted to run? MR. PERRY: Yeah, I have no problem if -- MR. ROGAN: We'll continue with the interview . We did state though for candidates to be considered we would like them not to run for the remainder of the term. But the floor is yours. MR. TUNIS: You know, I just see as being a resident for my whole life here, things come and go. And the way that this City has become it really needs to change. It really needs to get a step in the right direction . It needs to get back to being for the residents . Everything with infrastructure , anything like that with budgeting the way it pretty much is, where's all the -- where's everything go? You know, we have crumbling streets with the older generation that needs to leave because they can't afford their houses anymore because of taxes and everything else is. You know, younger generation , yeah, they're fine with working down here but they are living out of town. You know, they'll live right next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 door, Dunmore , Throop, it's better for them. You know, nobody wants to really move back into the City once they get out. And it's time to change. It's time that we're here for what really matters , the residents . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you very much for putting your letter of interest in. As I said to all of the candidates it really means a lot knowing that there's this many people that want to step up and actually do the right thing. That being said, why did you step up? Why do you want this job? And what do you think that you bring to the table that the other candidates that we talked to today, they're not going to have? MR. TUNIS: I stepped up really to try to get something . There needs to be changes , all right, so fresh face -- listen, I'm not really into politics that much. But there's a plus side there. I also -- I'm a small business owner. So when it comes to budgeting , yeah, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 let me tell you. It's a lot to do with budgeting especially when you're a one-man show. And you know, knowing different ways and how to get different things done throughout the City that is not going to cost an arm and a leg because there is multiple ways to do everything . And that's what needs to happen. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Also I'm sure you're in tune with the City and what's been going on lately. What do you feel our biggest challenge is and as interim Mayor, how would you deal with that challenge ? MR. TUNIS: I think it's gaining the trust of the residents again. You know, gaining the trust and showing them that we're actually here for them and you know we all got to work together . So there's no sides. It really needs to be everybody on the same team. You know that's how it has to be anymore. We can't keep going we're this party and we're that party. It's work here for the residents . That's what we need to do. MR. PERRY: Okay. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you for applying . The criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton or City employees for lack of a better term, were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , contributions and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps do you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator who is currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their actions in order to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. TUNIS: Yeah, the investigation needs to go further , you know, and I'm sure it is. And it will be. And it needs to be a fresh start. We need to get all the corruption out. And it's going to take some time because you know there's little things that are going to pop up here and there throughout the next year or two or even, you know, further down the line. But it needs to get taken care of because , again, they are all looking out for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 themselves . That can't happen anymore. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. One of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and mercantile tax. Both the Recovery Plan and Exit Plan include a recommendation of replacing both with a payroll prep tax. But that's only available to Act 47 cities. So the City's contracted to leave Act 47 next year. So that would have to be done this year. So what would be your thoughts on converting the BP and mercantile tax into a payroll prep tax. MR. TUNIS: I mean, if it makes sense to do that, then that's what we should do, you know, sit down, look at everything . Figure out how it's going and see how it is for the citizens and see how it is for all the small businesses and bigger businesses that are around but see which is best for them. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. If you're appointed you'll be Mayor of the City for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 approximately five months. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in that time period? In other words, what are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. TUNIS: My goal is to restore trust back for the residents and sit down, figure out with budgeting , figure out what we can do to get better, you know, with infrastructure and everything else in a City and just budgeting really. We need to figure out a budget so we're not in the hole so much and, you know, try to get everything that they want to come back. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Can you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees ? MR. TUNIS: I have been in -- well, I've been an assistant general manager as well years ago at Snow Mountain it was called when I took over. So, you know, I had employees every day. I had to go through with interviews and get everything , figure out with budgeting for all of our, you know -- I mean, figure out budgeting for everything in the restaurant field that I was in charge of. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 And then I progressed into working as a -- up in Harley Davidson also and I still -- there I had to work, you know, be there for the customer , make sure all the inventory was correct and everything was in check, later into being a small business owner myself. So, you know, I'm every day making sure the inventory is to a "T" and making sure everything is there because you got to keep track of all of your funds. MR. ROGAN: Thank you for coming. I don't have any further questions . So this concludes the interview . And we appreciate you applying . And we will call the next applicant . ( Jay Walsh ) MR. ROGAN: State your name for the record, please. MR. WALSH: My name is Jay Walsh. MR. ROGAN: And two questions before we turn the floor over to you. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the last year? MR. WALSH: Yes, I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for a full term? MR. WALSH: Excuse me? MR. ROGAN: If selected for the five month position , would you run in a special election for the two year term. MR. WALSH: Probably . MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. WALSH: I don't have anything to say. MR. ROGAN: Do any Council members have any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Walsh, thank you for taking the time to put a letter of interest in for this position . And what I would like to know from everybody is, what was your motivation ? Where is your heart? Why did you want this job? And what do you bring to the table that the other candidates that we're going to talk to today aren't going to have? MR. WALSH: Well, I don't know the backgrounds of all of the candidate s that came today. I do know Robby Webber. But I have a lot of experience in sales, marketing . And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 think I love this City. I lived here for I believe 45 to 50 years of my life. That's just about what I got to say. MR. PERRY: And finally , what do you think the City's biggest challenge is and as interim Mayor how do you plan on dealing with that challenge ? MR. WALSH: Well, first of all, I think that the fiscal responsibility I would like to bring in an outside forensic auditor to basically get a firm grasp on what the City's finances are because I'm not sure what they are. MR. PERRY: Okay. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, thank you. Thank you for applying . What are your thoughts on replacing the business privilege and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax? MR. WALSH: Well, again, I think it comes down to fiscal responsibility and getting a firm grasp on where the -- what the forensic accountant comes up with. So I would be projecting something that's not within my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 expertise at this particular moment. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Mr. Walsh, if you're appointed you will be Mayor of the City for approximately five months. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in that time period? What are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. WALSH: I think my goals are -- I think the Scranton Times had a list of people that were -- what they were looking for in their Mayor. I think I meet that criteria . And my goal is specifically to understand the fiscal responsibility and where the City sits right now. Without that I'd be ship without any sails. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: I don't have anything further . But thank you for applying . This concludes the interview and we'll call in the next candidate . MR. WALSH: Okay. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 ( James Freethy ) MR. ROGAN: Can you please state your name for the record? MR. FREETHY : James Freethy . MR. ROGAN: Then I'll have two questions and then we'll turn the floor over to you. The first one is are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. FREETHY : I am a resident . And I couldn't hear that second question . MR. ROGAN: Have you been a resident for the past year? MR. FREETHY : Yes. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for the remainder of the term? MR. FREETHY : I will. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. FREETHY : I realize that this is to fill out the term of the last Mayor that's in this town. So a lot of the programs that have been started and a lot of the sanctions that have come from Harrisburg are in place. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 So I'm going to be able to work with the team of the managers of the different departments and also realize that I have to be flexible . I know that I'm honest. And I have to be committed . One of the things that has come to my mind, I live over in the West Scranton area. And I get up every morning early and I walk. And I see a lot of litter that is all over the place. One of my endeavors is to form a group of men and women and kids in the four sections of Scranton and equip them with garbage bags and brushes and shovels to enable them to determine what work is like. I understand and I see a lot of youth walking the streets and I realize that school was probably just out. So that would be good for them to do to learn how to work. When I was a child, I was involved in the Boy Scouts and the Junior Pilgrim Fellowship of the church I go to and the Senior Pilgrim Fellowship . And to earn merit badges, I had to -- I had to be willing to do things. I do believe that -- that this City is -- has beyond the point of a turning point. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 They are back in a positive direction . And I'd like to keep it going that way. I'm honest. I'm forthright . I don't know if you've read the letter that I sent to a woman that is involved in the election system. And a couple of times I was a minority inspector over at Jackson Heights and in order for them to hire me or choose me, I must have, you know, fit the bill. And I was thinking about this yesterday . And I'm going to say it today because it came up. If God wants me to be in this position , then it's his will. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, do you have any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I do. I'm sure you're well in tune what's going on with the City of Scranton . What do you feel our biggest challenge is right now? And as interim Mayor, how would you deal with that challenge ? MR. FREETHY : Our biggest challenge is to show some honesty . And in that, that would be reflected in what I had said that I would like to have done, young people, people that can do what I said that I came up with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 with the litter pickup and maybe some recruitment from the Boys Club, maybe some recruitment from the churches and some recruitment from the Boys and Girl Scouts. Like I've said I'm going back -- to earn a merit badge, I had to -- I had to complete archery or rifle or basket weaving or anything like that. But -- and at that time, there was a YMCA. I don't know where it was located . I know there was one on North Washington Avenue right up here. But I know some people that go to the Dunmore Y to swim and exercise -- so to go to the schools to have publicity to get young people involved and in a work ethic. And it's probably all up to who the administration and -- that's in place now to have that work passed. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Freethy . That's all I have, Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for applying . One of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and mercantile tax. Both the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Recovery Plan and Exit Plan include a recommendation of replacing that tax with a payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So we're scheduled to leave Act 47 in the next year. So what would be your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MR. FREETHY : My thoughts are that's a move in the positive direction . I know this that I used to live on Sumner Avenue in West Side. My father worked for the phone company . And he bought a house up in Clarks Summit in the 60s. And my mom is still in that house. And she's still being taxed by the City of Scranton . And that's a burden on her. So to eliminate that is a good thing. To replace the monetary need, that would come from probably from Harrisburg after they put another sanction on the City to come up with an honest number of delinquent properties and out-of-town landlords as they are determined or called to have an honest evaluation and to get I would believe the money that's owed. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. If appointed you would be Mayor of the City of Scranton for approximately five months. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in that time period and what are your goals an your vision for the City? MR. FREETHY : Well, a couple of the accomplishments -- well, hope to get is what I had just spoke about. And with that in practice , I believe many people that have an open mind anyway will see that that this City and this administration means business . There was a big negative back when the Mayor had to leave office. And to get the confidence back immediately -- this is what I know, immediately is to show them in the nice weather the energy of the youth and the determination of the youth and objective of, you know, cleaning up the litter. You know, I come into Scranton once in a while on the expressway . And there is a sign there that says Welcome to the City of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 And I don't know what shape that's in -- that sign is in. So maybe it needs to be repainted . Maybe it needs to be illuminated . But I'm really going for the first aid -- the first aid is stop the bleeding and along with that first aid is to show many people in different areas of Scranton , North Scranton , West Scranton , East Side, South Side that there is work, visible work being done in the neighborhoods . And the neighborhoods like I said a while back they used to have YMCAs and bring the neighborhoods back and bring it back through the work and toil and cooperation of the City and the maintenance and supplies that I believe like rakes and brooms and shovels and bags and illuminated vests, reflected vests that could come as a one shot deal before 2019 is over with. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. FREETHY : You're welcome . MR. ROGAN: I don't have any further questions . So this will conclude our interview . Again, we thank you for applying and we will call in the next applicant . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. FREETHY : Will I hear one way or the other? MR. ROGAN: You will. MR. FREETHY : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. ( Joseph Albert ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . Would you state your name for the record, please? MR. ALBERT: Sure. Good afternoon . For those of you who don't know me, my name is Joseph Albert, US Army retired. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Albert, we have a couple questions -- MR. ALBERT: I'm also a Scranton business man. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Albert, we have two questions before you begin your presentation . The first question is, are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. ALBERT: Yes. MR. ROGAN: And the second one is, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 if selected , would you run in a special election for the remainder of the term? MR. ALBERT: No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. ALBERT: Okay. Thank you. As I said, US Army retired. I'm also Scranton business man who's been involved with the local insurance agency that's been operating here in Northeastern Pennsylvania for over 100 years. I assume you all received a copy of my resume from your clerk's office. When I filed I delivered five copies but I was told they only needed one and the office would duplicate everything , recollate , restaple. I suppose I should be honored to be here and questioned regarding my ability to be named Mayor of the City of Scranton under Section 607 of the Scranton Home Rule Charter . But I must tell you in reality I'm sad and disappointed that this is how we have to fill the office of the City of Scranton . I was told by the City Clerk that I would have five minutes to offer an opening statement . And I thought in doing so that my statement probably should be like a lady skirt, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 long enough to cover the subject and short enough to keep interest . I know you're aware of the perspective and the recent column from the Times Shamrock publication Chris Kelly who promoted this process but one missed, quote, this week we will appoint Councilman Wayne Evans, remember you read it here first. Evans will serve until the end of the year when he will win a special election and take over and finish the two years plus left in Courtright's reign of error, unquote. Gentlemen , this fears a reaction. Courage is a decision . But remember , the City that forgets its past has no future. And I've been in the City from a population of over 125,000 down to less than 65,000. And through being a leader in the Commonwealth , Scranton , producing two of its greatest Governors it's now the laughing stock of the state Northeastern Pennsylvania and the county. That's not how it has to be. In fact, I admire Noah. You remember the man that sailed on a wooden boat with two termites ? There's a lot that can be done. But it's time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 to think outside the box and put partisanship aside. Because as Winston Churchill once said, an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it eats him last. You've seen what has happened with the Scranton School District where some of you have come from. But now you have the responsibility to do what has to be done. Gentlemen , I'll return the floor to you for questions . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Thank you for your letter of interest , Mr. Albert. I do appreciate that. For knowing our City and seeing it from the outside looking in, what do you feel the City's biggest challenge is and as interim Mayor, how would you deal with that challenge ? MR. ALBERT: I see seven significant -- several significant challenges . The first is to restore some credibility , integrity and ethics as the face of the City. Whoever you appoint as Mayor has to get out, communicate to the public and present a new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 image for the City of Scranton . It's not going to be done overnight . It's not going to be done in four years. It may take two terms whoever the next Mayor of the City. But the City can rebound, recoup and become a significant contributor to the State of Pennsylvania and the United States of America . MR. PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Rogan, that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. The criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton or City employees for a lack of a better term, were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps would you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator but to also hold them accountable for their illegal actions in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 order to restore trust in City Government ? MR. ALBERT: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, sir. Say that again. MR. DONAHUE : Given this information , what, if any, steps would you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator who is currently an employee for the City but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to begin to restore trust in the City? MR. ALBERT: I think whoever you choose as the Mayor has to step forward and start exercising leadership . He has to work very closely or she whoever you choose. They have to work with the Council . This is a team effort. It's not one person. The City is comprised of people. It's a team. Council has a responsibility . The Mayor has a responsibility . And they also have hopefully the time to work together and share information , share ideas and work for the betterment of the people that they were elected to serve. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. One of the major impediment s to economic growth in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 City is the business privilege and the mercantile tax. In the Recovery Plan and Exit Plan, one of the recommendations is to replace those taxes with a payroll prep tax. So what are your thoughts on doing that? And it would have to be done this year because it has to be done under Act 47. And we're projected to leave Act 47 in the next year. So that would have to be done this year. So what are your thoughts on that? MR. ALBERT: I don't really have any to be perfectly frank with you. I would have to really seriously take a hard look, consult our legal counsel , consult with Council -- City Council and hopefully come to a conclusion and make some recommendations . MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. If you're appointed as the next Mayor, what do you plan to specifically accomplish in the next five months and what are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. ALBERT: Well, hopefully take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Scranton out of the cesspool of ridicule and give it some credibility , give it a permanent face, positive for the community for not only its citizens but for the county, and as I said, the state and hopefully the country . They'll pick up on it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Can you please tell us what your experience is managing budgets and supervising employees and what additions or cuts would you plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. ALBERT: I won't make any at this point. And it would be strictly a matter of sitting down meeting with them. Hopefully I would meet with every City employee that is currently on the City payroll , find out what they think. That's going to take time. It's just not going to be resolve d in 30 seconds , 24 hours or even a month or two months or three months. The best -- whoever you appoint , they can do is change the image of the City of Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: What are your specific plans to promote economic development in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 City of Scranton ? MR. ALBERT: I don't have any specific plans. MR. ROGAN: Fair enough. And what solutions would you support or oppose in regards to the refuse billing and collections for the City? MR. ALBERT: I don't have any solutions right now. It's a matter of if you think outside the box and you decide to do something nonpartisan and you pick someone who you think is a leader, not a follower who will give direction . Some problems will be solved. And some problems will not be solved. MR. ROGAN: We appreciate you taking the time to interview with us. This will conclude our interview . We're going to call one more candidate then we'll take a ten minute break. Thank you, Mr. Albert. MR. ALBERT: Thank you. ( Thomas Welby ) MR. ROGAN: State your name for the record, please and we'll have two quick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 questions and the floor will be yours. MR. WELBY: Tom Welby. MR. ROGAN: And, Mr. Welby, two questions . Are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. WELBY: Yes, I am. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for the remainder of the term? MR. WELBY: No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. WELBY: Thank you. And thank you all for the heck that you all have been through through this period. I'm sure you'll agree with me that the City of Scranton is wretched with a great number of residents business and City employees that care greatly about this community and were and are greatly disappointed in what's occurred in the last several months. I personally know many employees and department heads that are still in a state of disbelief and just want to move forward doing the right thing and to show everyone that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 City is full of honest, hardworking people that genuinely care about our community . While there are several issues that I would like to see resolved or implemented , I think it's important to get the input of our employees and our department heads on many of those issues. One of the items that need to be addressed as soon as possible are the contract with Northeast Revenue and whether or not the decision to not work with the county on the delinquent collections was influenced in any unfair way. I would like to work on the Licensing and Inspection and Permits Department to resolve what appear to be many ongoing issues regarding the amount of time that it takes to apply for and receive a permit to do work in the City. The City's website says that it will take one to two business days with possible exceptions . You all know because I know it also bothers your heart as well how long it takes some people to get a permit, as much as 30 days to get a permit to fix a leaky roof.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 As I understand under the structure of the department right now, the permits can only be signed by one person that being the director . I think that the requirements should be met that would allow for a second person -- at least a second person to be able to sign for them. Also, we have to find a way to work with the union to put an inspector on the streets on weekends . It's common knowledge contractors or alleged contractors that if you do any work in the City of Scranton on a Saturday or a Sunday, you do not need a permit. There are more roofing jobs done in the City of Scranton on Saturday and Sunday than all of the week days combined in any given month and besides the likely lack of permits for that work being done. The bigger or at least equally concern is the quality of the work that might be done by many unlicensed workers . And there's also with all of us a genuine fear that the work would be shotty and unsafe for the resident . Another concern that I have is that I believe that there are many grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 opportunities that are not pursued in the City leaving money on the table that will go to other communities if we don't apply for them. I'd like to work with your primary grant writer and Mr. Bulzoni to grow that department and bring in added revenue to our City and also to work with our federal , state and county officials in that area. Personally in my present position we meet regularly , that being the Chief of Staffs for the Governor 's Office for the Congressmen 's Office, for the Senator 's Office, for the State Senator 's Office from the county and also with all the other state representatives . We sit and talk about opportunities that can help move the region forward . I would like to see the City a little bit more involved in that as well. Also, communication is important for obvious reasons . I would like to see regular meetings with the Mayor with one or two members of Council and perhaps the City Clerk every two weeks for the discussion of what progress and obstructions we are experiencing that affect our City and the taxpayers .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 I'd also like to see the establishment of a business council composed of small and large business representatives that would meet monthly to discuss opportunities and to discuss roadblocks . Another issue that has come up recently that I believe must be dealt with immediately and it's the security for this building . With all due respect , it is irresponsible for this building to not be a security building . It's 2019 and we're at least 10 years lax on this incredibly important issue. There are other issues that I think must be dealt with that are equally important , not the least of which is taxpayer relief for our residents . People work in the City and businesses that want to exist or grow in the City, we're not going to grow our City if we don't find a way to extend tax relief to our residents and to our businesses . Some of the other issues that are equally important are blight. I've spent a great deal of my life obsessed about blight issues and graffiti issues. I've spent a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 of my time going around personally helping to clean up at that time. I didn't speak much of myself as far as my involvement , but I can tell you that by my actions , I am involved in the community and a lot of community organizations . And I respect the time that I had passed. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yeah. Mr. Welby, thank you for taking the time not only to come here today but submit your letter of interest . As I mentioned to all the candidates , it's just overwhelming . It's just a positive spin that we're -- there's this much good will and people willing to step up to take leadership in really one of our biggest times in need to entrust government again. But what I'd like to know from everybody is what was your motivation for submitting that letter of interest and what do you bring to the table that separates you from the other candidates that we're going to interview today? MR. WELBY: Good question . My motivation is what has driven me for all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 volunteer work that I have done for most of my life. And I actually retired from WNEP TV eight years ago. And at that time my intention was to do public service work. And I did it for almost a year when I got talked into going to work for Representative Marty Flynn in his office. And the intention there first was to be part time. And second was to be able to use that office to work for him and also to serve the people. And there we get a lot done helping people that I as Tom Welby can't call an agency or a state department and get an answer. I can't get anybody to pick up the phone. I call and I say or I write to them and say it's Chief of Staff from State Representative Marty Flynn's office. I get an answer almost immediately . We can help a lot of people. So it's terrific that I actually get paid for helping people. But some of the other things that I have done as former chairman and still board member for the last 15 years for the Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority and we're responsible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 for building a lot of trails and helping to grow this City. In a lot of different ways other than just the trails, 15 year board member for the Visitor 's Bureau which I resigned from that last year being a board member -- former board member of Outreach EOTC, board member of Neighborworks . And there's executive director volunteer for First Friday of Scranton and a few others. It's, I guess, the same nature that many of use, you included have. You're on Council to help the City and to help our people. And I feel the same way. As far as separating me from the other individuals I can't really speak to that. I think everybody -- the 16 people that have stepped up for this position know what they're getting into. And for them to have the heart and the willingness to do that and sacrifice a lot, I couldn't say what separates me from that other than I thank them for stepping up as well. It's not going to be easy for them for the next five months what they have to do in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 their personal life because of the decision they chose. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And finally , I know in your opening statement you talked about many of the different issues and challenges that we do have in our City right now. What would you prioritize to be our number one issue, our number one challenge and how would you deal with that as interim Mayor? MR. WELBY: Boy, it's almost like pick something out of a -- there are so many that are equal. I think probably finding a way to -- tax relief. If finding a way to lower and change the structure of the wage tax is a good first step and also for the saving of the business mercantile tax. If we don't continue to bring businesses into our City, we have to do something . The other part of the tax thing is finding a way to at least tax the private enterprises that exist in nonprofit properties is something that has -- we have to find a way to do that. Tax relief is number one. It's hard to say -- it's just one though. MR. PERRY: You're not going to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 too many complaints on this side with that answer. That's all I have. Thank you, Mr. Welby. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Just to touch on taxes quick, one of the major impediment s to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and the mercantile tax. As you're aware under the amendments to Act 47, you can -- municipalities are given -- Act 47 municipalities are given the opportunity to institute a payroll prep tax as an alternative to the business privilege and mercantile tax. But that would have to be done this year if -- since we're on track to exit Act 47 next year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax? MR. WELBY: Absolutely for it. And I know that there was a lot of work that this City has done to get to the level at which they can present the puzzle that would allow for that. And it's a fair way to better balance and better structure that tax. It's unfair to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 an awful lot of business that have a higher gross, the taxes on the gross, not on the net of the business . It's just totally unfair. And that would be a step in the right direction , a serious step in the right direction for our businesses . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And also lastly, the criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton or City employees were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator still employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to restore trust in the City? MR. WELBY: That's tough. You would think that anybody that knowingly was involved in what has happened in the last -- I was going to say several months. But it appears last many years that they would step up and know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 what they did and resign. I mean, there's no gray area that they should be doing it. Until all the indictments come out or all the information comes out, I don't know how we can make them admit and own up to what they did. But anyone that took anything to influence a decision should not be working or serving the City of Scranton in any way -- black and white just should not be here and should have the decency to leave. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. If appointed , you will be the Mayor of the City of Scranton for approximately five months. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in that time period and what are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. WELBY: Well, of course, the taxes -- although it's going to be very difficult for someone that's in there for five months. I know that and you know that. That's a big road that's in front of that person and I think that the next person that succeeds the temporary Mayor is the one that has the serious 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 weight to carry. But there are some things that can be done I think almost immediately and that is the improvement in how we are doing in the application for grants in the City. I forward from the State Representative Marty Flynn's office we get notifications from Harrisburg of any grant opportunities that are open and with a description of what the grant is available for, what it can be used for, whether or not matching funds is required . And that could be an obstacle for applying for something . Clearly we can't apply for if we don't have the money for the matching funds. But a lot of them don't require matching funds. And those projects that we send the opportunities over for include storm drainage problems , water runoff problems , traffic problems , paving problems . It's just about every aspect of our life it covers it. It also includes what the deadlines are for applying for it and all the links for which to apply for. And because I believe a staffing shortage , manpower shortage and a time constraint shortage , we don't apply for as much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 as we need to apply for. And leaving that money on the table is something that can be dealt with immediately . Obviously , it can only be dealt with for those that apply in that window. But I think the expansion of that department or a coordination within that department to improve it is one of the top things and one of the things that can be accomplished I think with the approval of Council and finding the money to do it in a relatively short period of time. MR. GAUGHAN : Can you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising or managing employees and what additions or cuts would you plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. WELBY: I forget for a millisecond there that that's part of the job. I served as the sales manager for WOLF TV FOX and also our internet department and had a staff that I directed at that time. Also prior to that, I worked for a place down in Wilkes-Barre called the Station Complex from '80 to '86 when I was the advertising and promotion department manager 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 and also was responsible for a lot of the entertainment that we hired that ranged from Dizzy Gillespie to Todd Rundgren and Billy Idol and a lot of other acts. And with that we had a staff of 135 people that I wasn't directly responsible for their primary jobs but I was directly responsible for anything that affected the entertainment portion of those jobs and worked with a lot of people. I had success in working with them. And you work with those people as you would and should and that is treating them with respect , treating them with dignity and expecting to be treated the same. As far as cutting costs, that would take a serious sit-down and to look at everything . We clearly have to cut costs. It's difficult for us to raise more money. We can't raise taxes. So we have to cut costs. And sitting down with Mr. Bulzoni and Council and department heads and finding ways to reduce those costs. It has to be done. MR. ROGAN: What are your specific plans to promote economic development in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 Scranton ? MR. WELBY: Meeting with the business leaders that I would hope that everybody would agree that that's something that would be okay. Monthly meetings with business community from a small auto body shop to our corporations that exist in the area and doing it monthly and talking about things that are going right, things that are going wrong and how we can improve those situations . And the same thing with developers , sitting down with developers in the area and discussing those same ways and then sitting and meeting with our federal , state, and county departments and talk about funding and ways we can bring in more cash, the RACP Programs that the state has available for the development , the tax credit programs that the state has available for development . They could be pursued in my opinion a lot greater than they are right now. MR. ROGAN: And finally , there's no question that our current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions will you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 collections ? MR. WELBY: That's -- first, I think that the refuse collection company that we're using right now in my opinion is not doing the job that they could and should be doing. I suspect you all have noticed the same things I do. We get in our office complaints about nonstate related things and we follow up on them. And there are a ton of people that the Times Tribune article pointed out to that aren't paying the refuse bills. Yet these people aren't paying the refuse bills often times have four, five and six apartments in one building . And every month you drive by their house and I posted a lot of them on FaceBook with identifications of who the owners are that aren't paying their bills. I've knocked on the door of one of them that lives on Rebecca Avenue in West Scranton that owns multiple houses that aren't paying their bills. Now granted , the refuse collectors still have to pick up that garbage . It's not fair to the neighbors to leave that garbage there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 It's also not fair to the rest of the taxpayers that are paying their bills to allow them to not pay it, whether it be the hiring to put the focus on that and to go out and cite them and get the cooperation of the district magistrates to work with the City in citing these people. There is legislation that was enabled by the state a few years ago that enables the municipalities to follow up on these people, file a lien against -- there are procedures to get to it. But after you get to it, I think it's the third level. And I'm on the County Blight to Bright Task Force and we talk about this. In fact, Councilman Evans is on the same committee and I know he feels the same way about it. There are ways to go after these people. You follow the proper procedures . We not only file the lien against that property , but you file the lien after the steps are met against every other property that they own, then you could attach it. And the same goes with tearing down houses in the City. We -- unless it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 changed -- have a policy of filing the lien against a single property . There's a property in the ten hundred block of Cedar Avenue that's owned by a company that owns 27 properties in the City. They let it go. The City paid for the demolition of this property and put a lien against that one single property I think 35 feet wide. Nobody's going to buy it because it's too narrow, the setbacks to build there. It's like filing a lien against this piece of paper. It's worthless . But the City could have if the proper procedures have been met, filed a lien against all 27 of that company 's properties . And I think if we start moving in that direction and being more diligent and doing our homework , we'll have a lot more respect to our ordinances . They aren't going to -- knowing -- if knowing that they are going to eventually be dinged for that amount or that teardown , they're going to take care of their property before it gets there. And that includes the garbage fees. They could be attached the same 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 way. MR. ROGAN: We thank you for coming in and for applying . This will conclude our interview . Council is going to take a five minute break and then we will wrap up the last six interviews . MR. WELBY: Thank you for your time. ( Dennis D'Augostine ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . If you could state your name for the record and then we'll have two quick questions before we turn over to you. MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Dennis D'Augostine . MR. ROGAN: And the two questions , the first one is, are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Yes. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for the remainder of the two-year term? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Good afternoon , Council . My name is Dennis D'Augostine . And I'm here today because I love this City and I felt I had to step forward . After all, what will become of this City if its good people don't do anything ? See, corruption is our number one problem . What becomes a number one quality for a Mayor? I suppose it should be someone who loves the City, has lived above reproach and values transparent ethical interactions above all. That's why I'm here. There are three virtues that we need to value highly that I want to introduce as Mayor. Number one, honor, integrity and trust. Number two, recovery ; number three, strong leadership . Let me begin with honor, integrity and trust. Trust and integrity in all our dealings as a city. For the past six years I have served as Chaplin to the City. And I have done so without pay and without benefits . In fact, every night I responded to a crisis or an emergency . I always did so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 without any other motivation than a genuine love for this City and a love for its people. Last summer I received a top secret security clearance , a background at the highest level in an effort to be transparent, let me assure you of this. My efforts as a Chaplin and my work as a minister at the Steamtown Church, one of the largest and fastest growing churches in Scranton will not be an obstacle to my work as a Mayor. During the five months as interim Mayor, I will relinquish these roles taking a leave of absence so as to pursue this important and noble post that of interim Mayor. I also want to be clear, religion will not inhibit my role in government . I will continue to honor God and our country 's heritage by not mixing politics and religion . Let me continue with my second point, recovery . To bring genuine healing to our City and its people. I mean, this is what I do for a living. By God's grace, I pick up broken pieces and try to restore them. In a time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 where churches are dying, I live to the building of two. These churches that I founded and manage today are ever expanding and include diverse populations such as Steamtown Espanol . There are hundreds now attending within the span of a decade. In reality , they are truly cities within a city. And can I just say that we were able to restore a beautiful historic building within our great City. But I want to restore more than buildings . I want to restore lives. I want to help people to heal and actively listen to them. My third point, strong leadership , to execute the office in a manner fitting and representative of the people. I believe that a good leader acknowledges the expertise of others and influences them through personal integrity and accountability to work as a team. Leadership can be achieved . But it can only be accomplished through active listening and well-informed decisions . Facts before acts will be my steadfast policy. As Mayor, I want to acknowledge the vast resources of potential we have in many of our people. As a leader I will work with our City Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 City employees , our business community and all of our citizens . While we have many caring employees , I will reenforce to them that we work for the people. And I will hold them accountable . My wife and I are proud homeowners . We are grateful to live debt free lives even on a modest income. As I manage a budget of more than 110 million , let me assure you I will rely on the experts . But I will also be holding them accountable and my honesty and integrity will never be suspect . In closing , here's exactly what I'm going to do to ensure that my plan happens . Number one, I will set up one day a week to welcome all citizens to meet with their Mayor. We will have direct access to me to address their concerns . This is unheard of in the history of our City. Number two, I will be present . To that end, I plan to attend City Council meetings . I'm committed to face-to-face interactions with Council not hiding behind letters or e-mails. I will be compassionately 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 fully present at all times. Number three, I will attend neighborhood association meetings with Chief Graziano . And I will require other department heads to attend when there are specific issues in the neighborhood which require their attention . I will make sure their concerns and ideas for our City are heard and where possible , act upon. Number four, I will personally return all phone calls that are directed to me. Number five, I will promote the beautiful aspects of our City. Scranton is beautiful . Number six, I will strive to make the office of Licensing , Inspections and Permits one of the most efficient and welcoming friendly offices in our City. And lastly number seven, I will give my best efforts to see Scranton not only heal but transition and prosper . That's exactly what will be accomplished in five months. In one thought , why me? For 15 years I have been a registered independent . I have two master's degrees . I am bipartisan and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 have worked tirelessly to bring honesty , integrity , trust, recovery and strong leadership in all that I do. I will continue to do so so that the next Mayor of Scranton can step up to this noble post and continue to effectively heal our City. God bless you Council . God bless you Scranton . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. D'Augostine , thank you for putting your letter of interest and bringing all the passion that you bring every day. Thank you very much for that. As a candidate for Mayor, what do you feel you bring to the table that's going to separate yourself apart from some of the other candidates that we're going to speak to today? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Integrity and honesty . MR. PERRY: Thank you. And finally , you did rattle off some of the challenges and issues that we do have in the City. Prioritizing those, what do you feel is our biggest challenge and how would you deal with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 that? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : I feel like our biggest challenge is to rebuild the trust of Scranton and its citizens . And I would be committed to do it as I laid out in my plan. Can I add one more thing? MR. PERRY: Sure. MR. D'AUGOSTINE : I also think I'm -- stability is a top quality within my life. And I think stability is what we need until the voters choose. As evidence , my work within law enforcement and my work within fire department , I de-escalate for a job mixed with much compassion and listening . And I think that sets me apart. But I don't know all the other -- MR. PERRY: Fair enough. Sometimes I just ask that question just to get inside the candidate 's head to see, you know, what do they feel that they do very well. And that's kind of another way to look at it. But, no, thank you. Your answer was absolutely fine. And I appreciate all the service you do give for the City. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 Perry. Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you for applying . The federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton , or City employees were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other property to benefit the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : That's the job of law enforcement . Can you ask it a different way? MR. DONAHUE : What steps would you take as Mayor to make sure that trust is restored in City Government in light of, you know, the current circumstances ? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : I believe trust needs be built with the citizens of Scranton . Therefore , my plan revolves completely around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 them. Also I said that I was committed to the policy of facts before acts. And I think it's very important that every department head I get to know. I hear their story where they're from, where they're passionate about the jobs they're doing. So I do that currently . I have ten staff members at my work. And they mobilize hundreds of volunteers . So I would do the same thing by getting to know them. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and the mercantile taxes. The Recovery Plan and the Exit Plan give an alternative to both by implementing a payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So the City's on track to leave Act 47 next year. So if that's going to happen, that has to be done before the end of this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Once again, that's before any action. And one of the things that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 I think is what makes a good leader is to rely on the expertise of others that I am able to discern as trustworthy and honest individuals who are incredibly skilled at what they do. So although I'm not an expert in everything , the way I would like to answer that is I would rely heavily on experts in that area and use a lot of discernment on my part to see if they are skilled and if they are operating in character , honesty and integrity . And that's a great question , Councilman Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. My first question was, what you do plan to specifically accomplish in five months. But I think you answered that on your opening statement . So thank you. My second question is, as Mayor of the City, you're going to be in charge of a budget of approximately 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of employees . So could you please tell Council what your experience is in managing budgets and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25107 supervising employees and what additions or cuts would you plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Okay. By gifting I'm a people person. And I'm told that I'm good at casting vision. I could manage people. I could manage budgets. I could manage day-to-day operations . I have done many capital improvements . But once again, I'm not saying this as to avoid your question . But man, we have a skilled Council . Each one of you I respect deeply. And we have skilled City workers . And it's just picking through and trying to discern how to rebuild the honesty and integrity of our City. And so once again, I would rely heavily on department heads to do their jobs but listen, have active ears to listen where are some of the holes and some of the problems . MR. ROGAN: Two questions , one, what are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : So I -- one thing that I will say is I am willing to drive to Philly and meet with the heads of IKEA and try to get them on the border of our Dickson City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25108 And I'm a big proponent of -- I'm an entrepreneur . That's -- I mean, that's what I -- the same giftings that, you know, to start a church would be the same giftings to start a -- so I have a big heart for local business . And so, I'm a go-getter. And I love to seal the deal. And I want people to look at Scranton and see this is as an opportunity for their business to come into and to stay here and for young people to want to come back and young people to want to stay here. And we have some of the most fantastic colleges in this area. So I would be absolutely committed as much as one can in five months to economic development , specifically IKEA. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. And secondly , there's no question that Scranton 's current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MR. D'AUGOSTINE : We're going to collect . So -- are you referring to the 6 million in -- MR. ROGAN: Part of what's owed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25109 the City but also of a grander scheme any different ideas. MR. D'AUGOSTINE : I'm committed to doing the right thing. That's what I'm committed to. So if someone wants to bring to the table and demonstrate to me how the -- a -- the honest thing to do would be to not collect . I'm willing to listen. But I want to do the right thing. And I'm committed to it. And 6 million dollars of unpaid, that's -- we need to collect that. And so, there's that balance of like I'm willing to listen. I'm willing to interact . I'm willing to be open. But what drives me is doing what is right. And that's what will drive me, Councilman Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. We appreciate your time and your interest . This will conclude the interview . And we're going to call the next applicant . Thank you again. MR. D'AUGOSTINE : Thank you, Council . ( Karin Foster ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 MR. ROGAN: If you could please state your name for the record and then there will be two quick questions before turning the floor over to you. MS. FOSTER: Karin Foster, resident of Scranton . MR. ROGAN: You already answered the first one was if you were a resident . And have you been a resident for the past year? MS. FOSTER: Yes. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election to fill the remainder of the term? MS. FOSTER: No. MR. ROGAN: Okay. The floor is yours. MS. FOSTER: Good afternoon , Councilmen and residents of Scranton . Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. Let me start off with a quote from actress Jennifer Lawrence from her national campaign to fight government corruption . "Government is ours. We pay for it. So it needs to work for us. And right now it doesn't work. It doesn't really work." Her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 words ring true to us today. Many of you know me as a community leader, an advocate from West Scranton . But I do much more. I do this work not for personal recognition or compensation . For the past decade, I've been a proven civic leader and a catalyst for change. I'm engaged with current pulse of the City. I'm involved with public and private partnerships designed to enrich the quality of life for all of our residents for their health, transportation , census data and the revitalization of West Scranton . I've been sought out as a consultant for our city neighborhoods . I became an advisor and I provided training for our neighborhood watch programs . I've served on boards, committees , and panels in leadership and treasury roles to find proactive solutions . I received leadership rewards at national , state, and local levels. My successes are contributed to my public administration listening to our community members and providing actual results . In my professional careers as a successful entrepreneur , an educator and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 communicator , I have managed finance . As an experienced grant writer and fundraiser , I have acquired , budgeted , and managed hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants and other funds for the improvement of our neighborhoods . I have been courted in the past to run for political office. I declined because at the time it was -- I was more successful as -- working with government rather than being a part of it. Right now is a time for leadership , not partisanship , political gains or more of the same. We are faced with a generation after generation of nepotism , cronyism , and corruption that needs to change. We need to work together to change the City's culture of governments and restore the public's trust. We're here today because of a fallen leader. Council , your efforts have been noble to give the mantle to the people. Is this the time for one political position to move to another or is it time to a set of fresh eyes who is not indoctrinated with past practices . We need your help to create corrective legislation and restore the faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 and trust in our City. Whomever you chose for this term, ask yourself , what is the true motivation of the person who wants this position ? How will they be able to make government work for the people? Do you want a placeholder or do you want an agent of change? Like you, I hear the frustration and anger of our residents and business nearly daily. Our taxpayers deserve better. I'm hear today for action to stand up and right the ship. First and foremost , I'm not a politician . I can offer a fresh perspective from someone looking inside. Although I'm a registered Democrat , I'm not partisan . This is essential to represent the citizens of Scranton . I do not have any immediate family members that are working for the City, nor do they wish to. The City needs an approachable , visible leader as interim Mayor. I can start on day one with the confidence that I could be prepared to do this job for the people. So how do we effect positive change for Scranton ? We need to rip the bandage and truly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 see what we're doing with -- dealing with. We need to embrace the positive steps for the independent review of the LIPS Department . We need to utilize our greatest assets, our citizens -- can I finish? MR. ROGAN: You can wrap up your thoughts , yeah. MS. FOSTER: -- as a volunteer coalition to review our departments . We need to continue the efforts to utilize our education , nonprofit and private sectors to move forward . Furthermore , the budget deadline is fast approaching . I will meet with David Bulzoni who is an incredible asset and next steps review the political impact and potential impact of current litigation . I'll meet with each department for their input and power of those who have the ability -- effective change and make the tough decisions for the betterment of the City. Gentlemen , I'm the only choice to ensure that the government is working for us and answerable to our employers the taxpayers . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Well, first of all, Mrs. Foster, thank you for taking time, stepping up and, you know, doing what really you do best in helping out the community and applying for this position for the biggest position that we have at one of the most important times. So thank you very much for that. Now, what do you feel is our biggest challenge facing us right now in the City? And as interim Mayor, how would you deal with that challenge ? MS. FOSTER: Perception of our City Government needs to change. We need to show them that we are working for the community and that if we need to take care of issues that are standing in our way that we take care of them immediately . MR. PERRY: And finally , what do you bring to the table as far as a candidate for Mayor that would more or less separate you from the rest of the candidates that we're going to talk to today? MS. FOSTER: I have been active in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 our community for 10 years. I am interacting with all of the other neighborhood groups and nonprofits as well as many collaborations . So I'm -- I have the pulse of what is coming up next and what has been done. I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get things done on day one. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. The federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton or City employees were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other property to the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify the unindicted coconspirators who are currently still employed by the City, but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions in order to restore trust in City Government ? MS. FOSTER: I would ask, first of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25117 all, at this moment if they are involved , hand in their resignation immediately . Any information that the government needs as far as to complete this case will absolutely be cooperative in those methods . I would immediately fire anyone who is involved in this. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and the mercantile tax. Both the Recovery Plan and Exit Plan include recommendations of replacing that tax with the payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So given the fact that we're on track to exit Act 47 next year, that would have to be done this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MS. FOSTER: My initial thought is if we would probably need to transition . So in that light, I would say, let's change the requirements for the mercantile tax and make it so it's on your net receipts rather than gross and then look at a stepped out procedure to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25118 into the other tax method. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in the five-month period if you were appointed Mayor? And what are your goals and your vision for the City? MS. FOSTER: I would like to have an independent group of individuals including with our local leaders and maybe some of our professionals to come in and take a look at all of our departments and make an analysis and find out where the deficiencies and where they are and see what steps we can make immediately to make things more efficient . For example , if it's a matter of putting in a paying system so you can pay your fees online or with a debit card then that should be a fairly quick fix to be able to do that. I'd like to look to having an upgrade to our DPW's dispatching system so that is more in tune, in line with the rest of the vehicles that they use in the police and the county. MR. GAUGHAN : Good. Thank you. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25119 Mayor of the City if you're appointed , you'll be in charge of a budget of roughly of 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of City employees . Can you please tell the Council what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees and what additions or cuts would you have in mind to make to the 2020 budget? MS. FOSTER: I worked in managerial positions in retail in past years. I have been a successful entrepreneur . I did not have employees with them. However , I have been working with budgets with the nonprofit that I run and also managing large sums of money through grants. As far as the employees go, I expect that if someone has a job that they are supposed to do it. And if we go exhaust every effort for the individuals to step up and do what they need, then we'll have to discuss where their future is. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Two questions . What are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MS. FOSTER: I didn't quite hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25120 you. MR. ROGAN: What are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MS. FOSTER: I think we need to take a very close look -- and I know that this is started , but ways to make development more friendly for people that want to come in and redevelop our older stock of homes. I would like to propose some hybrid of a package contractors to come in if they're rehabbing a home that it's straightforward and there's not really a fast lane but cut down on some of the red tape that they're seeing now. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , there's no question that Scranton 's current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MS. FOSTER: I see the need to have a hybrid between having the additional -- excuse me, the existing plan here but then also having something that was for low income individuals , senior citizens that only have one bag a week. There needs to be a better way to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25121 deal with our recycling . That will cut down on a lot of the trash that's going out. I lived in communities -- and this may not sound very popular . But I've lived in communities where $300 was only six months of my trash bill and it didn't take as much trash as Scranton does. So I see the value of the program that's in place now. But I also understand that it is quite pricey for people that are on fixed incomes . MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Again, we appreciate you applying . This will conclude our interview . We'll call in the next candidate . ( John Drobnicki ) MR. ROGAN: Hello. Can you please state your name for the record? MR. DROBNICKI : My name is John Drobnicki . MR. ROGAN: Two questions before we turn it over to you. One, are you a resident of the City and have you been a resident for the last year?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25122 MR. DROBNICKI : I've been a resident here for 10 years, own a home. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for the full term? MR. DROBNICKI : I haven't made my mind up yet. There's a possibility . I won't turn it down. But I haven't made up mind there yet. I just basically put in to get you guys out of trouble . MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. Thank you. MR. DROBNICKI : Okay. I worked for Advanced Auto Parts 22 years. I work in the store here on Luzerne Street. I'm a Navy brat so my father retired when I was 10 years old in Waymart . And I grew up peddling newspapers . And I'm a milkman . I worked 27 years in Waymart bidding company . I was drafted into service in 1970. I did my two years and decided to stay in the reserve . I put almost 38 years into the Army and Air Force Reserve total. I used my GI Bill and went to Lackawanna Junior College here in the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25123 I met a lot of good people in that college . It's a beautiful college . A lot of businessmen taught in there. After that, our company closed down so I wound up in Dunmore with Advanced Auto Parts. At this time they put the new highway up there. And I was looking at my older age and I figured Scranton 's a nice place to live. I found a beautiful home. My son and my granddaughter , they're with me. I'm a widow. And I like the City. And I want to see it prosper . And I see now that you have a problem . I know you're looking for impartiality . I didn't grow up here. I love the City but I'm not connected to anybody in the City. So there is no impartiality . I like to work with people. I want to come in and work with everybody . I have no hate for anybody . I just want to work with people and be fair, do the City business until everything can get back together again. And down the road if things work well, maybe I'll run again. But I'm not even looking at that avenue. I just want to get you through the few months you got ahead of you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25124 here and go back to being whatever . That's all I have pretty much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Sure. Well, Mr. Drobnicki , first I want to say thank you for your service and also thank you for you letter of interest for the interim Mayor position that we have. As you know, the City of Scranton has many challenges facing itself. What would you consider to be our biggest challenge and as interim Mayor, how would you deal with that challenge ? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, like I says, I'd like to try to maybe look out there and see if we can get anybody to move into the City and try to start work here. I even talked to my employer . They were looking at coming into this area at one time. I know it's a challenge here. Us older people are trying to hang onto our homes, you know, taxes going up, garbage bills, things like this. We're strapped with our income. I see a challenge here of doing things fairly.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25125 You know, there's a lot of, you know, people really out there saying, hey, this is the same old crooked stuff. It's going to happen over. I want to get away from that. I figured , hey, you know, get in here and be honest with people. Let's get this place going. Let's get the right people. Let's do things the right way. You know, maybe from here we can start it. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And lastly, what motivated you to send in your letter of interest for interim Mayor and what do you feel that you bring to the table that might separate you from the other candidates that we're going to speak to today? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, I worked my way up as a Master Sergeant in the service . I worked well with people. I work in a store and I have to be -- it's tough in a Fortune 500 company . You got to be fair with the public. It's hard to deal with the public. And I spent 22 years with this company . I haven't been fired. People must like me. So I'm thinking I could get together with people and get people working together . That's one of the things, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25126 yes. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the archaic business privilege and mercantile tax. Both the Recovery Plan and Exit Plan include the recommendation of replacing those taxes with payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to municipalities in Act 47. So given the fact that the City's scheduled to exit Act 47 next year, that would have to be done this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MR. DROBNICKI : I'm not really familiar with that yet. I'd have to talk to some people that are -- instruct me on that and understood it a lot better. I don't really know how to answer that question right now. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. The federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25127 City of Scranton , or City employees were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other properties to the benefit of the former Mayor. So given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirator who is currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for the illegal actions they've taken in order to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. DROBNICKI : What did you want me to do about that? MR. DONAHUE : So given that information of what was in the criminal indictment , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify City employees who are still currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their illegal actions ? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, I'm hoping that, you know, we have people on the job here that will go through that actually let the police do whatever they've got to, you know, take care of that situation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25128 MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. First, thank you for your service and thank you for coming in today. We appreciate it. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in the five-month period if you were appointed Mayor? MR. DROBNICKI : It's pretty hard to get anything accomplished just in five months. I know you have the day-to-day business to do. Putting the "I"s and the "T"s on the letters to get anything started . That was pretty much my main thing was just to get you through to get somebody elected . Like I says, I can probably try to look into maybe talking to some of my former employers about me trying to get something going here or something , work together with you guys and see what kind of things you guys have together , you know. That's about all I could do there. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Can you tell us any experience that you have in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25129 managing budgets and supervising employees and do you have any thoughts on what you might -- any additions or cuts you might make to the 2020 budget? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, I do know and I think it's hard for people to understand if there's anybody looking for any raises, I work for a Fortune 500 company . I didn't have a raise for three years. I finally got twelve cents. And I'm a taxpayer here. And people just can't be asking for big money right now, not until the public starts making money and they're the ones that pay the people to work for our City. And I really think I like to work with whoever is in charge of, you know, the (inaudible ) we've got to lay low and everyplace you go they're dumping people. They are shortening managing positions . I don't like to cut anybody . But I don't see giving out any big handouts right when we're trying really hard. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I don't have anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25130 further . Thank you for your time. We appreciate you applying . MR. DROBNICKI : Right. MR. ROGAN: And we're going to call in the next candidate . Thank you very much. MR. DROBNICKI : Thank you for having my time for this. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. ( John Keeler ) MR. KEELER: Good afternoon , Council . MR. ROGAN: Before we begin, can you state your name for the record? MR. KEELER: John Keeler. MR. ROGAN: Two quick questions before we turn the floor over to you. One, are you a resident of the City of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. KEELER: Yes, both. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election to fill the remainder of the term? MR. KEELER: If selected ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25131 MR. ROGAN: Right. MR. KEELER: No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. Thank you. MR. KEELER: I understand being the Mayor of Scranton is a trustee position , a trustee for the citizens of Scranton , I know a little bit about what being a trustee represents in the sense that I'll be the Mayor of Scranton , has a fiduciary responsibility to do what's right every single time for every single decision that would be in the best interest of the entire City and every one of its citizens . I think that we should have a total open government with complete access, complete accountability . We'd like to see -- to me, main objective here for this five-month period is to reestablish some sort of public trust in the institutions of government within the City. In order to do that, I propose if I'm fortunate enough to be selected to conduct any and all business in the outer office of the Mayor, not the private office. Number two, is to have a media representative present at all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25132 times. I think that is so important to create this atmosphere where everything is going to be done out in the open, obviously except the manners of personnel or other topic or subject matter that requires a private discussion . So I have a great deal of experience in dealing with local governments in all facets mainly we were fortunate enough to develop products and services that I spearheaded that allowed municipalities -- because all municipalities regardless of where they are, what size they are struggle to -- with tax law requirements . And the tax burdens are difficult to increase whereas the expenses continue to accumulate . So consequently , I believe that the way to help these municipalities is to create products and services that would allow the governments because of their nonprofit status the ability to invest the daily cash requirements , whatever they had on deposit with interest bearing accounts . Now, granted , that money was earmarked for certain -- had to be spent based on allocations . But we were able to help these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25133 governmental agencies increase their revenue without any tax increases . It all obviously depends on how much money is being invested and what the rates were, but it worked and we were very successful in that regard. It was a great deal of fun. I got to learn a lot about businesses . I served for 20 years as a member of the Scranton /Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority which is the largest issue or municipal bonds in Northeast and Central Pennsylvania . By virtue of dealing with different entities associated with bond deals, I became familiar with investment bankers , bond counsel , and all other parties , even the printers associated with how important municipal bonds are. And one of the most important elements that needs to be scrutinized whenever a municipality deals with bonds is the -- are the fees associated with these bond deals, not only is the interest rate expensive possibly depending upon the rating, but the fees associated with bonds are often considered to be easily added to the bond deal which creates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25134 a lot more expense . So I believe right now that I have the best background . I have a complete background . I have always been interested in the City. I have done many things to help the City. I've never had an elective office. I've never had a paycheck derived from a public entity other than the FBI when I worked for the FBI. But the idea is we need to have more input but also we need to be able to step out of the box. We need to be able to start thinking in innovative ways to develop revenue which can increase the benefits to the taxpayer , which my wife and I have lived in our house on Orchard Street for nearly 40 years. And we have I think one of the greatest fire departments . My brother Joe was the Captain on the City Fire Department for 25 years. He passed away in 2000 -- we also live where we live on Orchard Street and we're so grateful to see the police department go up and down Orchard Street and across Irving and South Webster Avenues .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25135 And we recently had a police officer move into the neighborhood . And I think personally , the Police Department of Scranton is magnificent . They do an awesome job. I think if you compare Scranton to other municipalities within the State of Pennsylvania similar size, it's easy to see that the City is hanging in there. And I believe one of the main reasons for that is the police department . So I know there's a lot of good candidates here. But I don't know if there's anyone that has the same type of resume I have, the same experience I have, the broad breadth of experience and knowledge that I have that would be -- plus leadership skills required to augment some of these products and services that the bank offered were significant . So I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to your questions . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. First of all, Mr. Keeler, thank you very much for taking the time and submitting your letter of interest for our interim Mayor position .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25136 That being said, what was your main motivation for actually submitting a letter of interest to wanting to take this job at some point, you know, will become daunting . MR. KEELER: Well, my main motivation really is that I love being a Scrantonian . I love living in the City. I have the expertise . I have the education . I have the experience to help. And I want to do that. I want to be able to help Scranton any way I can. And while I was running -- raising our family, it was very difficult to enter into public office because I just couldn't afford to lose. But now there's a situation where things have changed . And I believe it's the perfect time for me step forward and put this information and background I have to good use. So I wanted to do this basically all my life. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And the other question I was going to ask but you already answered it was what separates you from the rest, but you did touch on your knowledge of the financial institutions and the bonding . So finally , what do you see as being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25137 Scranton 's biggest challenge right now and as interim Mayor, how would you go on dealing with that challenge ? MR. KEELER: Well, I think there are two big challenges . The first challenge really is trying to reestablish an assemblance of confidence in the accountability and openness of the City Government . I think that needs to be first and foremost as a requirement for whomever is chosen for this job they have to be aware of the fact of how important it is to reestablish the sense of stability . And number two, is that the City is so important but it's changing . As a substitute teacher the last three years primarily in the Scranton schools , easy to see the demographics within the City are rapidly changing . And that's an element that needs to be looked at all times. Over in South Scranton , for example , the projects at Cedar Avenue have been magnificently impacted and turned into a really nice place like Cedar Avenue and places like that. Every -- the City is a lot different than it was when I grew up here in the 50s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25138 60s. We need to be aware of that. We need to become more inclusive . We need to understand that there are people that are moving in here that are not really accustom to being Scrantonians . I think they're the two biggest challenges is to create this atmosphere of accountability and restoring the public trust. Because after all, we are a fiduciary responsibility which is a very important responsibility . MR. PERRY: I couldn't agree more. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Keeler, for coming in. And at this point, thank you for your patience while we work through this process . Talking on restoring trust in City Government , the criminal information outlining federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton , or City employees , were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions and other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25139 property to benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify those unindicted coconspirators that are still employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their actions to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. KEELER: I don't see how I would be able to identify unindicted coconspirators unless the FBI did. I mean, I'm not sure what the legal ramifications are there. I think that I would probably if I was -- like I said, fortunate enough to have this job, I would be -- I would be inclined to consult with legal counsel on that matter because I wouldn't want to slander anybody that may or may not have been an unindicted coconspirator . Should people be identified by the federal authorities or the legal authorities , that's a horse of a different color. They would no longer be welcome as employees of the City of Scranton . Number two, I would not ever accept any contributions from anybody who was either doing business with the City or hoping to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25140 business with the City. That has long been a pail of concern over the voter and residents of Scranton is the pay for play stuff. I don't believe in it. And I wouldn't do it. No way. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the archaic business privilege and the mercantile taxes. So the Recovery Plan and the Exit Plan both recommend replacing the business privilege and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So given the fact we're on track to exit Act 47 next year, that would have to be done before this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax? MR. KEELER: I think the business privilege and mercantile tax are counterproductive . I am a firm believer in economic multipliers . I know it to be an economic law that it speaks the truth. And I believe the mercantile tax has been really an instrument in moving people out of the City, especially automobile franchises . But because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25141 they pay obviously on the gross amount. They don't pay on the net amount. And it's a counterproductive tax. But before I would eliminate any other tax, I would want to see what the ramifications would be for the budget because I don't know what -- how much money is being generated . But I would say that if I was the Mayor of Scranton , I would do whatever I possible could regardless of Act 47 or anything else to eliminate or get rid of that business privilege and mercantile tax. I think it's maybe one of the worst decisions made. It's a very negative counterproductive multiplier because what happens is, the properties are vacated . Then the properties are sold to people who may or may not pay taxes. The jobs go. So it's just a -- multipliers go both ways. And I would do whatever I could. Now, as far as creating more tax on income, I don't know. That -- we have to be very careful in Scranton . MR. DONAHUE : The payroll prep tax wouldn't be a tax on income. It's a tax on, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25142 you know, payroll preparation and it would have to be revenue neutral what you bring in for the business privilege -- MR. KEELER: Well, I don't know that much. I'd have to look into that. I'm not -- I don't know the intricacies of that tax. I understand municipalities have to tax. But mention the word tax in Scranton and you might as well mention -- it's just a negative term here. You need to stop worrying about income and start worrying about expenses . There's only so much you can do to raise income but -- without being counterproductive . Just because you raise your price doesn't mean your sales are going to increase . Many times when you raise your price depending upon how it affects other products and services , your sales are going to go down. That's what happens here. Every time you raise taxes you lose money. When you lose money and you don't cut expenses , that creates more and more deficit . And then when you -- that's exactly what happens . It's true. It's as true as I'm standing here. That's how the math works. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25143 just by the word -- increasing taxes does not necessarily mean an increase in revenue . That's the answer to that. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And it wouldn't be an increase in taxes. It would be a revenue -- MR. KEELER: I think that would be true. I don't know much about it. But when you start talking about tax, different taxes I would be very careful . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. What do you plan to specifically accomplish in the five-month period if you were to be appointed Mayor and what are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. KEELER: Well, if I am chosen for this position , which I hope I am, if I am chosen for this, my first and top priority would be to do whatever I can to fundamentally change the way the City Government is apprised by its residents . I want to be wholly accountable and out in the open and as transparent as humanly possible .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25144 I would invite a member of the new media to be in the Mayor's office all day every day. And I think as many conversations that can be recorded should be recorded . I would go out into the City, visit neighborhoods and go to neighborhood association meetings and whatever public outing I could attend to let people know that this is different now. Yeah, we had our black eyes. We've had situations that were traumatic and hard to overcome . But things have changed . And we're going to move in the right direction . That's the tough sell here. That's going to be difficult . This is not a band-aid. It's not like you're going to be able to pull it off and the cut is healed. It's going to take some time. But I believe five months with me being the Mayor is a good way to start. And as far as -- what was the second question ? MR. GAUGHAN : What would be your goals and your vision for the City? I think you answered the first part. MR. KEELER: My main objective besides that would be to try to address the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25145 need for creating more jobs. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Can you tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees and what additions or cuts might you consider to make to the 2020 budget? MR. KEELER: Well, I have considerable experience in working with budgets both as a bank -- each department had the responsibility of creating and managing our own budgets . Plus when I was President of Scranton Neighborhood Housing Services , we were required by the federal statute to create, maintain , and keep track of our budget to deal with the auditors and accounting firm who audited the books and created the financial statements . I believe totally in managing finances and managing budgets . I do, however , know that budgets are only budgets . I saw somewhere in the -- I was reading in the Home Rule Charter about how some of the -- in the Administrative Code about how the question dealt with unrealistic income, which is a fatal mistake . The State of Pennsylvania when I ran 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25146 for state representative was just overwhelmingly balanced because of unrealistic , impossible revenue . They have budgeted I don't know how many millions of dollars for tolls from Route 80 that they knew aren't going to materialize in that amount of money. But it made the budget balance . I don't know. I think they should be real. There should be audits done to make sure that the numbers are reasonable . I have a great deal of experience in running and managing people, in managing enterprises . I ran the branch on Wyoming and Spruce for years. We had an overwhelming success there. And then when I was in Carbondale , I managed the Consumer Lending Department . And in my own life, I managed our household along with my wife's home. We tried to keep everything above board and pay all our bills, pay our taxes. I think my management skills are second to none really. I'm not sure that there's anybody that I know that was in there. I mean, there's a lot of great people in that room. But I have a significant amount 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25147 of management experience . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: What are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MR. KELLER: Well, specifically I think what Councilman Donahue mentioned is the right way to start looking at a way to eliminate the mercantile tax. I don't know what -- the financial plan has changed -- the way the state runs. But when we were involved with the KOZ and the KOEZ zones here in Scranton , which I was a big advocate of those two programs , it created a tremendous amount of revenue . And on face value, it looked like the City was giving away and it turned out to be a bonanza . And the -- that's the sort of thing that I will look to see. I would work with the Chamber . I think the Chamber needs to be a lot more Scranton oriented , the City of Scranton oriented . And we need -- I've spent years on the MetroAction Board working close -- the concert with everybody connected with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25148 Chamber to try to develop business . And I believe I would go out to certain places. Rochester , Syracuse -- towns that are not that far away that have major companies headquartered there and try -- sell to them how important it would be and how much benefit it would be to their company to locate here. And that's what I would do. Plus, under the Chamber through MetroAction -- and I don't know if they still have that. But other fundamental ways they have to provide business loans even the University through their small business development center can provide small business with capital to get their business up and running and keep it running because I think the fundamental problem here as far as business development and economic development is lack of capital . We just don't have the big entities here that contribute a lot of capital to the towns. And I think that's what I would try to do. I would try to raise capital through a couple different ways but make people aware of the availability of capital through various 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25149 agencies . MR. ROGAN: And finally , there's no question that our current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MR. KEELER: Well, to me that's unconscionable what happened there. How it happened only God knows. But to me, anybody associated with that should be away. The fact that there's 13 million and a total of 17 million in delinquent obligations -- 17 million being with the fees and interest . First thing I'd do is change collection agencies . Second thing I'd do whether or not it's far-reaching , I would find out if there is any way to file a lien on someone who has delinquent taxes -- or garbage fees. Now, I know that liens are hard to enforce . I know that judgements are hard to enforce . But I would do it anyway. And I would make an example because you can't sit back and let people do that to the citizens of Scranton . That's exactly what I mean about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25150 accountability . That is an overwhelming lack of accountability . We cannot sit back and allow everybody else to pay their garbage fees. I was petrified not to pay my garbage fee on time. Not to pay -- and get away with it? How's that happen? Like, I don't know how anybody can allow that to transpire . I know there are ramifications involving what's transpired that may or may not precipitated in this taking place. But the idea that the citizens , the vast majority of citizens in town pay their garbage fees and every other tax on time, they are being overlooked because the ones who don't pay, nothing happens . I don't know. I'm not an attorney . I've been around a lot of attorneys . I've been in a tremendous amount of real estate deals financing properties . But I do know this much that that should not stand. No way should anybody in Scranton be subjected to that sort of neglect . And I mean neglect for people like me who pay our garbage fees where somebody could have 12,000, 20,000, all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25151 this money. You could pay for cops and firemen . You could balance the budget. You could do all sorts of things. You wouldn't need these taxes. That's what I mean. We can't just talk about taxes. That's not going to work anymore . Solution to the problems is what's required , not adding more revenue or more money. Oh, that's great. But the idea is we got to solve the problem . And the problem here is accountability . The problem here is understanding what the word trustee means. I'm acing on their behalf. I'm acting on their best interest . This City does not belong to me. It belongs to the citizens . But I am here to work on their behalf only, not mine. So it's just a case of -- it really makes me mad to think that that happened here. MR. ROGAN: Well, thank you, Mr. Keeler. Thank you for applying . This concludes our interview . We will bring in the next candidate and we'll be in touch. MR. KEELER: Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity . Good luck.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25152 ( Robert Weber ) MR. ROGAN: Hi. State your name for the record. Then we'll have two quick questions before we -- MR. WEBER: Robert Weber, W-E-B-E-R. MR. ROGAN: First, are you a resident of Scranton and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. WEBER: I am a resident and I have not been arrested . Is that what you said? MR. ROGAN: No, no. Have you been a resident for the past year. MR. WEBER: Oh, yes. MR. ROGAN: That's one of the requirements in the Home Rule Charter . And secondly , if selected , would you run in the special election for the remainder of the term? MR. WEBER: No. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. Thank you. MR. WEBER: As you could see from my resume that I have extensive knowledge and background in budgeting and representing local 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25153 unions or representing the Teamster 's Union for years as their Chief Officer and negotiate over hundred contracts . So I understand that end of it. I have been involved -- I coached high school and college basketball for 20 years and was involved in budgeting with the athletic departments throughout those years. And I had my own business for 14 years running a trophy and plaque business , dealt with, you know, tax issues and budgeting for that. Raised four children in the Scranton area. I've been here for 65 years and never left. And I put my name in because I think I can assist and help Council with some of the pending issues that might be sitting in front of them that weren't signed or that were refused to be signed. I think I can assist in those issues and help them make decisions that would progress this City along. I know it's a short period of time over the six months. But there is some opportunity there to be able to help out and help straighten the City out for some of the issues that are pending . Any questions ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25154 MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Weber, thank you for submitting your letter of interest . Again, I've said this to everybody . But it's very overwhelming to see such, you know, citizens step up in our time of need and really take care of the City that we all love. And although this has been a process that neither one of us really wished we weren't going through , I'm very proud of the way we're going through it and speaking to all the worthy candidates . Now, you did mention why you did step up and why you wanted this job. What do you feel that you bring to the table that might separate you from the rest of the candidates that we spoke to today? MR. WEBER: Well, I think my background kind of, you know, states that that I have basic knowledge in a lot of issues, not -- maybe not the political side of it. But throughout the Teamsters Union when we had to run for office every three years there was a lot of political issues involved in that and in attaining that three year election all the time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25155 And I just feel that sometimes eyes from the outside can see stuff that eyes from the inside might not be able to because you're locked in certain issues and sometimes that another view from the outside , someone that's not really connected with a lot of things that are currently going on. It could be very helpful at times. MR. PERRY: Sure. I agree. What do you feel are -- and there are many, but what do you feel our biggest challenge as a City is right now and how do you plan on dealing with that challenge when you become interim Mayor? MR. WEBER: Well, that's a very hard question to answer because there are basically so many issues are concerning right now. Obviously in long term, the infrastructure in the City is -- has to be dealt with, trying to bring in business to this area with the infrastructure , some of the things that are visible that you see. Big business is going to have a hard time coming in here. Taxes are an issue. The uncollecting of past delinquent taxes and garbage fees are a real issue. There's an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25156 issue there that I think how it got so high is a question . There's something that should be looked at. I think the company that does the collecting should be dealt with quickly based on the circumstances . And housing and permits , there's just so many issues that in a six month period I don't know if you could really handle all of that in that time basically assisting on issues that are brought up, yeah. MR. PERRY: All right. Well, thank you, Mr. Weber. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes, thank you for applying . And at this point, thank you for your patience as we work through this process . MR. WEBER: Yeah, Mr. Keeler took up all the time. MR. DONAHUE : The first question I have is the criminal information outlining the federal charges against the former Mayor stated that unindicted coconspirators associated with the City of Scranton , or City employees to put it simply, were directed by the former Mayor to solicit payments , campaign contributions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25157 other property for the benefit of the former Mayor. Given this information , what, if any, steps will you take to not only identify any unindicted coconspirators currently employed by the City but also to hold them accountable for their actions in order to begin to restore trust in City Government ? MR. WEBER: Oh, yeah. I think all those issues should be directly addressed and looked into. Standing from the outside you couldn't give you a good knowledgeable answer not knowing the facts behind some of the issues that are pending . But, yes, they should be dealt with. And the only problem you might have there is that if you're coming in for the six months and you deal with that in a part-time position and now there's an election for the Mayor in November , that Mayor is going to come in and maybe disassemble what you have attained for the six months. So do you address it or do you just deal with it in an ongoing basis and let the new Mayor handle that. It's a tough question to answer.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25158 MR. DONAHUE : Okay. My second question now. One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the business privilege and the mercantile tax. Both the Recovery Plan and the Exit Plan have recommendations transfer those over -- replacing those with a payroll prep tax. That's only allowable to Act 47 municipalities . So given the fact that we're on track to exit Act 47 within the next year, that would have to be done this year if it was going to happen at all. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MR. WEBER: Is that one of the issues that are sitting with Council right now to be signed or dealt with? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, from -- I think from our standpoint , you know, we're mostly in agreement . It's we're going to have to get the school board on board and it would be revenue neutral . So any money you bring in from currently from the business privilege and mercantile you would set that rate based off that number. You know, but it would spread it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25159 out more. MR. WEBER: The answer off the top of my head would be, yes, I would be very interested in agreeing to that. But obviously you have to sit down and see how it's written up and everything like that. Right off the top of my head I would say, yeah, that's a very good issue that should be addressed with immediately . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. WEBER: Yep. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. Mr. Weber, what do you plan to do specifically in that five-month period if you were appointed ? What do you specifically plan on accomplishing and in that vain, what might be your goals and your vision for the City? MR. WEBER: Well, again to assist basically what you guys have been dealing with and what is on the table to assist in maybe getting that stuff passed and moved along. Obviously in the short six month period you try to bring a little bit of respect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25160 back to the office. And for the future, again, what you can accomplish in six months might be a hard thing to answer. But you can probably get things started to move on and hopefully the new Mayor elected for the new year would continue to do that. I would say bringing in business to this area to increase the tax base because it's kind of depleting a little bit. I think that would be very important . I don't know if you can accomplish it in six months but you could sure as hell start, you know? But that's what I would look at. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Could you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees and what additions or cuts might you be considering to make to the 2020 budget? MR. WEBER: Well, involved with the Teamsters Union for many years. We dealt with a 1.5 million dollar annual budget and had to deal with making cuts sometimes to keep the office and to keep the local, you know, operating properly . And as far as dealing with people, I've dealt with a lot of office 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25161 employees that we had to at times get rid of for different reasons and held onto some good ones. And dealing with over, you know, probably 35 to 4,000 members in dealing with their personalities and conflicts and representing them on a daily basis, I'm pretty sure I can take care of any issues that are presented to me. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: What are your -- you touched on this a little bit. What are your specific plans to promote economic development in Scranton ? MR. WEBER: Well, again, I think you'd have to start with the actual infrastructure . I think again, I'm repeating myself, but if I'm running a big business and I'm being brought into the City and look around at the tax base maybe and the infrastructure of certain buildings that are here that are sitting still up that maybe should be demolished , it's hard for that person or that company to come in here and say, okay, this is going to be the area I want to come to.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25162 So I would deal with that strongly if you had a lot more time. But obviously there's avenues you have to address with the Chamber of Commerce and things like that. But that would be one of the biggest issues I would look at is try to get work and business in here to bring people. MR. ROGAN: And lastly, there's no question that our current refuse billing system is broken. What solutions would you support or oppose in regards to refuse billing and collections ? MR. WEBER: Well, there's two ways you could probably go with that. One would be the initial proposal from the county that would have allowed them to collect the taxes at a much better rate and return some money back to the City. Is that what you're talking about? MR. ROGAN: Specifically with the garbage fees, not the -- that's a whole other ball of wax that needs to be addressed . MR. WEBER: The garbage fees, I'm a very strong proponent of hiring people within the City to do the work because you're paying these firms tons of money on the outside to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25163 the collection process when you can employ people from within the City, you know, with a good supervisor and a person who has a good outlook on that to go out and collect these taxes from the City employee . So you're employing people at the same time going out and collecting instead of hiring these firms from the outside because usually the firms that are hired from the outside to come in have some ulterior motives to letting fees go beyond their tine because they get a higher percentage of collection . MR. ROGAN: Right. Well, thank you. Thank you for applying and coming in. MR. WEBER: No problem . Thank you for allowing me to be interviewed . MR. ROGAN: This will conclude our interview . We'll call in the last candidate . MR. WEBER: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. ( John Sheroda ) MR. SHERODA : Good afternoon , everyone .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25164 MR. ROGAN: State your name for the record and we'll have two quick questions then we'll turn the floor over to you. MR. SHERODA : My name is John Sheroda . MR. ROGAN: And we thank you for your patience . MR. SHERODA : No problem . MR. ROGAN: First, are you a resident of the City and have you been a resident for the past year? MR. SHERODA : Yes. MR. ROGAN: And secondly , if selected , would you run in a special election for the remainder of the two-year term? MR. SHERODA : I'm thinking about it. I'm not really sure at this time. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. SHERODA : Okay. Again, my name is John Sheroda . I'm 61 years old. I'm a resident of Scranton for most of my life. I spent about 15 years in the Peckville area. I graduated from West Scranton High School. I have a Bachelor 's of Science Degree from East Stroudsburg University . I have a Master's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25165 Degree from Cabrini College and I have 60 credits over my Masters from Penn State University . My employment is I'm a retired school teacher out of the City of Philadelphia , although even though when I was in Philadelphia , I resided in Scranton . I just bought a new home in Scranton . It's a new home to me. It's not a new home. But it's a new home to me. And I plan on staying in Scranton until my time is up. As far as my working background , I was a police officer in the City of Scranton for about a year and a half under the Com D Development in which I chose to take up education for the rest of my life and then obviously when I taught at Wallenpaupack and then I went into the City of Philadelphia and taught for 19 years in north Philadelphia . During that time I was the head football coach and head baseball coach at Martin Luther King High School. And as I said before, I just retired in June. And I'm looking forward to staying in the area and being back home full time.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25166 MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Mr. Sheroda , thank you very much, not only for your patience like was mentioned but your letter of intent for our interim Mayor at our time of need. I spoke to everyone . And I'm just very thankful to see just so many good citizens come and actually want to do the right thing when we need it most. So thank you. MR. SHERODA : Yes, you're welcome . MR. PERRY: Now, what do you feel is our biggest challenge right now within the City of Scranton and as interim Mayor, how would you go about dealing with that? MR. SHERODA : Actually I was thinking about it. I actually feel like we have three challenges really. The first one is even though I'm a union man, I feel the fire and police -- I can't think of the word now -- retirement system has to be overviewed . They do deserve a retirement . They do deserve a pension . But I think maybe my idea would be if maybe new police officers or firemen coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25167 in they would have to have a new contract for them where they might not be able to receive those benefits as they have in the past. Obviously if you are currently a fireman or a retired fireman or a police officer , you would be grandfathered into what we have now. However , I don't know if the City could handle going on with the same procedure that we're doing financially . That's number one. Number two, and I know it's two different areas. We have the school district and we have the City Government . Somehow we have to work together to get that situation rectified because the school district is very important . Without schools obviously we don't have anything . And I think those school systems -- the school system in Scranton is excellent but we have to figure out a way that we can fund the school system. We have to work hand-in-hand. And finally , when I was growing up here -- and I don't mean to harm anybody by this statement . But we had a small minority of people here which is great. But now we're very, very diversified . And I don't know if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25168 the people that are coming in from the different areas are truly -- want to be Scrantonians or they feel like they're Scrantonians . I would try to have programs or some kind of issues that make them feel more comfortable living in Scranton . MR. PERRY: Thank you. And finally , what was your motivation to put in a letter of interest for Mayor and what do you feel you bring to the table as a candidate that might separate you from the rest of the candidates that we spoke to today? MR. SHERODA : 61 years old, I lived here my whole life. I played football for the Scranton Eagles. I played for West Scranton High School. I -- this is my town. I love this town. I taught in Philly for 19 years. I never took residency in Philly only part time. I would come home on the weekends because I want to be in this area. This is my area. This is my home. And I'm very proud of this area. MR. PERRY: Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25169 questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for applying and thank you for your patience while we work through this process . One of the major impediments to economic growth in the City is the archaic business privilege and the mercantile taxes. MR. SHERODA : I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. MR. DONAHUE : The archaic business privilege and mercantile taxes, both the Recovery Plan and the Exit Plan include the recommendation of replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with a payroll prep tax. But that's only allowable under Act 47, you know, for Act 47 municipalities . And given the fact that we're scheduled to leave Act 47 sometime next year, that would have to be done this year. So what are your thoughts on replacing the BP and mercantile taxes with the payroll prep tax? MR. SHERODA : Again, I'm not really familiar with it. I really don't have an answer for that. I apologize . I'm not in tune to that area. I'm sorry.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25170 MR. DONAHUE : All right. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. What do you plan to specifically accomplish over the next few months if you're appointed Mayor and what are your goals and your vision for the City? MR. SHERODA : What I plan on if I am put in this position over the next five months, I just plan on working with City Council and try and achieve some goals. Obviously five months is a very short time. But I would really like to look into the firemen and the police officer pension to see if we can work some kind of a contract out where we don't have to pay these high fees. The other thing I'm really proud of in Scranton is if you go down Penn Avenue, it's a beautiful area right now. There's a lot of new businesses coming in. There's a lot -- the old buildings are made into apartments for older people, whatever , they're getting filled up. However , we have a problem . We're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25171 losing our young people. And as I walk through the streets and talk to people they're saying we're losing them because of our tax base. And I think that's something we have to work on. Mr. Donahue , I don't know if that's what you meant by that. I'm really not sure. But somehow we got to figure out how are we going to get the people that aren't paying their garbage taxes or all of these other -- how are we going to get this money collected ? What are we going to do to improve that situation ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. As Mayor of the City of Scranton , you'll be in charge of a budget of roughly 110 million dollars along with managing dozens of City employees . Can you please tell us what your experience is in managing budgets and supervising employees and on top of that, what additions or cuts would you plan to make to the 2020 budget? MR. SHERODA : I never handled a budget that big. I only made a hundred grand myself. But being a football coach and a teacher and everything , I've always handled my classroom . I've handled my football teams. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25172 I've handled budgets on a much smaller basis for football equipment or teaching equipment or whatever . So I am familiar with budgeting and things of that nature. As far as handling people, again, being an educator you're always in front of people. I'm not afraid to take any lashes from anybody . I'm also not afraid to work with people and discuss what our situations are. If you're a teacher , you listen to what the needs are of the students . If you're the Mayor, you may listen to what the needs are of the people. And when you listen to those and you work together with the wonderful City Council that we have, maybe things could happen. Again, five months is not a long time. I think I could really with my experience , I think I could really work with you, with the City Council and be a positive source. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. I don't have anything further . This will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25173 conclude our interview . And this will conclude actually the entire interview process . Council will be meeting and discussing the applicants . And we will hopefully have a decision by Wednesday . If not, it could drag out until the end of the month. But we will be working diligently to come to a decision . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25174 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
