MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON LACKAWANNA HEALTH & WELFARE AUTHORITY BOARD MEETING HELD AUGUST 20, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Order items? I'd like to make one comment . 3-G is correspondence that Council received from Mayor Cognetti December 24th regarding the City of Scranton 2021 operating budget. So I just want to comment on that and respond to it. And if anybody had read the Scranton Times today, Council responded as a body -- as a legislative body in the City to the Mayor's letter. So I want to read parts of that letter into the record now and also just expand on a few points. And before I do that, let me say a few things. First of all, I think it's normal for a Council and a Mayor and administration not only to work together on a budget but also to have disagreement s and have a debate -- an honest and open debate about the issues that face the City. And in this case I believe that's what happened . Although there were obviously some inaccurate claims and mischaracterizations made in the letter that was addressed to the citizens of Scranton by Mayor Cognetti . And that's why Council chose to respond to that letter. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And I'd like to read from it now for a second. So the first thing I think we have to remember with the propose d budget for 2021 that Mayor Cognetti present ed to Council in November was that it failed the most fundamental criteria for any budget and that is that it was not balanced . The Mayor's proposed budget failed to include over a quarter of million dollars in expenditures that the City is contractually obligated to pay. In order to address this deficiency , Council had to make several amendments to the Mayor's budget to make certain that it was balanced and that all essential services and departments were fully funded for the entire fiscal year. And we did work with the Mayor and the Business Administrator to fix those issues. After ensuring all departments and City services would be properly funded for 2021, we began our review of the substantive changes to the City budget which were proposed by the Mayor. I think to the astonishment of Council -- all of Council , the Mayor proposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 nearly a million dollars in new positions and salary increase s while we're in the midst of a global pandemic . And at the same time the Mayor reported to us that we were project ing a 4 and a half million dollar revenue shortfall in 2021. So just think about that for a minute in terms of your own household . There's many people throughout the City who lost their job and you don't have the same amount of income this year as you did last year. So, you know, the people of Scranton wouldn't go out and buy a new boat or buy a new car or add on an excessive amount of expenditures to their household budget. That wouldn't make any sense. And it didn't really make a lot of sense in this case. And I think that's why we made a number of changes . Instead of fulfilling the claim to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency , the Mayor's budget created new positions and added expenditures which in some cases, not all cases, but in some cases we felt were redundant , inefficient and unnecessary including the following examples : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And the first one was the creation of a Chief of staff. And this was a position that was in Mayor Cognetti 's budget for an annual salary of $70,000. The issue with this position was that it would have essentially fulfill ed the duties which have been historically perform ed by the Mayor. Mayor Cognetti claimed in the letter that the Chief of Staff would have ensured that all department s are working together as efficiently as possible and stakeholders were engaged at every turn. It's my belief that this -- that is the job of the Mayor. And it's certainly not the time to add a position worth $70,000 in the midst of the financial issues that the City is having. The Mayor also stated in her letter that the absence of this position , the Chief of Staff position does not lend itself to efficient government operation s or allow the Mayor the capacity to respond to City Council and stakeholder requests and questions within the timeframe s that we would all prefer. That statement caught me just as totally absurd. What I'm reading when I look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 at that is that now we have to wait for important information and answers to question s because the Mayor doesn't have a Chief of Staff or the people won't get answers or return phone calls because there's no Chief of Staff in the Mayor's office. You know, that -- that's bad government . And that is certainly not any way to run the City and certainly not anything to put in a letter to Council that, you know because there is no Chief of Staff that now, you know, there's the potential that we're not going to get answers to question s, not only that we ask but that the people ask us. So I was very disturbed by that. The second position was the creation of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. This was at a salary of $100,978.22. This would essentially have fulfilled the duties which have been historically performed by Chief of Police. And the major issue that I think most of us had with this was that the Mayor's plan to fund this position included taking a patrolman off the street. And that in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 opinion is the last thing that we need to do at this point in the City. The creation of a manager in the Parks and Recreation Department at salary of $50,000, the City already has a director for that department . And one of the plans that the Mayor had under her budget was to move the supervision of the employees in the Parks and Recreation Department under the Highways Department in DPW. So you would have been adding a manager without any employee s to actually supervise or manage. The Mayor stated in her letter that by Council reducing the role of the Parks and Recreation Manager and cutting neighborhoods from the department , the City's initiatives for parks, recreation and neighborhood engagement would be curtailed and slowed. Again, I believe that that is totally absurd. Number one, there's already a director that makes $52,500 a year. We don't need -- we don't believe we need another manager for $50,000 a year. This is all work that the current director can do with any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 initiative s that the Mayor has planned . And the argument that because Council kept the title of the department the same as last year instead of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhoods that that would somehow slow things down doesn't make any sense at all. And just a note, Council allocated funding for additional part-time employees to take care of over 30 parks throughout our City. And that was our argument I think all along that we know that we have a large park system in the City. We also know that we don't have enough employees to cover the large park system. For example , McDade Park I think has maybe 10 or so employees dedicate d to that one park in the county. We have a huge park at Nay Aug. We have parks all over the City. We have a very small amount of employees . So adding a manager is not going to fix that issue. Council 's plan I think was more efficient . You know, the other thing with the Parks Department , the Mayor in her letter seems to have a concern about the parks. And I think we all do. But the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 concern that I have I think we need to focus on rather than adding another position to pay $50,000 is to make sure that Nay Aug is open for next year. That's a major, major concern of mine. Nay Aug pool it's been reported that the Recreation Authority -- the Chairman of the Recreation Authority said it probably won't be open for next year. I'm assuming and praying to God that we'll have -- everyone will be able to get a vaccine next year. People are -- young children throughout our City are going to want to swim. So instead of focusing on not having a job that pays $50,000 for a redundant manager position , why don't we focus on making sure that Nay Aug pool is open next year for our resident s and our citizens . And that's something I can't understand escaped this administration because we knew that was an issue going back well into last year. There was money in the 2020 budget for the new liner. And for whatever reason it was not expended . The Mayor also stated in her letter that because Council eliminated the position of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Confidential Secretary for the HR Department , it would hinder sensitive personnel work and collective bargaining coming due over the next two years and ongoing grievance negotiation preparations . This is a huge stretch . And I think the bottom line is that we just could not afford that position . There was also an allocation of $120,000 for part-time short-term interns whose duties were not specified . Look, I was an intern -- probably one time in our careers all of us on Council we were interns , unpaid interns . I never receive d a paid internship . And certainly the financial condition that we're in as a City, it would be great to pay interns . We can't afford it. The Mayor which I agree 100 percent with her had an intern program this year which was paid through the state. I would urge her to do that again in 2021, if possible . But to have $120,000 for funding we just could not afford that. And what Council did there was take that funding and we fully funded ECTV. Transparency is very important to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 this Council . If we did not fund ECTV, you wouldn't be able to watch these meeting s and know and get a look at what goes on in your local government . So we made sure to fund that. There was no funding for the Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority . I know due to the pandemic there's a lot of people in the City who use the heritage valley trails throughout Scranton . We actually have an agreement with the LHVA to fund a certain percent age from our budget. So Council restored that funding . And also, we restored some funding for the Everhart Museum because I know that due to the pandemic , of course, like everyone else they're struggling . The one thing that I do take major, major issue with and I think it was a total inaccurate statement and a mischaracterization is Council stripped away funding for demolition for blighted structure s and that the City would be now limited in taking down blighted structures throughout the City. If the residents of Scranton only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 read the Mayor's letter and didn't read the budget or didn't read Council 's response , you may think that Council just ripped the demolition budget apart and didn't include anything . That makes no sense at all. This Council -- and for the seven years I've been on Council have been yelling and working with the neighborhoods about blight, working with South Side, Minooka , West Scranton , Green Ridge, the Hill Section and so on throughout every section of our City. What Council did was reallocated $30,000 from the demolition line item to veterans organization s throughout our City who like everyone else are hurting . So we took that $30,000 and we reallocated to veterans organizations . The budgeted amount for demolition was set at $200,000. Thirty thousand dollars off would be $170,000. Now, keep in mind there is $198,000 currently in an account in OECD for demolition . So for the Mayor to make the statement that this Council stripped away funding for demolition as if we don't care 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 about taking down blighted structure s is a total mischaracterization and actually is not true at all. The other thing that I'd like to point out here is that the 2020 budget, which Mayor Cognetti operated under had funding for demolition in the amount of $145,000. And as far as I could tell with the information that I was provided , the City has not spent any of those funds this year. So if they're so concerned about taking down blighted structures , why has no money been spent from that line item as far as I could see with the information I was provided . Another example in 2019, the City budgeted 150,000 for demolition , only $20,775 was spent. So again, there is money for demolition . There's more money for demolition even than was the case for the past few years. And, quite frankly , if I thought that taking $30,000 from a demolition line item would have affected blight throughout our City or affected that program , I wouldn't have done it. I certainly would not have done it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 But because of the information , because of the money that was already in the accounts , I felt we could make that move to help our veterans out. Also another point on blight. Let's remember that Council voted to hire a profession al experienced company to come in and do a top down review of the LIPS Department . The LIPS Department was a source of contention and controversy during the Courtright Administration . We felt that was important . Barry Isett and Company was hired and the Mayor put that on the shelf and that analysis has not been done. I know they're going to take that inhouse . But I just wanted to make that point. In addition to the creation of a dozen new positions , the Mayor's proposed budget included large raises for department heads including proposing increases of over $100,000. The Mayor's propose d budget also included haphazard raises for a select few unionized employees whose salaries should be determined in my opinion by their unions' collective bargaining agreement with the City. What was all the more troubling 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 about these proposed increases to expenditures , was that the Mayor's budget did not have a plan to pay for any new revenue streams . Look, again, I'll go back to your household in the City of Scranton . If you're going to buy a new car or a new boat and you don't have the income, you have to figure out a way to pay for it. And we understand -- this Council understands this isn't our money. This isn't Monopoly money. It certainly doesn't grow on trees as we all have witnessed over the last seven years. So if you're going to add a million dollars -- almost a million dollars in expenditure s to the budget, you've got to come before Council and explain how you're going to pay for those expenditures . Now, we respect -- Council respect s all of our dedicated City employees and recognizes that compare d to other similarly sized cities throughout the State of Pennsylvania , the salaries for many positions in the Mayor's cabinet are low. They are low. That is a fact. There has been a salary study done. And the numbers bear that out. Knowing that, Council approved fair, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 equitable and reasonable raises of 5 percent for the Mayor's department heads instead of the Mayor's proposed increases which in some cases gave department heads a nearly 40 percent increase in salary, 40 percent . We're in the middle of a pandemic . There are people who are losing their jobs. There are small businesses in our City and throughout our county and our state and country which are closing their doors, and yet we're suppose d to approve some department head increases of nearly 40 percent . This was outrageous . It was uncalled for, especially in light of the distressed status of the City and the financial uncertainty going into 2021 that, of course, is caused by the pandemic . Now again, if the resident s of Scranton only read the Mayor's letter, which again, there was many mischaracterizations and many inaccuracies in that letter. If you only read that letter, you would come to the conclusion that Council simply took a hatchet and gutted the Mayor's budget and attempt ed to handicap her administration for next year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 That is simply not true. There is not a morsel of truth to that. What Council did was took the fiscally responsible approach and scaled things back and worked towards what we all felt was a compromise . The Mayor's claim that Council restricted contingency funding, again, simply not true. Mayor Cognetti presented several options in her budget to close the 4 and a half million dollar shortfall projected for 2021. The Mayor's request was to tap into 6 million dollars in excess workers' compensation reserve funds that were original ly earmarked for creation of other post employment benefit s trust fund. Council rejected the Mayor's request to raid the excess money from the workers ' compensation fund because we believe that the days of allocating one-time revenue sources to close an annual budget shortfall should be over because this represents irresponsible and shortsighted fiscal policy. Instead , the City should use the excess money from the workers ' compensation reserve fund to make long term investments to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 cover future retiree costs which ultimately would result in a lower total cost for providing post employment benefit s. It's a smart financial move. It was recommended by the City's auditor a few years ago. And I know that it was looked very favorably by the financial community within the City. Accordingly , Council determined that debt refinancing was the best option for the long-term fiscal health of the City. As I mentioned , many people throughout our City are suffering from the devastation caused by this pandemic . Many resident s have lost their jobs and small businesses in the City have closed their doors. Council believes that it would not only be responsible , but it would also be disrespectful to City residents and small business es who are suffering economic hardships to support the Mayor's proposals for new positions and massive salary increases . We constantly ask the people of Scranton to do more with less. Why shouldn 't our City Government do the same? So during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 these challenging times, City Government needs to deliver essential services in a reasonable and responsible manner. Ultimately the budget that was crafted by Council and passed unanimously , scaled back the raises for management employee s consider ably and eliminated what we believe to be several unnecessary positions . Our budget is fiscally responsible . We also have to remember that just a few short weeks ago in December of 2020, the Pennsylvania Economy League reported to Council that the City has a structural deficit where revenue s are not keeping pace with expenditure s. There was no way in good conscience that Council could approve Mayor Cognetti 's budget which added nearly 1 million dollars to our bottom line. And I find it hard to believe that the Mayor and her administration would be so quick to forget that the Pennsylvania Economy League is also projecting that in 2022 and 2023, we will have deficits of I think about 5 million dollars and then 8 million dollars . So, you know, it's -- it doesn't add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 up. It doesn't make sense. As the Chief Executive and leader of the City, the Mayor has the responsibility to either sign or veto the City's annual budget. In this instance , the Mayor did neither . Instead of vetoing the budget that she apparently opposed and presenting Council with an alternative plan, the Mayor decided to air her grievances with the approved budget in the media. I think we were all disappointed that the Mayor didn't reach out to Council to raise her issues with the budget which was approved on December 15th. But we extend our hand of friendship and we remain optimistic that we could work together to address the needs of our great City in the coming year. For the year 2020, I personal ly and I know that everyone on this Council worked hand-in-hand with Mayor Cognetti . I have high hopes for 2021. But I certainly cannot allow the Mayor's letter with so many mischaracterizations and inaccuracies to go unchecked . So I felt the need -- and I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 that all of us felt the need to respond to that because again, if you read the Mayor's letter, you would think that, you know, we just took a couple of pieces of paper and a sharpie and just started X-ing things out. There was a rational e behind every amendment that Council made. And some of the amendments were because we had to balance the budget and include expenditure s that were not originally included in the original budget that was present ed to Council . So again, I look forward to working with the Mayor in 2021. And I look forward to staying within the confines of the budget that Council presented . And again, I personally believe that it was a compromise that we were able to meet in the middle. And that's all I have on that. Thank you. Anyone else? Any comment s on the Third Order items? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? No announcements ? Okay. I have one. If you notice on our agenda, there's been the addition of an Eighth Order. So we have Fifth Order, Sixth Order, Seventh Order. We've added 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Eighth Order. And it's titled Old Business . This section is going to be utilize d when legislation has been previously tabled and a motion is intended to be made to place it in position for a vote. This will enable the public to be aware that the piece is being brought back as well as the ability to view on the City's website again and offer comment prior to a vote. And this was a recommendation made by our Solicitor , Kevin Hayes and our City Clerk, Lori Reed. Any other announcements ? Okay. Very good. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor, Bev deBarros , Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus? MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and second to accept public comment . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows : It's always Nay Aug, Nay Aug, Nay Aug. Capouse Pool is the Jan Brady of city parks. If the city can put all the effort into Nay Aug Pool with feasibility studies and grant seeking , why can't they do the same for the Penn Ridge Swim Complex ? MS. REED: The second submission supplied by Bev deBarros as follows : Dear Friends This is to thank you for your good work for us over the past year, but, most especially during the month of November as you crafted the 2021 Budget. As you considered the proposal , line by line, your collective wisdom and common sense, showed a knowledge of and respect for us, your fellow Scranton residents . I write this with heartfelt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 appreciation however , I was deeply disappointed at your poor judgement over the issue of the Fire Chief having a second job. I was stunned , really, that it even got as far as Council ~ that the Mayor and the Chief, himself , found this acceptable I have so much to say on the subject ~ but, for now ~ I hope that every time John Judge leaves Scranton and is out of the city for hours and days each week ~ that a substitute person is clearly put in the leadership role for when a fire erupts and life and death decisions are needed immediately . Do I need to remind you of the Jan 6, 2008 fire on Ash Street that took 3 lives? That house, somewhat boarded up, at 808 Ash St, is still standing , yet 3 people perished . MS. REED: The third submission is from Fay Franus as follows : Council , I want an answer to this question as soon as you are done reading letters from the residents . A yes or no reply. Did council go over these 55 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 amendments to the budget with the Mayor? If yes how often. If not why not? I want to hear a yes or no reply then you can explain the reasons for your yes or no reply. I did not hear one word last week from you of what Mayor Cognetti thought about your 55 changes . This is why I am very curious if you even consulted with her. What this council has done with these 55 amendments is going to set this city back years,. You say you want to move the city ahead, NO you do not. You deliberately cut Mayor Cognetti off at the knees by slashing 55 times any hopes of moving this city forward . You want Scranton to stay in the stone ages! You didn't even give the Mayor a chance for change. Oh I can already her your phony explanations as to why you did what you did. All five of you should be totally ashamed of yourselves . The people in Scranton elected Paige Cognetti to help us get out of where we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 been for 22 years. We put our trust in her. Much more than you did. We counted on Mayor Cognetti to take brave steps, put out new ideas, bring in change. That is exactly what she did and you ignored all she wanted to implement . She and her administration had a clear vision to make Scranton a city people wanted to live in not leave. But the five of you stomped all over their vision. How do you justify taking money from demolition ? People have waited years and years to have condemned houses torn down to bring up the value of their properties and for health and safety reasons as well. Mayor Cognetti has started to make a dent in that progress . The first Mayor ever to do so. Try telling the families who live in those neighborhoods with condemned properties 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 that you felt there was enough money in demolition to take care of all the properties that need to be torn down. You would be lying if you even dared trying saying so. Mayor Cognettis letter to the residents was compassionate and had a deep concern to address and take care of so many issues the people have had for years. Finally HOPE! Hope you took away. And you simply did not care! You all sit up there and just say whatever you want-- not much based on fact --just your opinions . Well your opinions are costing the city dearly. In every department in the administration . Mayor Cognetti wanted to create new jobs and give raises. Did you ever stop to think " Let's trust the Mayor's judgement on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 this and allow her plans to go through ." No! Not any of you wanted to broaden your view on how Scranton can grow. Shocking ! Did you ever stop to think that maybe job creations and pay raises are inevitable in moving forward . To have qualified people in government you most certainly should be paying them what they are worth. It is a win win for the citizens . God forbid you should take that position . Seriously why don't you do the people in Scranton a huge favor--have Mayor Cognetti come in to a meeting and go over the 55 amendments with her face to face. I strongly believe you owe that much to the citizens . All we heard is what you said at last weeks meeting with no response from the mayor. Pretty sneaky if you ask me. It is never too late to be honest -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 never to late to admit you were wrong-- never too late to allow all of us to hear the back and forth debate on these amendments --NOT just YOUR side. Will you do this for us? That is another question I really would appreciate an answer to. What the five of you did affected every one of us and may for years to come. You certainly had a chance to bring Scranton into a new bright era and you blew it. Do the right thing and reverse your budget! MS. REED: The fourth submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O I would like a clearer explanation of how 5C is to help the citizens ' of Scranton ; looks as though we are just picking up someone else's bill. O Please have someone from the Administration come to explain how they are going to keep 2021 overtime costs under control and explain how 2020 got so off track.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 O I would like to encourage Mr. Gaughan to read the Sunday Legal Notice for the upcoming Council Meeting ; only 5th, 6th and 7th Order items are included . The 3K item of the 15 December 2020 Meeting (the 39 pages of Budget Amendments ) would not have appeared . Getting close to the cutoff so I'll sign off. (Concludes Citizens comments as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: That concluded the Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. There's been a motion and second to accept public comment . On the question ? On the question , a few things. Miss Schumacher had asked about overtime . And I do have an explanation at least for the Police and Fire Department on the overtime figure because I did ask the Business Administrator , Carl Deeley. So I'll report on that in Fifth Order. Miss Schumacher comment ed about the Sunday legal notice and the budget amendments . Council did its job. We published the Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 amendment s on the agenda as we always do. The administration did not put the agenda on the website because of some kind of technical issue with the company that runs the server and I did explain that last week. So that was not the fault of Council . As for Miss Franus with her question about did we go over the 55 amendments of the budget with the Mayor, number one, a significant amount of the amendments actually are to make sure that the budget was balanced . And those were conversation s that we had with the Mayor and the Business Administrator once we identified that there were costs and expenditure s that -- in the amount of over a quarter of a million dollars that were not included . So that's number one. Number two, Council submitted the amendments to the Mayor and the Business Administrator for their review. Their response that we got back was the response that is on our agenda tonight , the letter that we received from the Mayor. So as we mentioned in our letter, the Mayor had the opportunity to veto the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 budget and present an alternative plan or present an argument . And then, you know, maybe Council could have been swayed. I don't know. But that's usually the way that it goes. The Mayor decided not to do that. And that is her right. Look, Council is doing its job here. Let's remember that for a minute. I've been on councils in the past where the Mayor's budget has just been stamped and that was it. Council looked at every -- and I know I looked at every single line item. And thank God that we did because there was mistakes . Anyone could make a mistake . I have made mistake s in the past. When you look at numbers long enough, sometimes you make mistakes . I'm simply pointing out that we did our due diligence with this budget. And you could agree or disagree with it. But we did our due diligence and we followed the process that is in place. So I think that the budget we put forward as I mentioned earlier was fiscally responsible . And again, we didn't gut the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Mayor's budget. We didn't take a hatchet out and just start X-ing things out of the Mayor's budget. We took a measured approach . And for those positions which there was more than a dozen of them, we looked at what we could afford and what was going to be redundant or what we felt was inefficient , for example , the Chief of staff. I don't remember a mayor in my lifetime and maybe I'm wrong, having a Chief of Staff. Does it sound good? Sure. Would it be good? Maybe. In the environment that we are in financially , in the environment that we're in with the deficits we're looking at moving forward , we put many of these position s in and in two or three years we're coming back and we're taking them out because we're going to need to cut someplace again. And guess what? 80 percent of our budget is already set in stone. We're already contractually obligated to pay roughly somewhere in the area of 80 percent -- maybe 75, 80 percent of our budget. So again, we didn't take everything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 out. We took everything out what we felt was not -- we couldn't afford and was not good for the citizens of Scranton . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I'm just going to make a couple quick comment s. I think you covered it pretty well. You went through all of those points there. I think I'm going to start off by saying, you know, a lot of the things that came out of the administration this year they weren't treated as business as usual. And I think the same thing should go for the budget. I think this budget was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 treated as business as usual and I don't think there is any excuse for that. Every business owner in the City is, I mean, injured , limping , you know what I mean, and to add 12 position and raises at this particular time I didn't think was right. When we were briefed by PEL, they did let us know of the creeping structural deficit that was coming in. You had mention ed it Mr. Gaughan . We had about a 3 percent increase in expenditures per year with a stagnate revenue of about 1 percent . And to add those positions and raises would add another percent to that budget. So we'd be going up 4 percent per year in expenditure s with 1 percent in revenue which just does not make sense. So with this uncertainty , I wasn't able to add that 1 percent to the budget. Like I said, you went through a lot of those points. But when we're looking at the debt refinancing , according to that letter that we seem to be backing the administration into a corner. But I think the debt refinancing was the way to go. And I think it had a two-fold method to it. The marketing and refinancing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 that we're making up that 4.5 million shortfall as well as some of these things needed to be refinanced anyway with the interest rates that they're at right now. So not only are we making up that shortfall , but we're also putting the City in a better situation going into the future which I think should be noted. Also, some of the information that was coming out was that we're running a budget surplus this year. So they're my comments . And if you guys could tell me any different when it comes to what the administration has been putting forward with the COVID reimbursements ? I know the first initial piece was about 825,000. I know right now the county is giving about 500,000 in reimburse ments. But I know that number coming out of the administration has been growing . And I'm not quite sure what that is. But I'd like to request a tentative list of what we are spending or what we are submitting to the county for that COVID reimbursement . So if you guys -- if Council feels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 that we've had an answer to that, I'll try to get that information together . But if not, I'd like to make a motion to request a definitive list of what's been spent and what's been put forward for reimbursement . MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? On the question , I do know that Director Cipriani from OECD submits to Council the cost that they're going to ask that they be reimbursed . I did ask a question about it maybe two or three weeks ago. And she did provide a breakdown of what's been -- I have to go back and look. But I think she did provide a breakdown of what's been submitted . I can't remember if she provide d a breakdown of what's actually been reimbursed by the county yet. So -- but I think we can -- I'll be in favor of it. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think a definitive list. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion by Council man Schuster signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Do you have anything else, Tom? MR. SCHUSTER : No, that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Councilman McAndrew , any comment motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have quite a few. I reserved my comments about the budget for Fifth Order. So I agree with you, President Gaughan , you know, budgets are made through compromise and disagreements , all right? And this is nothing personal . I disagree with my wife every day and we're still married 32, 33 years. I might be wrong with that. But this amended budget was one of compromise and fiscal responsibility , all right? So initially -- I want to start from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 the beginning of the process . Mr. Schuster and I sat down with the Mayor and the Business Manager to review the proposed budget, you know, we did that without violating the Sunshine Act we met in groups, all right? And then at night it was stated to us there was a shortfall . The shortfall for the budget was a million dollars , all right? The next day we were told it was 4.5. So that concerned me. That was in the very beginning . All right. So the same budget presented to us which was with a 4.5 million dollar shortfall which presented to us unbalanced . All right. But included in that million dollars added to the budget were 12 new positions , one being a Chief of Staff. All right. So this isn't the west wing. I don't know where we're coming from with a Chief of Staff. Also included in the 1 million dollars added to our budget with a 4.5 million dollar shortfall , there were large increases for a select few -- some not even working for the City a year. Of course, I had a problem with that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 At the same time having increases in this budget for people that aren't even here a year that they neglected or forget to put hundreds of thousand s of dollars in the budget for contractual increases that we had to provide for DPW and the police. And, you know, let's not make any mistake . I'm also for modernization of the City. I want to move the City forward . But in the midst of a global pandemic with such uncertainty , the citizens of this City deserve like I said from the beginning , there's need to have and nice to have. All right. I've always made my decisions and they've always been formulated by my own thought process so based on what I believe is always what's in the best interest of the taxpayer . So in the end I could live with this budget. There's some people out there that might disagree . But I own my vote. And I'm very happy and proud of my colleagues with coming up with this amended budget that we can all live with. Secondly , as Chairman of the Public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Safety Committee , it's been brought to my attention by a few people that, you know, during the past few snowstorms we have sidewalk s on bridges , one on Linden, a couple throughout the City that aren't being shovelled . So I don't know what the protocol is. I don't know what the process is or how it's done or where it's done or why it's done. I would just like to, you know, some information if Mrs. Reed could please reach out to, you know, maybe the DPW department or City Hall and just provide me with these answers to question s that are being posed to me. (Audio interruption .) MR. DONAHUE : Mark, you -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we can't hear you. ATTY. HAYES: Mark. MR. MCANDREW : -- congratulate him and wish him well on his retirement . MR. DONAHUE : Mark. MR. MCANDREW : What. MR. DONAHUE : After you brought up the sidewalks you sort of went out a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 bit. Every point after that you could start over with. MR. MCANDREW : This happens every meeting . All right. So can you hear me now? ATTY. HAYES: Yes. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : I need one of them towers that we just voted on maybe in front of my house -- or didn't vote on. All right. So Sammy Vitrus, all right, his last day of work was yesterday , 41 years of dedicated service to the City in DPW. His retirement officially is Friday. So I want to wish him a very happy retirement and wish him well and thank him again for all of his service . And then the sidewalk thing just -- I want some information if Lori can reach out to, you know, the City or DPW or both. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few. First off, I hope everyone enjoyed their holidays . I know it was really different for a lot of people this year. But this is a new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 year. I'm excited about what 2021 holds for the City of Scranton . And I don't want to rehash a lot of the points that have already been up with regards to the budget. You know, I think that they are all valid points and, you know, I do stand by my vote on the amendments and the budget that we had passed. You know, I understand that there are disagreements with the Mayor and her administration about some of those changes that we had included in there. But I know that it was fair and a compromise and something that at least our Council could all agree on. We all unanimously voted for it. So you know, I do -- and I said it in the past that I do appreciate the vision that the Mayor is bringing to this office and to this City and with her proposals and the discussions that we've had with them over the past couple of months regarding the budget. We just didn't, you know, I think I speak on behalf of everyone that we just didn't feel that was all possible this year and would prefer to see some of those changes made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 incrementally . But we did add several new positions . We did include raises. You know, I know that the salaries are still at least for department heads are still very far behind other cities. And I would like to see us catch up to that. With each year I continue to be open in ways that we can do that. I still have concerns about the potential revenue loss with COVID-19 and even if it wasn't as bad as we anticipated for 2020, you know, there are a lot of struggling businesses and people throughout the City. And I think, you know, I'd rather err on the side of caution but continue to work towards bettering the City and setting up for our future. I just as much as anyone want to move us forward . You know, I don't think that this was a backward step in any way. And that was all that I had for comments tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you. I just want to -- first, I want to also congratulate Sam Vitris on his retirement from DPW this week and to express my, you know, our extreme gratitude for his over 40 years of service to the citizens of the City of Scranton . Just to touch -- Mark, on the sidewalk thing, that's -- that has definitely been an issue going back. And I think that goes back to not having enough boots on the ground to actually get that done. But we 100 percent need to -- because it's always -- the Spruce Street corridor is always bad, Linden Street, Lackawanna coming into the City from West Side. And there's a couple others throughout the City. But we do need to figure out a way to get those done because there are a lot of people that, you know, walk in and out of the City to go -- whether it's to go to work, you know, to go to some of the stores down there or whatnot. But that is definitely something -- and that has been an ongoing issue. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 last year we brought up, you know, in conversations with the University about maybe helping us with this Spruce Street viaduct there. But because of insurance issues, they wouldn't agree to do that. So a lot of times when you go by there you'll see that the one section is clean in front of Fitzgerald Field. But, you know, there's two sections that aren't clean. The University cleans it but they won't, you know, help us out there because of some insurance issues I guess. But it's definitely something we need to address . And I'm also not going to rehash, you know, all the arguments both made in our letter that appeared this morning and, you know, what my colleagues brought up. I just want to bring up one point about the surplus and structural deficit that was mentioned in the Mayor's letter. Yes, we are looking at ending 2020 with a surplus . There's still some reconciliations that need to be done there to figure out how much of a cash surplus .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 But that is basically because of what we didn't spend money on. I know Councilman Gaughan mentioned the not spending the money on the liner for Nay Aug pool. We didn't do the Licensing and Inspection department review. We didn't do a paving program this year. You know, the list goes on there of what we didn't spend money on. So although I appreciate , you know, the administration 's management ability , it's not like we have this huge surplus because , you know, we just cut all of this waste. We have this cash surplus for 2020 because we didn't spend money. And it's things that we're going to have to continue to spend money on moving forward . In terms of the structural deficit , I mean, for her to say that, you know, that the revenue loss is laid out in the 2021 budget represent s the impact of COVID-19 and not a structural deficit , I don't believe that is entirely true. We do have a structural deficit . And it is not this administration 's fault. This goes back years due legacy costs, due to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 an outdated tax structure we were operating under. And they need to be fixed. But I, you know, we do have to have a structural deficit once, you know, when your expenditures far outpace -- when your increasing expenditure s far outpace your (inaudible ) and revenue year over year. That's what a structural deficit is. And, I mean, to say -- I think that's just disingenuous . We really need to acknowledge the fact that it's there and not -- that's something that we need to work on going into union negotiations , you know, over the course of the next year. That's all I have to add on the budget part. One request I have, Miss Reed, there's -- I've sent a couple requests to License and Inspections about a property at 2208 Prospect Avenue regarding vehicles in the yard. I know we've gotten a response that it was going through the magisterial system. I think that was our last response . But can we send a response to the License and Inspections Director asking for an update on, you know, where the situation stands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 with that property ? And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I have a few comment s. First, I'd also like to wish Sam Vitris a good retirement . You know, in this day and age to spend over 40 years in one position is remarkable to say the least. And knowing Mr. Vitris the past few years, he is someone who has integrity . He's a dedicated -- was a dedicated City employee . He actually cared deeply about the City. And if I ever had any questions about snow or anything related to the DPW, he was the first person that I was calling because he has so much experience down in that department . He wasn't only a good employee . He's just a good person in getting to know him over the last few years. He comes from a great family. And the other thing that has to be mentioned here is that, you know, he's a person that served over 40 years for the City through nine mayors, nine different administrations and he was also the President of the Local 235. He was the Union President for a very long time. And he fought valiant ly for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 the workers at the DPW. And that's not always an easy job. And he did it with honor and with integrity . So I want to wish again Mr. Vitris a happy and healthy retirement and thank him for all of the work -- all of the hard work that he did over the last 40 years. And he will definitely be missed. I also want to again, I mentioned at the top of the meeting the unspeakable tragedy regarding one of our firemen Steven Sunday who passed away last week. And I just again want to say how sorry I am for his family. It was just an unbelievable loss I know for his family and for the City. And he will definitely be missed. I also want to mention that if everyone could keep a friend of mine who I went to school with -- actually another DPW worker Eric Bower. He was involve d in a really bad accident up on East Mountain , ATV accident . So if everyone could keep him and his family in their thought s and prayers . I just also have a couple items related to City business . And the first one is the City back in 1976 instituted an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 entertainment fee. And this was a fee that businesses throughout the City would pay in the amount of $500 annually . So anyone who has any sort of entertainment , bars, restaurants anything like that they would pay $500. So the City sent bills out to establishments within the last few weeks for 2021. And I receive d a few calls from business owners for obvious reasons , you know, why should they pay $500 when there's probably not going to be any entertainment for quite some time. And these are businesses that are already hurting for money. I went back and looked in the 2021 budget and I believe the amount of revenue that this fee brings in is roughly $20,000. It's not going to be a huge hit to our budget. So what I would like to do is ask the administration if they will work with Council and they can work with Council to pass legislation to waive that fee for 2021 if at all possible just for the pure fact that it really doesn't make sense to have businesses who are already just getting crushed under the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 weight of the pandemic to pay an additional $500 for a service that they're not providing . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could send correspondence to the administration so we can get that conversation started . And I'd like to do that, you know, sooner rather than later because some of these people are getting these bills and they're scrambling . Again, I receive d a few calls on that. The second thing I would like to mention is the 2019 audit. We did -- I asked Mrs. Reed to ask for an update on this. We still do not have the 2019 audit. According to Kelly Lindsey from the Kohanski Company , the City's auditor , there's still open items that have to be rectified . I bring this up, number one, absolutely unacceptable as I mentioned before that we still do not have the audit. Number two, Lori and I received an e-mail from DCED, the Department of Community and Economic Development . And it stated in this e-mail that this would be the third notification that they sent the City from the Center for Local Government Service for a report that has to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 filed -- an annual audit and financial report. I'm not sure if that was filed. I believe you need the 2019 audit to file it. I'm not positive though. But I would like to check, Mrs. Reed, if that has been filled. And if not, I'm sure it's incumbent upon the receipt of the 2019 audit. My concern there is that according to the Pennsylvania law, municipalities that have not filed this audit with DCED by December 31st will be flagged for noncompliance and the communities will be ineligible for DCED grand funding until that AFR -- until that report has been filed. So I think we need to double-check on that. That's important . The other thing I mentioned , Kevin, if we could check again with the administration on updating -- and I'm sure they're working on this. But I know we have to update or we should update the memorandum of understanding with ECTV regarding the new funding stream that they're going to get from the City in terms of keeping them operable for 2021. So there is one in place. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 think we need to update that. Mrs. Reed, I have a question regarding OECD paving project s for 2021. I'd like to know how much funding there is total and just a status update on where OECD is with the paving project for next year. I know in January paving really isn't on the mind yet. But that does come quickly . So I'd like to know where they are in the process . There was also a resident before December 15th -- I can't remember the exact date -- but asked about $28,000 in COVID relief reimbursement for the City that they were trying -- the City was looking for website updates. And that gentleman wanted to know specifical ly a breakdown of the $28,000 cost and whether or not that was reimbursed by the county I believe he wanted to know. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could please follow up with the administration . That was a few weeks ago that we had forwarded that that gentleman was looking for an answer. I don't want to ignore him. Also, there was question s that Miss 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Schumacher and I think Miss Franus might have asked before December 15th. As far as I know, we haven't received any response from the administration . But if you could double-check on that, Lori, I'd appreciate it. Also, Miss Schumacher had asked about overtime . Obviously , the City is over budget in overtime for 2020. And I did ask the Business Administrator to provide justification for overtime in the Police and Fire Department s. And I asked if some of those costs are reimbursable . And Mr. Deeley did get back which I appreciate rather quickly . And I just want to read his response into the record. He said that for the Police Department , they're current ly running with seven fewer officers due to termination s and retirements . They currently have eight officer s that are off the road injured . They also have several officers on administrative leave most of the year. The City plans to hire at least 7 to 10 officer s in January of 2021. But it will not totally eliminate the overtime at that time because they have to still go through the field 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 training program for several months after they go through Act 120. So that was the explanation given there. For the Fire Department , he states that the Fire Department worked the majority of 2020 under the budgeted number of personnel due to retirement s in August of 2020. The department was operating with nine vacancies , which resulted in the need for overtime . The savings would have covered the increase for the overtime salary had it not needed to be transferred to cover the severance payments for the other salary. And I think I mention ed that -- the explanation for the other salary which I had asked about a few weeks ago. Thirty -- no, $3,006,45 is expected to be reimbursed from FEMA. And the current amount of COVID-19 related overtime is $80,908.02. And he states that overtime costs due to COVID had been submitted as part of the CARES Act reimbursement request . It's his understanding that this will not be reimbursed . And the next step is to apply for reimburse ment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. So he did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 provide those responses . I had additional questions about overtime . Controller , John Murray submitted his overtime report to Council and to the administration which will be in our Third Order next week. And there's a few things that I want to go through really quick. So the first one is in the final report for 2020, the DPW overtime for administration is -- it was budgeted the $250 for 2020. This is only $250 that we felt was needed for overtime and $5,861.91 was spent in overtime in the administration . So I would like a justification for why that amount of money was spent. Also, I could be wrong; but in my few years on Council , I've never seen overtime spent in OECD. I don't know that that's reimbursable from HUD, from the Department of Housing and Urban Development . But there was overtime in the amount of $1,157.69. I'd like justification for that. I believe I brought up overtime in the Law Department before. Again, we budgeted zero dollars in the Law Department , yet somehow we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 spent over a thousand dollars there. It's a -- small but still, there was nothing budgeted for it in 2020. So for the total overtime amount in 2020 according to Controller Murray's report, $1,473,750 was budgeted in 2020. The total spent at this point was $2,209,205.03. And that's a total overage of over $700,000. So I would like justification on those additional points that I just made. Also, I have a question just really about the rules and the process . And I did ask -- Solicitor Hayes had forwarded us all information about the acting titles of department director s. So right now we do have an acting Police Chief who I think is doing a wonderful job. But I would like to request from Mayor Cognetti some kind of explanation or timeline on when we're going to receive legislation naming a Police Chief, not an acting Police Chief. The Mayor appoint ed an acting -- as she termed it interim Police Chief which was effective September 12th, 2020. It's now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 January . And, Solicitor Hayes, if you could just explain -- I think what you sent us according to the Administrative Code says that if you appoint someone in an acting capacity , they only have 35 days. That applies to the cabinet department officials ? ATTY. HAYES: Right. So under the Administrative Code, the Mayor may appoint acting department directors for a period not to exceed 35 days. After 35 days, the acting director must either be approve d as permanent or dismiss ed. And no acting director could be reappoint ed to that classification for a period of six months. So I don't -- the term interim is not defined or used in the City Code. So I don't know what the classification means. You either are the permanent director or you're the acting director at least under the City Code as far as I could tell. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Could you reach out to the -- ATTY. HAYES: Just to be clear, I know all department -- all directors of department s that are specified in the City Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 including the Police Chief, the Fire Chief have to be approved by Council to that appointment . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So could you reach out to the Law Department and -- or the HR Department and just ask them what's going on with that? And again, I think Chief Mecca's doing a wonderful job. I just want to make sure we're, you know, following the rules and the process that's in place in the Administrative Code. ATTY. HAYES: To that point, Councilman Schuster , had requested that I reach out to the HR Department to see who else is serving in an acting or interim capacity . And I'll follow up with that and forward your request as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. That's all I have for tonight . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.
