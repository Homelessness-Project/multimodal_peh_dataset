VOLDENBERG : We're still waiting , Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two of them. So the Knights of Columbus at St. Ann's Basilica will be having two fish fries, all right, coming up March 1st and the 15th. And they are takeout only. And the menu is, of course, beer battered cod, fries, tarter sauce, drink. Meals will be served from St. Peter and Paul's Parish, not the basilica itself on West Locust Street. The donation is $10 per meal, which is a great price. And tickets are available online or by calling 570-241-6420. And also coming up on Sunday, March 3rd will be Holy Rosary basketball Cops versus Fire Department . It benefits the Holy Rosary Youth Basketball League. It will be the Scranton Police Department versus the Fire Department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Admission is $5. There will be some raffles and 50/50. I've been there a few years in a row and it's a great event. So I encourage everyone to go. And that is all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. KING: Yes, as everyone knows on Saturday , March 9th will be the St. Patrick 's Day Parade, which will kick off with a mass at 10 a.m. St. Peter's Cathedral . And then there's going to be a race which starts at 11:00. The race this year, it's a two-mile race and it runs the entire parade route. So it's a total of two miles. It starts up here by the Cultural Center, runs down past the Cathedral , turns around and goes back. All proceed s this year for the two mile St. Patrick 's Day Parade race are going to go to Kyle Gilmartin -- Detective Gilmartin . So we're trying to encourage as many of the runners locally and regionally to try to come out and support Detective Gilmartin so that we could really try to raise some additional funds for he and his family. So that's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Oh, you could go to the parade -- if you go to the St. Patrick 's Day Parade of Lackawanna County website , that's where the registration is for that race so if anyone is looking to sign up. Thank you. MR. SMURL: I have the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association Hometown Hero Banners , it will be the last opportunity to order them March 2nd between 1 and 4 p.m., at St. Clare's Church, 2251 North Washington Avenue in the lower church -- in the lower auditorium . And the South Scranton Resident 's Association meeting was moved from last week to February 21st, tomorrow at 509 Cedar Avenue at 6:30. MR. KING: Mr. President , I have one more thing. And it has to do with the PUC and the PUC hearing . I received a call about a week ago from Attorney Jessica Eskra indicating that the PUC had reviewed all of the tapes from the hearing s. And apparently when I had indicated on there that people -- people didn't get their bills from December and then ultimately when they did get their bill in January , they got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 late charge. I kind of said that's like a punch in the face. I had indicated that the only way at that time, the only way that you could get a refund is if you contacted them and complained about it. Well, I'm told they are rectifying that. They are not -- you are not going to have to reach out to them. They're going to go back and they'll -- so everybody should look and check your bills. Any overcharges you may have gotten or late fees should be corrected in future billing . For instance , the City of Scranton got a $729 late fee because we never got the bill here for the city. So there's a lot of people out there. So I'm told, I'm told that you don't have to contact them. They will credit your future billings . That is one good thing that came out of that. So hopefully it will be a lot more positive that will come out of that and hopefully we can stop them from these increases . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton , first thing I just want to point out that the Friends of the Scranton Public Library will hold their quarter ly book sale next week starting on Tuesday , February 27th and running through Saturday , March 2nd at the Marketplace at Steamtown right in front of the Crunch Gym. These are a change in dates. We used to do it Monday through Sunday. It's now Tuesday through Saturday . You could get some great bargains , books one or two dollars and children 's book as low as 25 cents. Item 3-C on today's agenda, the budget modification , the request for HR, they want to add $54,925.79 to HR's professional services line item to pay invoices . I wonder, are those invoices from Mr. Ufberg? I suspect they probably are. And speaking of Mr. Ufberg, the union contract s for firefighter s and police are still not on the City's website . For firefighters it's been 323 days since the arbitrator signed his decision and for the police, 207 days. And I fully intend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 to bring in a cake on April 4th to celebrate the first anniversary of waiting for those documents to get on the website . Remember , I was told 120 days so the lawyers could, you know, coordinate and dot their I's and cross their T's. I'll bring in a cake and I think a bottle of champagne , okey-dokey. I'm curious , I saw in the paper quite a bit of coverage that the county is taking action against PA American Water for the pollution of Roaring Brook and Lackawanna River from dam number seven in Dunmore . Is the city doing anything to cooperate with them or support their effort? MR. SMURL: I know Bernie McGurl was involved in that. And he's on the new council that we had just formed for the Environmental Council . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I know. I was at their last -- they're not going to have another meeting for a while. Bernie Smurl is on it -- not Bernie Smurl, you know who I mean. I was just curious . I'm wondering if that pollution event was payback for the ratepayer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 complaint s about the increase -- the rate increases for water usage. I'll tell you, you know, you can't make this stuff up. We should still have The Office going. We have some great stories they could tell. Payroll preparation tax, I saw in the paper the fourth quarter payments for 2023 are due on February 28th, which means sometime after that we should be seeing some very high numbers for the year 2023, correct , unless people are delinquent . And hopefully any delinquencies will be contacted . Oh, I saw the press release on the City's website on the February 13th snowstorm , you know, where you cancelled last week. And, you know, there was -- they banned parking beginning at midnight on the 13th and, you know, so those snowplows could get through to the downtown . Well, I live downtown . And I didn't see one damn snowplow. I think we had about an inch of snow downtown and everybody ignored the parking ban. So, I don't know. I just thought that was a very amusing day. But I will say one thing, two initiatives that I'm very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 impressed by, one, is the Item 5-B, the refinancing of the 2016 notes to get a better interest rate. I mean, what you discussed during the caucus, I think that is very important . And the other one I saw in the paper was for proposal for long-term financial forecasting and planning . I think they're both very good initiatives . You need to get away from year to year budget. You need to have a long-term vision. And I think they're both thanks to Matthew Domines '. He's probably the smartest man in this building and probably the most talented . You are not going to find a replacement . So you should try to keep him. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner. First off, I want to thank Councilman McAndrew for bringing up two weeks ago the two things I brought up about the bridge on Main Avenue and educating the people in the city about gangs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 You made by wife look bad. She always says to me, why do you go to those meetings ? Nobody ever listens . So I threw that back in her face. See, somebody's listening. So thank you. MR. MCANDREW : You're welcome . MR. SPINDLER : Next thing, I don't know if anybody saw it but there's been a commercial on TV about Jews. It says Jewish people make up 2.4 percent of the United States population . And since the terrorist attack, Jewish hate has gone up 388 percent . And I think our Mayor is part of that 388 percent for refusing to raise the flag of Israel that was given to the city. And I made sure I let all of my Jewish friends know what she's doing or not doing. And it's not just Jewish people. There's many other people that aren't Jewish that support the Israeli flag being raised. And she's wrong in doing that. And I hope -- I know it will affect her when she's up for reelection . Next thing, two weeks ago on Channel 16 they ran a piece on Wilkes-Barre is fixing their potholes .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 They don't just throw cold patch and not even pank it down like we do. I'm a witness . Last week on Euclid Avenue going into the Village of Tripp Park there was a pothole. I go by there every day and that's all they do. They threw cold patch in it and had cars go over it and pank it down. In Wilkes-Barre, you know what they do? They bought a machine that keeps the asphalt heated to 250 degrees . They put it in the hole. They pank it down with a machine . And they have another machine that heats the tar to 500 degrees . They seal around the hole with the tar and then they put sand over it so it doesn't stick to anyone's car. That's permanent . What we do is temporary . It's a waste of time. Those patches they put in don't even last. I think the city should look into getting a machine like that. I think Mayor Cognetti should call Mayor Brown who I wish he was our Mayor because he's doing a heck of a job and look into getting that machine , make a permanent fix, not a temporary one. It's a great thing that they do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Next thing, Joan beat me to it. But I want to talk about what Pennsylvania American Water did with that dam and all that sediment going into Roaring Brook and the Lackawanna River. The DEP should investigate that and slap a huge fine on them. That's ridiculous . I'm surprise d Bernie McGurl and all of these other people associated with that Lackawanna River corridor aren't up in arms about that. I haven't heard many people complain about it. But that's ridiculous . They should be fined tremendously for that. It's a darn shame that they're not even going to stop those -- the brook or the river because it's -- the trout will probably die. Next thing, I'll talk about pave cuts. There's a pave cut at the corner of Main Avenue and Philo Street. I think it was the water company that did it quite a few months ago. It's where National Bakery is. They just threw blacktop in there. It's caving in. You have to either go around it or almost go really slow going over it. I go that way almost every day. It's another thing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the water company screwed up. Oh, why was the meeting cancelled last week? No answer? We had two inches of snow and it was gone by, like, noontime. And there was a parking ban in the city. Really? Two inches of snow and we had a parking ban? What is going on in this town? It's laughable . It's ridiculous that there was a parking ban for 2 inches of snow. Unbelievable . And last thing, a few people have come to this podium and say that we're going to get into world war three because of President Biden. Well, the guy that's going to get us in world war three is Donald Trump. Last week it was on the news that he ordered Putin to attack NATO countries that don't pay some kind of fee that they are suppose d to pay. So the guy's a loose cannon. And he's going to get us in world war three, not Joe Biden. Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Les. Mr. Voldenberg , will you send PAWC if it is their -- can you please be quiet? Will you see if they will send a crew up to Philo Street and Main Avenue if they did indeed make the cut or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 who made the cut? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will in the morning , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you, sir. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . The first thing I have here is during the Doherty administration the city had a paving machine like that and they scrapped it. The first thing I have here for the residents is, this is a copy of the Home Rule Charter . Now, probably the Council members here have never read it, okay? But it says in Section 312, the Council may make investigation s into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any department , office, or agency in the aid of its legisla tive powers and function s and may issue subpoena s for those purposes . And the reason I'm saying that is because Mr. Smurl last week said he was only a legisla tor. And I think it's really important to realize just how corrupt and collectively stupid our elected officials are. We have a -- we heard somebody -- the Council President say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that he didn't think that the inspector s ever did a condemn ation if they weren't certified . Well, from what I've read and the Council has the same information but they are not really sharing it with the public because they really do a terrible job at doing their job. They are extremely corrupt . Mr. King said one time, well, if I'm corrupt , prosecute me. Well, you are corrupt . And you are destroying the city. And councils like you have done it for a long time. And it's not a big secret. Everybody knows it. That's why people are fleeing the city, okay? But the city building inspector Michael Gowarty , he wasn't even certified . He condemned 31 buildings . There's a record of it. You should look at it. You're the Council . Use your powers to subpoena to figure it out. You have that power. Now, I have a hearing in front of Judge Barrasse tomorrow ; and hopefully he's going to let me combine what I have going on against the city. But, you know, suing the city in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 court is a waste of time. You're not going to end that corruption like that. You've got to get fools out of government. You know, the most serious things we're really facing in this city is we're locked right out of our City Hall. We've got corruption just running rampant. Imagine being one of the 31 people in this city that had their property condemned by an inspector who legally couldn't do the condemnation . And what about all the quality of life tickets? And, you know, when you're a person and you're trying to represent yourself at the building appeals board and the people on that board aren't allowed to ask a question -- now, you got to realize something . These five Council members created that law. You all signed it. Where are the rights of the citizens ? Where is recourse? Why does the city collect a fine and then you do an appeal and you win and you don't get your money back? Is it just a revenue enhance ment? Do you really support that kind of corruption ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 You know, Mr. Smurl, I know you're really busy. I wouldn't look up either because really it just smacks of all the corruption we're facing in this city. It's all around us. It's collective stupidity . You look at the city, for 85 years people have been leaving here. We're building a project at Nay Aug Park with the grant money. Look at the project taking place in front of the building here. They could have bought the former Stoehr and Fister building , the Court Annex building for 1.6 million dollars and moved all the city department s into that building and saved a ton of money and rented the downstairs floors for business and the city could have made money. We just keep electing people that have great plans for this city but really and honestly they have no plan. So, Mr. Smurl, what do you intend to do about 31 properties that were condemned by an inspector that didn't have the authority to do condemnations ? You're the Council President . You could put your pencil down and you could just answer my question if you would. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. SMURL: I'll answer your question in Fifth Order. MR. MORGAN: I think you should do it now. I think all the Council members should say something while somebody has a chance to say something back to you because the truth of the matter is, this city is dying because of actions like this Council and previous ones. There is no opportunity for the young people here. We squandered all this grant money. You know, at one time Scranton had a very vibrate African American community . And in the 70s, they used grant money to tear it all down. You know, you got to really see how corrupt this government is and realize that. And I'm not mixing words with you. I'm saying it right here right in front of you and telling you you're corrupt . You can't justify the Nay Aug Park Project , all the grant money you're spending. You know Licensing and Inspection s is just -- you've got all the information I have and nothing 's happening . People need to be fired including the Director . And I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 statement s that they made to the open records , everything . And it's just asinine how deceptive this Council really is. Thanks for your time. MR. SMURL: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . The Times consider s Chris Kelly a columnist . I on the other hand consider Chris Kelly no more than an over the hill has-been allowed to use the media to further his evil poison pen. He referred to me a year or so ago as an intolerable bigot prevailing upon his domain of bleeding hearts. But in reality , I consider Kelly the intolerable bigot whose -- I guess his behavior against others show his intolerance of anybody else's opinion or -- especially in politics . I've known Mr. Scavo for 15 or 20 years if anybody was wondering . I'm not taking sides. But Kelly's article was needless . It's just something to fill up pages unnecessarily to me. Frank had served his sentence . And it's time to put it aside except for people with -- little people like Kelly. You know, there's organizations and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 individuals work to assist people to get back in society . And then you have people like Kelly that work against them. What I proclaim before all of you though, is Kelly's support and admiration for an anti-American , anti-Jewish, anti-Israeli disgust ing racist who authors letter after letter year after year promoting and supporting his favorite endorsement that varmint Hamas letter after letter. And Kelly just -- Kelly takes his abusing the paper --my newfound friend. This was a terrible statement to me. Unfortunately , Dominick Sudotti {phonetic } that authors all of this trash is a resident of this city. Kelly refers to Frank's offense as a violent (inaudible ) attack. What's worse than that? Well, it's Kelly's show of admiration and friendship with his newfound friend Sudotti . That's worse. You know, to change the subject , I didn't know until a day or two ago when you go to the jail to visit, you can't bring your phone in. I didn't know this policy. And I understand it. But there should be some little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 place for people to put their phones. You know, even you had to pay a dime or a quarter to use it for a couple hours. The reason I heard about this, a young lady entrusted someone she didn't know with her phone and it disappeared . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That's all on the sign-in list. Anyone else want to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I want to address that I did ask earlier before the meeting started City Council to allow me to present an under two-minute video as part of my presentation here. It was reviewed by Council and by the attorney of this body and it was denied because it was not -- public comment was not public comment when it was video. Even though in every single meeting they have here with quorums and people in here which is present right now video projections and displays are allowed. So there's been selective use of this and I protest that. I also protest the fact that I did give them even the opportunity for an in camera review of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 material beforehand because it was brought up that the appropriateness of it may not be sensible for this body and the insurances that is may not be acceptable because they had no idea what I presented . I could present something off topic or off color. I made the comment that any one of the speakers coming to the podium can do the same thing. They didn't want to hear that argument . They didn't want to hear the argument that anything coming before this body can be off color when it comes up for public speaking as it has been. So on that, I drop that because I have limited time. This is day 726 of the war in Ukraine , almost the anniversary of the third year start. I brought a video to support Ukraine , the citizens , and the people under those burdens . But that's not allowed at this City Hall that refuses to fly the Ukrainian flag. Shame on them. The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished. Luck will still smile upon us brother Ukrainians . Our enemies will live die as the dew in the sunshine and we, too, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 brothers , will live happily in our land. We will not spare either souls or our bodies to get the freedom and prove that we are the brothers of Kozak kin. That is part of the pledge of the Ukrainian anthem. You've heard it but maybe you don't understand the words of people coming and standing up and fighting for their freedom for their home and giving their souls for what's right. I question that at this body at this point. Now, onto 5-B of this topic to keep it on topic the verbiage is very vague and it request s an obligation bond of $36,200,000. In the fifth whereas , it allows the Mayor to control and choose the use of anything unexpended . She could use $200,000, 1 million or any part of the reinvestment on the 2016 bonds and has no strings attached to what the residue of that entire bond is. So effectively by signing this with no limitation s under the fifth whereas , if she uses 2 million out of that bond and decides that 34 million dollars is play money. Hey, you've given her an open check and you've done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that beforehand with the Recovery Act funds that were suppose d to come back to this body for approval every time they were expended and was never enforced . There was a question last week about the Director of OECD if she was working for the city and the response puzzling that you cannot say if an employee is currently or not currently a city employee without exposing nonpublic information . It's somewhat evident by the city's employment portal that we're looking for both an OECD Director and a Communication Project Manager for AARP. So your secret's out. Third, it was brought before this body it's a legislative body. But for the most part, this body unlike the Congress and Senate approves no legislation -- produces no legislation . You only approve it. In the past two years, can you name five ordinance s that were produce d in this body, not rubber stamped and produced by another ? How about three? I'll leave the other terms on here because I'm running out of time. But I consider the suppression a violation of first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 amendment rights. I hope that we can review this after the meeting that it can be presented next week. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. MARGAVITCH : Council , Mark Margavitch , Scranton . I know it's a small detail, any update on the photos I requested ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not received them to date, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. So we're just going to assume that the person didn't do their job then. I guess that's safe, correct ? Anyone think that the person did their job up there? Took the photos and just aren't sharing them? Okay, we'll just assume that that's what it is. I never got a response from the director of that department . But, you know, it's only been a month or about six weeks. But anyway, I know we always say that's an administration issue. But as Mr. King, you know, I spoke to you in early May about the issue and it only came to you after I was ignored by administration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 And, you know, here's my letter to Mayor Paige Cognetti not signed for, just got it back. So we do try to reach administration but we come here for help when we don't get that answer. So now on a side note, I did hear someone mention Wilkes-Barre. I actually was there this past week at City Hall. And City Hall is wide open. I was there about 20 minutes to one. I had to wait for someone to come at one and was able to walk the whole building if I wanted to go speak to the Mayor. I just ask maybe we could do the same thing to our City Hall, get it open again. And back to the two weeks -- or three weeks ago when I spoke, I was looking for the right-to-know request . This right-to-know request was regarding the question that you had asked for me, Mr. McAndrew , about has any property ever been condemn ed by the city release d to the property owner without going through the appeal process . The city responded and said my property was and that the reason was is because I had the issue fixed. So I wanted to know that document -- I did get it. The document I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 actually shared with three people in our audience before the meeting. And I wanted to know if they could tell me by reading the document what issue I was -- that it was that I repaired. Well, they went -- it was an unfair question but I asked Mr. Les, Miss Joan and Miss Marie. And they all failed, but it's because it doesn't actually state the reason. So next week I'll be getting into that. And then, you know, I only ask that if I do prove my case of someone 's, I guess, lack of ethical standards that we look to perhaps remove this person from their position . Now, I do also want to talk about the quality of life. I did not know Mr. Morgan was talking about it. But I do have an issue with it myself. The issue that I have and if I'm incorrect when I read it, I did not see the appeals process on there. So I don't know if I am correct but this is what I was told the procedure is. When you get a citation -- we're just going to say $100. Your choice is to pay the citation . I'm not worried about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 timeframe or you could have a $300 nonrefundable appeal. Does anyone know that to be not correct ? Okay, so is there any chance that maybe we can correct that to actually be refundable and actually appropriate with the fine itself, whether we have a $100 fine and not have a $300 appeal fee? I think it's borderline, unconstitutional there, not that I have the funds to fight that. But I do believe that's a violation of due process . Attorney Gilbride , would you have any comments ? MR. SMURL: Please address , Council . You can't speak to our attorney . He's here for Council . MR. MARGAVITCH : Oh, okay. MR. KING: I think we could possibly look into that, at least research it a little bit. MR. MARGAVITCH : Yeah, and the second part of it was -- and, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to speak to you if I couldn't. I apologize . But the second part of that which was a little disturbing is that if you do want to take it to the magistrate , you're told at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that point then they're just going to double your $100 fine to 200 to go to the magistrate . Now, obviously if you lose at the magistrate , I think you deserve to pay the Court cost. I'm not disagreeing with that. But I do think it's unfair that the fine should be doubled just because you don't want to pay a $300 nonrefundable appeal. I wish I had those odds in life to give someone a bill and tell them if they don't pay me I'm going to double it. You could fight it and I don't have to give you that money back either, you know? So I'm just looking if we could possibly have thought into that. So is that what everyone believes it to be the case? Did I misspeak anything on that? $100 fine, $300 nonrefundable appeal or they'll double it in court? MR. MCANDREW : That's, you know, I've heard that also. I think it is unreasonable . So we should have the opportunity to take a look at that or explain the rational e for it. I'd pay the $100. But I'm stubborn and I agree if I believe I'm right, I'd fight with the three, but it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 fair. You lose either way. So I'll bring it up for -- MR. MARGAVITCH : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . What do think of the water company now? Isn't that lovely? We're getting ditty box charged off for water service and they contaminate the river for years, years. And by the way, if you give them a nice hefty fine or whatever , then we're going to pay the bill because they're guaranteed a profit. The ultimate in corporate greed and malfeasance . And by the way, in my neighborhood there is all kinds of water project s going on. That's six to seven days of no or low water since the beginning of January . Well, isn't that wonderful . I'd really like to see your paper that you were using to speak off of if at all possible . I'll get together with you on that, Mr. King. And the thought occurred to me that if something like that happens again, maybe we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 could have all of the -- all of the Council sign up together and then tag team so you get your point across because that was an atrocity that they shut Mr. King down. That was a real atrocity . He's an elected official . You get to listen to the (inaudible ) every week. And a lot of times people might be unhappy with the way they were treated by government. But therein again, you know, when I looked at insurance and utilities , I'm a couple hundred dollars a month behind what I was before that fancy raise because I'm going to be 70 in the spring and naturally on I'm on Social Security . So it just -- things have gotten out of hand. And our friend Mr. Trump, well, I don't want to ever see him back in office ever. He's the most unqualified -- you know, if I stop by the bar here and have five or six shots of whiskey and hit somebody on the way home even if they were a senile old person that ran out in front of me and the accident was unavoidable , it had nothing really to do with my drinking , people would want to lynch me. And then you turn around and with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Covid in September of 2020, he canceled 20 million doses of vaccine . They didn't start taking care of people. It was supposed to be medical personnel and elderly. They didn't start to deal with those people until after the first of the year 2021. It was just resentment . It was resentment over the fact that he was expecting not to -- he was expecting to lose the election because things were heating up too much. You know, you can't stop something like Covid. And by the way, our friends in China, they could have bought our vaccine which did work. Theirs didn't and they still have it going on. They just unlock people up two or three years from now. So what do we want all of these strong men around? By the way also, if you go by the former Chamberlain plant General Dynamics , you will see cars parked right down Mattes Avenue. The reason they're parked there is because they have go through a security check to drive onto the property . And those are Scranton jobs. Eighty percent of the money is spent with the -- that we afforded Ukraine in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 the United States. And they need a lot more of it. And hopefully one of those artillery shells will wind up right up Putski's butt. Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini from Scranton . First and foremost, I would like to give continued thoughts and prayers to Detective Kyle Gilmartin . We're all praying for your recovery . Council , I would like to address each of those chairs this evening and the Oregon in the room. I'm being very serious . Since midOctober I've been here talking about a narrative about the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority and the Scranton Sewer Authority . To my dismay, this Council has yet to act on this matter. All right. I mention ed it -- fortunately , I'm usually right. Chances are there's a rain tax in those documents . And there is also a 2 percent increase per year for the next 10 years. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 You know, we're quick to talk about the water bills and the increase to that -- rightfully so we have to. But when they're able to increase it higher than the threshold and not one of these people in these chairs are addressing the issue, it becomes an issue, all right? I'm a big fan of those that are present . It's one thing to be here. But to be present is a different story. When you're present , you're able to determine the difference between right and wrong, all right. In my opinion , this body decided to have somebody from Kingston represent us who is the highest paid office here in the city. That's the Business Administrator . About two months ago, Eileen Cipriani and I had a conversation about the sale of the Parking Authority and the Scranton Sewer Authority . She mentioned at that time that her right-to-know officer Gracie was looking downstairs in the basement for the past month and could not locate those documents . Now, she's compelled at that time to tell the Law Department and the Solicitor so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 the Solicitor could verify that those document s are not here. I'm not going to ask Councilman Gilbride -- I'm sorry -- Solicitor Gilbride -- I've called a lot of people worse -- Solicitor Gilbride , I'm not going to ask him directly but, you know, there are municipal laws for the retainage of those documents . Now, President Smurl, you and I had a conversation here -- when was it, four weeks ago. You were told that they cannot locate these documents . As Council President I know looking through these -- through the City Home Rule Charter that you're incline d to notify the authorities . All right. These documents are not here. They need to be here. They need to be addressed . And you need to look at them. Eileen Cipriani did not tell the Law Department or she did -- regardless , if they are not here, they have to do something about it. You guys request ed these document s, what, a month ago, three weeks ago. Where are they? They're not here. All right. Those that are present know the difference between right and wrong. All right. We know this by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 watching the simplest of things. The Price is Right had a game, a shell game, right, spin the shells. Well, guess what, those that are present know exactly where the pickleball is. They don't kiss it on a daily basis, all right? When you make decisions like this, you get these results . Our last remaining asset are these roads. But yet we have to sit there, swerve out of the way just to prevent ourselves from getting our cars out of alignment . All right? This might be good for somebody from Oregon, but it's not good for me. This is not the Scranton that I know. This is not the Scranton that I remember . I'm asking for Eileen Cipriani 's immediate dismissal . I want her to resign. Step down. You are not doing anything good for this city. This railroad system is coming through in the not so distant future. We're nowhere near ready for this. And then now let me address the City Solicitor Jessica Eskra apparently called me on the phone because I'm asking the right questions , all right. During the process I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 told her that if she finds these documents , looks through them and if there is any wrongdoing, she has to notify the proper authoritie s, all right. If these document s are not here, she has to notify the authorities . This body, the city, you're all in violation of municipal law. Solicit or Gilbride knows this. All right. I know this because I talked to three different attorneys over 50 years' experience . I expect my answers to be address ed, all right. I'm not going anywhere . I've been here long before pickleball Paige. I'm going to be long here after her. She's not going to find that golden ticket in those pools when they open next year. All right. I expect everybody to be present next time and do the right. This is the end of the clinic. This one is free. Good night, Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? No one else. Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 resident of the East Mountain of Scranton , Pennsylvania . I just have a problem with what we do and what we don't do. A while back I brought up Serrenti . I asked what the revenue was because we had been told there would be a revenue by the Mayor herself and what was to be done. And I don't know that anybody followed up on that because there is no revenue . What was done that we were told that was going to be done? What is going on at Serrenti now? Do any of you know? MR. KING: I thought the -- didn't we ask them that? MR. SMURL: I answered it. MR. KING: They said that they never indicated that there was going to be revenue . I wasn't here when that initially -- MR. SMURL: The money part came from the police department had purchase d a program . And they said that by having that program they may be able to generate money from letting other department s come in and use it. But as far as the Serrenti Center purchase , I probably still have it here. It was not purchased with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the idea of it bringing in money. MS. SCHUMACHER : That was one of the reasons the Mayor gave for buying it. I don't know -- I'd like to know what's going on there now. I mean, how -- how long is it used? Who is using it? Is anybody else coming in at all? MR. SMURL: The Scranton Police and fire department are both utilizing it. I know worked stop up there because of a contract problem . But I don't know what else -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, that makes it okay, yeah. Has it been settled ? MR. SMURL: No, it has not. MS. SCHUMACHER : How long has it been going on? MR. SMURL: I don't know. I don't know when the job stopped . MS. SCHUMACHER : These are things, I think, the taxpayer s have a right to know. MR. SMURL: Well, there's a problem with the contract . So, you know, if the job wasn't progressing in the way that we thought , maybe that's why we stopped it and decided to hold and look at it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 believe we have as taxpayers a right to know what's going on. And you have a right to tell us -- actually an obligation , not just a right. MR. KING: I believe there's a lawsuit going on with the contractor . I believe there's a lawsuit with the contractor happened over a dispute over whatever the contract is. And I believe that's what held up the other construction . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Also, where is Engine 15? MR. SMURL: The physical truck itself? The actual engine? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. Why isn't it in its place? MR. SMURL: I don't know. I don't know. They keep backup engines there. It may even be in the Serrenti Center. I don't know where they keep it. MS. SCHUMACHER : All I know is, we were suppose d to do something with that home of Engine 15. And I took a ride up today and it is empty -- well, not totally empty. There's a four drawer file cabinet and there was something else in there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. SMURL: Yes, I know the police department were using it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Do we need that building ? What are we keeping it for if we don't need it? MR. SMURL: No, I believe we don't need it. I believe when last Council was here that did this -- it was Wayne Evans, Joe Weschler and that group. When they voted to purchase the Serrenti Center, it was to sell that fire station , use the proceed s to pay for the Serrenti Center -- the cost to operate it and stuff. And I know that was -- I know Billy Gaughan was the only one that voted no on purchasing that Serrenti Center. But that was the idea with the fire station . MS. SCHUMACHER : We were told things on the Serrenti and Engine 15. And we don't get told what's going on. I mean, I don't know that we have to hop in our car and go and see what's going on and why we're keeping that. Why are we paying insurance for a building that's sitting there with four drawer file cabinet? Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. KING: Frank, can we check the status of Engine 15? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Get an update as to, like, what's it being used for. Is there any thoughts of selling it? And, if not, why not? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I have one. Mr. King covered the Engine 15 question for Miss Schumacher . But the other one is, I know we've asked a couple times about Serrenti Center updates. But, Frank, can we reach out and get a Serrenti Center update, what work has been completed , what work is pending , what is the time utilization and by who, and what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 percentage of the project is actually completed at this point in time? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get on update, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Other than that, I'm going to save comments for Fifth Order items. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. Mostly, I'm taking notes from tonight 's meeting . So I agree with Mr. Schuster . We have been asking multiple times for an update for the Serrenti Center. And I agree with you and thank you for throwing it out there but maybe we should have the powers that be that are responsible for Serrenti Center come in for a caucus. And this way we all have the opportunity to ask the questions and not wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 for them in writing , okay? Please do that, Mr. Voldenberg . We've had them here in the past. And I think it's been a while. So I think it's a good idea that they come back. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll extend the invite. MR. SCHUSTER : If I could jump in on this. I know Chief Judge who has been one of the major people involved with Serrenti Center but I also know that Eileen Cipriani was in charge of a lot of the grant process . So it might be a good idea for Eileen Cipriani to come in with Chief Judge. I'm not sure about Chief Carroll . But I know Chief Judge and she was doing all the grant work for the projects out there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll invite them all, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Invite them all. Thank you. So next, so Mr. Mancini posed a good question . I did request these documents . I didn't get an answer. You got a better answer than I did. I didn't get one. So circle around with that. See if they do exist, I mean, obviously . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And, Solicitor Gilbride , maybe you could take a look at how many years they are suppose d to retain these documents . Are there certain document s that have to be retained longer than others? Is it five years? Is it seven years? Okay, so please clarify all that for us would you please, Solicitor Gilbride ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Where am I at here, number three. So also, you know what, you know, I have heard about the, you know, if you want to appeal when it comes to a quality of life ticket that it's a $300 nonrefundable fee. I don't know why it's 300. So that's a good question . So I would like to know what is the 300 for? Is it part of court costs, is -- MR. SMURL: I believe it's attorney fees -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, let's clarify . Let's get just that piece on the ordinance or the resolution so we all have better clarification as to why -- if you win you don't get it back or if you don't win. I think -- I think we should take a look at that. It's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 brought up more than once so it's worth another look. All right. What do I have left here? So a few weeks back we had correspondence -- President Smurl and myself and Mr. Gattens from the Zoning Board. And in the past they had a police presence . They requested one recently . And the Mayor on the 29th of January said it's going to be provided . Maybe something happened the other night. But my understanding that at last week's meeting there wasn't a police presence or yet since they requested it. So could you please look into that and see? Maybe it was overlooked, but check out the status of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Also, I believe President Smurl is going to address the rental registration letters that everybody got or most of the citizens got. I got a bunch of calls over the weekend . My daughter lives in a single across the street. She got one before me. And it's definitely a single. I just got mine today. I remember this happening 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 last year. I kind of remember it. It hasn't been confirmed if this happened to the extent it did this year. But if it did -- and I know there's a little explanation that you are going to report out. But I took a look at it. And I know you are only the messenger . But I took a look at it and I'm like this is -- so what you have to do is contact rental registration , which the phones aren't working , by the way. I don't know if you know that. But it's going to be tough to do or text them. And then they're going -- the rental department will remove the property from the mailing list and respond with the reasoning for it being a suspected rental. This is two years in a row. It's almost like shades of harassment. If something didn't work last year, they should have been better prepared for this. And I know there's multiple entities that could have been involved and how the mixup is. And there is no certainty that it won't happen next year, right? So if you have to go through this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 process every year proving that you live in a single, I think there should be a better way to identify these houses. We have ten plus code enforcement electric vehicles buzzing around the city in certain sections of the town that they are supposed to know in and out. I mean, they should be able to identify just looking that, oh, that's a double or should have a registration or that's a triple, not wait on a mass mailing that is very expensive to you guys to the residents . It's costly. But let's hope they fix it. I know you are going to report out and thank you for doing that. But I just took a look at it. And like I said, I know you're the messenger . But it just doesn't feel right two years in a row. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . So I'll continue on the rental registration . If you have receive d a letter regarding -- if you have receive d a letter regarding being a landlord or property manager and you are not, there are a number reason why this letter may have been sent to you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 They include not having a homestead exception . I don't know if I filled mine out and sent it in or previously being register ed as a rental. And on the county website if you had the property listed as a multiunit or a parcel or a mixed use or even unknown , what's happening is it kind of sets up a red flag and it sends out this letter automatically to that address . And even if your name is on -- has an address for your name but the property is a different address , that also sends out another red flag. That's why that letter went out. But this year -- I don't know how many were sent out last year or this year. But I do know this year anyone that has received this rental registration paper, if you would please just either call -- I'll give you the number. It's 570-348-4193, extension 455. Also Frank is going to put this on our website and there are copies over on Kathy's desk that I made. Or you can send it to Rselemba @Scrantonpa .gov or you can text a message. And text the message and tell them that this property is not a rental. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Now, they say once this is done, the person that takes care of this, they will respond back to you with the reason why you got the letter this year. So if you would do that, that would really help out with not getting this letter out again next year. This is for Mr. Coyne. The City Business Administrator advised Council that the information that was missing in the link should be updated shortly . It may even be back on there today. The IT Department was working on it for those blank areas that you were looking for. Also, Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge on North Main and Euclid Avenue where they keep hitting it, our Council sent a letter and asked Norfolk Southern Railway to consider labelling the North Main Avenue railway bridge with large height restriction lettering similar to the PA NE Regional Railroad Authority Bridge on Capouse Avenue and Olive Street. So Council did send that and asked for that to be done. Also, the other Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge on Theodore Street -- going up Theodore Street. Our Council followed up. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 looks like it's falling part again. We did request an engineer go to that Reilly Associates and also contact PennDOT and the PUC and see if they could ever get down there and fix that thing properly . I don't know why it wasn't fixed last time. But they are back on that again. As far as the pave cut inspector , the pave cut inspector works out of the DPW office right now. And there is also an assistant and a pave cut inspector part-time floater in that department . Two weeks ago we had question s about anonymous tip line for the Scranton Police Department . That is -- that does exist. It is online. If you go on any search engine and you type in Scranton PD anonymous tip, that does come up. So it does exist. The other things I found one other thing that the Scranton Police online reporting . I had some problem with illegally parked cars or abandoned cars and stuff. And there is a section in there where you could report those. But it's very difficult to get to. And I still haven't been able to get to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 it. So I had asked the administration if they would update it and include it an easier way to get to it. And the other things we have was two weeks ago we had the DPW report, the overtime report. And I don't know if it came misquoted or it was really off. They said that we used 40 percent of the budget I think is what it said. We only used 40 percent of the administrative budget which was $500. And they used $200.30. The rest of it, we do have an update on it, engineer ing, highway and refuse. And they are extremely low compared to that 40 percent . So that wasn't really accurate . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, when we mentioned that I was mentioning just the administrative budget. MR. SMURL: Yeah, yeah, 40 -- oh, okay. And then I got called they said (inaudible ) used that all, the whole thing. So it was kind of everybody took it like they had no more money left. MR. SCHUSTER : It's not a large budget. I did say that. It's not a large 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 budget. However , in one month of the year we used that -- MR. SMURL: Oh, administration , yeah. And I guess we'll go through this now. For code enforcement , Scranton enforces International Code Council of 2018 and Director Oleski runs the Code Enforcement Department . The inspectors work under Mr. Oleski's license . They work for -- basically for him. So if they go out to inspect a property or something , they report back to Mr. Oleski. But the city does not make them get certified as per this code that we follow. The certification comes from the union contract . The union contract says that any city inspect ors must get certified within three months after being hired. So I know all of our inspector s are certified at this time and unless they have any newly hired ones. And the rest we'll go over as we go through the rest. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. MR. SMURL: Second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so we heard from PFM tonight as well as the Finance Department for the city. Some of the fees that we heard will be about $25,000. And that's minus a fee schedule . Proposed savings that we will get from a lower interest rate were up to 1.1 million dollars . So when it comes to total savings , it's going to be that 1.1 million if that ends up being the interest rate we get minus that fee schedule and minus that $25,000. What they were asking for us to do tonight is to pass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 this so they could get our credit rating and to finalize that fee schedule . I'll vote to move this forward tonight . But I would like to see us get that actual fee schedule before we move ahead with finalizing the deal. They did say if this deal does not make sense and the fee that we get locked in or the interest rate that we get locked in doesn't make sense that we won't move ahead. But I would just like to know if that will come before Council at that point in time when we lock in that fee or if this vote tonight as this moves through Seventh Order is going to be our final vote on this legislation .

SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I think I spoke about it somewhat in the past. But what I've seen is individual s that have served on some of these boards for quite some time and do a decent job of it may want to stay on boards and they are replaced by others that maybe only have a short stint or they leave before their term is up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 We discussed this somewhat a few weeks ago when it came to the housing authority appointment . This one here is a replacement of Mr. Finnerty . I've seen him in action on the City Planning Commission . I think he does a good job. I think he's educated . I do not know if he would like to stay on the board or not. However , I'm just going to voice my opinion on this. I do think he should stay on the board. And this pattern of replacing people who have been on boards for quite some time to be replaced by temporary people that may leave before their term is up I'm not in favor of. So I'm going to be voting no on 5-E tonight . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 69, 2022, A RESOLUTION (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) GRANT FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF SIXTY-EIGHT MILLION , SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX THOUSAND AND FIFTY DOLLARS ($68,746,050.00)” TO REALLOCATE FUNDS FROM VARIOUS , BUDGETED ARPA ACCOUNTS TO ALLOW FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 would like to make a motion to table 5-G until we could have the Mayor and administration come in to have a caucus to describe where these $580,000 of ARPA money will be used when it comes to violence prevention . Nothing here is earmarked . So I don't know where this money will be going. I don't know what groups it will be going to, how they're proven to reduce crime or violence and I think it would constitute a caucus for that to be discussed in full. MR. KING: I think it would be a good idea to get some detail. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: We have a motion and a second. Mr. King, on the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I agree. As I was saying I think it's important that we get some detail of exactly -- I think we're all -- all in support of violence prevention obviously based on especial ly what has recently happened in our city. I think it's important we get some specific s before we move this forward . So if we could have the Mayor come in or provide us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 at least what the detail of exactly how these funds are going to expended . I think that's important . So that's why I'll be supporting tabling this until such time as could you get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , of course I'm all for violence prevention . But like my colleague said, you know, $600,000 is a lot of money. It's got to get in the right hands. They have to provide the right resources for this violence prevention . And there was just no detail in the legislation . I agree we need the Mayor and maybe the BA come in and explain because this just reminds me of, like, say my wife this Saturday coming to me and saying give me $600 because I'm going shopping . And I ask where are you going? Where are you going to spend it? I don't know yet. So this reminds me of that -- not that she does this every Saturday . But we need to know where that money is going and make sure -- I believe the police should get most of it. It's a lot of money, but we need know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 where it's being allocated for. MR. SMURL: Okay. So we have a motion to table Item 5-G and a second. All in favor of tabling Item 5-G signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
