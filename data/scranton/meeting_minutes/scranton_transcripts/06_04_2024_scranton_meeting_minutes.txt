Dispense with the minutes , please. MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY THE CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED MAY 28, 2024, FOR MAY 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have one. I believe the Electric City Flower Show is coming up -- is it this weekend ? I'm sure Norma is going to speak to it. But I just want to invite people to get out and support the Electric City Flower Show at Nay Aug Park. And I'm sure Norma Jeffries will mention it a little bit later. But that's all of I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So it's going on right now. It's the 2024 Summer Greek Food Festival . It's Tuesday , June 4th to Saturday the 8th serving from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. rain or shine on 505 North Washington 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Avenue. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Very good. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few that I'll just mention . There's a lot going on in the city this weekend which is really great to see. But Pride Month just started . There was the flag raising on Saturday , the first day of June. And so there are a lot of events supporting the LGBTQ community . One of my favorites is happening this Saturday . And that's held by the Scranton Fringe Festival. And that's the Big Gay Story Slam, which I've participated in for a number of years. So that will be Saturday evening at the Radison at 7 p.m. And it's just a really good, fun night, a lot of entertaining stories . And this Friday, I'm sure Joan will be talking about Swinging on Vine which will be on Friday. And that's the annual big fundraiser for the library for the Scranton Albright Memorial Library . And that takes place on Vine Street outside . I think it's rain or shrine. They have tents set up every year. It's usually good weather though so fingers crossed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 for this Friday. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I have one, the Scranton Area Foundation in partnership with the Luzerne Foundation , Monroe County Foundation , the Carbon County Foundation , Greater Pike County Foundation , Posture Interactive and other community sponsors will host the 5th annual NEPA Gives event from Thursday , June 6th to Friday June 7th. It's promoted as the largest philanthropy event in Northeastern Pennsylvania . NEPA Gives is a 24/hour online giving extravaganza . That's all about giving back to the community . NEPA Gives aims to raise awareness about critical work for nonprofit organizations to carry out throughout the region and help charitable organizations reach much-needed funds. There are over 250 nonprofit organizations from eight counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania will participate in NEPA Gives. Donations at participating nonprofit organizations are accepted at nepagives.org from 7 p.m. on Thursday , June 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 6th to 7 p.m., on Friday, June 7th. The closing celebration is June 7th from 5 to 9 p.m., in the 100 block of Wyoming Avenue downtown . It is free to the public to attend. And you'll have the opportunity to meet many of the participating nonprofit s in our area. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one more to add. Also on Saturday is the Arts on Fire Festival down at the Iron Furnaces . So that's going to be taking place from 11 to 5 this Saturday . So that's another great event to be able to go to that benefits the Anthracite Heritage Museum. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . As Dr. Rothchild said, we have Swinging on Vine this Friday night 5 to 8 p.m. Tickets are $20 in advance for many of the library locations , $25 at the door. But for your money you get cookout style food, raffles , beer, wine, margaritas . Especially if you live downtown , you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 don't have to worry about getting drunk. You could low crawl home like I will. There will be live entertainment for three hours from Picture Perfect and rain or shine, yes, we go on. Also the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are conducting their book sale from now through Saturday at the Marketplace at Steamtown . And just a reminder that if you are a teacher or you work for a nonprofit , come to the book sale Saturday between 10 and noon, and you could take as many books as you want for free. Okay, just a reminder , I'm doing the daily countdown of the collective bargaining agreement s. For the firefighters is now 426 days and for the police, 311 days; and we'll just be watching that. Sooner or later they are going to come out with the documents . Also, just remind you that, you know, I'll be starting to ask for updates on the city's audit. In the Home Rule Charter the audit is suppose d to be done by May 31st. Well, we've basically pushed that back to August 31st. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 But if you have any updates on how that audit is progressing , just let us know during Fifth Order. Now, I saw in the paper on May 30th a very interesting article about a new -- let's see -- city seeks project bids center training facility eyes at CTC owned land. And, yeah, that's very interesting . But I'm wondering how does this relate to the Serrenti Center which back in 2017 was -- the resolution was to convert the Serrenti Memorial Army Reserve Center into an emergency services center to be used by the Scranton Police Department and for storage of large expensive vehicles and equipment . And I remember all the conversations as this went through the process that was going to be used for training purposes and we were going to open it up to other communities and they might even pay us for using it as a training center. So my question is, are we still going to make the Serrenti Center into an emergency services center and a training facility in addition to a storage facility for large vehicles and equipment or are we going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 down another path with these project bids for a training facility and an emergency operation s center for the city, CTC owned land. Are we going to have two centers , two EOCs, two training facilities or is one going to be an EOC training facility and the other one a storage site? I know that the Serrenti Center is current ly locked up in a lawsuit with the Scartelli Construction company . So I know that that has kind of halted the progress of that building . But I think we need to know what we're doing with these two projects and what's going on with the Serrenti Center. I know Marie's been constantly asking for updates and we really haven't had one. I think it's time for a caucus on what's going on with that building . I was happy to see the overtime statistics looking very good, especially for DPW admin. And those look good. I went to the pocket park dedication last Friday. I saw you there, Mr. McAndrew , and, Mr. Schuster , were there. Where are the benches that should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 there for people to enjoy that park this summer? And that's it for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Norma Jeffries . MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, when it came to the Serrenti Center, what was our -- we asked for an update. Do you remember what the answer we got back that we'd be getting one in the future I think is what we were told. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did ask for a caucus. We don't have a date as of yet. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Yeah, if we could, you know, ask again, you know, where are we with grants for the renovation s that are going to be going on at Serrenti that were planned a while back and if we could get that caucus. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, also, I know it's in the early stage with the CTC project . But maybe they can differentiate between the two during that caucus and give us a little road map as to what's going to happen. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have speak on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 both. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Sorry, Norma. Go ahead. MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And the first thing I wanted to talk about tonight were the two things that I had mentioned recently . And I just think that prayers are being answered. The first one was on the article that appeared in the Sunday paper on the homelessness . And, you know, very seldom I read an article from beginning to end. But that was one that I read from beginning to end. It had a lot of great information on it. The two -- I don't remember the second writer. But the other one was Jim Lockwood . And anytime I see his name, I know he's going to do a great job on telling us and making it plain. It was very informative . And I was, like, thank you lord. Somebody is answering my questions , my concerns . So I'm not the only one in the City of Scranton who is concerned about our population , our homeless population . One of the things that they said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that is so true and I'm sure it's true is that they don't have a legitimate way to count and see just how many homeless people that we do have in the City of Scranton . But thinking about the size of our city, I know that we can't have thousands and thousands . And it just seems like hundred s is something that should be doable and handled in a very effective way. So I did write a letter to the newspaper about the article and how much I appreciated the information that was shared. I also know someone that I've been helping during the summer to collect clothing and underwear and things for the homeless in Kentucky . And what she does is, she's a young lady. And she fills her truck with things that she's collect ed and takes it down to Kentucky where a friend of hers has a mobile shower. And they give showers to the homeless people. And lo and behold today I was watching the news. And there is another person in Ohio who is doing the same thing. They take these old buses and they get them converted into showers that the homeless can take a shower and feel that they are better -- a part 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 of the community . So I'm hoping that someone out there has that ability and has that kind of knowledge and that I could always volunteer to help clean up or help wash the towels afterward s of these homeless that take these showers. So that's just something that's dear to my heart is the homeless population . And it was just very encouraging to hear. I did get Dr. Rothchild , I did send her a note. I don't want to ever come across like I'm complaining . I only want to know what's on my heart and the things that are a concern to me. The second thing that I talked about was what are we going to do for our kids in the summer. And then I saw a posting on Facebook that the Scranton Police Department is going to have a camp for kids. I was just thrilled with that. So I sent an e-mail to the person that's in charge of that if there's anything that I could do to assist them. And they did respond to me. And I will be reaching out to them in the coming days. They told me to come down to the police department down on Washington Avenue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 So that was two things that I talked about that I was thrilled to see some kind of action being taken. And then, of course, like Mr. King had said, our flower show is coming up. It's June. And it's going to be the last Saturday of June. What we're doing this week is, I and one of the other committee members will have a table down at First Friday. And we're just encouraging anyone to come up and ask us questions . It's going to be a lot -- it's grown so much since the first year that we had the Electric City Flower Show. And this year, one of the additional things that we're doing is that we have this huge big chair that someone -- each person is going to take their turn reading stories to the kids. And it's mult-bilingual . There will be all kinds of stories that are going to be read to the kids throughout the day and they have been contacted . So also, there is over 50 vendors that have been commissioned or they said that they would participate with us. So it's going to be quite an affair. So it's something that you could come in the morning . It starts at 10:00 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 goes to 4. And also, the museum is going to be open. And the Blackwatch Cafe is there to get something to eat. We're going to have food trucks as well. So it's a time that you could spend the whole day. The park is acres and acres and acres of beautiful land up there and you could just come and spend the day. And we're going to be praying for a beautiful day because it's rain or shine. And, you know, we'll be there. I won't be there this year. But, you know, I'm doing all I can before I'm going to be away. One final thing I have to say real quick is our big challenge is that getting the word out. We have the word on Facebook . We have the word in the paper out, put the little clip art in there. But we need you, the public, to help us spread the word. Everybody is not on Facebook . Everybody doesn't read the paper or get the paper. So we need you to help us to get the word out so that there is as many people that could flood that park on June 29th, which is a Saturday and thank very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Doris 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , guys, girls. Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . All right. So today is National Gun Violence Awareness Day. It's called -- we're calling it Wear Orange Day. Orange is a color. The friends of 15-year-old girl Hadiya Pendleton -- I hope I pronounced it right. They wore it in her honor after she had been shot and killed while on a playground in Chicago . Orange was chosen because that's the color that hunters wear to protect themselves and others from being shot in the woods. All right. So we're hosting a Wear Orange event on Saturday , June 8th at 1 p.m., at the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail's Olive Street trail entrance Scranton . We will hear from survivors and community partners and then we're going to do a trail cleanup to help beautify the area. It's a kid-friendly event. Feel free to bring kids, bring a friend, a family member along with you, just spread the word. Like Norma said, we're just looking for people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to also spread the word. The same day in the morning , the same place the Olive Street entrance to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail, Stride for Pride and 5-K starts at 9 a.m. That's being put on by Queer NEPA and Action Together . Now, the other thing I wanted to say real quickly because I'm not sure but I watched this on the TV from last week. And I know somebody was here talking about a trail, like, a running thing at Nay Aug or one of the parks to put in. We had workout stations at the same time. Years ago Nay Aug had that. I don't know if anybody remembers it. Jerry, do you remember that? I think where they had, like, around different sections as you walked around the park there was play -- where you could lay down and do calisthenics . And they had, like, instructions I believe on the -- if I'm remembering correctly . It was a long time ago. MR. SMURL: So, yeah, that's worn. MS. KOLOSKI : Yeah, it's no good now. I don't remember it ever being used. But I have seen workout places in other parks that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 were just nice little fenced in areas, like, across from the playgrounds and stuff where there were different things to work out on, which I think would be a tremendous idea also. I do not know about liability though, so I guess that would be something you'd have to take into consideration . Thank you, and good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Sherry Crowley . MS. CROWLEY : Hi. Good evening . I'm Sherry Crowley with Griffin Pond Animal Shelter , just coming back to touch base with you guys again. I was here I believe on April 28th. Since then we've taken in 86 more animals , four out of those 86 animals , 27 of those animals were seized by Scranton Animal Control and four were brought in by the police department and the rest were owner surrender s. So I don't know if you saw on the news last Thursday there was another hoarding case of two dogs and 26 cats. Because there is no room at Griffin Pond Animal Shelter , Street Cats, Friends With Paws, Northeastern Pet Fund and Rescue, there's no room. Your animal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 control officers are housing those animals and those 26 cats in their office right now. They need help. They need supplies . They need dog traps. They need feral cat traps. They need -- they need to access to a computer so that when they scan a dog or a cat for a microchip that they could access the microchip. They really need your help. You have an animal control officer that would like to open a shelter for the City of Scranton . She needs help securing the building , maybe help with getting some LSA Grants, something and that would help the city. That would help alleviate some of the animals at Griffin Pond Animal Shelter, also alleviate some of the cats at Street Cats to, you know, Friends With -- you know, the other rescues where everybody is just full all the time. We're in a nationwide crisis. So it starts here with all of you. And hopefully you could help your animal control officers . February 1st of 2024 this year, there was a new dangerous dog law that went into effect. A lot of magistrate s and judges don't know about this law. I'm part of the NEPA Animal Welfare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 collaborative . We're going to be putting packets together to mail those out so they understand what that means when somebody is brought in, you know, for owning a dangerous dog. And that could be a public safety for the City of Scranton as well. There's fines; but there is also, you know, I don't know the whole law but I'm, like, getting with Jenny Cali, the dog warden on that. I just wanted to make you guys were aware of that. Some of these, like, hoarding cases or people that say, oh, these people need jail, you know, this and that. Most of the time it's just a misdemeanor or a summary charge. There's not -- the laws are not for the animals at all. So when everybody is like abuse and neglect , somebody should go to jail, it doesn't work that way. So it would be a great help if maybe somewhere in the budget when you guys go to do your budget if you could get your Scranton Animal Control officers some of these supplies . They really, really need it. And then I think that's about it. Thanks for your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. CROWLEY : You're welcome . MR. SMURL: Victor Alberigi . MR. ALBERIGI : I'm not a frequent flier because actually I just moved back to Scranton just before Christmas after a 12 year hiatus in Summit, New Jersey while working in Manhattan . MR. SMURL: Excuse me. Can you take that out? We can't hear up here. I'm sorry. MR. ALBERIGI : I could speak up louder if you wish. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. ALBERIGI : So for the last 12 years I lived in Summit, New Jersey. I'm a former Clarks Green Borough Council person. And I know that there's a lot of responsibility in terms of running any level of government . I want to congratulate whoever was responsible for the power washing and cleanup of the -- and I'm not even sure what it's referred to as. But it's the overlook view at the East Mountain . My grandfather actually helped 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 construct that. And it's really a beautiful small facility . And I know you have of a lot of things to do with your money. But a question , there seems as though there's a surveillance camera there. And I was told by a police officer that there is also a surveillance camera at the Nay Aug Gorge where people are not suppose d to swim, okay. But as a person who -- by the way, at the age of 70 and still working likes to walk around. And I've enjoyed the improvements at Nay Aug Park. You know, those surveillance cameras , are they just recording or is there actually somebody in the police department who is actually watching them? MR. SMURL: They are recorded 24 hours a day and there's multiple ones at Nay Aug Park. There are cameras going down the paths. There's cameras by the bridge. And I know the police department does monitor them. But there many, many, many of them. So I don't know exactly how many they watch. But if they get a call, they could actually go back to that camera and go back and get the information from it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ALBERIGI : Well, the gorge is one thing. That's basically a safety issue to me. But it's a shame that that lookout point gets just absolutely abused like that. It's uncalled for. I mean, in my mind, you have to be kind of deranged to do that type of stuff. I don't know what else that you folks can do about that, but, you know, that could be a nicer place for the public than it currently is. It's obviously a beautiful view. There's a historical aspect to it. And unfortunately , it's -- I think poorly used by the broad general public. But if the city can do anything to try to bring back what used to be some of its glory, I just want to comment very briefly . I was kind of impressed with the idea of the van for bathing people. But a thought came through my mind, at Weston Field -- well, it used to be called Weston Field. There used to be a lot of showers there, I mean, in the day when I was young. I don't know if there still are. MR. SMURL: Yes, they are. MR. ALBERIGI : And people could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 hypothetically be brought there for showers . MR. SMURL: You can obtain a pass from the one center on Olive Street to go to use the showers . MR. KING: I believe they purchase -- they do purchase vouchers and hand them out to the homeless so that they could do that. MR. ALBERIGI : Yeah, because it would be expensive . It's not the idea of buying the truck. It's the idea of staffing it, the insurance of it. But, I mean, certainly I do think everyone is entitled to some degree of bathing. I mean, that to me is just a staple of life. And when people don't have that, I think it's just another reason why some people give up. So thank you to all of you who, you know, having not seen Scranton in 12 years, I've seen a number of improvements , some not so much the case. But I think if everybody works together that those issues can at least be improved. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Virgil Argenta . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta , Scranton . First of all, I would like to thank Scranton Parks and Recreation Department and Director Scott Gassenmeyer for their attention given to the 307 lookout cleaning and power washing away the graffiti . It looks awesome . So thank you, Scott, and Parks and Recreation Department . I would like to address an issue so it's on the record. Recently we have been having issues with problem properties in our neighborhood . One particular property that has been disruptive to the neighborhood with police calls and activity with numerous calls to Code Enforcement . Tired with the inept and unsatisfactory results from the city, doing a little research to uncover the owners of this property , the search was producing a vacant lot with no home on this address . Okay, I know that was incorrect . A few aerial views, some phone calls to the Assessor 's Office and a few phone calls to the tax office uncovered that this particular property , in fact, had a property on it and that the owner was not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 paying taxes since 1988 on this property . But they were paying taxes $119 a year for a vacant lot. So after this independent investigation , this property with a home on it will now be on the tax rolls starting with the 2024 year. So in regard to the tax issue, what about a trash bill? Is there any way that the city can go back and look and see if there's a trash bill for this property ? And if there is, can we retroactively go back and collect the trash fees? MR. KING: Virgil, can you share that address with us? If you don't want to do it publicly at least afterward -- MR. ARGENTA : Absolutely . I believe , Mr. Schuster , do you have -- I would prefer to give it to you in private so not to embarrass the owner. MR. KING: I appreciate that. Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : And this was uncovered by a concerned citizen . Imagine what could be done if the city worked with us citizens in our neighborhood s. We're the guys that know where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 the problems are and not afraid to do the legwork to help out. This property will be back on the tax rolls from a concerned citizen that wasn't on the tax rolls since 1988. So how many others had slipped through the cracks? Now, how are we making out with identifying the tax exempt nonprofits in the city? It's almost a year now that the city was to hire someone or they did hire someone to investigate this issue. Do we have any findings on how we're making out with that investigation or do you need some volunteer work from the citizens as well? MR. KING: I believe that they are actively still pursuing that. We had an update about a week or two ago. Frank, if we could get another update, I would appreciate that. MR. ARGENTA : And if it's something as simple as finding a property off the tax rolls and the city has employees , why do we have to hire out to have somebody go out and find out if we have tax exempt properties ? That can't be done inhouse to save the money?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 The police patrolman exam is coming to a close. Will you be able to provide the number of applicants that took the test and the percent age of applicants who passed and failed the test? It will be closing any day now. And if you could also provide the result preCovid with the number of applicants who took the old LEAB, Law Enforcement Aptitude Battery Police Test versus the current National Test Network police test if you have any kind of results or any kind of percentages on those tests. And does the City of Scranton Police Department , does anybody know, do we have a lateral program for officer s that are in another state that are willing to come here and be police officers ? And if so, can we get some of that information and we could share that information ? And it would be called a police patrol lateral program that would allow officers from another city to transfer here and they already have their certificates . Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 that signed in our sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, driving here I actually noticed a place where I used to stop at. Pennwood Nursing Home on Cedar Avenue, it's boarded up. It has the signs. I guess it was condemned a while ago or whatever on the front of it. And driving by coming here I looked at it. It's a three or four-story building . It was meant as a nursing home, probably every single room in there has two bathrooms in it. It's on Cedar Avenue close enough to Center City for on routes and all that. Somehow I think that would be a really nice place to consider for a homeless shelter . It has separate rooms. It has separate bathroom s. It had facilities for a nursing home. I don't know what the status is on it. But it's a derelict building that has quite a lot of what's necessary to work as a homeless shelter . It's just rotting away a short walk from Center City. It's just sad that it's in the condition that it's in considering it is a nice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 old building . As for the bathhouses, I remember in Baltimore they used to have bathhouses. They had them in different neighbor hoods and they used -- workers coming home from work at the docks and all that could use it. It's an odd concept of having a city bathhouse where they had towels and laundry facilities and they actually paid for the uses. But I think that a bathhouse would be a relatively productive thing to put in certain parts of the city. I don't know how that would be done. But it does give -- makes it a little more human for the homeless . And people that do construction work hadn't or wanted to carry all that dirt home and all that stuff could use it as well to go in there after a day of working outside when they are covered in dirt and soot and actually use a public bathhouse to take care of heavy dirt that they get from outside , tar from doing roads, the garbage men, and actually not have to bring that home. I think something like that would be an interesting thing to add to the city as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 thought . Last week we had a statement of how the Law Department can't seem to do much else but hire out of town contractors . We know the tax claims that we're looking to having run the collections out of the Philadelphia area -- tonight . We constantly need Philly and Reading as an example of how to do better in the city. Maybe you could get the Mayor of Reading to run the City of Scranton and we could dissolve the Mayor's position since everything everywhere else seems to be better than here. On 5-A, I see an issue. Bid out on April 12th of 2024, but in the backup the city was already communicating and it seems setting her up for this before the bid was ever release d. On page 38 of 70, it was clear that the city was having meeting s about this position in September of 2023, a full six to seven months before the bid was offered to the public. As it was noticed , she was in communication on an unadvertised , unbid position with Kathy Welcher and Daniel Penetar, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the third in September . We only see how the scale is shown in the bid document s and how it's weighed . But we never actually see the breakdown analysis of the actual bids and how they're scaled. Sure, it's great to have a chart. But if we're actually blind to the numbers and they are never included , why even bother putting in a chart of one to five scale if we never get to see that. She looks qualified . And I have no issue with her experience . I just have an issue with the selection that starts before the position is ever open for bids months prior. I think that any contracted bid out should be considered to be required to have three bids. If it doesn't have three bids, it should be require d to have a second bidding out there because with less than three respondents , we really don't have a good selection . I also have an issue with the contract span on the next contract for five years. In the estate law there's something I believe called the bone hand principle , which is running an estate from the grave. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 when I see a contract term of five years put out there that runs contracts into the next administration and runs extensions into the next administration , I understand at the end of it having a year beyond the administration -- the next Mayor's term. But I think five years goes a little bit it too far in that we should not be having the next Mayor bound too much by the previous Mayor's decisions . Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay, last week I spoke briefly about corrupt with a plus sign after it. If you're going to accuse somebody of being corrupt and you have some credible evidence of it, there's a nice place down in the next block across from the county courthouse and an FBI agent that would probably be more interested in hearing what you have to say provided that it's true and not just some notion. And, yeah, we have some feral cat problems here starting to brew. I don't know what happened with the Street Cats. We heard a few weeks ago that they were losing their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 neuter clinic. Well, maybe I could catch that person on the way out. I neutered 15 of them and released them. All right. Pave cuts, we really need -- I see them done. And I don't know if they asphalt the tar that they're putting as a sealer on the end is sinking down into the saw grove or they're just not using enough. And we should have an inspection when they do it and then a couple months later, especially after hot weather because that's when it would start to get a little hot and sink down. I had a cousin that had tar stuck to his -- the bottom of his feet on a hot day. And they had literal ly pick him up and he was bandage d for the summer. Once again, our utility bills are -- I have confirmed that with the gas company . They are charging as much or nearly as much for delivery as what they are for the gas that you use. So get ready this winter. You already -- just on what they're charging over the summer I will have it paid by probably the end of October a month's or maybe more of a gas 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 bill, cold weather gas bill. And, you know, I get a little silly about this mask, but I have a lot of problems . That's okay. But keep in mind before you say Covid is over that 1.5 million people are probably definitely dead over it. We had bodies stored in tractor -trailer refrigerator s and it just got totally ridiculous . And by the way, last winter there was a thousand people a day hospitalized with Covid. And I think it's Paxlovid is $1,500 for a script. So I don't know need that bill either. A lot of people seem to want to give themselves absolution because they're vaxed and that's okay, but don't expect it from everybody . All right. Well, we got elections coming up. And I have an article here which by the way I do know how to read. Tests find A1 tools create election lies. Now, on one of my favorite news stations , they did a speech by one of the anchors and it was a manufactured speech. And it was totally believable , totally believable . So they could literally take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 somebody and a candidate and the hell with the country , the hell with the voters and, you know, and make such a speech and have people all fired up when he, in fact, or she said nothing of the sort. Once again on raising the alarm on pregnancy care, well, throughout the south with strict laws on abortion , there are at least claiming 65,000 due to a rape. I'll drop this article off on the way. MR. SMURL: Is there anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , citizen of Scranton and a taxpayer , of course. I would like to know what is going to be done with the Serrenti building that is sitting down there empty? And is it -- I mean, I don't understand why the Mayor is out looking for a space for, what, intelligence or whatever it is but why Serrenti could not be used. And if she's not going to use it, what is going to be done with it? And when is the Engine 15 building going to go up for sale or has it? I may have missed it. MR. SMURL: It hasn't been put up for sale yet. But the Serrenti Center is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 currently being used by the police department and the fire department . And the building is current ly packed with equipment . So that's what it's being used for right now. MR. MCANDREW : Earlier this evening we requested an update with a caucus. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry, I -- MR. MCANDREW : We'll get them answers . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Yep. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hi. Rik Little, I had a question . Is Scranton , Pennsylvania designated a sanctuary city? MR. SMURL: No, it is not. MR. LITTLE: Not in any way. MR. SMURL: Not in any way. MR. LITTLE: From the Scranton point of view is what I'm asking. MR. SMURL: In the State of Pennsylvania we are not listed as a sanctuary city. MR. LITTLE: Because it certainly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 appears that way -- MR. SMURL: Well, we are not. MR. LITTLE: -- according to housing the way different actions , the United Neighborhood thing -- welcoming people to come and live and work here. Are you connected with the United Neighborhood -- the United Neighborhood Agency, it's down on Cedar Street? It's confusing because there's so many agencies that have the word united or neighbor and all of these things. I'm trying to sort it out. And, you know, we have a homeless problem and a housing problem . And from what I see of the use of the 600 Wyoming Street building , it's hard to get a handle on who exactly is doing what and under what name of agency. So I'm wondering if you -- you seem pretty positive this is not a sanctuary city. But there's all of these different agencies . And most of them are 501C3s and just to try to start to figure something out, I mean, we're talking about showers and all kinds of different things to deal with the homeless . And we have all of these charities , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 you know, that seem to be the official point of focus on the homeless . And a few weeks ago I gave you copies of my certificate of homelessness which I, you know, that I have to get. And so these -- so the people doing that -- I'm still not sure who's doing that. The three pieces of paper that I gave you, one was Keystone , one was CIC, and the other was Catholic Services . But there's a lot of housing that people are getting . But they are not people from Scranton . It's people that are being bussed here to Scranton . And I should have made copies of this United Neighborhood thing -- paper that I came across in the laundromat the other day. But it says, you know, we got jobs for you. We'll teach you English . We'll set you up. And it just seems like a real sanctuary city thing. So if the official City of Scranton is not a sanctuary city, there's a lot of confusion out there with all of these different agencies of -- that seem to be pushing that same idea. And I'm wondering if you know about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 it, especially that thing down on Olive Street, Olive and Wyoming and, like, the United Neighborhood things. I mean, I just went on a -- when I'm looking for housing it just became a wild -- people are in there on the computer and there's housing here, you know, and I'm not eligible for that housing but all of these people that aren't even living here, aren't even from here is eligible for them. So I'd appreciate some looking into this idea of sanctuary city because it seems like it is one. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Some comments , coming up a week from Friday, June 14th, will be the West Scranton High School graduation . I think they graduate at 5:00 and Scranton High graduates at 7:30 that evening . So I just want to wish all the graduates congratulations and good luck.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And a lot of them are going off to college , some are going off to the military , some are going off to trade schools and a lot of them are going to go into the workforce . So I wish them all the best. I know one thing, they received a topnotch education in our Scranton public schools. So I wish them all well. I actually have a graduate this year myself. Also, I'd like to thank Scott Gassenmeyer and Scranton Rec Authority as indicated by Mr. Argenta earlier . They did do a great job and Mr. Alberigi mentioned it also up on the lookout up on 307. I believe the WPA built that many, many years ago. And it is -- I think it's a focal point to the City of Scranton . And it provides an incredible view of our city. And I just hope that people will learn to respect that and keep it clean and not paint graffiti on it. So we appreciate the fine work by our Parks and Rec Department . And also, I would like to ask if we could get our city engineer Tom Reilly to -- there was an article in the paper about this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 West Nile virus up at the Robinson Park. Apparently there was some identified there. And if you could take a look at 3 Mountain Lake Road, that's the entrance to Jim Wintermantle 's home. And there's always a puddle there with sitting water constantly . I just want to see if our engineers could -- since we're doing a lot of work at Robinson Park and there is going to be some stormwater project s going on to see if we could try to get some type of piping to direct that water away from that puddling area which certainly attract those types of West Nile virus type of flies. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have a few and I'm going to report out some answers to question s that came up in public comment last week. I was glad the lookout was mentioned tonight . That is on the national registry of WPA project s. And I did see some of the photos of the graffiti . So I was glad to hear that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 had been cleaned. Some questions that arose in public comment last week, a resident had asked about the liability of the equipment for the skate park at Weston Field. So I did ask what the legal liability was for the city with the equipment , is there going to be supervision and what would the hours of operation be. And the administration got back saying they're going to work with their insurance provider to cover those needs. So that will be something that we'll be waiting on to find the answer for that. There was some questions raised about pave cuts in the city. One that I had, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just reach out again, in the 2023 and the 2024 budgets, there was not a line item that had receivables for pave cuts in it. So if we could just find out what they were, what were they estimated at for the 2023 and 2024 budget? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Another question was regarding the Meadow Brook Flood Project. Someone had inquired in public comment about a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 town hall meeting . So we had asked about that. And the administration let us know that the city is working to coordinate a public meeting on the project that's going to require the attendance or our partners from the state as it would be a state led project . So the administration is looking to get a date scheduled for a town hall meeting to meet with the residents that are affected by Meadow Brook. So that's nice to hear. There was some questions raised about the Civil Service Commission and some that I actually had myself. So we did get back how many members of the Civil Service Commission , the answer was three. How many members are currently on the commission ? The answer is three. How many were on the board at the time of the testing changeover, the answer was three. And I just had my question would be, have we always historically only had three members of the Civil Service Commission ? And we asked for an update on Mulfehan as well as Rubicon . And we got -- regarding the Mulfehan report, the vendor is in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the final stages of review of the draft. And they anticipate sending it to Chief Carroll within the next two weeks. So I'll be waiting to hear about that report. That's all, President Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, so one property , it's 206 Williams Street in North Scranton . I received a bunch of complaint s and pictures of a great deal of blight. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'll forward that to you if you could please have that sent over to Code Enforcement . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Also, so Mrs. Hodowanitz made a great point. So when we first appoint ed or approved the new auditing firm this year, you know, they came and spoke in caucus which was great. And they pretty promised they'd be on time or shouldn 't have any problems . But I think we need an update because it got moved to August 1st. We go on recess in August. So maybe have them come in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 and, you know, let us know if there is any roadblocks or speed bumps that they are occurring like with the other firms in past years before we go, you know, move for summer break. So if you could schedule a caucus, have them come in and give us an update, I would appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I apologize . I was at a finance meeting Wednesday . And we did speak about the audit. And we were told that the audit is actually on track to be completed in time. I should have reported that to you. But I just didn't get it in. But it's still -- if they want to come in and have a caucus that's fine also. But I did attend that meeting , sorry. I should have told you. A few other things, 702 Crown Avenue for trash and garbage and TVs on site. Code Enforcement did issue citations for that one. The following were Les Spindler 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 were sent in to DPW and the following , blocked drains at Bulwer and North Rebecca . They were notified last Wednesday , the 1400 block of Dorothy Street, they were notified of a sunk in pothole patch in addition to blocked drains near the baseball complex . And our Parks and Recreation were notified at Tripp Park. The field -- at Parks and Rec acknowledge d the overgrown area where the batting cage is and they said they will be trimmed . MR. SCHUSTER : I did forward an e-mail along to Mr. Voldenberg about graffiti at the Tripp Park playground. So while we're doing such a good job with the lookout, possibly to send over a power washer. I don't know if we got any answers back on the graffiti at the park. But the slides and some of the equipment there has a lot of graffiti on it. MR. SMURL: Okay. We'll ask Parks and Rec if they have the power washer out if they would attend to that. And I think the viaduct going to (inaudible ) has some graffiti on the wall. MR. SCHUSTER : The slide there at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Tripp Park is also broken. I don't know if that could be repaired. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SMURL: Thank you. A few other things, Mr. Walsh last week had asked if we had any plans that related to the flooded area down near his business on Pittston Avenue. The response was Borton-Lawson should have the preliminary results from their study later this June. And also, Council asked at May 21st meeting if there were any city properties and rental properties , they weren't captured for registration . So the registration team does not use OpenGov . That's what it used to be in. The new department -- the department now uses Telemy{phonetic }. It's a different program . It is very effective . It's very easy to use. I believe you had access to that today. You went to the meeting . MR. SCHUSTER : I could add one more thing with that if you'd like. The property that was -- came up in public comment tonight , I sent and e-mail right after public comment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 about the address . So I did send it over. And in that Telemy system, it isn't showing any refuse fees so if we could look into that address . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Okay. So that is actually -- it's working out fine. You could actually go online and look up properties and find the owners and see if there's current citation s or if there is other things that aren't being taken care. A few others things, does Council have any statistics regarding number of citations issued, the number of citations paid, the number of apartments identified and PPT qualifications . So the answer is the department has 12 properties currently in citation for prohibited occupancy ; 43 suspected rental letters were sent out this week, six were posted for properties , 51 are pending inspection s. And we have issued 1,354 properties and 3,312 units. Of this, 494 are through the permitting and code enforcement are complet ed. Additionally , we have 388 pending payment for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 license . The department also found 120 units that are not being charged for refuse. Another question was are any or may all citations be dated and time-stamped or photoed . The answer to that, citation s are dated at the magistrate 's office. Photos are provided with a right to know even -- of the property owner. And notice of the violation states the nature of the violation along with the owner's obligations and rights. If any property owners do not file a right to know request , copies of the photos are routinely provided at the time of the hearing at the magistrate 's office. I believe they were all of your questions , Mr. Argenta , from last week. I think they were yours. I did ask about research on an another item. This answer was sent to me by James Bosha. We asked about doing curfews in the City of Scranton . So this was in the New York Times. And I'll give it our Council people in case we want to pursue it any further . This was about Newark, New Jersey that prohibits people from age of 18 and under to be under curfew from 1 p.m. until 5:30 a.m. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 They had this on the books since I believe it was 1992 and they just have rebrought it back up because it seems they had a 13 percent increase in violent crimes, pretty much what we're seeing around here, an increase in violent crimes. So they have brought this back. The rules prohibit unsupervised youths from venturing more than 100 yards from their home between 11 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. There's a lot more detail into this. They do go on about how many people they had gotten picked up after the curfew. And this was early on when they first enacted it. Their first weekend , the curfew only netted three people. During second weekend there was just one person. And it was only an 11 year-old-girl with autism who had walked away from a nearby home. But when they do pick up these individuals after the curfew, they do have -- Newark has what's called a Reengagement Center where they could take youths for counseling among other things. We simply don't have that. So, you know, if our police picks someone up for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 curfew or something , we basically become a babysitter if there are no parents at home. So it's just another problem we may have if we enact it. Also, when we looked at the crimes statistics -- this is in Newark, New Jersey. This isn't here. I'm not saying that it works here or it wouldn't work here. But Newark, New Jersey, their population is well over 300,000. And they have the curfew enacted right now. But when they did their studies , they seem to find that violent crimes are committed by the youth, the peak is about 3 p.m. every day. That seems to be about the peak of the violent crimes that happen. And then it declines hour by hour until 11, 12, 1:00. So is the curfew going to stop that crime? I don't know. I don't believe so. I don't believe by enacting a curfew here would stop crime -- would stop crime. So our thing is, we're not going to give up on this. All the Council people, of course, have the right to pursue this further . So and this is only one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 research items I have done. So but it's difficult to enforce it. And if statistics show that violent crimes are peaked at 3 in the afternoon , I don't see how a curfew at 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. are going to work. Please mister -- you have to stop or I'll have you removed . You can't speak. Thank you. Thank you. Please remove him. So that's basically one study that I had gone through . I looked at a few others. Every one seems to be about the same. So naturally everyone can do their own research and decide if a curfew is something that the City of Scranton should pursue. I'm not saying we shouldn 't pursue it. I just want to make sure if we're going to spend the time and the money on something and we do have young adults that are picked up at 2, 3:00 in the morning , what do we do with them? Are we going to arrest them, put them in jail for being out after curfew? I don't agree with stuff like that. But, you know, so that's why it has to be looked at further . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 I'm sorry, the last item I have is over the weekend or beginning of the week, it seems that all of the news stations and the paper and everyone seem to blame the City of Scranton for putting people out in the middle of the street from Mountain View Care and Rehabilitation Center. That's not really what happened . This is a report from Pennsylvania Department of Health. And this is what they have wrote about the facility . It does not currently have adequate power to operate the facility , nor are the firearm alarms at the facility functional . Additional ly, the kitchen hood is not functional despite using a gas stove. Their sprinkler system at the facility remains out of compliance with regulatory requirements . So considering these circumstances , the department is implement ing an emergency relocation of the facility residents commencing May 31st of 2024. So that was basically evacuated by the State Department of Health. And, of course, the city went up afterward s. And that's why you see the sticker on the front 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 door that says it's condemned . But the city didn't throw anybody out into the street. This was an emergency thing and people were in an unsafe condition . That is all I have. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. Thank you. I appreciate it. I apologize for stepping out. But I did just have one thing that I wanted to bring up that the President had brought to my attention as well as a letter to the editor that was in the Times over the weekend . So apparently on the UGI bills now there is a weather normalization rate being added as a line item. And it was something that I had not realize d. But if you take a look at your bills, you might see that. I'm not sure what that's about or how it came about, if it was approved by the PUC. I would like to request that Mr. Voldenberg please contact UGI to see to get more of a description about that rate and where it's originating from because I am concerned that people's bills will go up because of it. So if you could do that, I would appreciate it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, can we -- I know the county is doing reassessments . Is there any way we could find out, you know, it was mentioned earlier that there was a structure that had not been paying taxes since 1988. Is it possible through the county to reach out and see if there has been other structures similar to this that has been the case? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. King, I could tell you that there has, in fact, been others. I don't know the breakdown versus what was contained in the city versus what is out in the county. But I know there have been several thousand properties found that were not on the payroll s. MR. KING: In the city? ATTY. GILBRIDE : I don't know the breakdown . MR. KING: Oh, okay. Frank, if we could reach out and see and get a number and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 then maybe I don't know -- see if there is any way to recoup. I mean, who gets to go -- I know I have been paying my taxes for as long as I've been a resident here. Why do some of these people get a free pass? MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, to go one step further , maybe reaching out to the assessor 's office to see how far it is that we could go back if we could go back to the construction of the property ? So in this case, if that structure was up in 1988 and hasn't paid its taxes, can we go back to 1988 to get those back taxes? MR. VOLDENBERG : We will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. That's it. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this might be a very simple thing to answer. But, Frank, can we find out if the city usually engages with consulting services for our HUD plan? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RESOLUTION 352 OF 2023 ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND SUBMIT A GRANT APPLICATION ON BEHALF OF CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ACTING THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH FINANCING AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT (MONROE) GRANT, PURSUANT TO THE PA RACEHORSE DEVELOPMENT AND GAMING ACT FOR UP TO $522,000.00 TO BE USED TOWARDS THE ST. JAMES MANOR RENOVATION PROJECT ”. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. SCHUSTER : Hang on. So on the question , we discussed in caucus that it seems to be the start of a habit or a pattern that's occurring out of the Law Department when it comes to legislation being sent on time for deadlines . So with this one here we've been asked to suspend our rules and move this to Seventh Order because the deadline is tomorrow . We did discuss having our Solicitor sending an official letter to the city administration to make them aware that we're no longer going to pass these through or suspend our rules or change our rules to make up for their shortcomings . I don't know if anybody else has anything on the question . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I was also disappoint ed that we're being asked to move this through tonight and that this is a pretty frequent occurrence for us where as I could see if it was something rare or if there were extenuating circumstance s. But that doesn't seem to be the case. And we continuously receive legislation late that we need to push through . It's really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 not fair to us because I know we all like to be thorough in our review of the legislation that comes through to Council and be able to determine our vote on it. I don't want to hold this up because this is -- we're acting as a gateway for them to receive this grant. So I don't want to jeopardize the grant for them but by voting no on this. But I did want to express my disappointment and frustration . MR. MCANDREW : I'll reserve my comment s for the actual motion that would be next. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. KING: On the question , I agree with my colleagues here on Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. And I also agree. We received this at 3:00 this afternoon and really had no time to read any of the backup from it. So it's kind of unfair to send items down like this. And naturally something like this we don't want to hurt the development of St. James Renovation Project . But it has to be brought to us in a more timely fashion . All those in favor of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 5-D to Seventh Order for a final vote. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , along with my colleagues we received -- so guess what, the deadline for this is tomorrow . All right. Who is going to be held accountable for this. Who's going to take blame for this, probably nobody and that's usually the case. So we get these emergency legislation at 3:00. We're out here a couple hours later without be able to look at the backup or the rationale as to why, you know, and then to have it moved in the same night because the deadline is tomorrow is ridiculous . It's incompetence .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 You know, we're instruct ed to follow policy and procedure and we do a great job at that. This happens quite a bit, more than you can imagine , late legislation . We have deadlines that we, you know, we try to maintain and every once in a while -- more than once a while they come down and say we have an emergency . So somebody sat on this legislation . Administration didn't receive this or work on this today and say, oops at 3:00 let's send it down to Council to suspend the rules. Somebody was responsible for this and didn't do their job. And, of course, as Council here, you know, and this is no fault of Catholic Social Services , right. So how could we hold up this legislation that would affect the funding or the grants for them. It wouldn't be fair. But it's not fair to us when administration isn't doing their job in a timely manner and expect us to do the same. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.

KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 49, 2024 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY . MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I would like to make a motion to table Item 7-B. There were many question s that were asked last week. We did get the answers to some of those, but one being in particular administration costs. I know that with ARPA funds there is an administration cost that the city does take. It's unclear here whether the city has already taken an administrative cost as they allocated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 this money for the SRA or if the SRA will also take the portion or will take the portion of that administrative cost. So I would like clarity on that before we move forward . I also -- I'd love to see a little bit more clarity on the project as we did have money put aside with the ARPA funds for the North Scranton Providence Streets cape Project . And I would like to know, you know, what is some of the scope of the work that the SRA is thinking before we move forward with this. So I would like to make a motion to table until we get that as the deadline for this is not until September . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question , we're still on the question , weren't we? MR. MCANDREW : No, it wasn't seconded . MR. KING: Oh, it wasn't second. Now on the question . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MR. KING: So on the question , I think it was fairly clear that it cannot be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 more than 10 percent of that grant utilized for administrative fees. So whether it's the city or Redevelopment Authority , I don't believe from the wording of it it can exceed 10 percent . So I'm probably not going to vote to table it. MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I'm in favor to tabling because I want some more clarity . We got a little but not enough in my opinion . Initially money was allocated for North Scranton Streetscape, that area. Then it was taken away. All right. So there was a plan. But now we're being told, okay, now they are bringing back through the Redevelopment Authority , but they are not really telling us what -- is it the original plan? Are they going to fulfill what they committed to initially because they're moving money back because they took the money away from them? So all we heard is, well, there's going to be some project s and they'll come to us but no one knows what they are yet in detail. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 I don't know. I think being fair to the residents who expected , you know, a nice streetscape or their share of the ARPA money because other parts of the city got it, you know, and rightfully so. But they had it. It was taken away. So supposedly it's going to -- well, it is coming back. But I would like a little more detail as to how it's going to be utilize d so that -- and I think the residents would too. So I'm support tabling this until we get further clarification and information . MR. SMURL: Okay. So then we will take a vote on tabling Item 7-B. Okay. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR.
