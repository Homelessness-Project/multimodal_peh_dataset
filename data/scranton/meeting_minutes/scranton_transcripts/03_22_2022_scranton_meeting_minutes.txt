MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So 3-J, the letter we received on March 8th from the Law Department that states that they want to provide City Council with an update regarding the City's insurance brokerage services . Present ly the City's contract of insurance brokerage service s is set to expire March 31st. And with it, the City's current policies for insurance will also expire. So I'm working close to 40 years in the industry . There's two things that you don't mess with or jeopardize . That is someone 's pay or benefits . So with that said, I want to know why this hasn't been sent down sooner or the process started sooner. I want to know who's responsible and who dropped the ball. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please inquire on behalf of Council to the administration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And then also 3-L, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 the City Council request log that I brought forward as a motion a couple weeks ago, I want to thank Mr. Voldenberg for compiling that list which I said is our list. Now it's visible for all of you to see. Most of the concerns that are going to be on this list are brought to us through public comment s. So I'm glad to see it. It will be put in Third Order every once in a while, not weekly. And so you'll be able to see, you know, your concerns and the progress of them and where we're at with them. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Are there any other comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, just one other thing, Mr. Voldenberg , while we're sending correspondence about Item 3-J, could we just see -- or could we just add to that correspondence to see what has been done in past years, what was the amount of time that this was usually put out for renewal ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. DONAHUE : Are there any other comments on the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one announcement . So next week for -- next week for our caucus Anser will be coming in and that's the firm that we contracted with for the ARPA funding planning . And they've been really helpful last week. All the Council members are being invited to meet with them and the Mayor so they would explain their process and what they've done to help us in our planning process for that funding . And I'm happy that they will be coming in next week so that the public can hear from them. If you have any specific questions for them just like a few weeks ago what I mentioned for the strategic economic planning if you had question s ahead of time prior to the caucus that you would like -- things you would like to hear from them, then you're welcome to send that into us. You could send them to Mr. Voldenberg and we'll make sure to get them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to them prior to meeting . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. KING: I have two. First, I'd like to thank DPW not only for the job they did with the storm that we had a week ago Saturday , I thought they did a really good job getting the City cleaned up under difficult circumstances . And then in preparation for the parade, I thought they did a great job setting up and getting the City ready for the crowds. And I was pretty -- I was very impressed that I think it was probably by 2:30, 3:00 they already had street cleaners downtown . They were cleaning up. So just kudos to DPW. I thought they did a really good job along with the Scranton Police who did a nice job protecting the area of the parade to make sure that the streets were blocked . And, you know, we've all seen situations where there is huge festival s in downtowns and, you know, we've seen some things where people sometimes will try to crash the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 party with a car or a truck or something . And I think our police did a tremendous job to ensure the safety of all of the citizens who were participating in the parade and who were there to watch the parade. Also, I was speaking to one of my neighbors today. And he mentioned -- I know that Earth Day is Friday, April 22nd. But on Saturday , April 23rd, they are trying to get groups together to help out with a huge cleanup at Nay Aug Park. I know he's working trying to get some students from some of the local schools . And so I just wanted to announce that they're going to be looking for some volunteers . As I find out more information about that I'll get that out there. And I know there will be a lot of neighborhood cleanups as well. So that's it. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Any other Council members have any other announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this Saturday , March 26th from 11:30 to 1, the Hickory Street United Presbyterian Church at 435 Hickory Street in Scranton will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 having a free Irish stew dinner, include Irish stew, Irish soda bread and muffins and butterscotch apple cake. All are welcome . And in addition to that, they're going to have bags of groceries from the food pantry that will also be distribut ed. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any other announcements at this time? I just have one. In preparation for Jog for Jude, which will be Saturday , April 23rd, this Friday which is the organization 's Pink and Blue Day where everyone 's encouraged to wear either pink or blue, there will be a happy hour at Backyard Ale House from 6 to 8. A $10 donation is encouraged and guests are also encouraged to bring baby clothing and/or toiletries for the St. Joseph's Baby and Children 's Pantry, which has been lovingly dedicated in Jude's name. That's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was very pleased to see that the summary of fiscal affairs was published last week very timely. And thank you for doing that. There were a couple years where that was totally missed. So I was happy to see that happen. Any progress on the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still in negotiations . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. We're on day 81, which means 22 percent of the year is already gone. I hope we won't have any unpleasant surprises . Also, today is March 22nd which is the 35th day for Acting Treasurer Mitesh Patel. So tomorrow , who is the City Treasurer ? MR. DONAHUE : We received legislation today appointing -- that will be on our agenda for next week appoint ing Mr. Patel. MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. That's what I thought would happen. Good. I too was very happy to see the City Council log 3-L and its noting about the status of the database on real estate taxes and the refuse fees. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 That's an important database and very useful to the general public and also to you as legislators if somebody 's going to come up to be appoint ed to a board or a commission . First thing you do is you check are they current on their taxes and fees. But I think that's something that should be maintained in perpetuity . But then I'm one of those strange people. I like to look at numbers . Speaking of numbers , did you all get to check out the February Controller 's report? You know, it's very educational . Most people, their eyes just glaze over, oh, you know, oh, numbers , I don't need to look at that. But have you any idea what the Controller reported for the month of February that we spent on salt? Doesn't mean that we actually salted in February . But this is when the bills came due. Do you want to guess what we spent on salt in that one month or recorded for it? MR. SCHUSTER : Was it $177,000. MS. HODOWANITZ : 175,158.99. We've actually budgeted for this year a half million 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 dollars for salt. And you're right. DPW does do a very good job reacting to these ice storms. But, you know, that surprised me. I couldn't really appreciate that, you know, it just boggled my mind. But then there was another figure which boggled my mind for the month of February what was recorded in interest earned. Do you have any idea? Would you believe 28 cents? Look on the summary of revenues on the very few first pages, 28 cents. It makes me feel so much better when I open my bank statement from my checking account , you know, I'm not the only one making pennies , 28 cents. And let's see. Also, I look at the funds distributed by the Single Tax Office on March 11th. And they're still recording Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax. When will we eventually transition to reporting Payroll Preparation Tax? Will that be like the second half of the year? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so that will actually come from Berkheimer and not from the Single Tax Office. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 interesting to track that for the first year. I saw the minutes of the Municipal Recreation Authority . And they want to bring back horseback riding. I will never get on a horse. But I hope that they bring it back for those who would like to do such a crazy thing. So -- but I don't recall ever having horseback riding there when I was a child. So this may be a new thing. And your insurance brokerage services memo, that struck a nerve with me. Are we talking about the Knowles Insurance Company for property and vehicles and everything ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, they didn't make the emergency legislation for today next week. They'll have two days or you're going to shut down all of those vehicle s and buildings . Basically , are we going to have to accept whatever is offered to us as a contract because we have no time to negotiate ? MR. DONAHUE : That's my understanding . MS. HODOWANITZ : I am not happy with that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. DONAHUE : I am not either. MS. HODOWANITZ : Not happy at all. I agree with you that we need to find out who dropped the ball, what happened . And remember , we've had trouble with the list of properties and insurance . Remember how we ended up insuring the Albright Memorial Library for seven or eight years and the City didn't even own it? You got to watch those details or they'll take us to the cleaners . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Doug Hine. MR. HINE: Good evening Council members . Thank you for your time. My name is Doug Hine. I reside at 1204 Moltke Avenue on East Mountain . My family and I've lived there for the last 24 years. My wife's family being there for the last 50 years. Moltke Avenue is a narrow two-way street, wide enough in some spots for only one vehicle , especially the 11 and 1200 blocks. It's a quiet residential neighborhood . And it's a dead-end street. Several houses have families with small children and pets. I'm here to discuss with you tonight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 a vacant lot addressed 1214-1216 Moltke Avenue owned by Mr. Jeff White. My issue is the dumping of fill on Mr. White's property . Soil when used, asphalt are considered clean fill by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection . Unused asphalt , however , does not meet this definition . On March 16th approximately 10 large dump trucks -- I'm not sure if they were double or triaxial trucks. My daughter was home at the time -- from a local company dumped a mixture of soil, used asphalt and unused asphalt on Mr. White's property . I brought picture s if would you like to see it -- what was dumped. The company was contacted that -- late that afternoon and said the dumping would stop which they did the next day. The unused asphalt could be seen at the top of piles in these picture s I took. There's no way to be certain that they didn't mix it in when they were grading the lot after they dumped. When I got home that night about 5:00, all you could smell with the pungent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 smell of the petroleum in the asphalt and my property is four away from this empty lot. The road was left covered with dirt from the trucks going in and out all day. I called Mr. White whom I had considered a friend to complain about the situation . He came and looked at it and said there was nothing wrong because it was all clean fill. They graded it, no problem . And he's unwilling to do anything about it. I contact ed DEP this morning , by the way, and they said they would look into it. I told them there is a waterway -- I don't know if it's a creek or what it is that runs along the side of that property . They were going to look into that and possibly call the inspector's office to have them look at it. My neighbors have complained to Mr. White over the years -- over the last few years about this. As the company that dumped last week along with other people have been allowed to dump clean fill along with construction debris including tiles still on the back of a toilet, garbage , concrete with rebar in it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Some of it's been removed . Some of it just gets buried when other things get there and pushed over. My family contact ed the City inspectors last May. They came out to inspect the property . But we were never told what came of that. Mr. White lives in another part of the City. He doesn't have to deal with the trucks coming in and out. He doesn't have to deal with the smell, the dirt. It's a quiet residential neighborhood . It's not a construction zone. And the neighbors and my family, we're pretty much fed up with it. What I'm asking I guess is for a City inspector to be sent out to the property to evaluate the situation , see what's been dumped and produce a report for remediation . We deserve an end to this. MR. DONAHUE : You can leave them Miss Carrera there. And if you want to leave your contact information too, you know, as soon as we hear back from the City inspectors we'll reach out and let you know what we heard. MR. HINE: Okay. Like I said, they're going to call the City. They said if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 there's an issue with the waterway, that raises it to another level and they will investigate themselves . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. And we'll see what, you know, the City's done to date too on your complaints . MR. HINE: Okay. MR. DONAHUE : All right? MR. HINE: All right. Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you very much. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: My Council , if I were President I would give the Ukrainians a blank check to buy back all our -- everything that we left there, guns, tanks and everything . Then I'd get the Taliban to bring them over to the capital in -- they have beaten the Russians once and they could go out their back door right through Russia like Sherman to the sea. That's just a wish I guess. These people are barbaric . There's no stopping them. I don't know why is -- they're being quiet right now unless they're just waiting for our next move. In speaking of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 barbaric ventures , this despicable reassessment encouraged by our two commissioners who I'd like to add, each of them have four jobs, four full-time positions . This shouldn 't been allowed to start with. But one of them is sponging off the taxpayers that they hate. They have no respect for the taxpayers in this City and county. They're at war with us. And if they'd done their job the last couple years, nobody since Janet Evans has approached -- has impressed these phoney I guess is a good word -- these phoney nonprofits hiding behind the Pure Charity Act. I don't know what's suppose d to be done about it now. They just -- every time you look in the paper there is somebody else buying something for large sums of money and taking it off the tax rolls. How many houses have to pay for these losses? The only answer anybody seems to have is raise taxes, raise taxes. Nothing is being done anywhere from the state all the way down through the county to the City. And one other thing, I mentioned a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 few months ago, the gentleman that was killed in front of my house on North Main Avenue by a speeding car, North Main Avenue is like a race track. 24/7 there's cars doing 60, 80 miles an hour. At Wells and North Main where the school stops twice a day for children , cars clip the sidewalk where 2 feet of the sidewalk these children wait for the buses going from speeding cars and tractor -trailers . There should be a stop light or maybe a four-way stop. Something needs to be done or you're all waiting for another tragedy like what happened in front of my house. And one other thing before the hook comes out for me. Almost every week there's a false alarm at the DePaul building . Last night there was -- I think it was this morning . There was three fire trucks there and the fire car. This goes on continuously . One of the ladies tells me everybody knows who's doing it and the next week it still happens and it goes on and on. They're going to be there one day for nothing , you know, when something ought to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 be done. And you, my friend, you should print what people are here talking about. They're not impressed when they read the paper about these accounts and taking it from this account . They want to know what these people that take their time to come in here are saying because I hear this. Every once in a while somebody says what did you all talk about or what did so and so say? It'd just take you a couple seconds to do that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . What I just handed you now is a little spreadsheet , a flow chart of procedures . This is not in any way as last week meant to be an attack on the process . It's not meant to say that there is irreparable damage. What it's meant to say is by this flow chart, we have Rule 10 and Rule 13 separate in the ordinances , in the rules for a very specify reason. And there is a flow chart of how stuff is suppose d to go through City Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 The bills itself that came forth are completely irrelevant . They aren't in -- aren't part of my argument from last week. It was a matter of pointing out to the attention that in this flow chart we skipped across three separate patterns of actual proper procedure per the laws. And it's not thinking that needs to be remedied . It's just something that I want to bring forward because there is a specific flow chart and pattern for how things are suppose d to work. And a number of times in this City not particularly with this branch of the government but others, those flow charts, pattern s and procedures are ignored and modified by fiat. This body has complained about things coming to it with no notice, with short notice that do not follow procedures . And I'm just bringing to attention that there are procedures that are out there that I would hope this body looks at and addresses a little bit closer, not that it intended to, but the path might have been a little bit in error. Now getting to the second part off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 of this because that was just putting forward that is not directed at a specific ordinance or regulation . It's just procedure . How can the City miss an insurance deadline ? How can the City miss any contract end? We had Microsoft Word where you could put ticklers on. Every contract should be in a database. Every contract should be flagged that it give warning beforehand, e-mails, notifications . This is grade school or high school pop-ups saying your homework is due for this assignment three weeks from now. This is not rocket science . This does not take an MBA. This does not take a masters . This takes someone actually using a schedule r. All of these contracts , every contract in the City has a start date and an end date. And an adoption of a start date on it, it should be put in immediately where that end date is not relying upon extension s or anything else and at that end date, notification a week, three weeks, three months beforehand. Obviously not a week because that does not allow you to go through process .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 It should have at least five weeks, one to put it in, one to negotiate , and three before this body is absolute minimum . But that isn't done. And again, we are here at an emergency order that suddenly comes into place. How many emergency orders has this body seen this year for processes that should have been handled beforehand? That information should have been shared with this body that this body should have been aware beforehand that this due date was coming up. There is no inner office communication between one side and the other if these are being missed. And that is a serious detriment to this body, to the government and the people it represents . And I hope we do not continue to have people in this body who are being paid for who cannot schedule an end of contract because that is just unfathomable . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : I have a little article here. I'd like to give it to you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 first. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. DOBRZYN : It just mentions about vehicles and that is on an editorial from the Times. And there was another article on it. I picked that one. You're almost twice as likely to be run over by a pickup truck or SUV than by a car. And there's reasons . They don't see in front of them. They see above people. Now, on the redistricting . We were kind of saved by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania . But it's not a dead issue. And I have been following what's going on in other states and many people in our state have similar ideas. Everything from calling it a crime to vote and not notifying people that are not eligible to vote and then arresting them later and all types of ugly stuff. So I hope we stay on that and make sure that it's -- make sure that we have the right to vote some day. And in seven different states, Pennsylvania included , there was a fraudulent elector sheet sent to Washington DC. And Mr. Barletta and Mr. Mastriano 's name is on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 them saying that the Republican candidate won. Now they put a little disclaimer on Pennsylvania 's. But there's five states that actually said that Donald Trump won the election in 2020. So this is really serious . We don't need this. And a few weeks ago we applied for a grant with Spruce Street. Please, no bicycles downtown . If you want to fix things up, great. But we don't need it turned in a memorial park. And it's liable to be a memorial park with tombstones on it. It's tough enough. When you turn a corner down at Wyoming Avenue in front of the mall either left or right, if the sun is in a certain position during the day and there's been three or four people killed there. You cannot -- it just blocks your whole windshield out. So I really don't think bicycle s are a great idea in a busy downtown . And that's all there is to it. We have trails. We have everything else. We're spending money all the time. We have parks. Let them go riding there. I used to go ride out in the woods. I just got something with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 better tires. I didn't like dealing with the cars even in the neighborhood . And I would like to point out that I'm sure I think Marie could vouch for this. Sometimes during the Doherty administration it was months something was being done and then we had an ordinance adopted , months. Sometimes six or eight months somebody was hired and finally they said, oh, let's get this passed. So, you know, let's get Council 's approval . And it was usually written up all on the same night. And finally on Ukraine , I got a brainstorm the other day. I fully support us shipping them everything they need and more. But, you know, with all the trouble that our police department has catching people on ATVs, wouldn't it be great if we sent them a thousand quiet ATVs so they could raid the Russian camps and get out of there in a hurry. And I actually literally called Congress . So if you're out there in TV land, think about it. Give them a call. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening Council , Marie Schumacher . I guess first I'm going start off because I think 7-A is -- I have some real questions on it. But I'm sure you guys have the answers . This is an objective of a contract to raise the profile of Scranton as a desirable location to do business , work, live and to inspire business investment and attract /slash retain talent. Now, where are we on that now? Can anyone on there tell me what our position is now? Or to foster a brand that welcomes collaboration , community , and celebrates the new future of work. What do we do in that area now? Nothing ? Encourage migration from high priced costal cities. Can you tell me how many have migrated here from high priced costal cities in the last three years? I mean, objectives without metrics are just useless . How can anybody ever judge on what was done how well if you don't know where you are now, how do you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 know when you get to where you're going if you really don't know where you're going? We have to start looking at our contract s and our bidding things as well. And speaking of that, I think that with 7 -- the third J -- 3-J, I believe that letter says to ask something about meeting with you all on the day of bidding which I believe was the 21st. Did anybody on this body meet with -- while the bids were coming in or with the Law Department ? MR. DONAHUE : We did not, no. MS. SCHUMACHER : You were invited ? MR. DONAHUE : I -- no. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Okay. That is -- that's pitiful . There is nothing else to say about it. But now moving onto what is on the beginning of the website about what you would do with the ARPA money, I'm glad something was done. But unfortunately , I think there are some shortcomings on it. For instance , I think the timing is too much or too little. I think it should be longer because what is not put in there is what is total amount of money that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 have. You're asking how many dollars you would spend in each of those categories . And it should come out with -- and then we have two years' worth. Are some -- you're just looking for this year or are you looking for both years? MR. DONAHUE : So there's -- there's not two years' worth. It's one total batch. They all have to -- it all has to be spent. We're under contract by the end of 2024. It just comes in in two separate batches . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. But it would have been nice to put that number on as a given I think. And I also think that it would have been nice to have some demographics . You certainly don't want to ask people to give their names. But it would have been -- it would be nice to see how many people who are a certain age bracket , what section of the City they live in, how long they've lived in Scranton and if they own or rent a property . And that would be helpful , a little bit. Plus, how has it been marketed ? I mean, how many people -- this is a good question too, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 yeah, how many people go to the website in a day? MR. DONAHUE : I could find that out for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I think you might want to look at that too. But there's been absolutely as -- that I've seen -- I read the paper every day. And I have not seen anything in the paper, hasn't even been announce d here, has it? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I think it was announced last week. MS. SCHUMACHER : It was announce d the last week? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. And there should be an update to it that should either have hit today or tomorrow . I have to check and see if that covers the demographic question that you had asked. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. My time is up. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. KING: No, I don't. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : The only comment I have, several citizens have made and members of Council have made is on 5-J. I'd like to say that if I didn't express it earlier , I am disappointed that we're at this point with this insurance piece. We'll see how it affects the rates, if it affects the rates. And, I mean, at this point in time we will find out tomorrow , but disappointed in this. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just one, I also want to point out that I'm in agreement on 3-J that this is something that we should have receive d previously . It appears that the deadline was missed or the upcoming deadline . And so I'm glad that we will be able to get the emergency declaration in in time so that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 can choose an insurance broker prior to the contract 's end. I'm wondering what's going on out there. But, yeah, I think that it will be hopeful with the introduction tonight of the OpenGov piece so that could hopefully help prevent this from occurring in the future. And those systems already should have been in place so that they had the reminders of when contracts would be ending. So I'm not sure why. I'll be looking forward to hearing answers on that because this shouldn 't have happened . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So all of a sudden all the weather got nice and the ATV season has started . A couple concerned residents came to me in the past couple of days voicing their concern s that there is, you know, there was a couple ATVs, very brazen riders doing wheelies up and down Main Avenue in West Side so almost causing an accident with one resident which is pretty scarey. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 So I think we shouldn 't have to wait until someone gets really hurt to take more action. I know that we passed some legislation maybe a year and a half ago with -- that prevents the ATVs from coming to a gas station to have their tanks filled. I don't know how much of that has been a deterrent . I know we voted for that because it kind of made sense. But, Mr. Voldenberg , since we now have a new Police Chief, would you please inquire to Chief Carroll and ask him, you know, voice the concerns I just mentioned that, you know, it's starting up again. I'd like to know maybe he has a different strategy moving forward to curb this brazen illegal behavior . Maybe, you know, he's in contact with other municipalities and have a different strategy or have things that seem to work better for us or will work better for us with this issue -- ongoing issue. And then secondly , I want to reiterate and go back to 3-J. I want to know who dropped the ball, all right? You know, moving forward we can use technology . But, you know, contracts have been around a long time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 I don't think we need technology to know when they're due and when they need to be renewed . So I want to know who dropped the ball. I want to know the potential lapse of coverage . And I want to know why this renewal wasn't done in a timely manner. But I definitely want know who is responsible so we can get a better look at this. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. In terms of 3-J, I'm also disappoint ed that this is the case. But at the same time we cannot, you know, we're put between a rock and a hard place because we can't let our insurance coverage lapse in terms of casualty and liability . I am hopeful -- and it's my understanding that 5-C on our agenda tonight will help track that in terms of a procurement software through OpenGov . It doesn't only help with putting out RFQs and RFPs but it helps with contract management. As long as I've been on Council , we've had issues with automatic renewal s in contract s where in the contract it will say that, you know, a contract auto-renews if that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 vendor isn't notified within, you know, 90 days before the end of the contract . Or I'm also hopeful that this legislation 5-C will be helpful towards that as well because we have gotten into situation s where it auto-renewed -- contracts would auto-renew because we didn't meet that 90-day notification requirement . So I am hopeful there. It was great to see so many people out over the weekend at the St. Patrick 's Day Parade. Finally , you know, hopefully a sense of normal. It was great to see smiles on people's faces. And the weather was beautiful . We did receive some complaint s that we have gotten updates on. One was some graffiti that happened in the 800 block of Coyle Place. Chief Carroll did respond to Mr. Voldenberg 's inquires on that because we got a few calls to our office. And his update was that Scranton officers did investigate the 800 block of Coyle Place. They attempt ed to contact the two reporting parties by phone and by knocking at the residencies . With no contact being made, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 they did identify eight properties that sustained graffiti to garages and/or fences. They photographed the graffiti that was visible though some property owners had already cleaned up the damage. They did speak with one victim who had a trail camera in his yard. It detected a shadowy figure passing in the area of damage and shows the presence of no graffiti and then the presence of graffiti . The images were deleted prior to officer arrival . But a verbal report was given to officers . The photographs were uploaded . So they are working on that. And if anyone sees something , please report it to Scranton Police. We also got a complaint about a sinkhole on Lafayette Street. Mr. Voldenberg first reached out to DPW who checked it out and said that it was on private property . So then it was sent to code enforcement . Code enforcement is going to go look at it. And if there's any issues, they'll send it along to the mine reclamation office down in Wilkes-Barre to also check it out. But we are following that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Also I got a complaint that -- asking if we can look into why SPD website , Cityprotect .com that lets you see realtime crime stats has not had data updated since December 13th, 2021. According to SPD it's an IT issue. And, you know, they just went on to say that especially with a recent uptick in violent crimes in the Hill Section it's imperative that the citizens of the City can see the data as not everything is publish ed in the news. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'll forward you along this complaint . Can you check with both IT and the Police Department to see what the issue is with the crime reporting function on the website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. We also got some complaints regarding the 400 and 500 blocks of Taylor Avenue. There was a -- I believe there was a shooting there over the weekend , you know, and also having issues in terms of drinking parties and loud -- large 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 crowds. We did receive word back from Chief Carroll that they are currently investigating the incident s. They've spoken to code enforce ment. And he will also be reaching out to the resident who made that complaint . And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 31, 2022 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH PRESS RECORD COMMUNICATIONS TO PROVIDE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS SUPPORT FOR THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT , CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. MCANDREW : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I just want to speak to this and underscore the importance of this piece to me and just explain why I'll be -- why I'll be voting in favor of it. So in the past we've had programs through OECD that I don't believe have been as successful as they could have been because of people just not knowing about the program and they how they could benefit from them. And many of these program s are meant to reach to underserved communities or low income households . They provided housing opportunities . And I don't believe that we've been necessarily reaching those communities in the best way. And so I believe that this marketing contract would help us to do that and to really make the most out of these programs and to make people aware of them. So for that reason, I think it's important that -- that our City is able to market these programs . And I'll be voting in favor of it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? Just briefly , I do agree with what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Dr. Rothchild said. And, you know, we have to start promoting ourselves better to the outside world. And I think this is a small first step. But it is a first step. And I'll be supporting this resolution .
