But there is a benefit that's being held for two of my uncles. It's called Together For The Trentlys . It benefits supporting John and Billy Trently . Friends and family have planned a benefit for John and Billy Trently . Both brothers were diagnose d with cancer within two weeks of each other. John has advanced prostate cancer and Billy has multiple myeloma . Together along with their families , they are facing this battle. The benefit will be this Saturday , September 21st from 4 to 8 p.m., at St. Mary's Center in Scranton to help defray the cost of treatments and travel expense s to Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City. Tickets are $20 and available at the door. There will be basket raffles , basket of cheer, 50-50, entertainment , food, wine and beer. Please come out to support two wonderful men and their battle with cancer. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I just have one quick one. The City of Scranton Office of Economic and Community Development is preparing their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Five Year Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and its analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. As part of the planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify residents needs in the community and ideas on what the City residents would like to see funds used for. Please take a few minutes and complete the survey which can be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. Thank you. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I do have two brief announcement s as well. Good evening everyone and thank you for attending this evening . The members of City Council received a letter dated September 6th, 2019, from a young girl age nine. I don't want to give her name or address or privacy reasons . But it says, thank you for giving me lots of books to read at the public library . Thank you for making sure I have clean water to drink. Thank you for giving me a park to play in with lot of trees. So I want to thank her for taking the time and for doing her civic duty by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 sending us a letter. And I want her to know how much we appreciate that letter. The second thing I would like to announcement is this Saturday , I have my pink on if you noticed . It's the Susan G. Komen Race For The Cure in downtown Scranton . In this City where -- in this valley, I should say, where it seems like the diagnosis of cancer is so pervasive and so ubiquitous , anything we can do to eradicate this insidious disease is always helpful . The Susan G. Komen Foundation has donated over 10 million dollars to breast cancer research and over 25 million dollars to funding a program in this general area. Their efforts are so significant and since their inaugural year it has absolutely I bet you quad -- more than quadrupled . It has to be 20 times. I participated in it. And each time you see it, it just gets larger and larger. One of the final things I would like to say about that is the unification of the City during this event it goes out Wyoming and down North Washington . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And I'll start to see as I come to work and go back to work on Wyoming and North Washington Avenues , each of the City -- not each and every one but most of the City businesses along those ways, the restaurant s, the truck and auto centers, the banks and the auto dealership and any other smaller business along that route will start to decorate their windows in a show of solidarity for anybody who is either walking in that race, fighting breast cancer or walking in that race in general or walking in that race in memoriam of a loved one. So registration still remains open. It's this Saturday . I looked at mine via Facebook and I was able to register today. So I would encourage everyone who can to participate . And again, breast cancer does not discriminate . It affects men and women alike. And again, I will repeat, I'm sure there's no one in this audience who has not been affected by cancer in some way or manner. So I'm sure they would appreciate any help we can assist in. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 just give some more details on that race. As Attorney Dempsey said it's going to be September 21st. The Race For The Cure will be held downtown . The race day schedule begins at 6:30 a.m., Courthouse Square with a 5K run beginning at 8:30 a.m., and the walk beginning at 8:45. Please be mindful of any potential road closure s and the safety of runners and walkers as you are travelling throughout the downtown area on Saturday . And also just a remainder for the speakers tonight just to state their name for the record before they speak. That's all I have. So with that, we'll go into FOURTH ORDER. (The following speaker s offered public comment : Joan Hodowanitz Bob Bolus Fay Franus Ron Ellman Marie Schumacher Lee Morgan Dave Dobrzyn1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Gary St. Fluer Norma Jefferies ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A Motions . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, real quick, Mrs. Schumacher , I understand your frustration with the signs for 81 on East Mountain Road. So, Miss Reed, would we be able to send a request to PennDOT to see who put those signs up? And then also with the cardboard recycling , I have some questions that I'm putting together on that too. But I think that requirement was pushed back until at least January 6th where we won't have to meet that requirement until then. I'd like to also just start off by thanking the Career Technology Center Culinary Arts Program and chef Mark McAndrew for hosting their seventh annual First Responder Recognition luncheon last week up at the Career Technology Center for members of the Scranton Police and Fire Department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 All culinary students did a tremendous prepping and serving lunch while also giving thanks to the first responders who serve our community . I also received complaint s at a neighborhood meeting this week from neighbors regarding a property the 508 Tioga Avenue concerning a large amount of lumber in the yard coming all the way out to the street and also old oil drums on the property both of which the neighbors believe are potential fire hazards . So, Miss Reed, would you be able to pass along those complaints to the LIPS Department as well as the fire inspector ? And one thing I did forget to mention last week but the house at 1218 Oliver Place that Mr. and Mrs. Labroski {sic} brought to our attention at our last meeting in July before Council 's recess was demoed on Saturday , September 7th. Also last week Council received an update on the status of the new Novembrino splash pad and recreation area. Construction on the building should be complete d by the end of the year and the splash pad should be finished by June 1st of next year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 On Friday, Mayor Evans and myself met with representatives of the school district including Acting Superintendent Mrs. McTiernan , Chief Recovery Officer Candice Finnan, Business Manager Pat Laffey, School Directors Barb Dixon, Katie Gilmartin and Tom Schuster to restart discussions on potential areas where the City and School District can share services . Since there's a been a change in leadership in both the City and the School District both the Mayor and district leadership are committed to developing a working relationship between those two entities . Topic of discussion included unifying the discount period for property taxes amongst the City, school district , and county; a HUP test for nonprofits , potential areas for joint purchasing , technology initiatives , grant writing and also the painting of crosswalks at intersections with school crossing guards. Councilman Gaughan and myself will continue to provide updates as we continue to move through this process . And I'll save the rest of my comment s for agenda items. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that's all I have for now. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments tonight ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you, Mr. Perry. Just a few comments , consistent with what we spoke about with Miss Jefferies, I did want to thank Scranton Tomorrow for putting those banners in downtown Scranton . Most of them I think are up right now and they run from Lackawanna Avenue to Mulberry Street and Franklin Avenue to Jefferson Avenue. And they really look nice. I'm not sure of the process by which they decided them or came up with the theory or dynamic behind them but they really are beautiful . There's one outside my office. So I would like to thank them for their efforts . And I think thus far everything I've seen them do they've been a great partner with the City. I spoke to Mr. Bulzoni this morning on the budget. And he had told me that is moving along accordingly and in accordance with his schedule . The PEL has requested that we have that to them no later than November 18th. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And I think additional e-mails were just sent out to all the department s today asking for figures and formulas so that that could be worked on and put in. That's why I hesitated to answer the question that was presented to me before. These are still working documents . And what I've learned in the law is if you give an answer on a working document you're probably doing yourself a disservice until a final document is provided . I also asked on the status of the audit. I believe someone had mentioned that last week. And quite frankly I had the same question . And I was advised that we do have a new audit team this year, Jones Kohanski {sic}. I do understand that has led to somewhat of a delay in getting some of the data and that unlike the previous auditor we had who had a three year term, so in the second and third year of the term, all they had to do type in data and everything was set up for them. This one may take a little bit longer than we expected . Miss Hodowanitz , you had asked about whether I think additional data 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 was going to be provided to them in light of what happened with the political corruption . I think the initial answer that I got for right now is no. I believe they are going to be working with the data that they have. And any additional data is received by Council or the Mayor or the Administration at any later date we can certain ly amend that or change that or ask for a more detailed audit in accordance with our Council rules. Mr. Donahue and I attended a meeting with the Green Ridge neighbors and they express ed a concern to me that I'm going to ask that we send a letter to the Department of Parks and Recreation , more specifically Mr. Fallon. We did a cleanup at Pretzel Park out in Green Ridge two weeks ago and I really think it's a relatively simple solution . But they are very large lights and they need bulbs and that the outlets , most of them, if not all of them were not working . So we would ask that those be rectified or fixed. The neighbors do like to put holiday decorations out there. I also did receive an oral request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 from one of the principals out in that area as well about crosswalks . And quite frankly , as I'm moving more about the City and talking to different neighbor groups I do think crosswalks are an issue and want to speak about more. So I've asked them to put that into writing and once that's put into writing we'll follow up on that more. There is two private schools out in Green Ridge and there's also a public school, Robert Morris. And I'm actually going to drive around tomorrow night and try and see which ones need to be clarified or just made brighter for most instances because there are as in all neighborhoods young kids. If there is any other issues on those in other neighborhood s that people want to speak to me on I would be happy to listen to them. And finally , last week I reached out to other neighborhood groups that might want to speak to me. I did hear from the Plot Neighborhood Group. I'll be meeting with them later this month. And I'm also going up to the Hill Section to meet with them as well. That's all. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. PERRY: Thank you very much. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, first I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to the family of Mike Melnick . I had the opportunity on several occasions to talk to Mr. Melnick who was a Councilman in the City for 16 years. And he was also friends with my parents . To be a Council man in this City for 16 years I think is an unbelievable feat. He was a dedicated public servant . And he was just an all around nice person with a big heart who had a lot of friends because of his personality and the way he was able to talk to people as if he was talking to them and not at them. So that was one of his great qualities . So again, I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to his family and I'm glad that this Council recognized him earlier in the meeting. I would like to make a motion now that City Council send a letter to the Licensing and Inspection s Department asking for a plan of action to deal with a blighted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 property at 342 Harrison Avenue. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. PERRY: Okay. We have a motion and a second. On the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I was on the phone earlier today with a resident who lives right next door to this property . I am trying to fight on behalf of the neighbors here. I was out at this property about two months ago. I know that the Licensing and Inspections Department was out there. So they are not ignoring the problem . The homeowner apparent ly cut the grass. But this property is literally in my opinion falling apart. The neighbor s who live next door are afraid if anything happens in terms of a fire that their house would also go up as well. And they really should not have to live next to this property in this condition any longer. So I would just ask as I made the motion that the Licensing and Inspection s Department come up with some sort of plan of action to deal with this property once and for all. And by the way just to add, this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 property -- no one has lived in this home for 25 years. Thank you. MR. PERRY: All in favor of the motion say aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd also like to make a motion to send a letter to Police Chief Carl Graziano and the Scranton School District Superintendent alerting them of an issue with speeding and parking issues on Perry Avenue which is in front of West Scranton Intermediate School. I'd like to ask them for an assessment of the situation and also what safety measures may be implement ed to solve this problem . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: There's a motion and a second. On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I have been in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 contact with this resident . And I know several of the other neighbors are concerned about this issue as well. A few weeks ago we receive d a complaint . The DPW was quick to act on it. And they put up children at play signs. Unfortunately , this did not solve the problem . So I just want to take a second and read into the record an e-mail I received from this resident late this afternoon . "We moved to this residence on Parrot Avenue three years ago. I'm very concern ed with the speeding that takes place on this road. Many people use this as a shortcut through this side of the City to avoid traffic lights. However , they speed very quickly in both direction s. My children as well as the neighborhood children play football , baseball and kickball across the street. They ride their bikes and enjoy the neighborhood as children should. It is a school zone. And there is no reason people should be flying up the street after stopping at the stop sign at Parrot and Fellows Street. Myself and other neighbors are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 very concern ed for our children 's safety. Dismissal from the West Scranton Intermediate School is an even larger issue. Children walk out in front of the road, cars parked to pick children up, and the traffic goes very quickly around the cars." She mentions that two slow children at play signs were installed and she also put up a large flag on her property alerting cars not to speed. No one pays attention to the signs. So hopefully this letter that's sent to the police chief and the superintendent , they will come up with some sort of plan of action maybe to install additional safety measure s to take care of that issue. Thank you. MR. PERRY: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? Ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I received from a resident on East Mountain several complaints up there. So one of them was on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 East Mountain Road they would like to have the edge on the right-hand side heading to Engine 10 trimmed . When they trim they ask that the trimming s could be picked up and not left behind. They end up covering the catch basins. Also Mountain Lake Road on East Mountain needs to be trimmed . The bushes are so high that resident s cannot see animals and other things that run out into the road. So we did receive a response from Mr. Gallagher , the DPW Director . And he informed Council that the brush hog is out of service for multiple repairs , some of which are safety concerns . So that is an issue. We did not get an idea when that might be back in service . But I just wanted to make sure that the resident is aware of that. Also Mrs. Jefferies has asked several times for an update on the Street Sign Program . So I just want to read an e-mail that we received again from DPW Director . Gene Reed and Dave Medici who are the two employees in the Sign Department in the City -- by the way, we only have two employees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 in the Sign Department . They have been trained . Harry Baker who is the Vice President of KS Engineering who is the company that worked with the DPW to implement this plan worked with both employee s for three days in the field. There is a very large inventory as you could imagine and you had pointed out on several occasions of poor signs to be addressed . Again, I reiterate there is only a two-person crew to do this. In addition to street signs, stop signs, do not enter signs, one way signs and other safety related signs are a priority . There was several of them that were identified as needing to be replaced. The two employees in this department plan on using a biweekly sweep in different areas of the City, two weeks in South Side, two weeks in North Scranton , so on and so forth. Whatever they could accomplish in two weeks in that part of the City with safety signs and intersection signs they will. He asked us to please remember they are a two-man crew. This is another job given 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 to them along with their existing duties that they perform daily. Since its inception , this program 's inception , they've had work through some technology glitches . They were without service . They have iPads that they have to type into. That since has been taken care of. Everything that they upgrade , any signs, stop sign, street signs go into a database that is saved. So we are keeping that data as we move forward which I don't think to this magnitude had been done before. So that is the update on the street signs. So if you have any other questions just let me know. But I just want to say I appreciate both Mr. Reed and Mr. Medici for all the work that they do. They do really care about this City and they are doing a great job. Also on that, DPW vain and City vehicle fleet that we've been talking about and has been in the newspaper the last few weeks, I had floated an idea to the Administration about two weeks ago in regards to installing GPS on all City vehicles for that matter. As I mentioned last week, many other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 municipalities do this on a regular basis so that they can track where the vehicles go and then if we're talking about snowplowing and other things it becomes very transparent because the resident s can actually go on the website and see where the snowplows have been. So I was very pleased to learn through Mr. Bulzoni , the Business Administrator that there is a meeting set for next week which Mrs. Reed will attend in our absence or anyone else who wants to attend can go to that. But it is on the GPS, its functionality and the costs. So we may have an update on that in the near future. And finally, I just also want to thank as it was mentioned Mayor Evans came to our caucus tonight . And coincident ally I had several question s on the legislation that we have on our agenda. But Mr. Evans came, answered the questions and that's really the way that I think this should operate and should have operated for a long time. So I appreciate Mayor Evans coming, clearing some things up, clarifying some things with the legislation . As he mentioned before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 he left he will be back when we do have legislation on our agenda that needs further clarification . So again, I just want to thank him and thank you. Have a good night. MR. PERRY: Thank you. I just have two quick things. The first thing is I'll share some information that I have to Mr. St. Fluer. I know you discussed about the Bethlehem comparison and that's something that we do all the time here for many purposes because it's such, as you know, a sister city. So this is in no way to misguide you or make an excuse. I'm just going to share information that I found and that you could use because I think you're on the right track with a lot of the comparisons . As you know, they are similar in population size but the one thing that kind of sets us apart is the square mileage that we have. Bethlehem is about 19 and a half square miles where the City of Scranton is 25 and a half square miles, which is about 30 percent larger than Bethlehem with the same population density or same population with more spread out density . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And as you know, the biggest cost that any municipality has to their budget, services , police, fire, DPW. So, you know, when you increase the size you'd have to increase, you know, the number of police to cover that, the number of firehouses , firemen and trucks, garbage trucks, employees of that size. And I'm not saying it's a complete compari son but if you up 30 percent , the budget would go to about 101 which is still a little bit shy of what we have. Not all of that would carry over, of course, I know. But it's just kind of to show you that there is going to be a, you know, bigger increase with the size of the City. So I would start with -- and something that I was working on before was number of firehouses compared to how many firehouse s do we have active, police officers per shift to the amount of police officers that we have per shift. And then you could kind of get your head around where the actual numbers are because the budget can be very intimidating and confusing when you're looking at it as just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 a document and not a living breathing entity that you see on a daily basis. So I do agree with you there. So that's just some information from me to you to use. And if it's something you already know, I'm sorry for wasting your time. If it's not, I hope there was some nugget of information that you could use to further dig because I do think you are on the right track. Something else that came up tonight was that long-term maintenance plan that we have been talking about for a while. One of the things that I would love to institute and it might be too late to do this but something that maybe the new Administration could look at is to do a mandatory allocation for a long term maintenance plan which would come right out of the City budget. It would be a certain percentage of a maintenance fund that we already have -- a maintenance program that we already funded, certain percentage a .05, a .7, something that would just perpetually increase until something is needed. And I would also like that stipulation to include something where the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 monies could only be taken out of that account unless it had Council approval . That way we would know we would have the automatic oversight of the bidding process , who's in charge of the work, what work's going to be done and for lack of a better word it would almost necessitate the communication between the Administration and the Council . Sometimes it's great. Sometimes it's not so great. But this is something that we can do to make it more open and more, you know, something where it's just more transparent. I think that would be the way to go because more times than not and it's very apparent to me now from being on Council for almost four years is when you don't have a long time keeper of building s and properties and overall assets, more times than not you kick the can down the road theory. You know, someone is only here for four years or eight years and it's, you know, and you hate to say it but it turns into it's not my problem situation . I hate to say that that's the way it is but look at the state of a lot of our assets. So I think that's how it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 being treated . So I think that's why this long-term maintenance plan it just can't be a budget item that could be tweaked or reduced . I think it would have to be something passed by Council that would have been be a certain percentage and have to be mandatory . Now, there is a lot of things that go into that. I could hear Mr. Bulzoni right now going, oh, my goodness , you know, there's something that we have to pay for. Well, there's a cost to everything . Are we going to pay now or are we going to pay later because one way or another we're going to pay. So I think that is something we need to take a hard look at especially come next budget time and the new administration is let's put something in place for a mandatory long-term -- a mandatory allocation for long-term maintenance program that is overseen by the City Council when it comes time to draw those monies out for certain funds. I think that would be a good usage of it. And after time, you know, you might go three or four years without using it which is great. That money just piles up and it stays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 there and it doesn't move. And then when you need it, you have it and then it gets replenished back and forth. At least then you could actually get project s done without having to take it from other account s. You know, is it a perfect plan, no. But it's something -- it's a good starting point for us to discuss . And it's lot better than what we have now. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MS.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 64, 2014, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND VIOLATIONS TICKET PROCESS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON ” TO BE AMENDED IN SECTION 3 BY DELETING NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 7, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28 AND 29 TO REMOVE VIOLATIONS AND IN SECTION 9 TO REDUCE FINES FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS AND IN SECTION 10 TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CITATION FINES FOR VIOLATIONS . MR. PERRY: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I again appreciate the Mayor coming in and explaining quite a few things as it relates to this legislation . First of all, I think this is a step in the right direction in the fact that when the Mayor was in our caucus tonight and one of the speakers brought this up as well, what they're really putting an emphasis on now is to give people a warning before they issue a ticket. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 So in the past what would happen and just as recent as I saw somebody making a complaint online is that you have high grass or some other citation and you would get 150 or $300 citation without being able to correct the problem before you had to go and pay the fine. So it became a thing of, you know, the City going out and penalizing people if they had a good excuse, if they were elderly or really couldn't get to it or there were health issues and so on and so forth. So according to Mayor Evans what the City is now going to do, they come up with a door hanger. So if a City inspect or goes out and you have high grass or some other -- some other penalty or you're doing something wrong, you'll get a hanger on your door and you'll have 48 hours to correct the issue. Again, I think that's a step in the right direction . Some of the other improvement s that I appreciated is the turnaround in permits being approved . Mayor Evans told us that -- and I know from hearing so many complaint s over the last few years it was taking a few weeks to get a permit approved . That's now down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 according to him to a few days. So that's a step in the right direction . One of the things that I was really pleased to hear from the Mayor is that they will no longer be accepting cash in the Licensing and Inspection s Department . Again, another step in the right direction . So the Mayor said somewhere in the span of two or three weeks they will be unveiling a credit card program so you'll be able to pay out with a credit card. I think the crux of this legislation is to make it simpler , easier to enforce . And, you know, the goal of this is not to collect money or penalize people. It's to change the behavior and it's to try to improve the properties around the City. The thing that I did mention to the Mayor and to my colleague s in the caucus is I do hope that in the future the City will be able to come up with some sort of program so when a City inspect or goes out and identifies an issue such as high grass and actually finds out that the person is elderly and cannot do it and cannot afford it that we would be able to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 provide them some avenue then to go to an organization or a charity of some sort to get the help that they need. I agree with what Mayor Evans is trying to do here. Instead of just handing somebody a $300 fine, let's find out what the problem is and then let's try to work with the person to solve it instead of, you know, driving them away or then they go to the magistrate and that drags on for a couple weeks. So again, I want to thank him for coming and clearing quite a few things up and I think the Licensing and Inspections Department is starting to move in the right direction . I think this legislation is a good first step. Thank you. MR. PERRY: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR.

MR. PERRY: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Again, I have to commend the Mayor and the Administration for making this move. I think that this program that actually then Councilman Evans had proposed and looking at Oswego, New York who did basically the same thing a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 years ago. This was an innovative out of the box type of program that finally puts money back into the neighborhood s. We see so much over the last few years about putting money into the downtown and that is so important . But this is a program that gives money back to the people who are living in the neighborhood s. And from all account s and from what we heard from the Mayor tonight , this program has been a huge success . So by putting now $185,000 of the remaining rental registration escrow, this program is only going to expand. And I can't wait to see what it looks like in a few years. Thank you. MR. PERRY: All those in favor of introduction , signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-F.

MR. PERRY: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction -- ATTY. DEMPSEY : Tim, one minute. I was waiting for Bill. ATTY. GAUGHAN : No, I'm good now. I don't have any more. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I came to this ball game a little late. So I understand that the solicitor -- assistant solicitor Joe Price, Jr., came in at an earlier date regarding this lawsuit . And before I approved a settlement , I really wanted to make sure I understood what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 was the genesis of the lawsuit , what happened during the discover y and deposition process and why, in fact, it was being settled . And a lot of that is attorney /client privilege and I can't get into it. I can tell you with my 28 years of experience that I do, in fact, think that this is a good case for us to resolve . Joe Price, Jr., explained to me very clearly why that was the case. One thing that did catch my eye was the amount of the $100,000. But what I was glad to hear is that there was no outlay of money by the City for that purpose . Joe was able to get this done for us over a five year period of time with only a credit to UGI in the amount of 20,000 over five years. So basically no outlay of money on behalf of the City because that did have me somewhat concerned if that was going to be the case and also that we were not going to pay any costs or attorney 's fees which again, could be the case in a lot of litigation . So I was pleased about that. The other thing that caught my eye that I think is very favorable going forward and again, you're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 always interested when you have a legal resolution how can we prevent this from happening again is he advised me going forward we're just going to adopt PennDOT guideline s relative to pave cuts and other issues and that also going forward , UGI is going to provide a designated operation s representative for the City which I think is a great idea. That could be a contact for all matters regarding paving and gas service s to Scranton residents and any other UGI project . This should facilitate better communication between the parties on any issues going forward . It's not to say we may not have to look at other things operationally or in terms of management . But I am -- I do understand why we are settling this. And I want to thank him for his time that he spent with me because , of course, I had a lot of questions on it. Thank you. MR.

DONAHUE : Yes, on the question . By finally appointing a majority of this Ethics Board, this is the last step to finally implement a process that sets a high bar for ethical conduct for not only City employees but also for City elected official s. Corruption and pay to play politics have held this City back for far too long and is long overdue to finally begin to change that negative perception of this great City which is why I wouldn't couldn't agree more with a letter to the Editor in yesterday 's Sunday Times from Sondra Myers that stated and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 quote, Citizens need to know that we must act robustly to get rid of corruption and earn the right to lose our bad reputation . Let's go for that anticorruption brand and more important an anticorruption mindset and activism , end quote. Anticorruption as well as transparent and open government must be the mindset that is instilled in each and every employee and elected official in City government . Being able to work on behalf of residents of this City is a privilege that should be treated as a public service not as a self-service . This Ethics Code does exactly that. The campaign finance limited Ethics Code drastically limits the ability of any current or future elected officials in this City from engaging in pay to play schemes . Gone are the days of an individual being able to donate over $40,000 over the course of four years to one candidate because no one donates that much to one candidate without expecting something in return. So I just want to close by I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 wish each and every one of the following appointees the best of luck in this important endeavor and also to thank them for their willingness to serve in this extremely important capacity .
