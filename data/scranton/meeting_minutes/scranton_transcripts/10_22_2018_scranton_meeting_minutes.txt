(The following speakers gave public comment : Michelle Dempsey spoke on matters of general concern . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on agenda items and city business . Sam Ganza spoke on matters of general concern . Gerard Hetman spoke on matters of general concern . Maria Schumacher spoke on city business . Lenny Srebro spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 concern . Glynnis Johns spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments . MR. PERRY: I really didn't, but I'll just make one quick comment and that's just kind of how our meetings are handled and how we would like them to be handle. There is over 70,000 people in this city. That's 70,000 different personalities , 70,000 different ideas and lot of times we butt heads or we don't agree. Most of the times most people don't agree on everything , it's impossible . But one thing that we can do is treat each other with respect and that's something that, you know, my mom instilled in me from the very beginning . It costs nothing . It's free to respect somebody and I make sure I respect everybody whether we agree or we disagree and I expect nothing less than anybody that I'm talking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to as well. So let's keep that in our mind. When we host our meetings if we want something to get done in the city, and that's why we're all here is to progress the city, whether it's how I feel it should be done or you or we get together , we kind of homogenize and come together on a certain plan let's do it with respect and respect each other because nothing gets don the other way. It's too divisive and civil discourse is never good for anybody . That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Sure. I'm going to circle back to last week's comments and discussion on storm water. Default is a word that is associated in most cases with a financial condition of someone or some thing. So simply stated, if you were in default -- you are in default when you fail to meet your obligations . As we all know and we have been for almost a generation the city had been close at time to default by failing to meet our financial obligations . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 So over the last four and a half years, four and a half plus years we have made some great strides in gaining our financial footing as we continue to work towards finally exiting Act 47. The last week's discussion on the storm water has lead to me believe we are guilty of another kind of default. Property owners and taxpayers in Scranton expect a certain level of service and responsiveness necessary from their government , but when it comes to storm water we have failed to fulfill our obligations . While it has been increasingly clear our future will include a Storm Water Authority , either a Scranton only authority or the more regional approach , which I fully endorse , and when that happens it is envisioned that the resources to finally address storm water adequately will be readily available and we can begin to effectively deal with this issue, but that is then and this is now. And today when it comes to storm water and our responsiveness to our citizens and property owners and taxpayers to even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 address this problem in the most basic way we are in default . City council 's calls for what might be called a storm water summit is not only important , it is not only overdue , it is absolutely necessary . I know Councilman Gaughan will be talking a little bit more about that in a few minutes . On a completely unrelated topic, I would like to talk about the word innovation and how it may relate to government , and particularly Scranton City Government . First I'd like to define the word, at least what it means to me. For many innovation is just a buzz word, a word that people tend to throw around in hopes of impressing the masses, but with no real intention of doing what is necessary to actually innovate . Innovation put in the simplest terms is creative ideas completed . There cannot be innovation unless the creative ideas developed are actually implemented in some way. This has always been a big stumbling block in my eyes and in the government sector. Government , by the way, is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 largest employer in the United States and it probably ranks to being number one in Pennsylvania and in Lackawanna County. In Scranton , I'm sure it's somewhere in the top two or three of all employers . With all of those employees , with budgets measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars and in large cities in the state the budget is probably measured in the billions , so how much is spent on R & D, research and development ? How much is spent on innovation ? The answer is zero. Zero dollars . This city is a $100 million enterprise price and we allocate zero funds towards innovation . Now, that's not to say that innovation doesn't exist in government , it does, it just has never been a sustained concept . At times, it can be driven by people that think innovation is important , but when those people are no longer part of the government for whatever reason innovation can and many times does cease to exist. Over the last few years I'm proud to say that a good share of innovation at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 city level and creative ideas implemented has come from this city council . Granticus , Smart City, the idea sessions , the Scranton Home Assistance Program, and coming soon, See, Click, Fix are just a few examples . Of course, that doesn't happen without willing and talented people on the administrative side of equation as well. Those that have partnered with us to get these things done. Some of those individuals have shown their ability to innovate and we are grateful for that. But, again, when key individuals are no longer working for this city the passion for innovation most likely will leave with them. But that is today and what do we to about tomorrow ? We need to find a creative , sustain able model of innovation . It needs to be part of our culture moving forward , a cultural shift in the city that historically has resisted change and it must happen. The key to innovation being successful is being able to quickly put ideas into effect through pilot programs . It's that simple and, of course, it's also that difficult . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 When you have what appears to be a good idea you create a pilot program . It's either successful or it's not. You either approve the concept or you don't. If successful the dividends can be great, but when you are unsuccessful what you learn through the process can be just as important . You have to be willing to take a risk and you have to be willing to try. So that leads to this suggestion for the administration , create a new entry in the 2019 budget called the innovation fund. Make 2019 the first year of what should be a long-term commitment to innovation within city government . I finally have this challenge for the mayor, if you create this innovation fund at a modest $25,000 in 2019, if the mayor agrees to that, I will take a $5,000 pay cut in my salary in 2019 and have that money transferred directly into the innovation fund. That's 40 percent of my city council salary for a .025 percent city stake in the fund based on the 2019 budget. That's how much I believe in the promise of innovation , that's how much I believe in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 promise of ideas. So, Mr. Mayor, the innovation is in your Court. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few. First, Mrs. Reed, I know we sent this before, 1207 S. Main Avenue the gentleman was in touch with me again, there is a large sinkhole that has opened up. If we could ask Licensing and Inspections Department and the city engineer to go out and assess that, I don't know if they have been out, we haven't heard anything back. Also, received a complaint about 516 Palm Street, overgrown grass and a couple of other issues if we could send that out again to the Licensing , Inspections and Permits Department . Also, I usually don't do this, but I do have to fact check Mr. Bolus, he said something that was completely false in his speech tonight and that there are no minutes for council meetings , that is not true. On the city's website there are minutes of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 council meeting . Now, I didn't agree, if he was paying attention back in January when we reorganized , I didn't agree with the way that we went about that and the way that it was done, but the stenographer takes the video that is recorded by ECTV off of YouTube and records the minutes and they are available on the city website . That does not include word-for-word transcription of council speakers . So what he said actually was not true. Also, I did receive a copy from Solicitor Minora last week of the Code of Ethics in draft form, so I received that last week. I have had a chance in the past few days to go through it. I'm pleased with a lot of the language in here. We used the City of Reading as a guide and to stay with the spirit of their law. There are some addition s and deletions that I would like to make so I'm going to hand those over to Solicitor Minora and get with him, and I did ask my colleagues in the caucus tonight and if they could do the same because I would like to get this on our agenda before the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 end of the year because I think it's very important . Also, last week we sent a letter to Mayor Courtright regarding several issues about storm water in the city, and I'm not going to drone on about it because we have talked about for months and months, but in the letter -- I made a motion last week and in the letter council agreed unanimously to request a public meeting with the mayor, members of his cabinet , city engineer , representatives from Pennsylvania American Water in order to address the city's management of these flooding events, and I did say last week that I understand that these things will not be cured overnight but it is such now, and I have seen over the last few years that there are spots in the city that get flooded every single time it rains. So there is no excuse for the city to continue to say that we don't have the money or just going to turn a blind eye to it and let people pay thousands of dollars every year -- or, actually I have heard one time why did they build their house there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 That's not an excuse. So I made that motion, it was very clear that we all would like a public meeting with the mayor, with members of his administration to address these issues because they are extremely important . So without fail we received a response not from the mayor but from another attorney , his city solicitor , in which she says, "The mayor is in receipt of your letter dated October 18 regarding the flooding issues in the 2600 block of Pittston Avenue and I have reviewed the same with him. This matter has already been brought to me by Councilman Perry, and as promised to him I will be meeting with him along with Council President Rogan to discuss this matter further with the appropriate members of city administration and Pennsylvania American Water. I trust that they will update remaining members of council following the meeting ." Well, I have a few issues with that. I'm glad that they are addressing the 2600 block of Pittston Avenue but they did not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 address half of the letter in I which we called for a public meeting . Now, you know, let me say, as I said last week, I have been asking very, very, very specific questions . This is not rocket science about the flooding that occurred in the city in August and what our response was to the state, whether we submitted for damages , are we going to get reimbursed , what that process looks like, sent it on more than one occasion , never received a response . Now, I'm not insulted by this because over the last four to five years this has been common practice by the mayor and the members of his administration to ignore my requests and my questions , and as I mention ed to my colleagues in the back tonight , you know, I don't ask questions that are not relevant to either something that's on our agenda or issues that are going on in the city. I'm not asking how many shades of paint we have colored city hall with in the last five years. I'm not asking for boxes and boxes of information just to make some poor person in city hall 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 go through it and get it so that I can throw it away just to make their job a little bit harder. I'm asking questions that are important not only to council , but to the people of this city. Who I feel was insulted with this response was every single person who over the last five to six months has called me, e-mailed me, stopped me on the street, came and knocked on my door and that I have met at their house in front of their door. Al Young, Lenny Srebro, everybody else in Keyser Valley, West Scranton , Minooka , South Side, North Scranton , you name it, my phone has rang off the hook and apparently to the mayor and other members of his administration it doesn't matter if people spend ten or 15,000 dollars to replace water heaters, electrical panels and everything else. It doesn't matter that we have people calling us crying because they don't have enough money to spend on all of the damages that has occurred . The response is get an attorney or have another lawyer write us a letter that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 is not the worth the paper that it's written on. So I'm going to ask again with the support of my colleagues to ask the mayor to do his job. Come out from hiding and face the people. We are willing to work with them. We are willing to work with the city engineer . We are willing to work with the DPW director , but we want to come up with a plan so that we have something that says here is the issues, here is what we are going to do with it. We keep referring to this Arcadis study like it's going to be the Bible. It's going to tell us how to create an authority probably so the mayor can appoint one of his cronies the executive director and flood that with a bunch the people that donated to his campaign . I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about every single person who has contact ed me, who I feel sick for, who has spent thousands of dollars who this mayor and his administration and his attorneys continually ignore, and it is a disgrace . This isn't political , this is the right thing to do and this administration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 refuses to do it, refuses to answer questions , refuses to provide simple information and, quite frankly , I'm sick of it and I hope that my colleagues are sick of it as well. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: (No audio for a few moments .) We did have a caucus with the Chamber of the Commerce earlier today and just to reiterate some of what was brought up, and we did go through many of the economic development items that have taken place in the city over the last few years. I mean, we talked about a couple of other tools that may work to move the city forward as far as the economic development side goes. Just the facts that we could talk about these issues and work on these progressive plans to try to innovate as Councilman Evans alluded to our city is really a testament to how many good work has been done over the course of the last few years. Although , people always pick items that aren't correct and that need to be fixed and any city America is, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 unfortunately , always going to have problems that need to be fixed and we need to fix every problem , but just because we are focusing or talking about one issue doesn't mean that we don't care about another issue that's going on. So the focus of our caucus, like I said, was about economic development , finding new ways to get people building homes in the City of Scranton , finding ways to get businesses to come into Scranton , build new properties , and the biggest complaint that we all hear is the taxes are too high, and the good news is over the last two years city taxes have not gone up. Next year's budget, from what it looks like, is going to be another good year, maybe a small increase or no increase . Our TANS are looking better, so financially we are doing significantly better in the City of Scranton . So at this point in time we need to look at ways to grow the city. So the Chamber of Commerce did bring to us an idea that can work to help really supercharge the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 growth in the city and the idea of a ten-year LERTA I think would push us closer to that goal. We did pass, I believe it was 2016 or '17, a three-year provision so anyone that built a new home in the City of Scranton or a business that built a facility would have three years tax free just on the improvement of the property . They would still pay what they were continuing to pay on their land previously . It hasn't been too successful . Three years and ten years is a big difference . The Chamber pointed to the Tripps Park development , which was done under a different program , which was the KOZ which exempted all taxes, including wage tax, including your state taxes. This program would not do that, but I do think ten years of not paying taxes on any improvements is a huge incentive to be given out. Unfortunately , it's one that needs to be given out because anyone that even considers building new in Lackawanna County knows that you are assessed at the absolute highest rate compared to other assessments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 New construction is completely not tax fair in Lackawanna County. That gets into another issue of needing a countywide reassessment , which I won't get into tonight , but this incentive which I strongly encourage the mayor to review and to propose so we could pass this for January 1, 2019, as the Chamber is suggesting , this incentive combined with other incentives that are currently in place, as part of the Trump tax cuts there is a provision regarding Federal Opportunity Zones, which part of Scranton is in that zone. And I actually wanted to announce this earlier , Evan Weiss is going to be featured , and those of you who know Evans he has been one of our consultants that has done an excellent job to help us in the city and get our finances straight , but he is the key speaker at a forum being held by the Pennsylvania Economy league. It's "Learn the economic development and investment benefits of the new federal opportunities zones." It's featuring Evans Weiss, Opportunity Zone and Fund Management 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Consultant . It says, "Federal Opportunity Zones are designed to spurn investment in designated low income census tracks by providing substantial capital gains tax relief. This seminar is regarding learning the rules." So there is a form and a lunch buffet as well. Tickets are $20, and like I said, it's present ed by the Pennsylvania Economy League. As I mentioned during the caucus, this program is great but it's not Scranton specific . This program is part of Scranton . It's also part of Archbald , it goes up to Blakely , so it doesn't truly give Scranton a leg up over other municipalities around us who are also trying to attract businesses , who are also trying to get people to build homes. The ten-year LERTA would do that and it would be Scranton specific , so I am really looking forward to working with my colleagues , working with the mayor to see what his take is on this issue. I do think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 it's something that council should take immediate action on. January 1 is right around the corner so I'm very pleased with the caucus that we had with the Chamber. And regarding the economic development , a comment was made that we don't know what Scranton Tomorrow is doing, we had them in two weeks ago. Scranton Tomorrow is going to be coming in quarterly . The Chamber, this is I think their second or third time in this year as well. I have tried to make a policy of having them come in on a quarterly basis as well because it's important what we are doing on council , and you see that every week at our meetings , but it's also important what we are doing with our partners , partners such as the Chamber of Commerce , such as Scranton Tomorrow , and that's why I do think it's important that we continue to have those discussions at a minimum on a quarterly basis and I appreciate them having an open door policy with us for any time we have reached out with questions they have been helpful and vice versa. So we hope to continue to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 those good relationships with our economic development partners . That is all. MS. REED: 5-B.
