MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially JoAnn Mahome(phonetic }, Pat Kelly, and Jimmy Tighe. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MR. KING: I'd like to make a motion to take from the table File of Council No. 42, 2024 as amended . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 of Council No. 42, 2024 as amended and place in Seventh Order for a final vote. This ordinance is the City of Scranton operating budget for 2025. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. MINUTES OF THE BOARD OF ETHICS MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 18, 2024. 3.B. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON DECEMBER 2, 2024, REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So first off, I would like to announce that the Scranton Police Department is having a rescheduled toys for tots event at Barletta's December 6th at 5:00 on Oak Street if you would please bring an unwrapped toy. And the DJ will be Danny Kay. And then second, a friendly reminder , last week I mentioned that my family 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 is having our annual -- it's the 11th annual Cookies For Kids Cancer Fundraiser. It's a bake sale slash Sunday with Santa with ice cream. And what happens at this is we raise money. And the money goes towards less toxic treatments for poor kids with cancer because usually the treatment is the biggest struggle for these kids that have cancer. So in addition to that we -- half the proceed s go to this company that develops better research or safer research and treatments for children . But we try to pick someone in the community that we can give half to. And this year and, you know, sometimes we don't like finding someone . That's a good thing. But we found a young man who is 19. He's not a kid. But in my eyes -- 19 is still a kid that was diagnosed recently with stage four leukemia . He's from Mid Valley area. His name is Eddie Kauffman . He's a great athlete . He's struggling . So half of the proceeds that we're going to raise is -- are going to go to him and his family because they really need it. And so what's going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 happen, we have cookies preboxed by the dozen. And then we'll have like I said Sundays. We have Santa Claus. You could get your picture taken. It's free. Our Digital Communications Class is going to take the picture . Our Print Production Class is going to print the picture s and give them to you. We also have a gift certificate board where if you're familiar with that there's different certificate s in an envelope and you pay $20 and the gift inside is either $25 or more. So we'd appreciate if you could come and help us out and help this poor family out and, of course, help the little warriors that are fighting cancer. And in addition to that, I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas , you know, Happy Hanukkah , Kwanzaa , whatever you celebrate . And most of all, have a happy healthy New Year. And that is all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, I would like to thank Mr. McAndrew and his family and all the students at the CTC. I know that they've been doing this for years. And it takes a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 of time and effort. And they raise a lot of money for a great cause. So I want to thank everyone that is involved with that project . It's outstanding . And I want to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas , happy holiday , happy Kwanzaa . Whatever you celebrate , I hope everyone has a peaceful , happy, healthy holiday season. DR. ROTHCHILD : I also wanted to just wish everyone a happy holiday season since this will be our last meeting before the new year. And I hope everyone , you know, stays safe and enjoys it with their family. It's a great time of year to do great things for others just like Councilman McAndrew was doing. So I hope people take that as an inspiration . MR. SCHUSTER : I guess at this time I should say Merry Christmas to everyone out there as well, so Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. MR. SMURL: Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Scranton . First a public service announcement of my own. In this morning 's paper in the legals there were two announcements , one that the County Commissioner 's meeting was rescheduled to December 11th. That is not true. It's tomorrow December 4th at 10:00 in their conference room and that prison board was rescheduled to December 11th. That is also is not true. It is still on December 18th. I called and spoke to Pat McKenna . And he said those announcements were printed in error and there will be a correction tomorrow morning , but a lot of people may miss it so it's tomorrow if you want to go to the County Commissioner 's meeting . Also, the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are conducting their December book sale at the Marketplace at Steamtown right in front of the Crunch Gym. It started today and it runs through Saturday . So you could get some great buys. Buy children 's books as Christmas gifts or all kind of gifts. So they're there. So what is the status of the 2023 audit? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. SMURL: I have not received . MS. HODOWANITZ : Remember the one that was due on September 30th. MR. SMURL: I have not received any information . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. I didn't think you would. And what is the status of the police union's contract . It's still not on the website . MR. SMURL: Not until they compile it together . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And is DPW still in negotiations for their contract ? MR. SMURL: I believe so. MS. HODOWANITZ : Their contract expires at the end of this month. And, oh, yes, and I guess you were all very happy to see that sale of Commonwealth Health's hospital basically Regional and Moses Taylor has stopped , which means that you still are going to have taxes coming from those two institutions next year unless somebody wants to scarf them up at a fire sale, who knows. But that in a sense is good news. Does anybody got a quote for how much money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 that they will bring in in taxes next year? MR. SMURL: I thought it was 800 and some thousand for the city. MR. KING: It's about 856,000 I think. If we were to real the taxes for the full year it's around $856,000. MS. HODOWANITZ : Right. I don't think the sale that was proposed is going to be resurrected . But there may be somebody else interested . MR. KING: That money was -- that revenue was not built into -- MS. HODOWANITZ : I know. I mean, in a sense that's good news. It's like frosting on the cake now. But, you know, I mean, it's good news and bad news because the bad news is when they go for profit, their focus will change to profit rather than patient care as the newspaper pointed out very correctly . So and I am still burning up with anger right now because President Biden went back on his word that he would not pardon his son. And most especially I'm angry because I have been paying taxes since I'm 17. But apparently his son is not going to have to pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the 1.4 million dollars in taxes that he owes. That also is being forgiven . And so my recommendation to you is you give very serious consideration to renaming Biden Street Spruce Street. And I do hope that Mr. Biden doesn't have the gall to set foot in this city again. What he's done is he slapped every citizen -- taxpaying citizen in this country right in the face. I think he intended to do this all along. And as far as I'm concerned he's -- hypocrisy is beyond repair. You may disagree with me, but 1.4 million . When is last time you were forgiven your taxes? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Well, Joan stole my thunder . I was going to talk about the hospital not being sold now. I heard that on the news I think it was last week. It's good that we're still going to be collecting taxes for now. Just one other thing, I was just wondering is the Friendship House a nonprofit ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Does anybody know? They are. So they have a new building downtown , took away all the businesses on that half of block that were tax paying entities . When are we going to stop giving properties away to all of these non-profits ? Pretty soon we're not going to be collect ing any taxes from businesses . It will be all non-profits in the city. It's getting out of control . I mean, first it's the colleges and then there's hospital s and now the Friendship House. When is it going to stop? It's just unbelievable . We have to pay taxes, but all of these non-profits , I don't know how they're considered non-profits . They make millions and millions of dollars . And they get away with not paying taxes. It's just out of control . They have been doing this for years and years and years. I've said the university and all the other colleges , we get a mere pittance from them compare d to the money they make. They should be giving the city a lot more. It's just out of control . It's got to stop. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 That's all I have tonight and wish everybody a happy holidays and happy new year and we'll see you next year. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Last week I donated out 1,500 turkeys for those in need here in the City of Scranton . I was assisted with Rob Bresnahan Congress man elect, Commissioner Chris Chermak , fellow masons, vets, and employees . While I gave out and we gave out the turkeys , Gaughan and McGloin gave out a 33 percent tax increase Thanksgiving gift to the people of Lackawanna County while overlooking other issues, the University of Scranton , Marywood and other nonprofits , including the hospital that just bailed out of here. While we see this, we're all part of this community . And the whole thing is about the people that make up the community , not the few politicians . And nothing is more disturbing than sitting back and see the coward Joe Biden eliminate his son from the criminal charges that were black and white. If we are individuals , no matter who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 they are if the system wants to put the screws to you they will. I've been through it. And I know about dirty cops, dirty judges, and dirty lawyers. And I'll be glad to name every one of them anytime somebody wants to know. This is what's wrong with the system. Biden turned around. As far as I'm concerned , he's a damned coward. He walked away from the presidential race because he chickened out. Nobody in Lackawanna County or Scranton , let's be specific , would ever quit unless it was some major illness . They would stay there fighting until the day they died before they would walk away. Biden is a coward. His son is a coward. And all of those who helped eliminate this criminal empire which it is, it's a total disgrace to all of us him using, oh, Scranton , I'm from Scranton . I did this. Well, if anybody recalls Biden's one saying was everything he learned from his career he learned at 10 years old here in Scranton . So he learned here in Scranton or Lackawanna County, if you want, how to be corrupt . Isn't that a great way to say who we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 are. He influenced everybody here, yourselves, that sits there. I'm an American . I'm a vet, fellow vets that died. And that idiot stood there looking at his watch when our people came off the plan that died thanks to him and the incompetence of his Vice President Harris. And to make it even more, we had trailers parked -- and everybody knows I have the Trump trailers . I had the trailer for Harris with Tampon Tim on it with tampons sticking out his ears parked on Montage Mountain . And guess what this illustrious Vice President did. She threw me the finger coming down the road. And, of course, we gave her two back to say hello and good-bye. You're finished . This is what we got. And now we have Hunter who has zero credibility . Let's be realistic . While his brother was serving this country , he was taking his wife out and then later married him. This is integrity . Dope, women, drugs, lying about everything and the father supports it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And the reason he pardoned him because it was flowing downhill . It's going back to Joe Biden. And I could assure you, this isn't over with any stretch of the imagination . And this country should be grateful that we have Kash Patel who is going to be the head of the FBI that is going to straighten this community out. And I could assure you of that. I'm on a personal relation ship with him. Okay, we're making changes . And this whole community , this whole country should get down on their knees and be thankful that we're going to have a leader who's about the people, not about the corruption and hiding it and doing everything he did. And the last damn thing he should be worried about is that Biden didn't give a damn about our troops, our fellow vets. Trump sure as hell did. He straightened out the VA. I don't know if everybody forgot that. Our vets got treatment . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . The first thing I would like to say is Bob 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Bolus is still doing his dinner this year at St. Pat's. It's on Christmas Day, come on out. He forgot to mention that. Another thing I want to say is, you know, I'm going to wait for the new government to be installed in Washington . And I'm going send a letter to Musk and Ramaswamy if that's how you say that gentleman 's name to have an investigation of all the grant money that came into the City of Scranton in my lifetime . I really think that the federal government needs to take a good hard look at what's happened in this city in the course of my lifetime and what's happened to all of this money. You know, you ask -- you know, Mr. Smurl, I asked you to tell the residents what happened to the proceeds from the Scranton Sewer Authority . Did you ever do that? MR. SMURL: No, I did not. MR. MORGAN: And why don't you do that? Do you represent the residents of this city? Are you a legisla tor for this city? MR. SMURL: I believe so. MR. MORGAN: Are you ashamed of what's happened to that money? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. SMURL: No, I'm not. MR. MORGAN: Well, then why don't you tell the residents what happened to that money? MR. SMURL: I don't know what happened to it. MR. MORGAN: Yeah, what happened to the proceed s from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority ? MR. SMURL: I have the amounts that were paid. MR. MORGAN: What's that? MR. SMURL: I don't know everything that was paid. I have the amounts that were paid. MR. MORGAN: I think you should tell the residents what happened to every dime of that money and how much of it went into the pension fund and where that money went to. And I think that all five of the Council members should do that because the people I'm talking to in this city just can't believe their sewer and their water rates. The Sewer Authority was never put together to finance the city's debts. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 anybody as old as me knows that when we were children , we used to watch toilet paper go down the Lackawanna River, okay. But what's happened is -- and that's why the federal government needs to come in here. Look at the South Side Sport Complex . Look at all the federal money that's come in here. Look at all the bids. I've been here for 40 years now. I've watched projects get bid out. You go look at the project , right, you take a look at the materials that went into it and the manpower hours and you look at stuff and you wonder, it's not right. It's just a pay to play scheme. The residents deserve a lot better. And when you've got a Council President who takes the water slide out at Nay Aug that was probably worth a half million dollars and you have to ask yourself, the Mayor puts new people on the Rec Authority Board. Look at the rent increases coming for the Scranton Housing Authority . Look at all the corruption we're buried under, all of it. You know, when you look at Joe Biden like a previous speaker spoke, right, he sold his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 office as Vice President and flew his son all over the world collecting money. And then he went and bought the Dupont Mansion, how much was that, like, 4.5 million dollars . Here's a man that was sleep walking through the presidency because he wasn't competent from the minute they rolled him out to run. They knew that he wasn't mentally capable but they didn't care because the people wanted to keep feeding at the public trough just like this city has. And it's gone on for decades . All of my children are gone because I made sure when my children were small, they never went to the Scranton School District . I took them to Abington . I wouldn't let the things happen to my children that other people let happen here because it's just a disgrace what's happened here. And it's like the president says. We got to get rid of the Department of Education . We got to send education back to the states. We've got to get rid of the National Education Association whatever it takes. We've got to refocus this country. And you know what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the amazing thing is, the whole world is changing the way it sees the world just because Trump was elected, not just because of what's happened with the Canadian s and the Mexicans . Even the UN, freedom of speech is coming back. But, you know, Mr. Smurl, maybe if you're a legislator , you should begin to explain to the people what's happened to their sewer authority and that money and what's happened to the city with all of that grant money. And I intend to ask a lot more questions . My only other question is, if we elect another mayor, I think we need to fire the Board of Directors of ECTV and turn that channel back over to the public. And I really think we need change in the direction of this city. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . I wish everybody a happy holiday and Happy New Year. So this is your last meeting of the year. Let's see who answers questions this evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 This Council has been ineffective simply because they do not answer the right questions or they just don't listen. Tonight I'm going to talk about facts. $500,000 to a third party company from another county to inspect our pavecuts without asking how many will inspect and the number of hours dedicated weekly. That's a fact. This will not work. It's a waste of money without oversight . Our fines per day set at $100 do not get the utility companies ' attention . My recommendation , increase it to a thousand dollars for per day with our own eyes on the problem , DPW is more than capable of handling the issue without a problem -- oh, wait. It's too late, half a million dollars later, only questions and nothing done. Not one of you has instructed Mr. Voldenberg to contact utility companies about properly sealing these pavecuts with tar. You were each just as much at fault for the lame duck mayor. That's a fact. Several lawsuits , over a million dollars to Ufberg. None of these was part of the new budget.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 How are all these lawsuits paid for and settled if they were not in previous budgets ? Any comments about Mrs. Flynn's lawsuit moving forward due to burden of proof? It looks like our administration and lame duck mayor will be decimated in the process . To treat any city employee to that extreme is flat out wrong, to single out our State Senator 's mother is stupidity at its finest. That's a fact. $113,000 to hang lights and decorations at Nay Aug Park for the holiday season. It's one of many examples of poor spending by this lame duck mayor. Was that in the budget? Who approved that? I heard that there were problems with the lighting and DPW had to rectify the problem . Volunteers were available to do the same very thing for free. That's a fact. This very same Council approved substantial amount of money for marketing when it came to finding the applicant s qualified to take our Scranton Police exam. One hundred thirty took it and few were hired. Not one of you asked why our testing average is higher 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 than the company 's national average with a 7 percent pass rate. One of the most recent hires hit a tree. Not one of you questioned who it was or the story behind it. We know the story, the whole story. That's a fact. Our city looks the way it does because of -- our city looks the way it does because of the good people of Scranton trusted this lame duck mayor. Instead , we have an expansion team of out of towners with no clue how to manage anything . This is one of the main reasons we have this current climate , crime, poor roads, one pool and yet progress in 2025 from the lazy administration has -- that has lost its pieces to the puzzle with no idea what it looks like. That's a fact. And Saturday , Penn State plays Oregon Ducks. I wonder who this lame duck mayor will be rooting for. I know she will not be rooting for the good people of Scranton . That's a fact. We are the Electric City. We are stronger than one person or group of clueless people not from here. We are so deserving of someone who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 could lead our city with a vision for the betterment of the good people of Scranton . We are paying attention . We'll make our voice heard. We are ready for change. Oh, it's coming. Game on. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Greeting s members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I also would like to wish a happy holiday season for whatever you follow and whatever faith you have. May you, your family, and everyone be safe, comfortable and happy during this holiday season. At this time we're all dealing with extreme water bills. That's a fact. What hasn't been put out a lot is there's a program called H2O Help by the American Water Company . It's out there. It was advertised two or three years ago. They did a campaign on it when they were doing rates previously and let people know it was out there. But ever since then it's really not gotten a lot of information out there to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 public. H2O Help, if you're a single person whose income is under $3,137 a month or 200 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines , you could get help. What kind of help do they offer? $500 towards your water -- one time a year $500 towards your water bill and $500 towards your sewer bill. On top of that when you qualify for it, you could get a 20 to 80 percent discount on your water bill rates, your delivery , your water usage, everything . So if you are truly the poor of the poor and you hop on this program , you could see your bills drop by 80 percent after them paying your back bills off for $500 a pop. But it seems that very little is out there to actually coordinate these groups, these organizations for people in the community who desperately need them. There is no advertisement . There is no public information that they are out there. And a lot of people find out by either when they're at their last rope or they get told they just don't know about it from someone else who is using the program . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 out there. But unfortunately we don't have people to coordinate for those in need. We have homeless advisory boards that the public isn't allowed to attend who advise that they're going to do something in the future. While people suffer under the burdens of these fees, it would be nice if our local government took action to coordinate what resources are physically out there for a population in need, actually made a place where they could come together and see everything that's out there. I talked about this months beforehand in the loops by jumping between different department s because it's so isolated between NeighborWorks , public assistance , the electric company , the water company , everything is handled in different sections . And unfortunately unless you know all of the steps, there is no one out there with a road map to walk you. I'd like to congratulate you all on a three week extra holiday since you had August off, now it looks like you're having December off. Unfortunately for us even though 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 it's not on the agenda, that eliminates three weeks of the public being able to comment on things that are important to them. I understand they could contact you directly . But sometimes getting before the public body is important even if nothing is on the agenda. It serves as a place to inform the community about things such as H2O Help which are important . I talked about the food resources in the budget and the mud funds for the homeless that were $10,000 a piece that were on that list as unspent . Whether they were unspent or not, as of today, 27,111 has been spent for recycling that has been rejected and charged the higher rate by the landfill . So we've spent almost 250 percent of the entire (inaudible ) budget for food and shelter for those most in need to pay for our garbage -- our recycling to be moved from the recycling pit to the garbage . And yet nothing 's been done. By the end of this year, it will be over $3,000. Have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . I'm Rik Little from Scranton . Happy holidays . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 agree with everything that Lee Morgan said. There needs to be an accounting from the top down where the federal money goes. There really should be something in this whole municipal , county, state, government like a department of government efficiency because it's just a runaround. It's a runaround going to Matt Cartright's office, you know, complaining about the courts. The courts are in big disarray . There needs to be an accounting of the courts and this leads into what goes on. And I agree with Lee Morgan on the Electric City TV. I mean, that was a public access channel when I first came here that anybody in the community could put stuff in. But now it's taken over by the government . That has to change. And one of the things I think in the very at least ECTV should cover the board meetings of the big agencies because that's where -- that's where the information comes out. For the last five months I've been going to the Scranton Housing Authority meeting . And I'm usually like the only one there to speak, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 you know. And, you know, you speak and they give me a time limit there. You could speak for five minutes . And then they make the minutes a month later it supposedly goes to the Mayor. But these delays are crucial delays. And I was at the Scranton Housing Authority Board of Commissions meeting last night. And there's like 50 people there and they were really mad because they -- I don't know what the connection is, but there's this place called Park Towers where most of the people are on -- MR. KING: Park Gardens . MR. LITTLE: Park Gardens , thank you. And, you know, their rent's raised 25 percent . And at the meeting it was revealed that, yeah, over the last -- it's raised like four times in the recent past. That's why there has to be -- and I know from the Scranton Housing Authority they have like almost 9 million dollars playing with. But they have their thing called delinquent . And this is a setup. Most of the people who live there are -- have been -- you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 know, they don't know if they get an eviction notice, they're gone. There's a bad relationship between two judges and the people that run the Scranton Housing Authority with due process . And since the city -- the Mayor appoints the people on this board. It's basically been the same board for about 30 years. And things just have to be more efficient . I've been led down rabbit holes by Northeast Neighbor Housing . There's no housing around here, you know. And it starts at the Scranton Housing Authority . They get millions of millions of dollars . They say, oh, we'll put it into infrastructure , you know. And that's it. They only have to file with the federal government every five years, you know, and they say BS things like, oh, there's a federal inspection . There's no record of anything . And there is no record in the court in the magistrate court of all the thousands of people that have been evicted since at least 1996. I go to Matt Cartright and he goes, oh, I need a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 FOIA. You know, and then I take the FOIA up to the county and I get escorted out of the building . There has to be some sort of due process . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? If not -- MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: One comment , I think that Mr. Coyne made a good point in terms of the multitude of services that are available in this community that -- maybe I'm wrong, but they seem to happen in silos. So I was wondering if we could reach out to the administration , Mr. Voldenberg , and ask them if they could assign someone on that administrative staff who can put together a list of all of the opportunities for poor and for the citizens out there of opportunities like the program with Pennsylvania American Water Company , H2O. Is that what the -- so that program , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 but there's many others I believe that are out there that are available to the citizens of this great city. And it can be very difficult and daunting , a daunting task for those less fortunate that are struggling , many of whom don't have access to computers or just struggle to be able to gather the information that could really help them out. So I'm wondering if we could ask our administration , our Mayor if they could assign someone to put together a list of all of these programs that are available and put them in a single spot on the website or just to have that information available at City Hall so that people have the opportunity to access these programs that could truly have a major impact on their lives. So I'd appreciate if you could do that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out and report -- MR. KING: Otherwise , I wish everybody a happy holiday . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few since it is the holiday season, Nay Aug has started their light show. Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask the BA's office to ask Eileen Cipriani if she could just send an explanation of the process that was used for the city to get the contract or that's been contracted for the lights and where did those funds come from to pay that contractor ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Can we also request of the BA's office a complete document of the ARPA funds, project s, expenditures since it's -- the deadlines are this December if we could just get that full list. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I did ask a few meetings ago for an update on the next meeting for the Weston Field skate park if you could also request what the next date is for that planning meeting at the skate park at Weston Field. And then two questions that we've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 asked for two weeks in a row. We did ask what is the cost to retain the software for Rubicon . I know that should be rolling out soon. But the administration was in here for caucus I think three to four weeks ago. We asked what the price was and we didn't receive an answer. The last two weeks we've asked, but if can find out what that cost is for the software . And then last week I did ask about the Serrenti Center and if there's been any trainings for outside agencies whether they use the computer system over there or whether we just have the police department or fire department or any of the city groups have done any training s for outside agencies that would have charged a fee. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do, yes. I just have one thing that I wanted to get forwarded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 to code enforcement . It's a property I've gotten complaint s about in the past, so the blighted area around Prescott Avenue. It's on the corner of Prescott Avenue and Vine Street. And it was the old Vine Street gas station that since has been deterioration . And there are probably a few dozen tires that have shown up over there on that property . So I'm not sure if they were dumped there or what's going on. And there is often, like, different vehicles parked there. I'm not sure what's going on with that property . But if they could get over there, any quality of life violations . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have the code enforcement and DPW look into it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. I appreciate it. And it's a shame because the old Prescott bingo hall has actually been taken over. And they renovated and updated it and have made it into a community center I believe for the Indian community in the neighborhood . And it was really nice to see that building rehabbed . I think it was being used for apartments before but on either side you've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 got the one apartment building that previously had a fire that I think we're trying to sort out what to do with. And then you've got the Vine Street station on the opposite side. So it's kind of wedged in between these two blighted properties . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So every week when we sit here during Fifth Order and ask questions that Mr. Voldenberg sends onto administration . The following week we sometimes get answers or at least there's information on its way or is pending or -- so the one that bothers me the most -- so the Rubicon software cost retention . We asked this -- Mr. Schuster , I hate to correct you, but it was like four weeks ago. And we asked it multiple times. And when first asked during the budget work sessions , we were told we got that number. We'll get it to you next week. We got it. We got it. Guess 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 what, it's four weeks. We haven't got it. So please, I mean, this is beyond ridiculous . You know, they brag how great this program is working . I never believe d -- and they said, of course, we need to retain the software . But, you know, we have to approve that. So when are they going to tell us how much it's going to cost if you could, please, Mr. Voldenberg , let's get us an answer. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I know it's not you. You're waiting just as much as we are. So, like I said, so that's a question we asked last week. We ask every week. We didn't get an answer. So here's another question I asked last week about the Novembrino park. The consistency in locking this park it's -- it hasn't been going well. I mean, I constantly get complaint s that it's damaged that the gates are open that the doors are open. There's motorcycle s. There's all kinds of stuff going on in there, ripping up trees, damaging equipment . So the response I got -- you know, what's the policy? There's got to be a policy, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 you know, for all the parks to be secure and safe at night. So what I got back was the park has an employee who lock the gates at Novembrino before leaving at 6 p.m. on -- okay, that's every day supposedly . And then on weekend s, either an employee or the director or manager will lock it. The Parks Department reviewed all parks in August. I also asked about signage and clarity of it with regards to, you know, sun up, sun down, whatever , no trespass ing because I've heard different interpretations from residents . It's not clear to them. So they said in August for proper signage they took care of that supposedly. But they will review it again. And in regard to cameras , Parks, IT Department and SPD are in constant communication about safety including the camera. So I'm glad to hear all of this. Let's just hope it continues because it wasn't happening . But I think I mentioned it. And I think it was well received. I'm not sure yet. But a resident offered to lock Novembrino Park up at night in case someone forgets. This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 seems to be happening . And I guess this resident 's father in the past maybe when he was a child would lock the park which is pretty cool. So that's, you know, and it's great that this resident wants to take ownership and step up and do that for us. So let's make sure, you know, administration is aware of that and what their response will be for that. All right, if you don't mind? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And then we've had a little dialogue before school started about increasing the rate for the crossing guards. They're grossly underpaid for the amount of responsibility and first line of defense for our kids every morning , you know, and the terrible weather that, you know, that they have to deal with -- probably this Thursday morning . Yeah, this Thursday morning . So I know there's been discussion back and forth with the Scranton School District as to how they're going arrive at a decision . I know everybody up here from what I remember is in favor of it. But, Solicitor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Gilbride , do you know where them discussions are right now? Is there any movement ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : The last conversation I had with the school district was that the plan to do that was after the first of the year. The city administration and the school district were going back and forth on other issues. But there did not seem to be any holdup on providing pay increase to the crossing guards. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, we'll, check back after break. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I believe this was discussed during caucus. If I'm correct , Attorney Gilbride , this just brings our legislation in line with what's required . Is that fair to say? ATTY. GILBRIDE : That is correct . The procedures that are outline d in this ordinance are already being followed and have been for a substantial period of time by our officers . As you are all aware, the Scranton Police Department is going for certification by the police organization state wide. In order for that to occur, one of the things that must happen is that the city's ordinance must be -- must basically mimic what their procedures . So basically all we're doing is cleaning up our ordinances to make sure that they match the procedures that our police are already following . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR.

SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , last week I had asked in the backup it states that there's no cost to the city. However , in the budget there are some revenue s and there are some expenditures in regard to pave cuts. It looks as though everything is going to be reimbursed . I had some question s last week about, you know, the backup document ation indicated no cost. However , there has to be some sort of cost as money was -- is on line items. The answer I did get was that utilities are going to apply for pave cut permits. And the costs are going to be tracked through the OpenGov financial system. I understand how it's being tracked through the system. But it really didn't answer my question . But that was the answer I did receive in regards to this contract . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. SMURL: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR.

Now you move onto the question and then vote on the amendment . MR. SMURL: On the question ? All those in favor of that -- of the amendment Item 7-F signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-F as amended .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Oh, on the question , so over the years Council has done its due diligence when it comes to the budget. I didn't want that to be forgotten . Looking back over the last several budgets in 2020, 2021, 2022 Council drastic ally reduced expenditures in areas of new hires, salary increases , and at times during this period of time the Mayor even refused to sign the budget and allowed it to go into law. But savings were made and legacy costs were reduced . A tax increase were proposed for two years with proposals from the Mayor. And Council decreased those tax percent ages with the residents in mind reducing the number of hires and salary increases . Although I did not vote in the affirmative for those two budgets because it didn't appear that additional positions and salaries were being funded on the backs of -- because it did appear that the additional positions and salaries were being funded on the backs of the taxpayer . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Last year I even propose d my own budget that had no tax increase . But I would like to say that for several years Council has worked hard to reduce expenditure s and get us to the point that we're at today where no tax increase is being present ed to the city. Just to look at this budget though, in general it's being considered that it's reduced by 5.6 million dollars this year as opposed to last year. However , capital project s have been removed from the operating budget this year. And they total 5.6 million . So in reality , the budget is exactly the same as it was last year. It's about 118 million dollars if you include those capital project s. Also, something that's different with this budget is the pension contribution has been reduced by 8.6 million dollars . So there has been increase s to the budget moving forward . I would have liked to have seen this year if we take a little bit deeper of a dive, I would have liked to have seen some of those double digit salaries curtailed and because some of those people have been given large increases over the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 several years. But these things are just a small portion of the budget in totality . But I did want to make sure that the hard work of Council over the last few years and what we put into it wasn't overlooked . And it's gotten us to the point where this year we're not looking at a tax increase . That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so for the past two years I voted no for the budget. And the reason being there was a tax increase that in my mind and with my math equated to the same amount that was going to be given for new position s and large substantial raises. So there's no tax increase this year. I'm happy. All you guys are -- everybody is happy. But my recommendation regarding amendments , I mean, we finally make a couple cuts or it look like we're making cuts. We don't have to increase taxes but I still felt. And I, you know, I still feel that the department head increases should have been scaled back as they have been substantial over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 the past three years. Efforts to achieve parity with other municipalities should be incremental . There should be less. And that's not happening. So it's been a pattern , you know, in my eyes that those that are here the least have received the most. So I will be voting yes but only because I'm not going to be a hypocrite . There's no tax increase . I voted for the past two budgets that had one, but I'm going to be voting yes with reservation . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question . I'm also proud of the work that we've done on the budgets over the years and, you know, happy again that we have a balanced budget for 2025 and, you know, especially happy that there is no tax increase in there. I think over the years we have incrementally increased many of the salaries . But we're still woefully behind in many of them compared to other cities. And I think, you know, at times we had a tough time keeping people in some of those positions as a result of those salaries . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 So I do feel like many of the salary increases were warranted . And I appreciate all of the hard work that our employees put into working for the City of Scranton and for the residents . So I just wanted to make sure to thank everyone who works for the city and I'll be saying yes to this budget. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . MR. KING: On the question , this is my third budget. I voted for the two previous budgets which included tax increases . I spent a tremendous amount of time and effort went to studying that budget and trying to make reductions . I believe the first year the Mayor had asked for 3 and a half percent increase and we were able to whittle that down to 2 percent . Last year there was a request for 3 percent increase . And we got it down to 2 percent . I think it's important to note when I first started on this Council in 2022, we just came out of Act 47 after 30 years of financial distress . We've come a long way in the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 three years. We went from no credit rating whatsoever to BBB minus credit rating, refinanced a 36 million dollar bond which saved the taxpayers 2 million dollars and got our credit rating up to BBB plus. PEL had recommended as we came out of financial distress to do some incremental tax increases . I think that we've done the right thing. We've done the prudent thing. I think that we've been financially responsible and put ourselves in a position where the city is in a pretty stable financial situation now. We obviously have to keep our eye on the ball as things move forward . But I'm very proud of the work of this Council over the last few years to try to do the right things. It's never easy to have to raise or increase taxes. We increase taxes for all the citizen s. We're increasing them for ourselves. It's not something you ever enjoy having to do. But I am a believer that doing incremental tax increase s is a must in this day and age, especially in light of contractual obligations , health care costs constantly going up. We have pension obligations . So it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 is important to do some small incremental tax increases . And we've done that responsibly to the point where this year we put ourselves in a position where we could give the taxpayers a break. So I'm proud to support this zero tax increase budget this evening . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Roll call please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster .
