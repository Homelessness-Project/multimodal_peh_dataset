Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 DR. ROTHCHILD : I do have one announcement . MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. DR. ROTHCHILD : I wanted to thank Black Scranton for taking the initiative during Black History Month to hold an African flag raising that took place on Saturday at City Hall. I think that was great and something that we should certainly continue annually . And I believe they were having other events for Black History Month. One of them being at Madame Jenny's, not this weekend the following weekend . That's going to be a tribute to black women in jazz. So that's February 15th at 7:30 p.m., if anyone is interested in attending that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, just as a quick reminder of tonight 's Leadership Lackawanna Core Group fundraiser at Montage Mountain between six and nine. This is my daughter 's fundraiser, which I'm very proud of her sense of community and her civic engagement . The proceeds from tonight 's event 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 goes to build a garden maze at the Valley Community Library . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have four announcements tonight . So there are quite a few cabinet appointments on the agenda tonight as you may have noticed if you were looking over them. I requested resumes for each cabinet appointment as been made by the Mayor. The Mayor informed me yesterday that Council will have these resumes prior to the final vote. What we will do is we will put all of the resumes in Third Order prior to the final vote so it will be on next week's agenda so that the public will be able to take a look as well as Council . Second announcement , the Stevens and Lee fee agreement remains tabled simply for the fact that Council has not received it yet -- received a litigation budget. And I will be providing an update in Fifth Order tonight on the gas card audit that Council received . So we did receive an update from the Moretti firm. I know that many of you are curious about that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 And also the City Planner replied to Mrs. Reed today with a quick update on the MS4 permit. So I will be providing that as well in Fifth Order. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items and matters of general concern : Mayor Cognetti Joan Hodowanitz Fay Franus Len Srebro Patricia Nestor Les Spindler Ron Ellman David Dobrzyn Marie Schumacher Tom Coyne.) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Rogan, any motions or comments ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, just some brief 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 comment s. We discussed a little bit in our caucus and I know it's been brought up on the floor. There's a number of appointments before us tonight. Two of those by individuals who don't currently live in the City. The City Code states that a non City resident can be appointed to these positions as long as they move in within six months, which I think is a very reasonable rule. In the past, there had been instances where waivers have had to be granted . Unfortunately , one of those waivers that was granted in the past, the individual said they were going to move into the City which we know how that turned out they never did. I think this is two example s on the agenda tonight of how this rule is suppose d to work and how it's not suppose d to work. In the first example , for the Chief of Staff slash Assistant Solicitor position , the individual who is being chosen for that position currently lives in Dunmore has actually already from what I've been told signed a lease in the City of Scranton fully intends to. That's how the process is suppose d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 to work. The second appointment , Mr. Sheridan we're being told it's an acting appointment . He's not going to move into the City. But he's also not staying for six months. I don't think the Code should be interpreted that the person staying less than six months they don't have to move into the City or they don't have to get a waiver. You know if the Mayor wants this appointment, I think there should be a waiver accompanying the appointment if the individual has no intention of moving into the City. The other situation as I mentioned , completely different . That's the way this process is suppose d to work so we can attract employees outside of the City. As far as the appointment of Mr. Sheridan , he certainly seems qualified for the position . But I think it opens the door to saying, well, this is only a six month appointment . They don't have to live in the City. So again, I don't like that way of thinking . I'm going to oppose that second appointment for that reason unless a waiver is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 submitted . If a waiver comes down to accompany the legislation , then I think it's proper for us to consider that waiver. One other item I do want to bring up and I think it was Mr. Spindler brought up with the recycling . We did have a lot of back and forth with the DPW. And a lot of residents have been complaining about particularly about the paper and the cardboard . And again, it's no fault of the City and no fault of the DPW why the system is the way it is now. But again today particularly in West Scranton , I saw a number of reports on the neighborhood association page that the paper was again being thrown into garbage trucks. I know we're being told from the DPW that's not happening but I really want to stress that -- to residents the importance of recycling . And the City has a responsibility on our end too. You know, we're asking residents to do things a little bit different ly. But it's very important that the City is putting the garbage and recycling where it needs to go. I hope these reports from residents are not accurate .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 But we were told by the DPW Director and -- relayed from the DPW Director that the paper and the cardboard is going to the Recycling Center. I've heard from multiple residents particularly in West Side that that's not the case that it's being thrown in with the garbage . You know, I hope we get to the bottom of it. I'd like to send another correspondence to the DPW if everyone is in agreement just for some clarification on that. You know, when it's one or two people calling , you know, maybe they saw something wrong or heard something wrong. Like, like I said, on the West Scranton page I saw a number of people yesterday mentioning my recycling was thrown in with the garbage . So I think it's real important that we make sure that that is being handled properly even if it means we have to spend more overtime, the money being spent on overtime would be saved on landfill tipping fees. I don't know if the City has to put more DPW workers on the garbage trucks or what the solution is. But we can't be throwing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 recycling away. And that's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Rogan. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : No, I have no motions or comment s at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do have a comment in reference to what Mayor Cognetti had mentioned earlier when she was speaking . She was at the school board meeting last night as was I. And I did sit there for several hours and listen to the parents ' concerns . And it was very, very upsetting and this morning -- to know the inactions of previous administrators . And I'm happy and I commend the efforts of the current school board and administration and the superintendent for working hard to help resolve the situation in the schools and to relocate the students from Northeast Intermediate . So I just wanted to comment that I attended the meeting and I'm going to stay up-to-date on the situation . I don't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 children that are in schools . But I could only imagine if I did or if I had family that worked in the schools how upset I would be too to have them in that situation . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on some things I brought up last week. Myself and Councilman Gaughan have been asking Chief Graziano about Parrot Avenue and speed. We did get a response last week from the Chief that they're going to be putting up their speed timing signs to hopefully get some data in that area to see if we can figure out a solution to speeding over there. I also got a response from both the -- from the Controller 's Office regarding the Rainey and Rainey contract . When Rainey came in to do audit prep, I believe , '15 -- they were hired for the '15 audit. It was originally -- the bid was originally put out for four years to cover from '15 to '18. Council had amended that legislation to only cover '15 and '16. So they still did do audit prep in '17 and '18. But they didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 reach the threshold to put that out to bid. So I am trying to get what exactly the number was that was paid for those two years. And I've also been in -- or talked to Controller Murray about getting in writing some benchmarks that hopefully that Rainey could agree to. I think that's the main concern that I have. If they didn't go over the threshold for bidding that's one thing. But we keep on getting this late because there aren't benchmarks set. So I think the Controller 's Office will be working with the Administrator 's Office to hopefully get that done. And I'll keep everybody updated on that. And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few items. The first one is a gas card audit update. So as most everyone is aware, last summer there was issues with gas card usage in the City. And Council asked for a forensic audit to be accomplished . And bids went out. The Moretti firm from Old Forge was the company that was awarded the bid to do the audit. So I had asked weeks ago for an update 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 where we were with that audit. So I would like to read into the record now a response that we received Friday, January , 31st from Arthur Moretti who is the gentleman that is doing the audit: Dear Mrs. Reed, I am hereby respond ing to your letter dated January 23rd, 2020 regarding the City of Scranton gas card audit for all activity from April, 2016 through March, 2019. As requested in your letter, the following is a timeline of what has been done since receiving the contract for the examination on December 16th, 2019. The contracts were signed by me and returned as instructed by December 17th, 2019. On December 17th, I sent an e-mail to David Bulzoni to find out who I would be working with and indicated I would like to begin the engagement immediately . A copy of the e-mail is attached for your information. We made our first visit to City Hall on December 24th, 2019 and met the acting Controller , Mary Lynn Carey and her staff. Mary Lynn Carey was extremely helpful in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 helping procure some of the documents that she had access to. Because of the holiday and the new administration beginning January 2nd, 2019, I chose to take the document s I had available to me which included every gas card transaction of every individual and have been working through these documents at my office. On January 23rd, 2019, my associate and I met with the new control ler, business manager and staff. At that meeting I received additional document s and gave them an update on the status of my finding s thus far. A copy of some of the findings I had made, although my audit is not complete are attached for your convenience . This recaps our timeline so far. With regard to the progress made to date, I was asked to focus first on Fire Chief DeSarno in addition to others. We have reviewed and analyzed all of his transaction s. I will be sending the finding s on Fire Chief DeSarno to John Murray who is the Controller , Patrick Sheridan , the Business Administrator and Jessica Eskra, the City Solicitor today. I anticipate that I will be issuing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 my final report to John Murray, Patrick Sheridan , and Jessica Eskra by February 12th, 2020 providing any additional information necessary could be obtained . Please let me know if the distribution list should be expanded . Finally , please be advised that we are still on budget with the proposed costs that I provided . And our fees will not exceed the estimate . I hope this information addresses your needs. If you have any questions , need any additional information or would like to discuss in person, please do not hesitate to contact me, Arthur Moretti , CPA. The only other thing I want to mention in the backup document , there was an e-mail from Mr. Moretti sent to David Bulzoni , Jessica Eskra, Becky McMullin and Mary Lynn Carey on Monday, December 30th, 2019. Mr. Moretti says the following : Good afternoon . I hope you are all enjoying your holiday season. Let me first begin by thanking all of you for your kind assistance in providing me with some of the information needed in order for me to begin the gas car 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 audit. I understand it was difficult to get the information over the holiday since many of the key position s were off. However , there is additional document ation needed for me to be able to proceed . Items -- and this is bolded. Items eight, nine, and ten are most urgent because they relate to the Fire Chief who is leaving shortly . Number one, gas card statement s from the period October 24th, 2017 through 2019. Number two, list of all vehicles allowed to be taken home available for personal use and employees that they are assigned to. Number three, documentation executed when vehicles are assigned . Number four, list of gas cards and who they are assigned to. Number five, document ation executed when gas card are assigned. Number six, a list of all vehicle s purchased from the period January 1st, 2014 to present . Number seven, required mileage logs for vehicles available for personal use.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Number eight, W2 forms 2014 to 2018 for the Fire Chief. He says I will eventually request others. I need to determine whether taxes paid for personal use of company vehicle . Number nine, as I understand timecards and sheets are not used. I would like a summary of vacation and sick usage for the Fire Chief. Number ten, a job description or a job function or contract for the Fire Chief. He says I will require addition al information on other positions . However , with the Fire Chief leaving , his information is urgent. With regard to the Fire Chief self-audit, we have reviewed his activity from June, 2014 through October 23rd, 2017. Please note that the self-audit he has provided is insufficient and incomplete . The general rule is that the personal use of a city-owned vehicle is taxable to the employee as a fringe benefit . Personal use includes , community , local and out of town travel, errands and non official business . In reviewing his gas card 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 usage, there was suspicious activity such as filling his vehicle on the Carbondale Highway on December 26th, 2016; Labor Day, 2016 and other times. I am request ing that he redo his self-audit to justify his business use using his calendar , journal , or other written means to support his business use. I might need this information from other position s as well. It also might be helpful if he could be available to speak to me prior to January 3rd, which I understand is his last day. The Internal Revenue Service 's standard for record keeping is that there must be adequate records or sufficient evidence to support any credit or deduction claimed for business use. These records must substantiate the time, date, place, purpose and travel cost are more helpful when logged at the time the vehicle was used or shortly thereafter . Record keeping and meeting substantiation require ments is extremely important because if the employee doesn't do his own substantiation or meet the requirements , he is presume d to have driven the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 car for his own use and that value must be considered for income tax purposes . Again, I appreciate your assistance . Should you have questions or require further clarification , please call me. So that is the update on the gas card audit. In terms of the Licensing and Inspections ' assessment , I think I brought this up two or three weeks ago. I had asked Mrs. Reed to reach out to the company , Barry Isett because it was my understanding in talking to Mr. Oleski the assessment had not even been started yet. We had come to find out that the contract with Isett for the LIPS Department assessment was never executed by the City to date. The contract is currently being reviewed last -- Council was informed . But the previous Business Administration had never signed the contract . So, Mrs. Reed, if we can ask, you know, where we are in that process I would appreciate it. You know, as has been detailed here in the past, the Licensing and Inspections Department assessment was really -- I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 really important and apparently the contract was never signed. So -- and that's the way it was left with us Tuesday -- yeah, Tuesday , January 28th. So again, I don't know how it couldn't have been signed but we'll wait for another update on that. In terms of the MS4 permit update, Mrs. Reed talked to Mr. King our City Planner today. The City applied for the MS4 permit in May of 2019. In August, the City was in contact with DEP regarding finishing up with supplying them with the pollution reduction plan. The City to date has not received an official report from the DEP regarding the October inspection . Mr. King would like us to keep in mind that DEP has 80 to 90 communities that are going through this exact same process . The City's current permit stays valid until they are issued a new one. The new permit is good for five years once issued. Mr. King is going to speak to the Mayor to provide her an update. And once he has, he will coordinate with coming before Council for a caucus to provide further 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 update and information . And again, as I had requested along with the company that's doing the stormwater analysis because I think that's also important . Let's see what else. The issues with -- that Mrs. Nestor brought up with the Penn Ridge Complex , Mrs. Reed, if we can reach out to the administration , OECD, the Mayor's office and just find out if that is on their radar to put grant money into that and what their plans are for that complex . And then, Mrs. Nestor, so there -- if you want to -- are going to stay to the end of meeting it should be over soon. If you want to leave your e-mail or contact information we'll update you on that and we'll update the public. Because as I said, I do think that that is important . In terms of the sound issues in Council Chambers it was again -- and I don't know if it was because they weren't exactly speaking into the mic like this. It could have been that. But it is difficult to hear. And I talked to Mrs. Reed who is going to be in contact with the person that is in charge of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the sound system in these chambers . It has to be fixed. I don't know what that entails, you know, what the cost is going to be to that. But I would like to see it fixed. We were told that it could be something with the speakers facing this way instead of this way, which apparently that would make more sense. But again, we'll let the professionals take a look at that and get a cost on that. Also, in the caucus we had about five minutes . I briefly mentioned that next week I'll make a motion that Council sends a letter to Mr. Basalyga of Steamtown 300 for an update on the Electric City Garage improvements . We had NDC in here a week ago. And I was not pleased to find that, you know, the Electric City Garage, we're moving at a snail's pace is the long and short of it. So I think we need -- you know, I read Mr. Basalyga 's quotes in the paper. I think we need more information than that. To me, it's not good enough of a reason to be this far behind nearly four years later. And remember that the garage was sold 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 for a dollar. The Parking Authority put up nearly 3 million dollars for improvements. So there needs to be a better answer than that in my mind. Also we were informed today that in terms of a court date for the City LST tax approval , that is going to be set for February 19th, 2020. And that is all I have. MS. REED: 5-B.
