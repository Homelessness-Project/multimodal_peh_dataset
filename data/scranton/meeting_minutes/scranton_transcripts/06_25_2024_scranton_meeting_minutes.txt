VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON FIREFIGHTERS PENSION COMMISSION MEETING HELD MAY 15, 2024.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 3.B. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY THE CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED JUNE 20, 2024, FOR JUNE 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Just one comment , in 3-B when we're taking a look at overtime just to put on everyone 's radar, the overtime budget for Parks and Rec is at 83 percent . It is June. And it's the second highest month right now about $8,000 was spent on overtime in June. The highest month this year was January with 9,000. But I could see those prices rising in the summer because we're going to be doing more park work. But just so everyone realize s we're at 83 percent of that overtime in budget. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: Just a reminder , I know this weekend is the Flower Show up at Nay Aug Park. I believe it's Saturday , June 29th. So that's usually been pretty good -- pretty good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 event, a lot of people, a lot of kids. There's a lot of activities along with lots of flowers and plants for sale. And I believe Norma has said that the Everhart Museum is involved this year. They're going to have some activities in the museum. So I encourage people to get out and enjoy the Northeast Flower Show -- Electric City Flower Show this weekend . MR. SCHUSTER : And then I have one announcement , so everybody knows there is a meeting to discuss the Meadow Brook Flood Protection that's going to be held tomorrow on Wednesday , June 26th at 5:30 p.m. It's going to be held at the Holy Rosary Center at 300 West Market Street. So they are going to discuss that Meadow Brook Flood Project . MR. MCANDREW : I just have a quick one. I know we just did a moment of silence . But for the past week, I can't get out of my mind the horrific and brutal murders and rapes that have happened to young ladies throughout the country . And, you know, as Chairman of Public Safety, I'm afraid that, you know, these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 illegal aliens that are causing these horrific crimes that it's an element that I'm afraid that might get here. And we just have to be aware of that and my heart and soul and prayers go out to the victims and their families . That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I have one. Tomorrow , South Side Residents Neighborhood Association meeting is at 6:30 p.m. We are having it at 509 Cedar Avenue. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Last week I was asking questions about what actions the city might be taking with regard to the homeless population because of the heat wave that we had for nearly a week. And I asked for it to be brought up in Fifth Order, but I think it got overtaken by other issues. So I want to talk about it now. It was a brutal, brutal heat wave. I don't know about you, but it was bad. And even though we have measures during the winter Code Blue, for example , to protect our homeless , do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 we do anything for them when there's these terrible heat waves because I have a feeling that we're going to see more 90 degree temperatures before the summer is through . MR. SMURL: Joan, I believe there's a -- I don't know if it was Code Red. I believe there was something else going on. I forgot about checking into it further . I don't know if anybody else -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I think it's something -- maybe you, Mr. McAndrew , because you're public safety, you know, see if, you know, there is anything specific that the city is doing. MR. MCANDREW : I do recall last year a Code Red was issued for that for, you know, days that were over 95 or considered a heat wave. And there was room made available for them. But is that happening this year, I'm not aware of. We could definitely look into it. MS. HODOWANITZ : I don't know, you know, in conjunction with maybe schedule d patrolling that the police do maybe kind of check to see what's going on. But with regard to that, there were also some news reports on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 WNEP about remember that the only pool at Weston Park was closed that one day. I think it was Thursday because suppose dly because it had to be closed to be cleaned and then it opened the next day. And they showed people swimming in the gorge. And for those of us who lived in Scranton for many decades know the reputation the gorge has. It's extremely dangerous . But, you know, this is the corner we painted ourselves into by having only one pool available whether it's open or not. And, you know, somebody said, well, they could always go to the splash pad. Most high school student s and young adults are not going to go to a splash pad. And on the other hand, we don't want to do anything to encourage dangerous behavior like going to the gorge, don't need another story on, you know, somebody getting killed and drowned out there or a first responder getting hurt rescuing them. So I hope this puts into perspective the kind of emphasis we need to put on number one, keeping the pool at Weston Park open; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 number two, having adult supervision down there because of the recent history of fights and, you know, people getting hurt down there or killed as the case may be. And I know that the police department have a lot of things on their agenda. But it bothers me that this is June 25th and we have the rest of the summer to go. And if it's been this hot this early in the season and, you know, we're going to be seeing I think many more days 90 or above. And I just -- I don't know. I think, you know, government exists primarily to protect and serve its citizens for things that they cannot do for themselves. And, you know, our children are going to that pool at Weston Park. They don't need to see fights or get involved in fights. We certainly don't want them encouraged to go to Nay Aug gorge. I mean, they are young and stupid. They do not understand that you jump into that thing, you may not come back up to the surface . And I've been around long enough to have memories of it happening more than once. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 So I just -- I have a bad feeling about this. And I wish that the city would put some kind of priority on this to at least keep Weston Park's pool open, supervise it; and, you know, make reasonable efforts to make sure people are not using the gorge in lieu of other options . This is what happens when we don't have a pool at Nay Aug Park. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Mr. Voldenberg , would you look into see what, if anything , the City of Scranton is doing during the heat waves for homeless people if we have something ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . To piggyback on what Joan said, in William sport I forget what building they use, but they had a building down there they use it as a cooling station . It was on the news on Channel 16. People could come in and get water or something to eat or just get something out of the heat. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 But we didn't have anything here. That's ridiculous . The city decides we don't take care of people that are disadvantaged . Another thing about the pool, I had a swimming pool for years. You people okayed Mr. Gassenmeyer who doesn't live in the city. You people gave him the job. He's unqualified . There's no reason why that pool should have been closed last Thursday . There is unqualified people taking care of it. It's not that hard to take care of a swimming pool. Oh, we have hundreds of people there -- I'll bet you that was a lie. I bet you there wasn't hundreds of people there. I don't care how many people you had. They should have had the right chemical s in there. It should be tested every single day. There is no excuse why that pool should have been closed. It's ridiculous that we have one pool in a city this size. It's just outrageous . It's taken so long for the one up Nay Aug to get fixed. That never should have been shut down. This city is just poorly run. And I don't know what the solution is going to be. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Well, I know what the solution is. We need a new Mayor and a whole new administration because this is just ridiculous . There shouldn 't be people living out of the city working in the city. But three of you people up there voted to let him work here. He's unqualified for the job. Moving on, the famous hole on Dorothy Street still not filled. I was there two weeks ago. They filled it in once. It settled again. That's three weeks now it hasn't been refilled. It wasn't done right in the beginning . It shouldn 't keep settling the way it is. Next, I'm glad to see it the last two weeks in the Sunday paper that Pennsylvania American Water is going to clean the sediment out of Roaring Brook. It's going to cost them $300,000 so DEP isn't fining them. That's outrageous . That should have been fined. They are the ones who were at fault for letting all that sediment go. And just because they have to pay $300,000 they're not getting fined? What happens if it happens again? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 They should have been fined a million dollars or more. Three hundred thousand dollars -- it's their fault. They should be spending money to clean it up. They got away with murder. It's unbelievable . They want to charge us outrageous rates and $300,000 is nothing to them. They should have been fined. Lastly, some people that come here they ask me when my daughter is wrestling local. Well, I wasn't here last week. She wrestled at Vidoo Brewery on Washington Avenue last Sunday night. That's a small place. But anyway, July 14th she's wrestling at the Throop Civic Center on 500 Sanderson Street in Throop. It's going to be a good show. The company she works for, it's called Smash Master Wrasslin . And most of the wrestlers in that company are from the 570 area code, hence the shirt I have on. And some of them are from out of town. Most of them are local people. The show on July 14th is going to be a really good show. It's their second anniversary show and it's going to be really good. It's $20. And it's worth it. These people put on a good show. And they risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 injury as, like, I -- as witnessed of my daughter breaking her collarbone a year and a half ago. So, yeah, if anybody could make it, it's Throop Civic Center, 500 Sanderson Street in Throop at 2 in the afternoon . So that's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , will you ask DPW if they will revisit Dorothy Street? This time find out if it is a utility cut. And if it is, why does it keep sinking . I don't want to just keep filling a hole. MR. VOLDENBERG : I understand . I will. MR. SMURL: I don't know if maybe it's a washout or something underneath it. Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Again, I'm not a happy camper tonight . There's an old saying that we all probably heard of. Don't wake a sleeping dog. Well, after 20 years of pure hell from two sick and demented neighbors , they finally woke me up. Like I've said last week, you can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 imagine what's it's like. I must have 50 pictures of adversity that went on over the years. Anyway, somehow they found somebody stupid enough that works for the city to drop everything and take a letter and then brag about how influential this woman is. That lets you know the caliber of people that I've been dealing with. I'm going to just say this one time to the Code Enforcement . I want them to immediately void and evaluate these ridiculous allegation s that they sent me the letter about threatening to take my home over absolutely pure nonsense . This woman like I said last week, has completely -- she has just gone outside the realm of her position . I'm the last one in the world that would want to fire somebody between Oleski and this woman, this department just stinks. People have come up here for a year or two complaining about everything . Nothing 's done just like everything else around town. I'm not threatening . I have a -- I've talked to a real estate attorney and a legal attorney for the bank. So to avoid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 anything else, let's just start over again. I don't want to get somebody fired. But this department needs -- it needs a new head. I don't know why Oleski got the job when Jack Liptai had been there for years. They take someone that's Mr. Fix it in his backyard and give him a position he knew nothing about. But that's done and over with. One thing I'll say for the man, I've never seen him ask for a consultant like every inch of this city every time you turn around somebody needs a consultant . That's the people that ought to be fired by you guys. Well, I'll let that go. It's enough. I do have a question though for Council . Is there a new position that I don't know about, a garbage czar? Last night I parked my car on the other side of the street. And about 10:00 a neighbor come and inspected my garbage and, I mean, he went to town looking . He looked like a damn fool to me out there looking at my garbage . But Rose gives him the benefit of the doubt saying maybe he's a looking for antiques . But lightening hit my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 house -- my tree in my yard Saturday night just before Svengoolie was on and I didn't see the end of it. Unless something like that happens , you can't imagine all the problems . The tree fell down and knocked the power lines down. It was on the street. Cars couldn't go by or nothing . Fire truck was there all night. And then you tried to find somebody Sunday to come do something . The electric company has no number for an emergency . The gas company has numbers . Whoever heard of the electric company -- there's no number whatsoever if you need help. What about seniors and low income people that have to deal with something like this? It's a hell of an expense . It cost $1,200 for the electrician . And he's not through . To cut the tree down and remove it was $1,800. And that's going -- you have to get somebody that's up to code that you people allow. I could have gotten a neighbor to do everything next to nothing . The boys from Portugal , but they're not licensed or anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: You know, real quick, there ought to be some kind of assistance and help for seniors and low income for an emergency like this to prepare them. Thank you so much. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , will you check with Licensing and Inspection and this has been going on for many weeks now and find out are there any violations on Mr. Elman's property or what they are, anything that we could do to help fix this if there's something wrong. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll investigate . MR. SMURL: Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Council , you were very adamant to establishing a curfew for out of control youth. Do you know a youth can get on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram and organize groups of youths in minutes to a certain location ? A curfew is a deterrent to be used at the officer 's discretion . You would think that the current city government would give the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 police officer every tool they deserve as a deterrent to keep everybody safe and to be able to enforce law and order. But Miss Betsy Smith, National Police Association President said it best. "If you have a mayor and a city council who don't want the children to face any consequences , then you will have to live with the fact that these young people like many of these street gang members will continue to wreak havoc in your neighborhood s and for our police department ." By the way, the city of Wilkes-Barre is 20 miles to the south. They have a curfew. I know you guys might have to do a little bit of work to look at it but might be worth looking into. Summer just started . Are we ready? Do we have a list of the storm drain, the ownership yet between the city and Pennsylvania American Water Company ? MR. MCANDREW : No, they're still working on it. MR. ARGENTA : The storm drains are atrocious after the storm. You may want to look into having those cleaned. Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I did take a look at some of the issues involved with the curfew. And I do understand them. Some cities are reluctant to put them into effect just because the police department does not want to be babysitters . Some of them don't want the responsibility of it. And looking at the laws when it talked about tortious actions -- actions out of tort, that entire section was based off of fining them for criminal actions . I think part of what this group was looking for not a criminal action against the juvenile s but a civil action, a civil fine that a civil fine could be put in place which is not under that section because it is not out of a criminal incident that would allow the police to actually act on that and take responsibility . I understand we don't have any centers for storing them like other cities do. That might be something to look into. As of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 having to store them for a certain period of time, it's true down in Baltimore they actually have the center for juvenile s that have been picked up open to 4 a.m. in the morning . If they cannot get a responsible parent after a curfew is over and it goes past midnight , they start actions against the parent and investigating for child neglect because a 14 year old should not be out at 1:00 in the morning partying on any day. There's a point where letting juveniles roam on the street without protection at all at any time of the night is negligence , both for the parents and for the city. As of the police getting maybe charged because of they become a babysitters of them, police have immunity . Police have qualified immunity when they're operating under the auspices of their job. It's not going to happen. The liability just is not there for that. But there is an issue of where to put them and that needs to be looked at. I think it's a tool that is valuable for the city to have just to keep the juveniles off the street at 1, 2:00 in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 the morning , because without that, there is nothing we could do. I understand for those who are 16, 17 who might be starting on the edge of it, we're not a stop and ID state. So if a cop goes up to them and asks them and they just refuse to answer, a cop can't assume they're underage and they could just walk away and just not answer the police officer . But we're talking about juveniles who are 12, 13, 14 who are obviously underage and shouldn 't be out at 1:00 in the morning getting drunk in front of a store. Moving on, I don't know if you've gotten the notice that the electric company has a rate increase lined up for upgrading their funds and infrastructure . They're looking for an increase from 5 to 9 percent in that section of the bill. Have we've gotten any information back on our Scranton shootability survey from our company that we hired to deal with the situation yet? The gorge, I understand we don't like it. But over on average there is two injuries or fatalities a year over time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 In the last few months we've had five deaths right on our streets. So swimming in the gorge or getting shot, it's actually more dangerous to walk on the street of Scranton than it is to dive off the cliffs on the gorge statistically speaking . The financial interest forms are up there. Thank you for getting them up online. Does anyone actually review them? One was dated received after -- one was dated that was actually signed and dated after it was received . Some have no address on them. Some list no position . A few were late. By Section F, the penalties that are suppose d to be implied are $25 a day with a maximum of $250 for being late on those forms. Do we actually ever impose those fines? And I know for years we haven't even touched those because two years ago me and Joan pushed for that with the Ethics Committee because they just weren't out there. Block 10 of the form direct or indirect sources of income. Specifically in that form is spouses . It seems that no one in the City of Scranton has a working spouse 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 anywhere to be listed on that form. The only reason I bring that is up because in the Planning Commission I had to call up one of the members who was voting because he had a conflict of interest because of his wife. So it's important that those forms are filled out properly . And I just don't think -- they're signed, put in a drawer and no one actually reviews them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rik Little from the City of Scranton . The homeless situation is a problem . I look at what concern ed citizens are doing around the community and using the police to move tents and things like that. I say that the problem is much more stealth . And as I said before, it has to do with the agencies that start with the word housing like Scranton Housing Authority . Everybody that works there in my research has what is called by what they are Scranton Housing Authority , a federal authority . They are agents of the state and they have qualified immunity . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And that's a tough thing to get around especial ly when they have things like the agency of -- Area Agency on Aging in their pocket and all the legal entities . I go to the legal entities , Northeast Penn Legal and Lackawanna Pro Bono. They don't even now what -- they don't know what -- the legal devices are for to fight this qualified immunity . Now I lived in Adams High Rise for 14 years. They confiscated my stuff until I was finally evicted . I'm put through in the Court system. Just reading all the Court system rules, you know, they have local rules. Oh, we can't, you know, if you raise something and it isn't in our law library , you have to provide it. I mean, I did all of that. But the fact of the matter is there is no federal law library . They took all the books out of Lackawanna County. And they closed the law library in the Federal Courthouse . So it's all -- the importance is judges, you know, people don't realize that a big number of judges are in the pocket of these housing controlling people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 And now because they are just plugging new people into all of these position s. They're doing it at Area Agency on Aging, you know, and it's key that this is where the federal money comes into the county. And so they switched charters . It used to be -- I forget his name. He was the head of health and human services for the county. But they farm it out to nameless , faceless other places. And most importantly it's the American Rescue Act money, which comes through the county. It came through ERAP. And they clunk it all. And Scranton Housing Authority is so built up and they're a 5013C. They are suppose d to be a nonprofit . Yet they get millions and millions of dollars and they get the money and it's suppose d to be for housing . And everybody just -- oh, we put the money into infrastructure . We're fixing the buildings , you know. There is no -- there's nobody looking into, you know, just how much except for the big dollar amount, you know, it's like over 200 million dollars they're putting into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 housing . And then they say they are putting it into infrastructure . And then they are evicting people like me based on this person that they put in as the manager through their lease. They don't even look at the lease document . None of the judges look at the lease document because they're used to doing this for, like, 28 years. And there's no accountability in the courts. So if we're going to vote, look at the judges we're voting for. This is all important . Thanks. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm here to talk about our current climate , climate in the City of Scranton . This is not the city that I grew up in. This is not the city that I remember . The city I remember had community pools growing up, lots of memories to be shared. Those are gone now. We had an administration for 12 years, found a way to budget, run pools, recreation , seven pools throughout our community that service families , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 children growing up, allowed to have memories , didn't raise taxes once in 12 years. Distress ed status, remarkable . This administration cannot even keep one pool open, one pool maintained on a daily basis. Connell Park does not have water in it. So for people from South Side if they want to enjoy, relax in a pool, they have to go up to North Scranton . It's not fair. It really isn't. It's not fair to single parents raising children that want to enjoy the summer. They get off for the summer. They want to relax. But you don't see that. What you see is an administration just doesn't act properly , does not become proactive for situations . It's just reactive. I guess it's easier to put dirt in two pools and leave them set aside for five years. Where's the memories in that? You know, every time we take something away, those children suffer. I asked this Council for the last two weeks, it's very important that this body do the right things. This next election locally it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 very, very important . Our current climate to the city, to our first respond ers, our police officers , our firefighter , ambulance , it's very important . When you see calls like this go out on a daily basis, some that we don't even know about it becomes a concern . It's even more concerning is the fact when it involves children under the age of 18. We've talked about a curfew for weeks, for months. I've talked about a public safety director eight months ago, ten months ago. It falls on deaf ears. What also falls on deaf ears is the current climate based upon how our Mayor acts. You know, we had five deaths this year unwanted and, you know, that's not our city. For her to not even address that, not even to address our children that get put in harm's way, families not even able to go on their porch because they're concerned because of the current climate. Well, to me that's not the city that I recall. I remember seven pools. I remember biking up to Nay Aug Park enjoying the day, jumping off the high dive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 sharing memories with kids in the area and the kids that you grew up with and kids that you got to know. This climate is a lot different . I don't see how Wilkes-Barre could institute a curfew for us to not even consider it to put a 14-year-old female in front of Turkey Hill in West Scranton on North Main Avenue into a precarious position because her parents were not around drinking , passed out isn't a good situation . All right. Our climate is not a good situation because kids do not make the choices that we made when we were younger . As we take things away, the situation becomes more dire. The police department has taken guns off the streets , drugs off the streets from minors. The least we could do is to have a curfew as a deterrent , a 15 year old from Forty Fort is missing for six days. Do you know what time she left, Mr. Smurl, 1:00 in the morning . I don't know about you, I was raised well. I'm sure you were too. I had a loving mother, single parent raised me when I was five. My brother was almost two and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 a half, raised a strong -- Mr. King knew her very well, 5'1 and 3 quarter , very strong woman. Unfortunately you know what happens now a days. We need to be strong for them. This railway is coming through . This is very important to the City of Scranton . It's very important to our future. And as far as I'm concerned , if one Mayor could walk around with us for 12 years and not raise pools -- not raise taxes and have seven pools open, can you imagine what somebody can do with two of these? I can. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just briefly , I had a concerned citizen reach out to me about 723 River Street. There was overgrown grass and shrubs in addition to an uncovered and stagnant water above-ground pool. City Code Enforcement placed a door tag on the property June 14th followed by a citation for $200 today. It was already mentioned that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 statements of financial interest are up on the website . So I appreciate getting that done. I mentioned a few things here in caucus. I want to get an update on the Lackawanna Avenue wall project as to when that's going to get started as well as concerns about drains throughout the city. And also I understand that PennDOT is going to repair the barrels that are busted off of the -- I guess as you're exiting the city, Pittston Avenue and the entrance to 81, those barrels are all busted. So it's my understanding that that's on their agenda to get addressed , correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . Their contractor Pennline was assigned and they're behind schedule . So I'll follow up. MR. KING: Thank you. That's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I got an answer back from a question I asked last week. Last week I asked about if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 administration and Reilly Associates could give an update regarding pave cuts permits and violations regarding the current pave cut process if any fines have been levied for cuts that weren't up to our ordinance . And the answer I got back was that the city is currently reviewing and improving the pave cut process and will discuss with Council once a new plan is complete . We could set up a caucus in the near future. So they're looking to set up a caucus in the near future. I just want to state that I came onto Council in April of 2020. And by the summer of 2020 within three months I was meeting with Tom Preambo and current pave cut inspector at that point in time. They were working on a process at that point. We're going on four years now. There's been a lot of turnover in both of those positions . We current ly do not have a DPW Director . We currently do not have a pave cut inspector . So I'm really interested to see what this process is going to be and still waiting on 2023 and 2024 line items. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 check on that. I know it wasn't spelled out specifically in our budget in 2023 and 2024. But if we could just get their estimates on line items on what they thought the revenues would be for those years. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I received a phone call from a resident in the city that wanted to express gratitude towards DPW and Lou for the work that was done at Chick Feldman Field. They were happy about a quick cleanup . I guess some trees had fell and they wanted to express their gratitude for that. I would also like to express my gratitude . I got a call today from some resident s that were out of town over the weekend . They didn't realize that trees had fell. They actually came from a drainage ditch in West Mountain and fell from the drainage ditch onto the property . But the DPW dispatch was great with getting that out and Dennis came out to the site. Many of the resident s did chainsaw the trees and move them off of the road, but thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 you for DPW for that. I know we have a storm coming tomorrow and I think they're going to come out to get -- remove those trees out of those drainage ditches so the water could flow freely before those storms. With that being said, with the last few storms I have gotten some concern s from Keyser Valley. So if it's possible , I know that Mayor had discussed possibly Reilly Associates or someone , you know, giving some updates to the Keyser Valley resident s. Being that we're having a meeting for the Meadow Brook Project this week if we could look to see if we could get some kind of a meeting together possibly with the North Scranton and Keyser Valley resident s to, you know, get an update on what work is going to be done and the status and updates on the West Mountain study. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. When it comes to DPW, we did have some questions two weeks ago about the current director and the vacancy there. The Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 stated in the paper that we had someone that would operate the day-to-day. We found out it's not an interim director . It's not an acting director , but someone managing the day to day. So with that being said, I have a question . Who is making management decisions and making approvals per the Department of Public Works when it comes to major decision s and expenditure s if we could ask that question . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also, can we find out is the recycling coordinator position , is that also vacant at this point in time? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe it is. I'll find out. MR. SCHUSTER : That you. That would be Chris Smith? MR. VOLDENBERG : It was, yes, so it's vacant. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few that I'll make quickly . First of all, I'm not sure if Council man King brought up we had discussed this in caucus about cleaning of the storm drains. And so I wanted to make sure that DPW was aware along Mulberry Street at almost every intersection after the University , so after North Webster going up, all the storm drains are filled. And I know that we had the storm over the weekend and that could have caused some of it. But there's tons of garbage and they really need to be cleared out for them to be working properly with the water draining . So I'd like DPW to get out to Mulberry Street and to go along those intersection s and clean them, please. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And with regards to the Code Red, I know that I mention ed a few weeks ago it was part of the Unsheltered Task Force meeting that we had that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 we did have a discussion about having a Code Red shelter . However , I don't know what resulted from that conversation if they made plans to open one or not. But it certainly would come in handy for this past week in the heat storm. So hopefully for the next one -- for the next heat wave we'll be able to have that. I think it's very important that we do. And another Council member had mention ed about the response we received on the pave cuts. And I had also received further responses on Myrtle Street. I still would really like to meet with the city engineer and find out what we need to do, is the city going to look forward to being able to have maybe the Mayor and the BA come in for a caucus to explain further about our plans for pave cuts. But I'm still hopeful that we can have those meeting s prior to that point because they are, like, the utility companies are doing work throughout the city over the summer months and we want to make sure that things are done properly so when it comes time for the winter, our roads are not falling apart. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 And one more thing on the pool closure that had happened . I don't know the exact details about why the pool closure had happened . But I work in a facility that has a pool. And I could tell you even checking different chemicals three times a day that things can fluctuate very easy. And we occasionally have to close our pool to patients for a variety of reasons . And you never know when something is going to go wrong with a pool. And that's why a lot of people dislike having a pool or don't want a pool even in their own yards because of what could happen. And there's a lot of maintenance required. I was even up at McDade Park over the weekend . And the splash pad is open but the pool was closed there too. So it's unfortunate that it happens when there's a lot of -- when it's very hot out. And it would be really nice to have as many pools as possible open. But I think being closed for one day, I don't think it's as much of a concern as much of the aging pools that we have. But I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 look forward to when we could finally get the pool at Nay Aug back. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I got feedback from a question I posed last week. So I think most of you are aware that the new red recycling containers had a huge error on it. It had everything collectible except paper on it. So it was an error. And the answer I got was the city is aware of an error on the red recycling bins. We are affixing decals that will cover up the erroneous information . So I don't know how that's going to happen or when or if they're going to mail decals because I think a lot of them have been picked up already . I know I got mine. So, I don't know, we'll have to see what happens there. And I want to echo Mr. Schuster 's comments about DPW. They did a fantastic job related to the weather . But they're always on the spot. But I do know that there is some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 areas of the city that they weren't able to get to. And it's not because of them not wanting to do it or not being able to get to it, but it's because there's no direction of overtime . You know, we all scrutinize overtime up here. It's part of our job. But when, you know, resident s pay a lot of money, pay a lot of taxes. And sometimes overtime is warranted , an act of God is a good example when there's something , you know, horrific crime in the city, of course, we're okay with the police and the first respond ers' overtime. So this is an event that, you know, we should be okay with the overtime . Tighten your belt later on. But like I said, DPW did a fantastic job. But they could only do what they're directed to do. And I too would like to know who's running the show over there, you know, we're told there's, you know, the paper report that there was an acting DPW Director and that's not true because we asked about it because resident s are asking us. They're like, hey, what's going on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 here? So I'd like to know who's making these decisions and, like I said, this is no shot at DPW. They do a fantastic job. But sometimes overtime is warranted because , like I said, a few have people reached out to me in these areas of the city that haven't been addressed yet but no fault of their own. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few, 1600 block of Mulberry Street there is a Mercedes automobile there, no inspection. And it's been there I've been told it was turned in June 24th to 311 for the police department to look at, no inspection and the tires are flat. The 1800 block of North Washington Avenue, we have sent Code Enforcement to visit that for the former school building and the grounds , a lot of high grass and additional overgrown shrubbery and trees along North Washington Avenue and along Electric Street. 2300 block of Jackson Street, the West Scranton Falcons Football field property request Parks and Rec and Code Enforcement to review the damage to the stairs on the building 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 of that and if we could get it repaired. 1730 Dixon Avenue, neighbors complained that the new sidewalks placed by the senior living complex have a high drop-off at one end of the property . So we'll send Code Enforcement out to review that. 1604 Pittston Avenue, this has been on for many years. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask when we plan on doing this? The sidewalk is caving in. There's barricades . There's tape. And it's got probably about a 5 foot drop-off. I have four pictures that I sent to you if we could find out what our plans are for that. Also, the corner of Duncan Street and Cedar Avenue, there is currently work going on on the lot there. A lot of debris has fallen down onto the telephone pole and onto the stop sign and it's blocking the sidewalk , also included pictures with that. 401 Davis Street, that there is just a small white building that's been there as long as I could remember . I'll also send picture s of that. But it's now overgrown and then the front porch is falling off now. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 now it is a safety hazard. So we need to know are we going to do something about that before it falls. Another structure , 639-631 Alder Street. It's a three-story staircase falling off the back of the building . I included picture s. You could see there is no support left. And it's not -- it's when it's going to fall and it's going to be soon. So if we could get there and I don't know what we can as a city do about it, but that's going to fall and that's a huge staircase . And the corner of Prospect and Maple Avenue garbage again. This is fifth time this year I'm asking about that. I don't know if the homeowners are paying the quality of life citations because I see them there and then they disappear . But they don't seem to be concerned . So I want to know, you know, are they paying this or is this at the magistrate 's office. Also, at Weston Field the demolition and construction has begun down there. The Weston pool, naturally everyone knows last year it was beyond repair. The filtration system 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 was completely rotted out. We went down and looked at it. And we actually had volunteers last year come in and do welding on that system just to help the kids get through last year. So there was no way we could have opened that pool this year. But that is on its way down. The bathroom houses are down and so is that old garage that Parks and Rec use for their equipment . All of that equipment now is up at the Serrenti Center. And that's where it will be stored until we could find a way to get them into a building to store all their equipment . And one last thing, Mr. Voldenberg . Pioneer Construction , I know this has been going on for a very long time. But on the corner of Lackawanna Avenue and Wyoming Avenue, the construction is complete d there. But it's just a big open pit now. Can we ask -- Pioneer Trucks were there. We have barricades . But are they going to replace the sidewalks that are concrete ? I don't want them replaced with blacktop. The code said concrete . We need the concrete sidewalk s back, the concrete curbs back. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 they need to level that back out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to the water company management who will in turn reach out to Pioneer and get it completed . MR. SMURL: All right. If the water company gives you an answer, would you please let us know? MR. VOLDENBERG : They will. I'll find out tomorrow . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
