MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Here. The purpose of today's meeting is to conduct interviews for the vacant City Council seat that was vacated when Councilman Evans was appointed to become Mayor Evans. So we're going to follow the same process we followed when we filled the vacant mayoral position . We're going to have interviews , a few questions and then Council will take a recess in executive session to debate the merits of the candidates and hopefully have a decision today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 ( Jay Walsh ) MR. ROGAN: Mr. Walsh, before we begin, one quick question . Same startup question when we had the mayoral appointments . Are you a resident of the City of Scranton . MR. WALSH: I am. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. WALSH: Excuse me? MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. WALSH: Okay. My name is Jay Walsh, resident of Scranton . I'd like to lead off with the Lord's prayer. Our father who art in heaven, hallow it be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Now, I'm going to speak on the fact that I'm still into a forensic audit for the City as also for the county, the state and the federal government . That's not the -- that's my work outside of City Hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 I'd like to touch on collective capitalism which floats all boats. It's a concept that was developed after World War II with the Japanese and later written about by an economist in 1962. Collective capitalism floats all boats. I'd like to say a word on the Diocese of Scranton clergy situation . It's reportedly now that there's 18 hundred people who have called the hotline to complain . Having been a sexual victim myself at the age of eight by my little league baseball coach and I didn't come to terms with it until the Sandusky situation . Never told my wife, never told anybody . Referendum voting, I believe in referendum voting because I rather deal with issues than politicians . I'm not a politician . I'm a facilitator . I'm open for your questions . MR. ROGAN: Does anyone have any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Walsh, for putting in your letter of interest . Why do you want to be a City Council person? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. WALSH: Because I think I could bring about change. MR. PERRY: All right. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Walsh, for applying . How would you define the governmental function of the City Council ? In other words, what is the purpose of having a City Council ? MR. WALSH: I think the current City Council is dysfunctional . Okay, I believe that there should be facilitators instead of dealing with issues rather than personalities . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. What would you like to try to accomplish in four and a half months on Council ? MR. WALSH: My main goal would be to get the City books under control and make people aware of the idea of referendum voting. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. This will conclude the interview . We'll bring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 in the next candidate . MR. WALSH: Thank you. ( Richard Pica ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . If you could state your name for the record and we have one quick question before we begin. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MR. PICA: Yes, I am. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. PICA: My name is Richard Pica. Good afternoon Council and City residents . I first want to take this opportunity to thank you for think invaluable experience to interview for the vacant Councilman position . As I stated earlier , my name is Rick Pica. I want to take this opportunity to tell you about myself and my qualifications and experience and my love for the City of Scranton which would all be an asset to City Council . I'm a lifelong resident born and raised in the City of Scranton . I attended public schools . My parents and grandparents are also lifelong residents of the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 My family is deep enriched in family history of public service in Scranton where my father was a fireman , fire chief, and my uncle was a police officer . These family ties to Scranton make growing up in the City a wonderful experience . Knowing the City, the families of the firemen , the police, the City employees and City officials . All of these experiences are what brought me back to Scranton where my wife and I are -- currently raise our family. My wife is from upstate New York and she now calls Scranton her home. Upon my return from the military , I was employed by Geisinger Health System. I worked for Geisinger for 20 years as a technician , a manager and a director of clinical engineering . I gained years of experience in management , finance , procurement . I was responsible for over 50 employees , budgets , project management , large expansions and procurement of medical equipment and contract management . I also during that timeframe worked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 with my father and his family owned garage door business . In 2010, I left Geisinger to take over my family garage door business based in Scranton . I served Scranton and the northeast PA. I'm also on the board of directors for the Northeast PA Youth Shelter here in Scranton where we provide quality emergency shelter and related services to unaccompanied youths ages 14 through high school graduation . These experiences of being a lifelong resident , family history , working in the City, a homeowner , a small business owner and being involved in community give me invaluable knowledge , experience and the good and the bad of the great City of Scranton . That's why I am here before you today so I could keep our great City moving forward and work with Mayor Evans and the City Council to address this current City business and issues to bridge the gap until our new City Council starts in January . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Pica, both for your letter of interest and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 your service to the country . Thank you very much. MR. PICA: Thank you. MR. PERRY: So you did talk a little bit about why you wanted to be a City Council man. How will you apply your private sector skills to your Council seat when you get appointed ? MR. PICA: With my experience in the business sector being familiar with the mercantile tax and garbage fees, that will be valuable knowledge to help work the City through the issues that we currently have trying to attract businesses . I'm not a big fan of the mercantile tax. MR. PERRY: No one is. MR. PICA: The Scranton Prep tax that I think we're looking at or the payroll prep tax, I believe they use that in Pittsburgh as well from what I read. And I haven't contacted anybody in Pittsburgh to see how well it's working and if it's a good fit for the business people there. But that would be a start where I would begin to see if that would be a better option than the mercantile tax. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for your interest . How would you define the governmental function of City Council ? In other words, what is the purpose of having a City Council ? MR. PICA: Well, my understanding we're the legislative branch of the City. And my view as the role of the City Council is to work with the Mayor and work with all the department heads and try to uniformly make our City better. It's a very important role. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. In your opinion , what is the biggest challenge facing the City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MR. PICA: The high taxes in Scranton and Lackawanna County I think are one of our biggest challenges . I mean, we can make a laundry list of challenges here in the City. But I would say taxes so we can attract new business and new people, young people into the City so we have a bigger tax base and a bigger business base to help bring people into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 City. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. What specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ? MR. PICA: Could you repeat that, Mr. Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sorry. What specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ? MR. PICA: City operations , well, I would work with all the department heads first, go talk to them and see if there is any way we could as Council help streamline the operation , look at their budgets and see if there is any way we can streamline budgets . I also am a big fan of what Pittsburgh has is they call it an institution and service privilege tax where they tax the non-for-profit businesses , foundations that provide service or other related services to the City to help bring some more revenue into the City to relief some of that tax burden. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. This will conclude the interview . And we're going to bring in the next candidate and we're hoping to make a decision today. Thank you very much. MR. PICA: Thank you very much. ( Joan Hodowanitz ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . One quick question before you begin. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MR. HODOWANITZ : Yes, I am. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MS. HODOWANITZ : My name is Joan Hodowanitz . I've been attending City Council meetings for five and a half years. But my frustration meter maxed out long ago. I'm so tired of standing at this podium asking for information and getting little or no feedback . I'm fed up with the parade of taxpayers who contact City Hall for help with their problems and get only lip service or worse yet are totally ignored . I realize that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 many problems can't be solved in the near term. And some can't be solved at all without legislative action. Nevertheless , residents deserve a prompt response from City officials and a full explanation of what can or cannot be done to resolve their problems and why. I understand that you, as Council members can only pass on information the administration provides to you. And I am confident Mayor Evans will direct City employees to answer our requests for information in a prompt courteous and uncensored manner. We should not have to rely on right-to-know requests for the most basic information about our City's financial status or it's internal operation . If I'm appointed to City Council , I will work with you, the Mayor, his department heads and other City employees to get answers to questions , find solutions to problems and reduce the risk of fraud, waste and abuse in local government . If City Council 's request for information or taxpayer assistance are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 stonewalled or ignored , I will have no problem confronting the responsible employee including the Mayor. After all, what can they do to me? Bend my dog tags and send me to Baghdad? Jerry Cross hit the nail on the head when he said, "I had no business coming to this podium to complain if I wasn't willing to recommend my own solutions and take my fair share of public criticism ." Finally , I believe that five months on Council will give me at least some insight into how things really work in this building . And if the way we do things cannot stand public scrutiny we must change the system so that it better serves the needs of the people. So win or lose, I will be here in the peanut gallery on January 6th. And I will use whatever I learn in the next five months to make Scranton as Mayor Evans would say, just a little bit better. And with that I'll take your questions . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Well, Joan, thank you very much. I was very happy to see that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 you put your letter of interest in. It puts a big smile on my face to see you do that. I would love to see your name on a ballot some day. No one comes to this Council every week and week out without the passion and tenacity as you do. And that's from the heart. I really mean that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. MR. PERRY: Now, when you get your appointment for a couple months until the end of December , what skills do you have that you're going to bring to Council that's going to help you be an effective Council person? MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, for one thing, my education will help me with things like budgets and audits. I have a bachelors in accounting . And I have an MBA and I could even do research . I have a masters in library science . I have seven published articles on fraud. I love fraud. It just turns me on. But I don't like fraud in my City. So I do have a certain number of skills. I know how to read an audit. I know how an audit should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 done. And I know when the auditors are not meeting the task when they are missing red flags and the auditors need to be challenged . MR. PERRY: Thank you. Again, thank you, Joan, for putting your letter of interest in. I'm pulling for you. MS. HODOWANITZ : You're welcome . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for your interest . How would you define the governmental function of City Council ? In other words, what's the purpose of having a City Council ? MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, a City Council according to the Home Rule Charter is the legislative body. And it takes the proposed legislation . You could also do your own legislation , you know, to help run the City. You have to work in concert with the executive branch which is the Mayor. You are the ones that will finally approve the budget. You are the ones that receive the audit. And in addition , the Mayor is also an addressee on those things. But you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 should be working with the department heads to number one, make sure we have the right legislation that our ordinances are not out of date, that new ordinances are enacted as required . You should be making sure when you look at the budget, not only the revenues and expenses that you're going to approve , but that we have the right people in the right positions . And they have to have the right qualifications . You look at the 2020 budget. One of the things I would strongly encourage you to adopt and consider is a new hire. And it is a certified internal auditor because the public watchdogs, the independent auditor , the State Auditor General , and the Controller 's office missed all the red flags on the double pensions and what Mr. Courtright was doing for five years. So you have a larger role than just legislation . You should be aggressively working with the Mayor and his department heads making sure the appropriate legislation is being drafted , old ordinances are being changed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and then you have to look very closely at the budget. And that's a hard call because you're going to have to cut some things that are nice to have to start beefing up the things that are essential . MR. DONAHUE : In your opinion , what's the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MS. HODOWANITZ : Do you want me to do that in alphabetical order? MR. DONAHUE : I said the biggest . MS. HODOWANITZ : A lot of people talked about taxes how unfair they are with delinquencies not being collected . A lot of people talk about the City's image of being a corrupt government pay to play. But I'm going to introduce two other issues that I think you need to look at that don't get as much attention . One is the deteriorating infrastructure of this City. And that includes under that rubric stormwater management , okay? We're just getting -- no pun intended , we're just getting our toes wet on the issue of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 stormwater . But look at all the buildings and the real estate and the vehicles that the City owns and needs to maintain . When are we going to see a long-term maintenance plan so we don't have to look at a 10.7 million dollar bill to renovate City Hall just to make it workable , okay? I know it's not sexy in a budget to plug in numbers for long-term maintenance , but you could kick the can down the road so far. How many times in the last 20 years have we had to do emergency repairs to firehouses , okay? And, you know, vehicles that DPW needs, vehicles that our fire department needs, you got to bite the bullet. It may not be very sexy, but you got to dedicate money to that. We need a capital budget that's very serious and it's posted on the website. The other thing that is not talked about and runs shivers up and down my spine is the ongoing litigation against the City. What I mean is, I want a Plan B in the event unlikely it may be, but in the event we lose something like the Act 511 lawsuit or the sale of the Sewer Authority lawsuit , what's our Plan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 B if the courts tell us that we're going to get hit up for a lot of money? Do you realize that Act 511 taxes account for 42 percent of the revenue in this year's budget? 42 percent . So, you know, we're putting a lot of faith in winning those lawsuits . You look at the 2017 audit, management which means the Mayor and his staff is supposed to discuss litigation . Read the paragraph . It's less than a hundred words. It basically says, yeah, we're going to cover that in our financial statements . No Plan B. You do that in the corporate world, the auditor is going to give you a going concern finding meaning basically you're probably going to be out of business next year or when those lawsuits come due. So I think those two challenges , the infrastructure , you know, stormwater management which we've not been pushing too hard and maintenance of all of our property and litigation , you got to have a Plan B. Don't want to make that decision in a rush should something happen. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. Miss Hodowanitz , what specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ? MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, one would be bring in a certified internal auditor . I would place that individual in the BA's office because the BA is responsible for monitoring and directing operations and the budgets of all the other departments . An external auditor , one who does our annual independent audit, he does not look at the City's internal controls to evaluate them as to their effectiveness . He only looks at internal controls as they impact directly on the financial statements . You have got to have an internal auditor . And by the way, when I say you put the -- certified internal auditor , you get a certified internal auditor . You don't stick a body in there, give him the job title and say let it be written let it be done. It has to be a qualified person. It's going to cost money. On the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 other hand, you could finally discharge Rainey and Rainey because they could teach the BA staff how to prepare for an audit. You don't need to contract that out anymore. That's one thing I would do. I think you're going to have to look at the entire personnel listing in the budget to make sure, like I said, that you have the right person with the right qualifications and if we need a new hire, suck it up and hire them. But, you know, you may have to eliminate some nice to do functions . You're going to have to prioritize essential services . That's one thing. And more automation , you can never have enough of that. That's the way to go in the future. That will save you a lot of personnel cost. And work closely with all the local universities and schools and get their interns down here. That is free hidden brilliant manpower . And a lot of them are local residents and maybe we can get them to stay in Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ROGAN: No questions . Just one comment though. Really appreciate you applying and it's very refreshing to hear all of your ideas and there is no question that you know the issues so far than anyone else that's been in front of us from being here so often. But it is very refreshing to spend a little bit more time than we do on -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I got more than my five minutes. MR. ROGAN: You did get more than your five minutes . So thank you very much. And we're going to call in the next applicant . And we hope to have a decision today. Thank you. ( Mary Walsh Dempsey ) . MR. ROGAN: Before you begin just one quick question we're asking every applicant . Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MS. DEMPSEY : I am. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MS. DEMPSEY : Thank you. Good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 afternoon everybody . Thank you for having me today. I apologize I'm coming off a three day bout of laryngitis . But I'm pretty sure I could get through today. But if there is any scratching of my voice, my apologizes . Let me introduce myself. My name is Attorney Mary Walsh Dempsey . I have been an attorney in the City for the last 28 years. And a few things have led me to this decision here today. And you may be surprised to hear what the first one is. It's actually you four. And I mean that with the utmost of sincerity . When I -- because I'm not a political creature by nature. And when I saw that you four put aside the ideological philosophy that are historically associated with political parties whether it be democrat or republican . And four democrats voted to appoint a republican Mayor. I was overwhelmed . Thank you. I really was because for the first time in a long time I thought the residents of this City are being protected . And I was invigorated and I was revitalized . And I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 excited . That's number one. Mayor Evans, I don't know if he's here today. I don't see him. But to him as well, he put aside what could have been his individual time to run for a two year seat and he said I'm going to take this five month term because it's what's best for this City. The second thing that brought me here is I was involved recently in a legal dispute that was on public access TV. Two things I learned . Number one, I didn't know that many people watched public access TV but they do. And the second thing I learned is people appreciated my voice. They appreciate d the passion that was associated with it. And they appreciated what was said. And while this voice has historically been reserved for private legal disputes for a long time, I thought , you know what, maybe this voice has a place in the public. Maybe I can represent people. Maybe I can articulately say what needs to be said on behalf of the residents in the City of Scranton . So those are two of the reasons that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 brought me here today. A little bit about myself, as I said, I've been practicing law for 28 years in the City. It's not just I have a law degree. I practice law every day of my life. Sometimes more than I want, to be candid with you. I have been in every courtroom . I have been in front of every judge. I say that so that you know I'm a business woman. I have been involved with two law firms only in my 28 years of practicing . One was O'Malley and Langan for 20 years. I was a managing partner . I oversaw three offices . I oversaw the budget. I oversaw our employees . I understood what challenges were facing downtown Scranton at that time, parking , a lot of the blight issues that are not -- now being solved. Quite frankly , I think there is a homeless issue in downtown Scranton that I happen to see every day because I have a large window facing my office; the mercantile tax, the trying to get and retain good employees in the City. I saw firsthand the challenges that we faced. The last eight years I actually kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 of switched sides. At O'Malley and Langan I represented individuals . They came to me and I assisted them in every way I can. I will bet I represented thousands of residents of the City of Scranton . In the last eight years I switched and I am now representing businesses . Many of the businesses in the City of Scranton who will remain unnamed due to confidentiality ; but again, I speak with their CEOs, their COOs, their CIOs, their -- vice president of HR. I understand the challenges that are facing them. They tell me what's wrong and I have to fix it. A lot of things I can fix and a lot of things are a creature of this City that we just need to fix on our own. So I understand . And while a lot of people may come in here to you today and say this is one of the most dire and calamist times in our City's history , I'm going to tell you something . I look at it differently . We have nowhere to go but up. And I mean that honestly . And I for one am willing to work as hard as I can for as long as I have to which is five months to make that happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 with you four if I'm appointed . We have to build. We have to create honest, open, relationship s. We have to maintain integrity . One of my favorite things -- and I have my binder. I've been studying up on the Home Rule Charter and the Ethics Act and many other things, the Exit Plan for Act 47. One thing you'll find about me is I don't do anything halfway . You know, my kids think I'm working on some big case because they see me studying these binders every night. I have been working for this. If I don't get it, at least I learned something new. But if I get it, I want to hit the ground running . You're not going to have to teach me a lot. Now, am I going to know everything ? Absolutely not. I'm going to need to learn from you four. But I'm going to listen to you four because you've got the experience over me. I'm also going to maintain my own independent and objective judgment , which if you look at the Ethics Act are the exact words that's listed there. I think that's important for any of us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 A couple other quick things that may be important for you to know about me. I'm the incoming President of the Lackawanna Bar Association . I only say that for two reasons . Number one, I understand what it's like to be in a fiduciary role. I've sat on that board for four or five years. I've represented the lawyers of Lackawanna County in that role. Oh, boy, I didn't get through half of what I wanted to say. Let me just finish my thought and I'll complete . But I was elected by my peers. And to me, I was humbled and I was honored -- am I bound by that? I have other things I wanted to say. But I will be bound by it if need be. MR. ROGAN: You can have another minute. We're going to have questions from Council members as well. MS. DEMPSEY : Yes, and maybe some of them I could cover. I just want you to know that I've done my best to stay aware of issues, not just for coming in here today but over the course of my career. I follow Joshua Mast and his Scranton Tomorrow team. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I follow Bob Durkin and his Chamber of Commerce . I'm familiar with the lawsuits that are facing the City with the garbage fee and the taxation fee by Attorney John McGovern . I know that we've got the City delinquencies . I know that by the end of this year to come out of Act 47, we've got to make a change from the business mercantile tax to the payroll tax. I also know that we have to look into putting a debt policy into place. I understand what needs to be done in the next five months. This is not just someone who is showing up and saying I want to fill a seat for five months. Mayor Evans said I want to get a lot of work done. I feel the same way. And I'm willing to do it. And I'm willing to work hard. And I'm willing to work with you and for you. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, well, Attorney Dempsey , thank you for your letter of interest and coming up by stepping up to the plate. That means a lot to us I know. Now, one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 things that I learned fairly quickly on this seat was how different the public job is than the private sector. So how do you intend to apply the skills that you've learned privately to this more of a public type atmosphere in government ? MS. DEMPSEY : Understood . I think one of the main issues I will face in making that transition is time. In the private sector I can kind of control how I solve a problem . Whereas I understand the public sector, things may take more time. But to answer your question more directly , I think I bring two very important things to the table. And they are my critical and analytical thinking skills. I've been solving complex problems for 28 years. And I've been doing it for some big companies in this area. And they are problems and they are disputes that have lasted over a period of months and a period of years. And I have the ability to look at a problem and I'm not going to say I can solve it immediately . But I can come to a thinking or a thought process or I can decide who or where we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 need to reach out to. I also have the ability to listen to other people. Like I said, I'm diplomatic . I don't want you to think I come -- I'm going to come in here and say this, this, this and this. I listen and I respect and I dialogue with others so we can come to a solution that it's in the best interest of the City. MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Attorney Dempsey , thank you for applying . I followed the zoning hearing . And you should be commended for your preparation in that. And it was one of those rare instances where even though you argued back and forth for up to ten hours, at the end of the day you came together and you made a consensus . So my first question is, how would you define the governmental function of City Council ? In other words, what is the purpose of having a City Council ? MS. DEMPSEY : Two-fold I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 think, maybe more so. I mean, I've read a lot of things and I started to realize everything that's -- that's involved in it. And I certainly realize what an enormous undertaking it is. But I think the way the Council is set up, there should be a checks and balances to -- with the Mayor, obviously . We've learned that the hard way and with his administration to make sure everything is going okay. I also think it's a proactive role to listen to our neighborhood leaders to listen to our residents . I know, I watched that July 31st meeting with the Pennsylvania Economy League and DECD. And what a great roadmap they set out for us. So part of our role is to listen, listen to others who have the expertise . Listen to others who could tell us what to do, where to go and how to do it and also to have foresight . You know, some of these health care benefits they are calling them legacy benefits , which I'm quite familiar with from my job. These are decision s that were made years ago that are adversely impacting us now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 So I also think a Council has to have foresight to know how their decisions are not only going to affect the present day but the future. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. In your opinion , what is the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MS. DEMPSEY : Well, honestly right now in the position we find ourself in I think it's a lack of integrity . There's obviously other challenges . I think exiting Act 47 although a roadmap has been set out for us has to be done, you know, relatively quickly . I think those lawsuits are important . I'd like to get on top of those garbage delinquencies . That makes me angry that some people pay and certain people don't pay and certain people get deals and certain people don't get deals. And the garbage is still picked up. And I'm a regular citizen just like everyone else. So if I think like that, there's no reason other people shouldn 't think like that. But getting back to the integrity point, I very -- I have difficult y -- I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 modest and I'm humbled patting myself on the back. But I think the one thing you will hear if you talk to anyone about me is my honesty and my integrity . And I have treated everyone with that during the course of my career. And in response , I expect that from other people as well. So I think those are a few things that face us immediately and again, maybe in the course of the next five months. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. DEMPSEY : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. What specific ideas do you have that might help improve City operation s over the next five months? MS. DEMPSEY : That's a good question because I actually thought about this a lot. And I'm not sure in a five month period -- there's so much that needs to be done. I don't know how much proactive work is going to get done in the next five months because I think we have to respond to so much that needs to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 done that's already created for me. But, you know, ideas, a couple things. In terms of our neighborhoods , I feel like our neighborhoods are the core of our being in this City. And it was funny, Dan Simeral {sic} had a -- was quoted saying, he called us lifers. I consider myself a lifer. People who like -- love Scranton no matter how bad it gets we're not leaving . And a lot of people in our neighborhoods are lifers. But there are grassroots organization . There are people on the street. You want to know anything in Green Ridge, you could come out and ask us. And we know because we see the strange cars going in and out of alleys. So I would like to start some sort of -- and again, this is very premature and, no, I haven't thought about funding or anything like that. But if you have a neighborhood liaison or someone to meet with our neighborhoods , monthly maybe optimistic , maybe bimonthly , six times a year. I'd like to hear what they have to say to us. And good neighborhoods create good schools . And good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 schools create good neighborhoods . They feed off of each other. So that's kind of one of the ideas I have. I think I can bring a lot to the table to you in terms of managing some of these lawsuits . I'm not going to say I'm going to come in and solve them all or settle them all. But I really do think I could give you some good guidance . I understand the workers comp system which for years has been in disarray in the City of Scranton . And I know that. And I know our reserves. And there's issues with that and PMA. So again, I think my goal during five months is to respond to a lot of what's already on the table. And I think I had a list of eight things which I didn't get to. But if I could do something proactively during that time, those are a few things that come to mind. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Well, this will conclude our interview . We appreciate you coming in. We're going to have four more candidates come through and then we're hoping to make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 decision today. MS. DEMPSEY : Okay. Thank you so much. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. ( Marie Schumacher ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . Before you begin just one question . Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MS. SCHUMACHER : I am. MR. ROGAN: And the floor is yours. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon me? MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. I'll keep it short. The reason I'm here is because I do have some issues and ideas that cannot be presented from this podium within the five minutes that's allotted to the speakers . And so I thought this was an opportunity . It's -- I've made a lot of complaints . I made a lot of suggestions , not always a lot of feedback . And I thought maybe things would be different if I looked at it from the other side of the podium, which is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 reason I'm here. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry? MR. PERRY: Yes, Miss Schumacher , thank you for putting your letter of interest in. Just like Miss Hodowanitz , I was happy to see your name on this sheet and to see you up here interested . Your passion is second to none. You come well prepared every meeting . And you do come with some very good questions and sometimes we can't get the answers for you timely. And I think this is a very good place for you to be right now. So thank you for coming. So I know why you want to be a Council person. So one of the things that I realized pretty quickly was that my skills that I learned in my private sector didn't naturally translate into the public sector. What skills do you have that you grew up with that you learned and how will you be able to apply them into your Council person position ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, as you know from my resume, I worked for a defense contractor . And I was a leadership position at one of the associations , electronics industry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 association where we did 10 year budget every year that forecast the expenses on each department of defense and NASA project as well as we had went to the Department of Energy as well. And in that process , we took what was already published , of course, and then we went out and the association set up interviews for us. And we went out and interviewed the people that we needed to talk to to form our opinions . So I am familiar with government from both sides. I did Congressional stuff. And again, the budgeting certainly and my official title for a long time was research . And I think you're familiar with the fact that I -- I'm very curiously naturally . And I just see something and the light goes ding and I go after it until I find the answer. So I think all of those things would be helpful here. And I do -- again, see where there's a problem and where there's been successes . I mean, one of the things I'd be happy to share which is I don't think this body 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 or the school board interfaces enough with our elected officials . I mean, you all need to be lobbyists and go to those people. There's a lot that they can do for this body and they should be doing. And I don't think they're called upon often enough or held accountable when they don't do anything for us. So, you know, that's just one of the things that I think would translate . MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for applying . How would you define the governmental function of the City Council ? In other words, what's the purpose of having a City Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Is to balance the administrative body. You don't want a dictator which could probably happen if you didn't have a council that they had go through the wickets of you people. And also, you're able to bring things to the administration 's attention that you don't have that they haven't addressed .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 So -- and represent the people. There are, you know, four of you soon to be five, four of you have been elected by the public to represent them here. It's important . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. In your opinion , what's the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MS. SCHUMACHER : I think the revenues , increasing the revenues or cutting the cost or both, one of them, you know, any of those things need to be done. And again, researching what others have done, advocating for what we would like the state to do for us and in some cases, the federal government . And I think those things could all be very effective . And I have other ideas on what we can do to either increase the revenue or decrease costs. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. What specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MS. SCHUMACHER : Probably a reorganization and looking at doing some analytics on functionality of each of the departments and where they could be combined and where they might be bid out even. So that would be one of the things and again, lobbying . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: That will conclude our interview . We appreciate you coming in. We're going to call -- we have a few more candidates and we hope to make a decision today. MS. SCHUMACHER : You are? Okay, thank you. MR. ROGAN: Yep. Thank you. ( Kathleen Madzin ) MS. MADZIN: Hello. MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . One question before we turn it over to you. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MS. MADZIN: Yes, I am. MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MS. MADZIN: My name is Kathleen Madzin. I am a resident of South Scranton . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 graduated from Dunmore High School. And I also graduated with a bachelor 's degree in psychology from the University of Scranton . I'm not sure what you need to know from me from my introduction here. But I did start my first real job which was in November of '88 at the Educational Opportunity Center which is a nonprofit federally funded grant program . And that was to help people seek further education , whether it be getting a GED, getting a certificate , getting a bachelor 's degree, whatever . And in my position , I assisted adults who wanted to go back to school. My position afforded me a lot of experiences that other jobs have not. I partnered and traveled to local job centers . They were the Career Links of today in Scranton , Honesdale , Milford , Montrose , Susquehanna and even Stroudsburg . So my territory was pretty big. I also went into the Lackawanna County Prison and worked with women who were soon to be released by getting them some footing as to what their next career step would be. I worked with GED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 programs at Marywood . I was also part of a rapid response team who went into factories and businesses that just told their employees that they were closing down. So what we did is we came in and kind of tried to buffer them back up and say there are opportunities beyond where you are now. I also did help families figure out financial aid. So all of these different things I learned how to organize my time, execute tasks, speak to groups of people as well as individuals one on one. And I successfully met criteria and goals set by the grant that funded the program that we worked at. So these skills I think would be valuable to take the position with Council . Then in 1999 I was afford an opportunity to open my own business with two other women that I partnered with. We bought a building at 320 Penn Avenue in Downtown Scranton . And during that time Penn Avenue was definitely not the Penn Avenue that it is today. There was a lot of undesirables roaming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 the streets . The Metro was set to open on the other end of the corner. And really in between there were just a couple of businesses that may have been open like 9 to 5. With that building , we worked on it for a good solid year. We built it. And we opened it in January of 2001 as the Banshee . And that I think started the restoration of Penn Avenue. I'd like to take a little bit of credit for that, just a little. During my time as owner there, I also wore a lot of hats. One of them I was actually a chef hat cooking in the back. But the opportunity that -- to build my skill set there gave me experience in staffing and hiring folks and actually having to fire some folks. I was responsible for the inventory ordering and I also had to adhere to LCB codes and different laws. And obviously we needed to make sure there was good customer service provided . I scheduled entertainment there, organized bar events. And we even worked with community events like Party in the Park which used to be up at Everhart . We were one of the donors to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 provide the food up there for the folks that attended that. In order to open the business , we worked closely with the Chamber of Commerce , other supporting groups that gave us funding packages together . So it really reenforced knowing how to kind of open a business in Scranton . In 2005, my husband started a job with MetLife . I sold the Banshee probably around 2004, 2005. So once we sold that, he went and worked with MetLife and I was his office manager . He was a captive agent with them. So I was responsible there for basically running the office, organizing the files, doing customer service , supply, ordering and all the typical things you need to do every day to keep your business running . That job fortunately allowed me to have some free time. I wasn't a full-time employee there. So during that time, I started volunteering in the community . In around 2008, I started a reading program at Connors Park. And Connors Park is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 over on Orchard Street over in South Side. And that was just because one day I met a little kid outside of my house who was coming up from the store and said he can't read. And it kind of struck me because kids usually say I don't know how to read. I haven't learned to read. But this kid really was like I can't read. So I thought well, in the summer kids need something that seems like it's fun but they're learning . So I decided to figure out a way to get a program at the park. So I partnered with the woman that runs the free lunch program there. And I would just come in on Wednesdays . It's five minutes already ? MR. ROGAN: You could have another minute to wrap up your thoughts . MS. MADZIN: So I did that. And then in addition to all the rest of my community volunteer , I'm a volunteer with the Elm Street Project in South Side which is now the South Side Revitalization . I'm on the Image and Identity Committee . So we've been building the image of South Side. And that's about eight years, seven years of doing that. I participated in the Blight to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Bright training the county offered . I sat on the board -- or the awards board -- I'm not sure what it was for the Beautiful Blocks Grant. I was able to vote on who got what awards for that. And what else do I do? And I just volunteer over in South Side. Oh, and I'm Vice President of the Neighborhood Association . And that really is what kind of facilitated me getting my interest in doing community work and helping out the neighbors . So really to sum it up, I'm here because I like to champion Scranton . And lately, that's been a little bit difficult because we're facing several challenges in the City. And we really need to reenforce with our neighbors who are the real stakeholders in this City that they do truly have a stake in this City. I would like to be part of a team that makes sound decisions for our neighbors . And I think my experience volunteering , my experience in employment really has me -- a good solid resume for this kind of position . So I figured I better put my name in because if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I can't put my name in, I can't expect someone else to do it for me. So that's really why I'm here today. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Miss Madzin, thank you for your letter of interest (inaudible ) that really does mean a lot to us. Sorry, the mic was off there. Thank you, Miss Madzin, for your letter of interest and your dedication and your love for the City. That means a lot to us. How will you use your skills that you learned in the private sector on your seat as a Councilwoman ? MS. MADZIN: In my private sector, I have learned to be organized . I have learned to be task oriented . So I also have learned that I don't always know the answer to questions . So I am not opposed to saying I don't know the answer to this question . Let me go and find someone who does know the answer. So I think I can be a very good listener to the folks of our City and to the problems of our City and try to figure out a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 way to get a successful answer to the issues. MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for your interest . How would you define the governmental function of City Council ? In other words, what is the purpose for having a City Council ? MS. MADZIN: I did read the charter for what the Council does. And basically you're the legislative branch. So we can kind of align that with the Congress that we know, the House of Representatives and the Senate on the federal level. And you need to work -- I believe the Mayor and you folks have the same equal power. So you kind of have to work together to get the best focus and answer for what needs to be done within the City. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. In your opinion , what is the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MS. MADZIN: Right now I think the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 biggest challenge is that we kind of don't have support from the citizens in the City. When I told folks that I was doing this, a lot of them are like, good luck. This is great. And the other side of the coin was why? So it's hard. We have challenges . They're not going to upend the ship. We just need to right the ship back on its course. So I think transparency and automation are really the two things you have to pay attention to. It would be wonderful if someone could come in the door and they sign in and they have their list of what needs to be done so they go to department A, department B, department C and they could follow -- each department could follow where they were and what they did and what kind of extras still need to be done. That would be a really good thing to be able to do for the City. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Thank you. What specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MS. MADZIN: Specifically I would like to see the departments automated . I would like to be able to bring in our brain trust that surrounds us, students from the University , students from Marywood , students from Lackawanna , students from Johnson Tech to be able to come in and figure out a way to automate us and bring us not only into the 21st century , but maybe the 22nd and be ahead of the game. So that way we can build support from our outside folks looking in and getting some ownership into this City, show our citizens that are here that we're working towards making everything clear and simple and a plan that you know how to jump into and really get right, like, the right path because it seems like from the complaints I hear from folks is everybody has to go in 16 different directions to try and find one answer. And that's really been confusing and somewhat difficult for some folks. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. This will conclude our interview . We have two more candidates and then we're going to break 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 and we're going to hope to make a decision today. MS. MADZIN: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. ( John R. A. Tarantino ) MR. TARANTINO : Good afternoon , gentlemen . MR. ROGAN: Before you begin one question to start off, same as last time. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MR. TARANTINO : Yes, I am, a proud resident . MR. ROGAN: The floor is yours. MR. TARANTINO : Okay. You might remember me. I was here a few weeks ago for the Mayor's position . I mean, you picked the second best man. I was the best man but I could live with that. You know, Evans deserves all the credit and all the luck. I want to do something for the City of Scranton . I've been reading up on what's happening to Scranton . It seems like it's a cookie jar that people just put their hand in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 and take stuff out. Now, that's depressing . One thing I could say, I could only speak for myself as I have the City's good intention at heart. One of the reasons is I have three properties myself in Scranton . If you steal from Scranton , you're stealing from me. I don't like that. I want to see Scranton fulfill its promise . It's a beautiful City. Like I told you before, I lived outside of Pittsburgh . I lived outside of New York City. I lived in New York City. This City is clean. I mean, the streets -- it's impressive . The building 's impressive . I told you before this building 's impressive . I have the highest regard for people like yourself because I know you're not doing this for the money. That's for sure. You're doing it for probably the same reason I'm going to do it. I want to help the people. And just to sit back and complain helps nobody. If I could help -- if I could work -- I could work with anybody . And if I don't have the best idea, I'll listen to the best idea. And I'm open to anything that makes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 the City better if it makes it better for the people. The people -- everything I read about Scranton residents is they could put up with incompetency , maybe. But they can't put up with dishonesty . Now, this Mayor, I get angry. I get angry. I would drive him myself to the city jail and throw away the key if I could. But I don't have that option. If you give it to me I'll do it though free of charge. I really want to help the City. And if you got -- I have some ideas, you know, as I explained to you before and maybe they're good and maybe they're not so good. But I'll listen to you. I'll work with anybody . I've been a shop steward before. I've owned business before. I've had million dollar businesses . I've been around. And one thing I could tell you is nobody, nobody could have asked me for a favor and expect me to give it to them if I'm a City Councilman . I don't work like that. Thank you, gentlemen . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any questions ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. PERRY: Yes. Welcome back. MR. TARANTINO : Thank you. MR. PERRY: Good to see you again. And thank you again for the letter of interest . Question a little bit different than the last time you were here. How will the skills you learned in the private sector, how will you apply them to your job as Councilman ? MR. TARANTINO : Okay, simple. It's not just in the private sector, I'm at an age now I did all I wanted to do as a worker. Now, I want to see things get better for me and for people. I want to help people. Like I said, I've been a shop steward . I've been a manager . I've been on both sides. And I'm open to anything . I can work with people. I can take advice. I can take criticism . I can take rejection . I can take success . I want to succeed . I want to see this City -- I moved here two and a half years ago. I've got three properties . I'm looking a fourth one. That's how much I believe in this City. And once Scranton gets better for me, it gets better for everybody . That's my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 main objective to make it what it used to be. It was 150,000 people here in 1940. Now there's half of that. Why? MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any questions ? MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : In your opinion , what is the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MR. TARANTINO : All right. Well, besides the -- I guess the fiscal restraints . I mean, it's tough for the City. I've been reading the papers, been reading the articles , look at the news. Even this building here, I mean, it has to be renovated . And I read it's 11 million dollars is what I read to renovate the building . And I'm wondering , who's the contractor , Michaelangelo ? 11 million dollars ? You want to sell it. You want to keep it. There's a lot of problems facing the City fiscally . You can't keep digging into people's pockets and grabbing all at once. But you could reach in and take a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 little bit at a time, just a little bit to get by. That's all I say -- maybe a little payroll tax for the people that work here. That's the biggest problem is the fiscal restraints . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. What specific ideas do you have that would improve City operations ? MR. TARANTINO : To improve City operations , well, the first thing I would do I'll put street signs on the street corners . You drive by, I can't even read the streets , you know, either the signs aren't there or they're missing . I would have more -- maybe more volunteer work for kids for schools , get them involved , maybe reach out to seniors in nursing homes make them understand that they're not forgotten . They were people that were productive at one time. Now they're in the twilight of their life. And it's hard for them. People want to feel needed. People 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 want to feel like you'll listen to them. That's what I see here. You have to make people believe that you have their interest at heart. Other things for the City, well, maybe make Nay Aug Park maybe more user-friendly , maybe have more open days at the museum for people, maybe make the police maybe walk on patrol a little bit and talk to the people. That's nice, you know, when the police are -- they know who the people are. They talk to them. You never know. These are some of the things I might do. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. This will conclude our interview . We have one more interview and we're going to hope to make a decision today. MR. TARANTINO : Okay, thank you, gentlemen . MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. MR. TARANTINO : Thank you. ( John Drobnicki ) MR. ROGAN: Good afternoon . Before you begin, one quick question , same question we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 had last time. Are you a resident of the City of Scranton ? MR. DROBNICKI : Yes, I've been a resident here for 10 years. I own a home. MR. ROGAN: And the floor is yours. MR. DROBNICKI : Very good. Yes, I see this opportunity for a Council position open up, of course, in my later years I can't jump in the military anymore . They retired me from there. And I see that you could probably use somebody . I've been around the world. I've been in a few situations around the world. I know people. I like this City. And I think I could work well with you. I'm not out to cut anybody down or make, you know, I'm out to work with people. I mean, I know we have a president that was an actor became a president . You have another president that wasn't a politician . He became president . So I'm not into politics . But I think whatever is thrown at me I think I could take the bat at it and try to do something . I have a granddaughter lives in the City. I have a son. And I'd like to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 things better for them and the rest of the people in this City. Other than that, you can hit me with whatever you need to hit me for. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any questions ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Welcome back. It's good to see you again. Again, thank you for your service . MR. DROBNICKI : Right. MR. PERRY: So how do you think the skills that you learned in the private sector, how are they going to be applied to your Council appointment ? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, as each point -- as each problem comes along, I'd probably try to get ahold of somebody that's been involved in that before, you know, I try to, you know, try to find things out on my own. I don't know about things, about stuff, but I could get things done it seems like. As I've said, I've been around. I been in -- I've dumped tanks in the ocean for the fishes. I've been up in Alaska unloading an island to clear it off. We had 60 days to unload an island. We had to get all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 furniture off that base and on barges. I've been on Iraq. I've been among the busiest airports in the world. For six months I was on that base and, you know, under extreme heat and 45 days without even a break, without even a day off or anything . So like I says, I've been in a lot of situations . And I think if I got something thrown at me I could try to work with people and get something done. MR. PERRY: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you for your interest . In your opinion , what is the biggest challenge facing City government and what could you bring to Council to help us address that challenge ? MR. DROBNICKI : One of the things I've noticed here, I've been to a couple meetings . And I know I've never been called back or told, you know, my neighbors have, you know, asked me to stop here. And I've never been told or -- how can I say this in words? They never come back and resolve the problem or said why or anything else. I'd like -- as a Councilman , if somebody has a problem , I'd like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 to at least give an answer. I'd say, I'm sorry, we didn't have the money or we were looking at this or something . It just seems as though a lot of people say we can't find anything out. There's a door here that doesn't open. I'd like to see a lot more open communication with the City with the people who live here. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. What specific ideas do you have that might improve City operations ? MR. DROBNICKI : Well, one thing I'd like to do is I know -- I work for a Fortune 500 company . They're not paying big money. And I don't like to take anything away from people. But I think we really need to look at some of the wages that we're paying people. You know, I think when you're going to start hiring more people, you know, I think we got to say, hey, this is what so and so makes. This is all we can afford to pay. We can't be looking at union demands today and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 expect the people that are retired that are, you know, trying to pay for their homes to pay people that are -- you know, I think some of these salaries are way, way too high for the area. Another thing like with contracts , I mean, really should look at some of these contracts and see if there is somebody , you know, share some of the wealth so-to-speak, look around, see what some of these people do and what they're willing to do and get together and say, hey, look what this guy did. He did this extra or this one, look what he did. You know, I'd like to see cost cutting as much as we can. I know my position was eliminated because they sold their trucks. They found a different way to do things. I went back to the company for half the money because I need to pay for my home. And that's the way it is today, you know, people have to take cuts sometimes . That's what we need to do here. We got to take cuts in the City to keep it going. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Thank you for coming in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 We appreciate your interest . This will conclude our interview . We're actually -- if a Council member has a motion to recess, we're going to recess and discuss all the applicants and possibly come back out shortly for a vote. MR. PERRY: I make a motion to recess so we can meet in executive session to discuss a personnel matter. MR. ROGAN: Motion has been made to recess in order to meet in executive session . Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? (No response ) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? (No response ) MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it. We are in recess. (Recess was taken)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. ROGAN: Call this meeting back to order. MR. PERRY: I make a motion to nominate a person to fill the position vacated by former Scranton City Councilman Wayne Evans to serve for the remainder of this year with the said term scheduled to expire at 12 noon on January 6th, 2020. MR. ROGAN: A motion has been made to fill the position vacated by former Councilman Wayne Evans. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: This motion is to place the nomination on the agenda. On the question ? (No response ) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? (No response ) MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and so moved. MR. PERRY: I make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 nominate Attorney Mary Walsh Dempsey to fill the unexpired term of former Scranton City Councilman Wayne Evans for the remainder of this year with said term scheduled to expire at 12 noon on January 6th, 2020. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . First of all, I just want to thank everyone who put their name in. This is actually , in my opinion , a difficult decision . We had, you know, talked back there for -- for quite a while and went back between several candidates . All the people that showed up today and took their time out of their schedule I think should be commended . Your participation and your interest in public service is extremely valuable to this City. And I want to again thank you for that. So for those applicants who did not get the position , I don't think that you should be deterred . I think, you know, you should continue to participate . And I just really appreciate everyone putting their name in. I do want to congratulate Attorney 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 Dempsey . I do think she will make a good Councilwoman . And I think she'll be a part of a good team here to move this City forward . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. PERRY: On the question , yes. I also want to thank all the candidates . This was a very difficult decision . In some ways I think we saw a little bit more passion and a little bit brought to the table more so than we did with some of the candidates for the mayoral position . And this was very difficult . And it did go back and forth like Mr. Gaughan said. And there were more than one person that I feel willing to step in and take this job. But at this time, we need to make sure that we're doing what's best for Council and what's best for the City. And that's how we got to our decision . And I want to congratulate Attorney Dempsey . And I wish her all the best of luck. MR. ROGAN: I would like to thank all the applicants for applying . My colleagues , we all worked together again on a very upfront process . Everything went very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 smoothly . I will be voting against the nomination , not as a voting against Attorney Dempsey . I think she's going to make a great addition to City Council . But I did believe based on how short term the position was that there was one candidate whose understanding of the issues far exceeded anyone else that was interviewed . That was Joan Hodowanitz who's a regular speaker at our meetings . I just think because of the short term nature of the position that it was critical to have somebody that knew all of these issues on day one. So that's who I was advocating for. And I think from watching the interviews , her knowledge of the issues was head and shoulders above anyone else that applied . And that's not a slight on anyone else. I do understand Attorney Dempsey does have at least -- does have three votes so we will welcome her to the board. And as just to reiterate , my vote is not a vote against her. It is a vote in support of another candidate . Anyone else? Roll call, please? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: No. The motion passes. Attorney Dempsey is going to be the new Councilwoman . If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. PERRY: Motion to adjourn . MR. ROGAN: Meeting adjourned .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
