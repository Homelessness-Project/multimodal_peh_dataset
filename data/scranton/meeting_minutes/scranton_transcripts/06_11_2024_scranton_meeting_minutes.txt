MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially Sheriff John Szymanski and Vincent Dutkevitch . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to make a motion to take from the table Resolution No. 49 of 2024. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table Resolution No. 49, 2024 and place it in Seventh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 Order for a final vote. This resolution is a Memorandum of Understanding with the Scranton Redevelopment Authority . Anyone that would like to speak on this piece of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , we did get some answers back to question s we had in the last two weeks about this legislation . In one of the answers it says that they are waiting for the completion of the North Scranton study or plan. Do we have any updates on this, Frank? Is this something that needs to go out to bid? Is it just something that's in the works? There hasn't been a study as of yet; is that correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not that I'm aware of, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : And then this -- to pass this legislation , we don't -- is it September 30th is the deadline ? I know we discuss ed that in caucus last week. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. MCANDREW : For allocation . MR. SMURL: Yes, for allocation . It's got to be allotted . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so no real rush on this. I'd suggest that we kept it off the table until we got the timeline for that North Scranton study and the plan if anyone else is in favor of that. MR. MCANDREW : I'd be okay with that. MR. SMURL: All right. So we're going to move onto continue this. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to keep it off the table. So if it's a motion to table this, I'll make that motion. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , you have a motion and second to take it from the table. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'd suggest voting it down until we find out about the North Scranton study and plan. MR. SMURL: Okay. Anyone else? MR. KING: Don't we have to vote on the original motion? There was a motion and second. And there was on the question . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 the question was to possibly table it. ATTY. GILBRIDE : The question on is to remove it from the table. That was the initial motion and the second. You must vote on that motion first. MR. SCHUSTER : So if we were to vote it down, it would keep it off the table. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Correct . DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm in favor of taking it from the table and voting on it for tonight . I feel like we received our answers from last week. So I'd like to move forward on it. MR. SCHUSTER : I mean, at this point I've received answers. When it comes to administrative fees, the SRA is going to take that 10 percent administrative fee which comes out to about $90,500. I was worried about that fee. So now I know who is getting it. As I've said in the past, there was that streetscape project in North Scranton . I know it was several million dollars . I know we're possibly looking for other ways to fund that. I see that this would be an improvement possibly to the area. I'd 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 just like some more, you know, now that I'm seeing there's a plan in place for North Scranton that there's going to be a study and plan and that there is no, you know, no rush to get this done as it's not due until September 30th, I'd like to get the timeline on that plan. But if we vote to take it off the table, then so be it. MR. SMURL: Okay. I am in favor of removing -- taking it from the table tonight only because the questions I had asked had gotten answered and that the streetscapes plan, there's enough money in $900,000 to do a streetscape project. That's into millions of dollars and it involves the state also. So I'd like to just move forward with this and let the SRA start doing improvements up there as soon as possible . Anyone else? All right. So this will be voting on taking this from the table. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. SMURL: The ayes have it and so moved. Dispense with the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON JUNE 5, 2024, REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF MAY 28, 2024. 3.B. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT FOR YEAR-TO-DATE JUNE 6, 2024 AND YEAR TO YEAR COMPARISON REPORT FOR JUNE 7, 2023 TO JUNE 6, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. KING: So is it fair to say -- is it fair to say that 2023 is down compare d to 2022 by roughly close to $500,000 -- over 500,000. MR. SCHUSTER : Are you talking about the Payroll Prep Tax? MR. KING: Right. Is that what we're talking about right now? MR. SCHUSTER : It comes to these collection s, they always seem to be low to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 begin with. As we're seeing the -- what's actually collected (inaudible ) a lot of times these numbers seem to be in these areas. So you're talking about the 391,900 in the first quarter ? MR. KING: No, I'm talking about the comparison between 2023 and 2022. If you look at the total -- MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, the 840. MR. KING: Two point -- 2 million eight hundred eighty-nine thousand five hundred fifty-five dollars . And then I know they had budgeted 2.4 million . And then in 2023 they budgeted 2.4 million again. But they've only collected $2,372,004.81. Next time we meet with Kathy, I'd like to try to get a better understanding as to what's happening with that. That's a half million dollars less. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so, I mean, that is correct . So last year would have been 2.4. And they collected 2.8. So they overshot that budget estimate . And then this year, yes, they are -- they are falling short. And that's suppose d to have organic growth. So it is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 good question to ask. MR. KING: They undershot it by 28,000, I guess. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, over two years it seems to balance out. But this year as of 2023 they're under budget. MR. KING: Yeah, they seem like they're behind. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few announcements . First off, I just want to say that Saturday ended up being a great day for the Garbage Olympics . And I was really happy to be able to participate again along with Kathy and Alison from our office. And I think we did a pretty good job in the Garbage Olympics picking up garbage . We were over in West Side. It was also being done in Pine Brook. So I'm really happy for that event and for the other cleanups that were going on that day. I wanted to mention that this coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 weekend is Juneteenth. And that's going to be taking place on Saturday from 12 to 5 p.m. So that's hosted by the Black Scranton Project every year. And that's at 1902 North Main Avenue. And it's really a great event every year that they do outside . And there's always music. And I think they are bringing back the roller skating again this year too. I almost fell on my butt last time that I tried that, but it's a really fun event. And the City of Scranton is starting up again the movies in the park. And that was something that they did last year that I thought was really successful . And that's being done over at Nay Aug Park. And they released days and the movies that they'll be playing and that could be found on the park's website , also on Facebook pages, so definitely great opportunity to bring kids to go see the movies in the park. I know I'm going to go to a few. And I want to wish all those a Happy Father's Day this weekend . And lastly, I wanted to thank the SPD and the Scranton Fire Department as well for their work over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 weekend in the Hill Section , pretty close by to where I live there was a shooting and a domestic incident . And they were there all day long and I really appreciate their work to keep everyone safe and to try their best to resolve that situation . It ended unfortunately , but I know that they really worked hard. And I believe they asked for the public to try to stay away as far as they could. But I know when I drove by just driving home that there were a lot of people out trying to witness what was going on. So I just ask that if there is something like that happening in your neighborhood that the public -- try to listen to the police and stay away for their own safety. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? I would also like to thank the Scranton Fire Department for continuing their replacement of smoke alarms and CO2 alarms. They did Prospect Avenue on Saturday from the beginning to the end. They basically come knock on your door, ask you if you have smoke alarms or CO2 alarms.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 If you don't have them, they provide them free of charge and they also install them. So if anyone is in need of these, you could call 348-4164, extension one. And you could -- they will put you on the list to have them installed . This is all done free of charge. And it is for anyone, anyone elderly or if you can't afford them. It is totally free. They have a concern that people are afraid to let them in to install these alarms because they think they're coming in to inspect your houses. That is not done. They actually cannot do that, go in your house and inspect it. So don't be afraid to let them in, a smoke alarm or a CO2 alarm. They do save lives. And the underground minors, the Brook's Mine up at Nay Aug Park, they are open all summer now from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., free tours. They take you in through the mine and explain a lot of what they did. They've totally rebuilt it. They've put an exit in on the one side. They've done a great job up there. This is all free to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 public. But they do accept donations . So if anybody would like to help them continue their job of -- because they are building some of the old coal cars that are there. They'd like to rebuild them. I guess they're in the process of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: I'm sorry, I thought you had more, Jerry. If I could just -- I want to thank Scranton Police Department as well and the Scranton Fire Department for their handling of that situation , very tentative situation up in the Hill Section . And, you know, unfortunately it ended in a self-inflicted bullet wound. But they did a great job protecting all the neighbor s and ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of everyone in our great city. So they always do a great job. It doesn't matter what the situation is. So I want to thank them. And once again, I do want to congratulate the graduates at Scranton High School on Friday night, this coming Friday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 night. I think West Scranton is at 5. I believe Scranton High School is at 7:30. So I wish all the graduates well in their future. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First name on the list is Leslie Collins . But she was here earlier from Scranton Tomorrow . So I don't believe she wants to speak again. Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I would just like to comment as Mr. Smurl said the passing of Vincent Dutkevitch . He was a Scranton Firefighter from 1961 to 1993, retired at the rank of Captain . So he was one of our heros. I also want to thank everybody in the city who supported Swinging on Vine last Friday night which is the library 's major fundraiser and also last week, those people who came and supported the book sale that we have every three months. The proceeds from the book sale go towards children 's programming . And keep in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 mind the library will be offering children 's programs throughout the summer. Also about the library , you might have seen in the paper that the county awarded a $550,000 contract to KR Construction for the renovation of the Nancy K. Holmes branch library in Green Ridge. If you don't know, that building dates back to 1891. It's two years older than the Albright. And the renovation will bring it up to make it ADA compatible, energy efficient and a lot of things that needed to be done for a building that old. Five hundred fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. But people should now that no local taxpayer s were killed in the awarding of the contract because the money came from a grant from the Department of Education and private fundraising . So there is no taxes involved and hopefully the renovations will be completed by November . Friday, June 14th is Flag Day. And I always admire people who like to display old glory. But I would like to remind people that there is a flag etiquette . People aren't aware of it, not unless you were a boy scout or a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 girl scout or you were in the military . If you have a flag that you fly outdoors and it is torn or dirty -- and these flags get dirty very easily because , you know, the air outside is not very clean. It needs to be retired, taken down and replaced with a new flag. If you take a flag down because it's torn, dirty or otherwise , you know, defaced, you do not throw it into the garbage . You call either the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the VFW, the American Legion, the DAV or any other of those organizations . They will take it and in an appropriate ceremony usually on Flag Day they will burn them. And that's the way they are properly disposed of, not in the garbage . They do not go to the landfill . Remember , that the flag will be put on -- it adorns the caskets of veterans and first respond ers. So it does not go into the garbage . That's actually a federal statute , by the way. Anybody can Google it and download it and read about it. The labor agreements , I'm keeping track. The firefighters ' agreement is now 433 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 days old. Police is 318. So we'll be waiting on them. If you could in Fifth Order if you have any update on the status of the Serrenti Center, vis-a-vis this project by CTC owned land for an emergency operation center. What is the status of the Serrenti Center? I know that there is ongoing litigation but -- MR. MCANDREW : I'll report out in Fifth Order. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, if you could give that in Fifth Order, I'd appreciate that. And this 7-D, the Chrysalis Research and Consulting work for the HUD five year consolidated plan, in the legislative backup the financial impact is blank. Are we to assume there is no cost to the city for this contract work? If could you also answer that because it's up for final vote tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , city resident . And tonight I'd like to start with the street signs. And after Council last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 nothing was mentioned about the activity with the street signs and that there was work that was going to be started . And good old Facebook , you know, there was a posting that the street signs were starting to go up in West Side. And I thought , why do we have to go to Facebook to find out that the street signs are starting to go up? So I reposted it to let everyone know. So I did ask some friends over in West Side if they've seen them. They had not. And so I was just wondering if anyone could tell us exactly what's going on with those street signs. Is it a part of the project ? Where are they putting them and what can we expect going forward ? Also, it was good to hear Leslie Collins talk about the activity that's going on with Scranton Tomorrow . And when she mentioned the prayer breakfast which is going to be in October , you know, I just pray that that does go forward . I always went to them when they did have them. It's amazing how the pandemic just changed our lives and a lot of the things that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 we had then, it's good to start seeing them come back. So I wish them success with that. And as soon as I see any information on it, I will be sharing it with any of the folks that I know. Also, I spoke a few weeks ago about the coordination of the PPL -- not PPL, that's electric -- the gas company and the water company digging up our streets once they are paved. Well, it started. On our posting , you know, our Facebook page for our community someone posted they did it. It lasted the 96 hours and they're digging on a new paved street. So, you know, I know that there was some discussion on it when I first started coming to Council . That was six years ago, so certainly something can be done. And I understand that water breaks under the ground. And I think we all understand that and we like to turn on our faucets and have good, clean running water. But there must be some kind of coordination that can be done. So that's enough of that. Now, I turn into an advertising podium here. And the first thing I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 wanted to talk about was our Scranton Project . And thank you, Dr. Rothchild , for mentioning that. And the reason that -- I just think that everyone given the opportunity if they cannot go to the Black Scranton Project on Saturday , look up what it means. What does Juneteenth mean? What does it mean? Why are they having a celebration for June 16th? Look it up. Google it and become more educated about it, about our history, about what it means when they want to celebrate because people come and ask me, you know, well, you know, I could tell you what I know. But there's a lot more that you can learn about it. So come out on Saturday , learn about it and bring your chair. I was talking with Glynis, you know, there may not be enough chairs for everyone . So make sure you bring your chair so that you could sit and listen to the music. I won't be roller skating , Dr. Rothchild . But, you know, you just enjoy the activity . And it's good to see the kids out and how they interact with each other. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 just so enlightening . So come out to that on Saturday . And then also my other thing that I'm working with is the Flower Show. The Flower Show is going to be, of course, on June 29th at Nay Aug Park. But it's so much activity going on with it. And it's grown so much in the years that I've been involved with it. I think this is the fourth year. And this year the Everhart Museum is going to be involved with us. They partner ed with us. And they will be having free admission to the museum. There's face painting for the children . And there's also -- they're going to have music as well. And we're going to have music. And over in the park by where the zoo used to be, any of us who grew up in Scranton know where the zoo used to be. There's going to be story telling time. And we've got a huge chair for someone to sit in and tell stories to the kids. They are going to read books to the children . And also, the Scranton Public Library has been very gracious and have given us books that each child that comes will receive a book.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And we have little Nay Aug pins -- you see my little Nay Aug shirt on tonight . We have little Nay Aug pins that each one of the children that come to the event will receive that pin. So I'm just hoping that, you know, that people will put this on your calendar just for this weekend is Juneteenth. And then the 20 -- I keep getting this date mixed up, but the Saturday -- last Saturday of June is the Electric City Flower Show. When I first came to Scranton -- I'm almost out of time. People said there is nothing to do. There's plenty to do in Scranton . Have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, I was glad to hear that we had something good to say about Sheriff John Szymanski . He was one hell of a sheriff , but he was one hell of a citizen in the city and he was a great friend. And we need more people like him in this community . Bringing on, I also have trailer loads of disinfectant wipes still available for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 people that we've donated out. We had the trailer at Weston Field. I'll probably take it out of there after a while because they just stopped taking stuff off it. But moving on a little more, I just came back. I've been out of the area for the last couple months dealing with a torn Achilles tendon. And right now I'm going to through treatment here at Lehigh Valley. And Jessica is very familiar . She's one of their associates . And they've had nothing good -- nothing bad to say let me put it that way -- but good things to say about the physical therapist s that are employed there. What I don't like and I'm not making this personal to anyone. But see our flags that are flying here? I've travelled all over the world. What was the feeling that everyone got here on the 80th anniversary and saw all those white crosses sitting there knowing those young guys never got a chance to come back here. But we're here tonight in this city and this country able to speak freely. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 We're not getting shot. We're not having our heads cut off like Hamas and the rest of them are doing and I donated the flags. And it really ticks me off that the Israeli flag and the Ukraine flag is not flying here. I paid for them and I donated them. I also donated them to the government building and the county. I think it's a slap in the face to say that we're supporting all of these scumbag s that are out there protesting defacing our statute s and everything else. Now, the 80th anniversary passed. I didn't see a flag outside . I didn't see any flag that said thank you guys for dying. Thank you to those who came home maimed and otherwise with PTSD and everything else. I didn't see any of that either here, the Government building or anywhere else to honor those veterans , those Americans . And I'm an American . I'm a Republican and I'm a patriot. This is my country and it insults the living hell out of me to see a flag flying out there that's under the queer organization that's given respect instead of giving respect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 to those that died that gave us this right to be here. And, Jessica , don't take it personally . I could care less what people do in their own personal lives. This is about here. In Florida they got rid of the rainbow s on the bridges now. Now, they're red, white, and blue lights. We're taking our country back from everybody that is trying to take it from us, all these radical s that are standing out in the street going, oh, we're Palestine Hamas. If you're Hamas, you're a murderer, a raper, a butcher , etc. That's the difference . We're trying to bring the country back. I'd like to see right now look at our city. How many shooting s have we had? Gerald, you remember . We could leave our doors open, our cars unlocked in the city. We can't do it anymore. And why is it that way? Thank you, Joe Biden, bringing all your illegal s. They have no jobs, nowhere to live, no place to go. So what do they got to do? Steal, rob, beat up people, shoot people, get what they want. They got to eat. They're going to find a way to do it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 This is what's happened to our country and our city. And in this city we need to take it back. And in my final statement I brought this up with Jessica more than once in the past. I have a brother that's a plastic surgeon . I have cousins that are MDs. I would respect fully ask you to identify behind your name what type of doctor you are. Your professional is one of the best in the world and we all go there for treatment . And it's a profession you should be proud of and not feel that you shouldn't put it behind your name as a physical therapist . You are the people that make us healthy again and should be damn proud to do it. And I would respect fully request that you identify that you are a physical therapist . It's an honor to have that more than anything else. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Okay. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . You know, this is a city that just seems to exist on consultant s because we have such a poor administration . Now, a week or so in the paper we got a consultant looking for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 location to spend 600,000 or whatever . What's wrong with that property on Colfax? There's a beautiful building and there's big acreage there. Secondly , this I went through some garbage to get. This is the third time the same spot piles of garbage been piled up down at the river where the fishermen park and I got a picture of it. This idiot left a bunch of stuff with his name on it this time. This is what destroys our city, our neighborhoods is allowing people to get away with this and making taxpayer s like you and me have to go and clean it up. Last month I don't remember who did it, but somebody cleaned up the other two loads that were down at the river. It's a city property where they were. Let me just give this to you. This really teed me off. His name is all over that. That wasn't in the garbage . That's just some cardboard boxes. Give me one second. I'll show you pictures . That's the third time they done that. MR. SMURL: Where was it at, Ron?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. ELLMAN: -- make an example out of this Steve -- MR. SMURL: What was the location ? Where was it at? MR. ELLMAN: If you go down North Main to the 2700 block where the apartments are, you take that little road by the railroad tracks and you could park there (inaudible .) That's where this pile was. The other two piles were just to the left of it. Like I said, last month somebody cleaned it up. MR. SCHUSTER : The barrels that were down there. MR. SMURL: Can you go back to the microphone so everyone can hear you, Ron? Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : There was like 55 gallon plastic drums there right, the last time you came it. That's been cleaned up? MR. ELLMAN: Real quick, three or four houses up from me is a condemned house. Every Monday night this white car comes and dumps four, five, six just bags of garbage there. I don't know who they are. But the car doesn't have but one sticker on the window so I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 take it they are from out of the city where you have to buy stickers or something . Anyway, if Oleski considered my case of water on a lawn chair rubbish , this got to be worse. Steve Saco ought to be made to clean it up and made an example of. Besides that, this is right where the fishermen park. There was two cars there today. But I don't what -- I didn't see them, you know. It used to be nice right there until they started dumping . My son is in the hospital so I got to go right now. I don't know what you're going to talk about afterward s, but I wish you would consider making an example out of him. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Tom knows where this is at so he will give Mr. Voldenberg the location and then we'll send hopefully someone down to actually document it. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Storm drains within the city, can you produce which ones belong to the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Scranton and which ones belong to the Pennsylvania American Water company ? And if you could provide information which departments will be addressing the storm drain repairs? And if you can, please provide a list of storm drains owned by American Water Company and which ones are owned by the City of Scranton . The city ordinance provide s for dumpsters on the streets, is there any relation s for pod storage contain er on the city streets and who enforces that? We have a number 1A91 in front of 617 North Summer Avenue for the last five years. It's taken resident 's parking spots and it's making it very difficult in the winter months for the city snow plow. And that's pods. I have an 800 number for that too if you want it at the end. And do we have the final number of applicant s that took the Scranton Police Patrolman Exam? I believe the test closed last week. And can you provide a percentage of passed and failed candidates ? Will there be any update on the lawsuit regarding the Scranton Police Department promotional exam? And was the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 insurance carrier put on notice of a potential claim? As we know, another tragic event in our city. Will the cause for that tragic event on Saturday in the Hill Section be made available ? And is there any course of action to recoup for the city services ? And I know we need to protect , but we were there all day and there was a lot of equipment and some equipment was fired upon. Can we recoup any damages or any kind of funds for that service ? Are we making any headway with the investigation with the legitimacy of the 501C3s nonprofit s in the City of Scranton ? Is there any way the City of Scranton can assign their own field investigators from within the number of employees we have working in the city? And would it be fair to say all boards and meeting s take minutes of their meeting s like we do here at Council ? Should all city boards, especially the Zoning Board have the meeting minutes on the city website ? The Zoning Board hasn't had minutes of the meetings for years. Correct me if I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 wrong, doesn't someone get paid to make sure the minutes of the meetings are on the city website s? Christmas decoration for Nay Aug, do you know where they're stored at? Do you know how much the city is paying for the storage ? We do. Saturday , I attended a flag retirement service at the Marine Detachment Center. There was one elected official there. It was a Republican County Commissioner . Since last Tuesday night's Council meeting we've had many incidents concerning unruly juvenile s. Are we prepared yet? One incident , taser was used, two incident s, 14-year-old girls were passed out in front of the Turkey Hill, over 40 individual s running rampant in the neighborhood . The police were deployed . There was about 20 cops there. Can the cops be doing something better late at night like that instead of corralling children ? But we don't need a curfew. We're good with that. The welcome sign coming into the city, the North Scranton Expressway at the 7th Street exit, the grass is just about as high as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 the sign. Have a nice night, Council . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner. I couldn't help but notice on the way in today the pride flag flying on the flagpole . We fly all kinds of flags on the flagpole , pride flag, veteran 's flag, Italian flag, Irish flag, whatever . Israeli flag, no. The Mayor won't fly it. When I asked her she said, "Oh, it might offend some people." Well, you know what, it's offending more Jewish people not flying it. The Mayor cares more about a few people that might be offended by the Israeli flag than all the Jewish people in this city. I will be sure to attend the Jewish Food Festival , which I do anyway and tell every single person at that festival that we have an anti-Semitic mayor. She doesn't give a darn about the Jewish people in this city. All she cares about is a couple that it might offend because Israeli flag is there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Bob Bolus donated it and she refuses to fly it. And I think she's discriminating against all the Jews in this city, the state and the whole country . It's a terrible thing to have an anti-Semitic Mayor. Next thing, the hole on Dorothy Street I spoke about two weeks ago, it's still not filled it. I'm no engineer . But, like I said, that's -- it's not pavement coming out. The road is settling . What I think has to be done is that should be dug up again and filled in and leave enough stuff in there for it to settle. But what do I know? The weeds on Dorothy Street I spoke about finally got mowed last week except for a small area about 2 feet by 3 feet. And I saw the guy when he was mowing. He was done and I was walking my dog. I walk through the ball fields. And I told him they forgot to do one little area. And he said he didn't know why. So yesterday I went by again and I walked down. It's a little, just a tiny hill. At the bottom it looked like an old Christmas tree was thrown there years ago. And with all the weeds over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 growing on it you couldn't pull it up. But today I went back again and I pulled it up myself and put it out on the curb so maybe the garbage men will take it. And now they can mow the whole thing. Lastly, two weeks ago also, I spoke about that traffic light on Main Avenue. It turns black for a while. The next day there was somebody there taking care of it. But there is still something wrong. I don't know why, but when you are going towards that light it's still black. You have to get almost on top of it to see what color it is. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, do you mean the middle one -- the middle light, correct ? MR. SPINDLER : It's the last light going towards North Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : I've seen the first one but not -- MR. SPINDLER : All the other ones are fine. Going each direction , the other ones are fine. Those ones I'm talking about seem to have like a -- some kind of filter or something over it. And you can't tell what color it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 until you are almost right on top of it. So what the guy did, I don't know. He said those lights are totally different than all the rest right in that area. All the other ones you could see right from a half a block away. Like I said, there is something there. I don't know why those lights are different than all the other ones. I don't know. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Les, you said the batting cages, is that where the overgrown grass still is or did they cut that? MR. SPINDLER : Well, no, that was done. Like I said, I pulled tree out so now they could do that little area. MR. SMURL: Okay. So they did take care of that one. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, it should be okay next time they mow it now. Now I know why they didn't do that little area because someone threw an old Christmas tree there and all the weeds just grew over it. MR. SMURL: All right. The rest of your question s, they were -- that was all sent to DPW for the sunken pothole and the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 thing that you did. That was sent in. MR. SPINDLER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I didn't want to interrupt your conversation . MR. SMURL: We want to make sure that's taken care of all the time because it gets overgrown. Go ahead. MR. COYNE: Mr. Smurl, on the legislation last week for amending the funds to St. James Manor, you stated you did not receive it until 3 p.m. on that Tuesday . That's on page 64 of the meeting minutes from last week and you had no chance to review the backup of any of it. The administration City Clerk noted it was received on May 28th of 2024. So it seems they got this change request put through one week prior to sending it to you. So it never could have met the timeline . So it seems that the city administration actually didn't sit on it. It was a very late change request on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the part of CSS. So CSS didn't do their paperwork and waited until the last moment beyond when this body could actually do it. So the people requesting the fund actually put in the request from the time date stamp after this body could have actually lawfully produced it. So I don't know why suddenly we vote for rapid fire putting through legislation and funding when it was not the city's issue when it was actually the people asking for the funding itself. As you pushed it forward I understand that you can. But it flaunts the intent of the Sunshine Rule of not allowing this unless the action is de minimis . And 94,816 is not de minimis . I could understand how you did the meeting and require -- but I don't understand if you got it at 3:00 in the afternoon how the actual notes got up onto the minutes beforehand to comply with the 24-hour window that's required for the Sunshine Act for advertising any meeting s. I don't know it was added or Mr. Voldenberg had it beforehand -- a day beforehand but according to you, it didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 exist until in the Council until roughly three hours before the session . If that's true it couldn't have met the requirement s for the Sunshine Act because you couldn't advertise something and put it on the minutes that you never actually had. Again, on 7-C, I'll ask how did the bid that the city put out on April 12th of 2024 seemly offer to bid the winner on September of 2023? It seems there was communication and a potential agreement prior to the bid ever being produced . Again, April 17th, 2024 communication to Jessica Eskra confirms this information . I quote, it was a pleasure meeting with you Kathy Welcher and Daniel Penetar , Esquire via teams meeting in September , 2023. I will be pleased to represent the Scranton Single Tax Office in litigation on a contract basis for the collection of delinquent taxes. So six to seven months before the bid was ever released there was already communication including as previously proposed your office will be billed a reduce rate of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 $225 an hour plus expense s. The bid document states that preproposal conference will not be held multiple times. So how did they get a special preproposal conference in September and an actual offer for the position that was never actually published ? How open and valid is a bid process when the final winner was preselected six months before the position was ever bid out? And that included prepping and planning of the winner to bid at a specific acceptable rate. Should those who bid and were turned down be able to sue for expenses as the whole process was settled even before they bore the expense of actually putting into the bid because the bid was already chosen before it was ever put up before the public. And it's in the documents , all the dates. Look at the backup. It's there. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I hope I -- I could talk for a while, not too long though. I am very anxious to hear what you are going to have to say about the Serrenti 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 tonight . And I hope it includes the number 15 fire. I'd like to know has that gone on the market? I haven't seen anything in the paper. And are we or aren't we? And if we are, why isn't it being done? MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry to say, I don't have a lot to report. I asked for them -- an update for both or the differentiation between the CTC Project and the Serrenti Center. The only answer I got back is we will schedule this with the City Clerk. So they're going to come in hopefully before we go on August break. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, that would be nice. Yes, now on this building , how long is this building going to be in the cage that it is now? Do we have a finished time for the -- whatever is being done on the outside ? MR. SMURL: This -- City Hall? MS. SCHUMACHER : Uh huh. MR. SMURL: Approximately a little over a year. MS. SCHUMACHER : Really? MR. SMURL: Um hum. MS. SCHUMACHER : Wow. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then it appears the pave cutting has not been -- do we have a pave cut person again now on payroll ? MR. SMURL: I'm not sure if we have a pave cut -- there is a position . I don't know if it's filled. MR. SCHUSTER : It seems that the last update we got was that the city engineer was doing the pave cut inspections . MS. SCHUMACHER : Really? What are they going to charge? MR. SCHUSTER : We did ask that. Did we get a price on what they're -- oh, they're doing it free of charge at this point in time. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I was going to suggest that you bring back the prior pave cut person and hire her for a short time. MR. SMURL: This person had been injured so we can't put somebody in that place. We just can't -- we can't fire them. They're still -- they were just injured so -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I mean, to help the person that is doing it or is supposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 to be doing it now. And could we get -- for a while could we get some statistics on how many are done in a week so we know that things are really being done and how much the -- how many -- how many people -- how much people have paid to get those pave cuts? So that would be nice. And then I guess the capital budget, what, that comes out in August, as I recall? So maybe some of these things will be in that. And will the Meadow Brook again, is that -- is that on schedule ? Tom, do you know if all the rights-of-way have been signed? MR. SMURL: I know it's ongoing. I don't believe there is an actual schedule . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh. MR. SMURL: But it's ongoing. MS. SCHUMACHER : It's on hold did you say? MR. SMURL: It's ongoing . It is continuing . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. Well, are all the rights-of-way completed ? MR. SMURL: I don't believe every one is completed .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, maybe you could provide the number of them next week. MR. KING: I believe Boyd Hughes is working tieing up the last several rights-of-way, not quite done yet. But he's working on it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I agree with you about the lookout. But also that could be -- the trees in front of that could be trimmed back down once they get around to it. I know they are doing that. The DPW is doing the sides now which is very nice to have also. But I thank them for that. Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . A couple of week or two ago, maybe last week it was the lady from Griffin Pond came in and we should check up with the people from Street Cats and make sure that we're not getting a new bunch started . They were all over at one time in my neighborhood . I went through 15 of them, paid money out of my own pocket, neutered them. Okay. And we also -- I heard last week about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 televisions out in somebody 's yard. Well, you know, it would be nice if they at least had the opportunity on an annual basis to take these televisions down and pay to have them removed or recycled , whatever you want to call it. They're a terrible problem when you get these old TVs and they blow out and they weigh a ton. You just have nowhere to put them. You're stuck tripping over them or carrying them up to the attic and they never get taken care of. The one guy had a couple of elderly passed away and he had, like, six or eight televisions up in the attic that blown out over the years and nothing could be done with them. And I'm still tracking the gas bills. I strongly suspect that his good-naturedness of having us pay the delivery fee or whatever it is just a plow and he's going to go for a raise or they're going to go for a raise sometime in the fall. And the mathematics will add up to a 30 percent hike or 25 percent hike, which is outrageous seeing as we live right in the middle of gas land. Okay. Pave cuts, once again they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 should be inspected at the end of the season -- at the end of the summer season and everybody should have to register when they're doing one and they should be inspected after that and then they should be inspected several months later because I think what's happening is a lot of the tar that they lay down to seal the edge is just sinking down and it melts and sags down in the crack, and then you have a groove in the street for lots of water to get in. It's not -- not good for us. We get stuck with the potholes. Once again, the AI was in the paper again. And it's a problem in Europe also. And I'm going to bring this up again raising the alarm on pregnancy care. Emergency rooms refusing to treat pregnant women after Roe v. Wade overturn ed. They are worried about zealot DAs. Now, this is primarily down south. But there is plenty of organizations pushing it in Pennsylvania and everywhere also. Twenty-six thousand rape pregnancies in Texas since Roe v. Wade was overturned , 65,000 throughout the south. Miscarriages , they are told to go sit in a hot car to mimic sepsis. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And torn clothes , facial bruises , laceration verified that they were molested , no morning after pill in Iowa. I mean, aren't we -- I mean, we're so faithful . And it just goes on and on and on. And then once again, we got the Moms For Liberty in Philadelphia trying to remove the books off the shelves . Don't bother. I read them at home. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to talk about my opinion of the state of the city and our current mayor. We've talked about several things. And one of the big things here is basic infrastructure like our roads. You know, you see the state. You see the county. Every time they do a pave cut it's surfaced properly . It's tarred. It's sealed. They don't have to go back over it. Every time there's a tear in the road or a cut in the road where they seal them together usually in the middle, you see tar. You don't see that on the city streets . What you see is us filling them in at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 the expense of PA American Water and UGI. They rip our roads up. We have these ordinances . Nobody seems to enforce them. The Mayor could care less. She's not even from here. I don't think she grew up wanting to be the Mayor of Scranton . It's evident . She works her job 10:30 until the last photo op. Shameful . It's disrespectful . It's unbecoming of that chair and those who sat in them before her. Shameful that you have to find a swerve pattern on the roads that you travel on a daily basis. And the ones you don't travel, you have to watch the cars in front of you just to get out of the way of the potholes , manhole covers. I have never seen these streets in the condition that they're in. The other evening there was a party in West Scranton near Turkey Hill, a couple 14 year olds were passed out. That caused a call to resident s just down the street, several police officers were notified . They arrived on scene. Turkey Hill had to allow only two people in at a time. Now, we talk about a curfew, 1995 Conference of Mayors. A thousand cities, over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 30,000 people were surveyed , 387 replied; 270 of those, 70 percent in 1995 had a curfew. I heard kids underage walking the streets until quarter after one in the morning . And you mean to tell we don't need a curfew? Is it that mediocre is just normal around here or is it something that you just refuse to get to. You know, our kids are our future. It's one thing to fill our pools in with dirt and prevent kids from having a good future. The more things we take away, the more they want to do other things, you know, to put a 14-year-old girl into a precarious position just because this body doesn't want to do their job effectively . You want to compare us to Newark, New Jersey. I'm sorry, the last mayor used somebody from New Jersey. That doesn't work. Let's talk about the last mayor for a second. You know, our corrupt mayor, once he gets out he's not going to have a driver's license . Somebody 's going to have to drive him back into the city. And trust me, when he gets here, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 he's going to say, oh, I think I messed up. Well, this is what you get when you get people from out of town with a massive mailing list trying to become mayor once again. I'll tell you what, I'm sick of it. I don't see parties . I see people. People are not party. I'm an independent for a good reason. Everywhere I go, it doesn't matter where I go. You see the same thing. You know, the hope is lost. It doesn't have to be that way. This isn't the Scranton that I remember . This is what it's become because of arrogance downstairs taking a job just to hope for something else. We could do better. We will do better. And I take this a little bit personally , you know, she was questioned a few weeks ago about gang activity and unlawful deaths. And she compared it to other cities. Well, we're doing better than other cities. Five in five months is too many. One is too many. As a parent who lost a child, I could tell you firsthand it's not a good thing. And to have somebody representing us like this, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 it's just shameful . We could do better. And we will do better. She's in the pockets of PA American Water just because she doesn't want to make a call and fix our roads. You know, there's 1.9 percent increase in the water mitigation for the Sewer Authority . And none of you want to look into it. Threshold is a lot higher than that. But, hey, it's up to you guys. Do you want to be a part of the city and represent the people or do you want to just represent yourself and do nothing . The rest is up to you. The railway system is coming through . Our future is in your hands. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . If we could ask DPW to take a look at that welcome sign. I think Mr. Argenta said Center Street -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. ARGENTA : North Scranton Expressway -- MR. KING: North Main, yeah, if we could get that checked out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: The sign coming into our city should look presentable . It speaks volumes about our entire city so that's important . Jessica Rothchild is Dr. Jessica Rothchild . Period. There is Dr. Erin Keating . She's the Superintendant of Scranton schools. There's Dr. Jessica Rothchild . She's a physical therapist . There's doctors of pharmacy . There's doctors of -- I think we should just put that to rest as far as that's concerned . On East Mountain Road, there was something on East Mountain Facebook about Pennsylvania American Water had torn up a sidewalk . I think they were fixing the fire hydrant and the repair back was blacktop. So I looked into it. And I had -- actually Mr. Voldenberg looked into it. And we found out that that's temporary . They have four to six weeks to come back and repair it back to its 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 original condition . So I let that individual know that. I'm happy to see that the stormwater , the East Mountain stormwater construction is going to begin in the fall of 2024. And that Reilly Associates is apparently going to be looking into that ponding issue that was up by Mountain Lake where the West Nile was discovered so by Jimmy Wintermantle 's house. So I appreciate that. He's going to be addressing that. Also under 7-C that Chrysalis contract , I found out it's $38,500. That's the cost of that. And also -- oh, excuse me, under 7-C that wasn't the Chrysalis one. That was the -- I guess the last 7-D. But under 7-C, it's my understanding , first of all, that that's a service when you are looking for an attorney . They did put it out and esquire -- or Attorney Kathleen Thomas was the only bidder. So that's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few comments . Mr. King did get that piece back on the East Mountain stormwater . I'd also like to see if we could get, Mr. Voldenberg , an update on the West Mountain stormwater project what the timeline would be on that and when they plan on starting work as that study was completed the year prior. A few things, currently we have two directors that are out. We have our DPW Director that's out and out OECD Director that's out. These positions need to be filled. On March 29th according to the newspaper , we have an Acting Director for DPW. Has that ever been confirm ed by Council officially that we have an Acting DPW Director ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. According to the City Code, we have 35 days to have an acting director . Can we reach out to the administration to see is this director remaining active? What's there to be done to fill the position ? At this point in time we're 74 days in. So we're in violation of that City Code of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 35 days. So I'd like to see where we're going with that and what the -- what our plans are for OECD. And while we're at OECD, can we find out who is in charge of OECD while we do not have anyone in the position ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Last week or the week before we asked about a town hall meeting to discuss with the neighbors that are to be affected by the Meadowbrook Project . And we haven't had an answer back. But if we could follow up with them to see if a town hall meeting with the engineer s and the administration , possibly even the group that's doing the rights of ways could address those residents and their concerns . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out and have that scheduled . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Engine 15 was mention ed tonight . I know there was -- it came out about talk about selling the building . I think the last answer we got was that the building was being used for storage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 and we weren't to be selling the building . So if we could just get clarification , are we selling the building , has it been appraised and what was the appraisal price? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : The flower show, Miss Norma, I'm sorry, I'll be out of town that day so I won't be able to make it. But the last few years I was in attendance with my son and we had a very good time. So anybody that's out there watching , it is a good day to be had by all, interactive for the children . And I would recommend going to the Flower Show at Nay Aug on the last Saturday , whether it's the 28th or the 29th of the month of June. And that's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. Thank you. First off, I want to start off with the issues that are occurring on Myrtle Street on the -- specifically on the 1400 block with the Pennsylvania American Water project . I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 received several complaints , ongoing complaints about the shotty work that's being done there. And I know I've brought it up here before. But I was given a good synopsis of it from one of the residents on that street who explained that the project was supposedly done and complete d with curb-to-curb paving as of May 30th. Then last week a sinkhole formed and they came back to repair that and didn't even repair that properly because they didn't seal the edges of the patch around that area. And then they were back again today to dig up the street because supposedly they didn't hook up one of the residences to the water main, to the new water main. And it's assumed that maybe the place wasn't being rented because they must have been without water for a month. And I guess no one had noticed that someone wasn't occupying the residence . But if someone had, that would be a very long time to wait to be without water. And they also dumped a load of stone at the curb. There's a lot of debris around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 the area. And one of other neighbor s had also contacted me to say that they had drove one of the milling machines into the side of one of the trees in front of her house. You know, they left with broken branches . And let's see what else. They also left a piece of equipment parked on the street that took up three parking spots. And they came at midnight to remove it. That's a great time. And there's just so many complaints . And this is obviously not being done properly on this project . So I know that we've spoken before to Steve from American Water, certainly I want to reach out to him. But I also want to reach out to Reilly and get them to visit the area and find out why they've had to come back twice already and they're still performing shotty work along the 1,400 of Myrtle. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll involve Reilly Associates also, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one of the e-mails we had there were several other questions , some regarding the ordinance that the city has and the 800 block of North Irving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 which we previously received a complaint of if American Water's been contact ed because of the pothole and the poor restoration that occurred on that street. And I think mostly they just want to see that we enforce the ordinance that we have and that there are consequences for utility companies performing shotty work. And I also wanted to bring up another street. It doesn't have to do with the utility company . But it's a request for a paving and that is along the 500 block of Okell Court which is the alley behind Arthur Avenue. So I would like to send that over to DPW so they could check out the street and see if it's appropriate to add to future paving lists. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have them add it to the list. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And a couple weeks ago I requested the meeting minutes for the Unsheltered Task Force Committee that I had attended . But I don't think that we've received them to date. MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 DR. ROTHCHILD : So if we could put in another request for them, please. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one other thing that I have. Last week I brought up the weather normalization rate that some customers had been seeing appearing on their UGI bills. So there is -- UGI does have like an information sheet on what the weather normalization adjustment charge is. And the PUC had approved it apparently back into 2022 and as like a pilot program for us lucky customer s. And it said that the weather normalization adjustment will be applied under the following circumstances . And those are if temperatures are more than 3 percent colder than normal in a given month, then customers will receive a credit on their bill. If temperatures are more than 3 percent warmer than normal on a given month, customer s will receive a surcharge on their bill. And then in months of normal weather bills will not have this adjustment . So apparently it's been something that's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 around for a while and depends on the weather pattern s for normal versus abnormal weather expectations . And that's only between October 1st through May 31st of each year. So I'm happy to provide more information if needed, but that's what I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So first of all, I'd like applaud and say how proud I am of the police and fire department and their valiant efforts maintaining safety and professionalism with last weekend 's standoff, so kudos to you guys. I received response s to two questions I asked last week one. One I touched upon during public comment . But with regards to the Serrenti project that's been ongoing and the new one that's propose d at the CTC, I requested that both entities come in, the police and fire department , give us an update, tell us what's going on, what are they both going to utilized , the differentiation between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 the two. So that is going to be scheduled with our City Clerk, Mr. Voldenberg . So stay on top of that one because I would like to have that done before we go on break in August, okay, Mr. Voldenberg , please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And also, I requested Daniel Sefick who is the new auditing firm to come in and give us an update on 2023 audit. We were also -- the response I also receive d for that is we will look -- I'm sorry. We will work with CLA to determine optimal time for an in-person appearance . So we'll see what happens with that. I too have a concern about the two department heads that haven't been filled. And I know we've encountered this in the past. And we've heard, oh, well, it's acting but if it's interim , it's not acting. We've dealt with that before. Before we even hear that, it is what it is. The Code states that you have 35 days to replace. So please get us an update on that. Pods, we talked about them in the past. I remember we bringing them up once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 before. And there was a little confusion as the difference between that and say a dumpster . But I do believe in the Code -- well, first of all, if it's in your yard you could have it longer than in front of your house. The one you spoke of is there a couple years, right, so that's crazy. I know there might be some different language in the current zoning ordinance . So, Solicitor Gilbride , will you please take a look at that for us and then see where we're at with that and contact administration . And we'll get that address where that pod is located from you. We'll definitely take action on that. That's ridiculous . You also had a good point about storm drains who owns which ones. I received complaints all the time about storm drains that are being -- I usually have to reach out to DPW myself to see who's responsible for which ones or who owns. So I think that's a great idea that we get that information and post it on the website , you know, and so that saves people time from, you know, find out for themselves which one and call the appropriate entity that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 should be responsible for them. So let's please do that. Also, I have another one property is a nuisance and blight issues at 8 Oakwood Place. I guess there's at night, there's terrible, terrible time in the evening until midmorning . There's a lot of disruptive behavior at this house. There's quads driving all over the place parked up against the house. There's garbage all over the place. There's a fence that's falling down. And there's a pool in the back. So, you know, that's a safety issue. Can you please alert Code Enforcement to this property ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And I believe that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Last week we suspended the rules on legislation for St. James Manor Project . And I had comment ed that the legislation was sent to us at 3 p.m. that day. As it turns out, that was incorrect . And I should not have said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 because the information was not really accurate . So I apologize to our Law Department . It was not their fault. We didn't get it at 3 p.m. that day. So, Mr. Voldenberg , this and the following ones I have sent all of these over to you in an e-mail. Storm drain at Olive and Colfax again. And the status, I know it's on the demolition list. But 421 Colfax Avenue, approximately -- I mean, is it going to happen this year for the demolition or do we have an order or is there a -- MR. VOLDENBERG : It's in the demolition process . But I'll get a better timeframe on the process . MR. SMURL: If we can get a better idea of how long. Also, the newly paved road around the greenhouse at Nay Aug Park, they had dug out between the greenhouse and the road. There is about an 8 inch gap that's open there and cars are parking there. So the blacktop is going to start to peel there. So if we could ask if the contractor could either backfill that or tar it and then backfill because it's going to destroy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 the road we just put in there. And it goes the entire length of that road where they had milled it out so if they could take a look at that and hopefully repair it. I believe that was Pennsy Supply that did that one. Also, 800 block of Richter Avenue, potholes coming up the hill need to be patched . And the rear of 516 Palm Street, this one I've sent in multiple times. And the same two neighbors are calling again. It is overgrown again. I don't even know if people live in there. But if code enforcement could let us know what's happening there if it's abandoned or what we can do, board it up or -- it is a really bad structure . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's presently with the magistrate . I'll follow up. MR. SMURL: It is with the magistrate , okay, if we could find out what the next step is or no one is respond ing from the magistrate 's office. Also, I would like to send a request again to the Scranton Police Department , the Traffic Division and ask about the city ordinance that I've supplied before -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 the ordinance for tractor -trailer parking in the city. I want to know is there anything we could do or they need for us to change in Section 439-32 all the way down 439-93. It describes the trucks as tractor trailers , combination , a bus trailer . And what's not included in that is any city vehicle , fire apparatus , ambulances or any commercial truck were there is current construction going on. But these trucks -- I don't know about in everybody else's neighborhood . But if I drive 10 square blocks in my neighborhood on Sunday, I counted eight tractors . They were about I want to guess 10 feet wide. So your average car is six or seven. So you got to go out in the middle of the road to go around these things. They simply don't belong there. We have the ordinance for them. So -- and we also have I believe at one point they said there was no fine. But Section 439-93, a fine is not more than a hundred dollars total cost. Each day the violation exits shall constitute a separate violation . So that's in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 there now. So if there is anything else we need to add to that so we could start to ticket these commercial trucks in our neighborhood . And I know I've been asking this for well over a year. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And, I'm sorry, I did say to send this to you. But Engine 15 on Ash Street, I did send a -- I did ask the Mayor and Eileen Cipriani if it's at all possible to use that structure for Animal Control . I believe Animal Control right now is down at police headquarters , which there is no room. The reason I would like to see this is we have a building sitting vacant. They don't really have an office. They have vehicles . But, you know, they don't really have a home. And when we have what we had last week or the week before, you go in and you find 30 or 40 animals, there is nowhere to place them at that point. So I'm not looking to make it a permanent shelter , I'm looking to make it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 a temporary stop, put cages there and naturally the building is open now but use it as a staging area so we have something for our Animal Control people to work out of and to store these animals. I really don't want to make it a shelter for animals. I just want it so that if the police pick up a dog at 2:30 in the morning they are not driving out to Clarks Summit to the animal shelter to place the animal out there. They would have somewhere in the city they would be able to do that. The building right now belongs to us. So instead of selling it, maybe utilize it and take the Animal Control out of police headquarters . The bridge near McNichols School, the city had submitted an application -- a grant application . We are still waiting for the decision on that grant application . So that's what's holding that project up. And it isn't only that bridge. There's a lot of other work in that area that's included in that area. And I also did -- I got a request from the Zoning Board 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 again requesting a police officer at their zoning meetings. So I did ask the Mayor this morning . And I believe she sent that onto everyone else. And last thing, we were asked last week about the former Pennwood Manor building on Cedar Avenue. In the paper -- in the newspaper I saw a report. I don't know exactly what -- it was June 3rd. But the article was in the Scranton Times reported Congressman Matt Cartwright submitted a request to the House Appropriations Committee for 1.75 million dollars . And it said it was to redo a building in South Scranton and make it into affordable housing for low income at-risk veterans . I believe that's the building they are speaking about. I don't know anything else that large in South Scranton that we would be able to remodel with that much money. That's all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, two quick ones. Mr. Voldenberg , on 723 River Street, a neighbor expressed a concern . I guess the front of the house looks all right as the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 neighbors take care of it. But the back of the house, there's like a pool. It's been abandoned . And the grass is up as high as the fence. So if we could ask the Licensing and Inspection to stop by there. That would be greatly appreciated . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Also, you know, pave cuts seem to be a big issue that had been discussed here this evening . You know, number one, I think it's important that we find out what we're doing as a city as DPW to ensure that the pave cuts are -- I guess Reilly Associates is inspecting them for us now. That's all well and fine but we need a permanent solution to that. And actually , you know, the utilities we need to make sure that they're filling in these pave cuts the proper way. So and we'll maybe take a look at the ordinance for pave cuts and manhole covers if we could do that. Maybe I could ask, Solicitor Gilbride , if you could maybe take a look at that for us and see exactly what the ordinance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 says in terms of pave cuts and manhole covers. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. We're good? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time.

ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , as I said earlier , I had questions about administrative costs, the administrative costs on the money that's being sent over to the SRA with this MOU is set at 10 percent . Some of the answers that we received was that we received was that the fee covers the necessary costs associated with managing and administrating the funds. The SRA is going to undertake a range of project s focused on infrastructure enhancement , community development and economic revitalization . Much of the scope and specifications of this project will be developed after a completion of the North Scranton study and plan. The approach ensures that it's going to meet aesthetic and functional goals aligning with community needs and that they plan on sending detailed plans over to City Council . As this is a large some of money that will be going to North Scranton neighborhoods I will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 voting yes on this tonight . I wish that the Council (inaudible ) as we don't really have a strict deadline that's near. It's going out to September . So I think we could have got a little more clarity on the project s. But it is money that's going to be going towards revitalization and development in North Scranton . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to hold this up. But I'm not happy with the answers I got. And this happens a lot. I'll ask a question . And it's not that -- it's not the answer I'm looking for. I just don't get the answer. I get it in a different form. And then they provide new information . So the North Scranton Study Plan, who's doing it? Is it the SRA? Is it the city? I don't know. They don't tell us. Ten percent for the administrative cost could be, you know, how it's done it's either 2 and 10. Ten seems like a lot. What is the 10 going to be utilize d for?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 Is the 10 percent going to be utilize d for the salary of the SRA Director that we had to front in the beginning ? I don't know. Is it suppose d to get reimbursed ? I don't know. So -- and, well, I'm going to take the last sentence to heart. Detailed plans and timeline s will be provided to Council . So that's where we'll have to do our due diligence to make sure that these project s are what was original ly promised to the North Scranton residents . That's all I have. Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, one more on the question . As there is only one employee of the SRA, I would imagine those administrative costs are going to be going to that employee . I mean, we got some background info that said housing opportunities . Then some of the information as Mr. McAndrew said -- some of that original document ation said house opportunities in North Scranton , kind of threw me off because now the answer we're getting is infrastructure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 enhancement . I mean, I guess housing opportunities can fall under that somewhat , community development , possibly . Economic revitalization , maybe. But I would have liked some more clarity on the plan. But like I said, it is a lot of money going into the North Scranton revitaliz ation so I will not hold it up. MR. MCANDREW : So one more thing. So 10 percent is 90 grand, which is probably the salary. Interesting . Okay. MR. SMURL: Okay, roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-E legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : EIGHTH ORDER. 8-A. Resolution No. 49, 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR. SMURL: This resolution was taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for a final vote. If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn .
