Iwouldaskallinvolved withthe parties tobecooperative withthe investigation .CityCouncil through the Clerk'sOfficehasalready gathered together alloftheinformation thathasbeen requested .IwouldliketothanktheCity Clerk'sOfficeforthefinejobthatthey didgetting thisinformation together and filing aquickresponse . Onanother matter,Ihavespoken withthecityengineer ,JohnPocius,about thecondition ofEastMountain Road.After construction ,therewasaseamleftin middleoftheroadandthatoverthecourse ofthelastfewyearsaswebegantoopen up.Rightnowit'skindofpastthepoint ofaquickfixsowhentheweather breaks Mr.Pocius willgoupandtakealookat what'srequired forafinalrepair. Inregards totheSteamtown Market Group,Ihavecontacted Mr.Donahue ,whois1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 partofthatgroup,andoffered mysupport fortheproject .Asthistime,according to Mr.Donahue ,theyareactively trying to keepthisagrassrooteffort.They appreciated mysuggestion tobeinvolved , butactually atthistimetheydeclined my involvement ,butIdosupport theplanandI amanxious togetinvolved whenthetime arises.Andthat'sallIhaveforright now. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,thankyou.Afew briefitemsthatwerebrought upandthena couple ofotheritemstodiscuss .First, I'dliketothankcityengineer ,John Pocius,forhistimely response toan inquiry whereanoilcompany wasrefusing to deliver oilbecause ofthebridge wasn't certified .Iknowtheresident contacted Mr.Pocius,theycontacted measwell,and ourcityclerkaswelltheydidagreatjob andgotthistakencareofinaday,which isunheard ofincitygovernment . Next,therewasaquestion regarding thecurbcutsandthemoneybeingspentand1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 apossible street list,thereisnolist developed yet.Theletter states thatit willbeforreconstruction contracts tobe developed andbid,soasofthispointthere isnolistofstreets thatwillbe--orthe curbcutsandthepaving thatwilltake place,butwiththeissueofthecurbcuts thecityhastobeADAcompliant ,so unfunded payment fromthefederal government whereifthecurbcutsarehandicap accessible theydohavetobeuptothose standards sothat'swhyIlotoftimeyou willseethecurbcutsbeingdonein different neighbor hoodsandtheyareusually doneinconjunction withpaving projects , youwillseethestreet paving andthecurb cutsbeingreconstruct edandIbelieve when PennDOT pavesMainAvenue,whichislong overdue ,theywillbedoingcurbcutsas wellbecause ofthesameissue. Next,regarding thepensions I,too, amverypleasedtohearaboutthe investigation fromtheStatePoliceandfrom theAuditor General 'sOffice.Iamvery hopeful thattheywillgettothebottom of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 thisissue,andwhat'smostimportant forme istofindoutwhoauthorized thepayment of theseexcess pensions .Itappears itwasn't thePension Boardbyavote,soweneedto figure outwhyithappened andwhether it wasdonecriminally ,whether itwasdone accidently .Intheonecasescenario where moneyhasgonemissinginScranton so anything ispossible ,butIwouldliketo makearequest ,intheScranton Times article itwasmentioned thatAttorney Durkin reviewed documents thathefoundto besuspicious andthatiswhyhecontacted theStatePolice,soifit'sagreeable with mycolleagues Iwouldliketorequest those documents fromthePension Boardwhether it beonaconfidential basisjustforthe council members orwhether itbepublic knowledge .Idothinkweshould lookat thosedocuments andseewhat'sinitforour owninvestigation aswellifit'sagreeable ? MR.MCGOFF:CouldIjustask, Attorney Minora,woulditbeappropriate for ustorequest information thatisbeingused inanongoing investigation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR.MINORA:Well,it'sprobably public information tobeginwith,andIhave hadaconversation withAttorney Durkin and Iwouldsuspect thathewouldn'thaveany problem turning overanydocuments .Hehas beenveryforthright witheverything . MR.MCGOFF:Okay.Thankyou. MR.ROGAN:AsIwassaying,Ithink it'simportant forcouncil members toknow what'sgoingoninthisprocess andwhat documents theyAttorney Durkin readthat raised theredflagwithhimthathefelt theneedtocontacttheStatePolicesoI wouldliketoknowwhatwascontained in thosedocuments . And,finally ,Ithinkaswas mentioned bymanypeople tonight ,whileI'm hopeful thattheinvestigation sbytheState PoliceandtheAuditor General willgiveus afullpicture ofwhathappened during that timeperiod in2001,2002,whentheseexcess pensions wereauthorized Idothinkifall oftheanswers aren'tbrought outandwhat citycouncil islooking forweshould explore thepossibility ofsubpoenas atthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 pointandhaverightincouncil chambers a public question andanswer underoathto findoutexactly whathappened . Manyresidents havecontacted me regarding thisandtheyarecurious asto theroleoftheformer mayorandthe controller ,whether theywere--we'llsee iftheyaretheonesthatauthorized it,it doesn'tappear thateither orthemwere,but whatroledidtheytakeandwhydidthis takesolongtocomeoutisananother concern thatIhave.Whydidittakenearly amillion dollars beingdrained outofthe pension funduntilthatwasdiscovered ? AsImentioned lastweek,when Councilman Loscombe wasappointed tothe boarditwasmatter ofweekswhenitwas determined thathewasineligible andthe pension wasrightfullyrevoked ,butinthis caseitlingered formany,manyyearsand it'sonlythanks tothereporting ofthe Scranton Timesthatthisreally started to getoutthere,soIthinkweneedtogetto thebottom ofthatissue. Secondly ,regarding thearticle in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 thepaperonsnowremoval onthepedestrian bridges ,andthishasbeenanongoing issues IthinkaslongasIhavebeenoncouncil andprobably thesameforCouncilman McGoff whohasbeenhereabitlonger thanme,I didspeaktothemayorwhenthatarticle ran regarding thisissueandithassincebeen cleaned ,soI'mgladthatthemayorandour DPWDirector DennyGallagher didgetthat takencareof,butwhatwasexplained tome thesidewalks werecleared oncetheinitial snowstormcame,andthenwhenPennDOT came alongitpushed muchoftheslushandthe snowbackontothesidewalk thattheyfroze over,andonceitfreezes over,andanyone whogetsalittle behind ondoingtheirown driveway knowsit'smuchmoredifficult to remove atthatpoint. Wealsodiscussed acouple ofother ideasregarding thechanges tohowthecity sidewalks werebrought up,somepeople have onFacebook orwhereIsawsomegroups commenting wherethereusedtobeaprison release forthisissue,that--Ididbring thatuptothemayor,thatprogramhassent1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 wentaway,Idon'tknowifit'sbecause of theissuethecounty hadwiththatprogram underformer commissioners ,Ithinkeveryone remembers that,andtheotherissuewasone ofinsurance whereifsaycitycouncil wanted toadoptabridge andthefiveofus wouldbeincharge ofclearing theLinden Streetbridge,thatthereisanissueor insurance andtheircouldpossibly beunion issues,unfortunately . Andthatgetsmeintothesecond partofwhatIwanted totalkabout regarding PublicWorks.WhileIcommend our DPDirector DennyGallagher forcertainly doingthebestjobthathecan,andforthe timeIhavebeenoncouncil hehasbeenthe bestDPWdirector asfarasrequests from council andresidents thatwehavehadto dealwith,butattheendofdayit'snot thedirector thatgoesoutanddoesthework it'stheemployees .I'mhopeful thatwhen therevised recovery planisreleased it willcontain anefficiency studyfortheDPW andIhopethatefficiency studyiscarried outandthePublicWorkstrucks andevery1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 position arefollowed andsurveyed foraday tofindquicker waystodothesejobs.I havelongbelieved thatgarbage collection intheCityofScranton canbecompleted in fourdaysleaving thefifthdaytodoother things,pothole repair,whichweknoware solely needed,cleaning thebridges ,the manyotherthings,theparks,signs.We needmorepeople onthosejobs,too,and obviously thegarbage collection isabig partofthatjobandittakesupmostofthe timeandmanpower . Thatbeingsaid,Ihavelonged advocated forprivatization oftherefuse division oftheDPW.Manyothertownsand cities havedoneitandtheirgarbage fees arelessthan$300ayear.Byprivatizing therefuse portion ,thecitycouldkeepa smaller ,moreefficient DPWcrewtogoout anddothesesidewalks ,tocleanthe bridges ,tofillpotholes ,tocleanthe parks,dosigns,thethings thatweare hearing allofthetimethatarefalling through thecracks because somuchofthe focusisputonthetoppriority whichis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 collecting garbage andrecyclables . Sobottom lineregarding these issues,Iamhopeful thattherevised recovery planwhenwereceive thatcopy stillcontains thatlanguage .Thefirst draftcopywereceived didhavelanguage regarding efficiency studies fortheDPWand possible changes inthatdepartment ,Ihope thatthenewdocument thatweshould be receiving shortly willstillcontain those itemssoanoverhaul canbelooked atand hopefully apartial privatization ofthat department .Thankyou.

Butitshould notbeareflection on howwesolvethisproblem goingforward . Whether it'shiring casual part-timers, outsourcing theworktoprivate contractors through anRFPorevenworking withtheWork Release Centerweneedtofindapermanent solution thatwillsolvethisproblem once andforalleverywinter,everyyearfrom thispointon.I'mconfident that Councilman Gaughan ,astheChairperson of PublicWorksCommittee canworkwith1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Mr.Gallagher andtheadministration and formulateaplanandbringsomething backto citycouncil ifnecessary thatwewouldbe abletobesupport iveof.Iwill,of course,helpinanywayIcan.Noonewants toseethistocontinue andcertainly noone wantstoseeanyone gethurt. Onthepension ,adaycanhardly go bywithout another shockingdiscovery about ourpension plan.AlongwithCouncilman McGoff,Iattended thenewsconference by theAuditor General yesterday intheChamber building .First,wecertainly haveanally intheAG'sOfficebecause heisdefinitely aproponent ofthepension reform,butfor somereason theHouseandtheSenate andthe newGovernor inoffice donotappear tohave thatsamesenseofurgency .

Infact,theAGlatertookto Twitter tomakethefollowing revised comment s,"IfScranton doesn'thavea comprehensive fixtoit'spension situation within thenextthreeyearsthecitywillbe bankrupt ." Ourtrackrecord onpensions ,aswe allknow,hasbeenabysmal ,andmanyofthe dominans thatwereinplacefortheongoing andshocking pension revelations continue to beinplacetoday.Thatshould notbe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 acceptable toanyone.That'sallIhavefor now.Thankyou.
