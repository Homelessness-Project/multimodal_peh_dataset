CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA ECONOMY LEAGUE DATED NOVEMBER 16, 2019. 3-J. MEMORANDUM RECEIVED FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA ECONOMY LEAGUE DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2019 REGARDING THE PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX. MR. PERRY: Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just have one comment on the correspondence that we received from the Pennsylvania Economy League. I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 want to make one comment that over the, you know, over the last few years every budget season I've made a similar comment since I've been on Council that the projections and the -- the plan projection s that have been provided over the last few years from the Pennsylvania Economy League verse what is actually in the budget, in certain categories the percentage that we have been over budget is astounding and concerning . For example , this year -- and again, there's probably several reasons for this. But departmental expenditures were over the Exit Plan projections by almost 30 percent . Non departmental expenditures were over the budget -- or the Exit Plan projections rather by 40.3 percent . Capital expenditures were over the Exit Plan projections by 106.7 percent . I went back and looked at from 2020 to 2016 and I compared what the Exit Plan projections were over what the City had actually projected in their budget. And if you combine capital expenditures , departmental expenditures , non departmental expenditures , we've been over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 budget by almost 17 -- over 17 and a half million dollars . Now, I think there's some explanation s for that and some of that money might have been warranted . But if you're considering exiting Act 47, it's a concern when you don't stay in line or at least close to what the Pennsylvania Economy League had suggested or had projected in their Exit Plan. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Any other comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? I have comment s I'll make. First announcement , just a reminder that this week through November 30th, newspapers will not be picked up. DPW employees will instead be picking up leaves this week. Bagging of leaves is suggest ed. And leaf bags are free for resident s and may be picked up at DPW Headquarters on Poplar Street or at the Weston Fieldhouse on Providence Road. Again, leaves will be picked up this week, not newspapers .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 In observance of Thanksgiving holiday this week, City Hall will be closed on Thursday , November 28th and Friday, November 29th. And lastly, next Wednesday , December 4th at 4 p.m., Council will be holding a special caucus meeting in chamber s with members of the administration to discuss the 2020 operating budget. This caucus meeting will be open to the public. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern . Norma Jefferies Les Spindler Bob Bolus Ron Ellman Marie Schumacher Joan Hodowanitz Fay Franus Dave Dobrzyn Jeanie Murtagh {sic}) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. PERRY: Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, actually . I was not going to speak tonight because I was busy tracking down an audit and actually all of us up here are working on questions in anticipation of the public caucus on budget. So I thought I would let it go at that. But I have to say in light of Mr. Bolus's comments , I would be absolutely remiss if I didn't speak out. I have to go home to four children tonight . And I will not do that without speaking out against what he said here today. While there was laughter in the gallery , I found nothing funny about it. Speaking about someone 's sexual orientation to me in this respectable public forum of City Council , I thought the comment s were disappoint ing, discouraging , and deplorable at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 a minimum . If he had named the individual I think they would have been discriminatory and/or defamatory potentially . And under either scenario , I find them unconscionable , untenable , and unacceptable in this public forum. As it stands now, sexual orientation 's protected under federal law, Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act. It's also protected under state law, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. It's also protected under local Scranton Ordinance , which is actually quite liberally written and has been in effect for years. We were ahead of our time on that one. It is unconscionable to make these statements . The Scranton I know and the Scranton I love was born and created by a melting pot of ethnicities , races, national ities, and now sexual orientations . I like to believe and I want to believe that his opinion is one of the miniscule minority in the City. And I would hope that any member of this Council or any government or anyone would be welcomed in here with the same dignity , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 respect and kindness that I was, not only by these gentlemen to my right but by everyone in this building and all of you regardless of sexual orientation . I hope this does not have to be addressed again. Our Council rules prohibit it. I'm going to ask any of our -- whoever is holding the meeting in the future to please aggressively defend this. I'm going to ask our solicit or to step in if this happens again. It is unacceptable. And it should be prohibited . Joan, I'll make one final comment to you. I'm sorry that you resigned. But I would like to at least speak number one to Council 's commitment to the Ethics Board. Anyone who knows me knows I have been on that bandwagon since day one. And I know my Council mates have as well. Contrary to what a lot of people think, we talk a lot about behind the scenes, all of us. And each one of us wanted this to work and to move forward . And I want to defend Mayor Evans here in particular because I went to him on numerous occasions . As many people know, I'm trying to lead the charge to some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 extent to make sure that this Ethics Code is signed by the City of Scranton employees . And he has text me. He has called me. And he has participated in personal face-to-face meeting s with me about this code. And I will agree, City government does not work as quick as you want it to. I learned that very quickly as well. But we are committed. It will go on. Unfortunately , we will need to replace you. I'm hoping you're replaceable because I know you've done a ton of work. I thank you for the work you've done. But I do want to reiterate this Council 's commitment . And again, I have to say Mayor Evans I know is committed as well. And I think it would be unfair to characterize him in any other light. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the conversation we had last week with Mr. Srebro and some of the flooding issues that he has up at the Keyser Valley area. So we did send something out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the DPW and Mr. Gallagher asking for an update and then a potential followup meeting on that. So we'll wait to hear back from them. Related to that, we did receive some correspondence from our City Engineer which was forwarded by Mr. Bulzoni regarding the rehab of the stormwater system in on Briggs Street up in the Keyser Valley area. I just want to read really briefly because I'm sure people will be interested in this in that area, a project description . So the existing Briggs Street stormwater conveyance system was constructed in 1967. Since that time, additional stormwater conveyance piping has been connected to the system. Also additional development has occurred in surrounding area contributing runoff to the system. That's obviously one of the major issues in the area. Because of this and heavy storm events, the existing inlet bubbles over and stormwater sheet flows across Briggs Street onto the adjacent properties and streets . By constructing a new and more efficient stormwater conveyance system, these problems 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 will be eliminated in most storm events. The project will consistent of installing new and more efficient inlets and larger pipes to adequately convey the runoff to Keyser creek its original outlet point. The system has been cleaned and maintained by the City and the former Scranton Sewer Authority in the past. I do know that the City is going for grant funding . And I believe in the 2020 budget there is money in there to match that potential grant. So hopefully that project comes to fruition . The second thing I want to mention is, I too, as I mentioned , Miss Hodowanitz I'm sad to see you resigned from the Ethics Board. However , I will say again, I respect fully disagree with your statement that Council has not done enough. I think, first of all, you know, we didn't write the Ethics Code. We used Reading 's as a model and took many of the wording and really the spirit of that law and made it into our own. Secondly , Attorney Dempsey is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 correct . If, you know -- every time I ran into a roadblock in the last five years I would have resigned years ago. Attorney Dempsey is correct when she says that government does not move at the pace that all of us would like. Government is difficult to deal with. And keep in mind, especially -- and I'm not making excuses for this administration , but they're winding down now into a transition that's certainly not at full strength as they were at one point before Mayor Evans took office. But this year has been a difficult one with everything that went on. So I think we do have to take that into account . I am really confident that the Ethics Board is going to move forward . It is going to take on the training aspect and everything else. We are going to evaluate whether the figure that's in the budget is correct and sustainable . I know that you disagreed with that. But again, I know there's frustration there. But I'm really confident that moving forward it will be everything that it was suppose d to be when it was first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 hatched . And last thing I want to mention is Miss Jefferies had brought up the street signs. So when Council passed this legislation a few years ago, we were giving this company the authority to come in and basically create a database for us. Now, when you hear database, I remember when we were passing this legislation a lot of people said why can't someone from the DPW just go around and take a look at the sign and mark down whether it needs to be replaced or not. In fact, that was my first thought as well before it was explained to me. There's an awful lot that goes into this technology , number one, and into this database . And it is extremely beneficial to the City. Now, not only do we have a database , we have the technology to go along with it. We don't have the staff as you had pointed out. Mr. Reed was here a couple weeks ago. I think it's one and a half employees , or two employees , whatever it is. We don't have the staff that certain ly I think anyone on Council would like. But then again, we are a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 distressed City and we are always in some kind of financial turmoil over the last few years. So it's difficult to add in what probably should be seven, eight, nine, ten positions . And at one time I believe the employees in the Sign Department , there was a lot more employee s in there. So they're certainly not operating at full strength . I think, Miss Jefferies , what the plan is as I think I had mentioned to you previously , they're taking now all the data now that this company was able to compile . And they're working slowly because there is only limited staff. But they're working section by section . So it is going to take time to replace all the signs that were identified by this company . And there were quite a few from what I understand . It's going to take time to replace every single one of them. And I hope I answered all your questions . If I didn't, please let me know. But that's my understanding of the situation . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. And I have nothing at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MS. REED: 5-B.

MR. PERRY: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. GAUGHAN : I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. PERRY: I need a second, please. Someone say second. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. PERRY: Thank you. On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Sorry, I think there's a little confusion there. That's okay. So just a few things on this -- I lost my train of thought now. The first thing I'd like to do is make a motion to request that the administration provide City Council with an alternative analysis to the budget that has been presented . We could call that a Plan B. Realizing the speculative nature of the following items in the 2020 budget including 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 but not limited to the sale of refuse receivable s, the conversion of the refuse bill into the real estate tax bill, the lowering of the garbage bill from $300 to $250, and the conversion of the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to Payroll Preparation Tax. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor and a second. All those in favor signify by -- MR. GAUGHAN : I think on the question for the motion. MR. PERRY: Sorry, hang on for one second. On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , just in regards to this motion. I think, you know, over the last couple of days as we're looking at the budget and putting our question s and stating our concerns , one of the things that we would like to see and the reason that I made this motion is we would just like to see the administration provide a Plan B. With all of the moving parts in this budget as Mr. Bulzoni and Mayor Evans has described , my concern , I think my colleagues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 share this concern based on our conversations is that were one of these moving parts to stall out, we would be in a difficult position next year. So what we're asking for is for the administration to change the assumptions of the budget noting the ones that -- the major points that I had just made and give us assumptions if the budget -- if adverse things were to happen. For example , if the sale of refuse receivables didn't bring in 2.2 million dollars , whatever that figure is in the budget. If, for example , as many people had expressed and we expressed in the caucus the conversion of the refuse bill into the real estate tax bill, if that didn't pan out if it were challenged ; lowering the garbage bill from $300 to $250, also with the litigation that's involved with the garbage bill. I could go on and on. There is so many moving parts here that I think it would be malfeasance on our part not to look at an alternative and a Plan B just in case and hopefully we can all meet somewhere in the middle.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. PERRY: Yes, also, Mr. Gaughan 's right. We did discuss this. And this is something that the administration may very well have already done when they were putting together the budget models. But if they have, we haven't seen it. We've only seen the finished product of the budget that came to us. So I would like also to see any information that they may have and, if not, well, then this is a good time to bring up any kind of exit strategy , backdoor plan, secondary idea for if one of these many moving parts does not work because this budget is a little bit different than most. And there are more than one things that could hit a snag along the way. And if that happens , I want to have a parachute to get through this and not have a big hole in the budget come 2020. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? Ayes have it. So moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Now I'm still talking on the question with the actual legislation now. And I just want to go through a few things before we end here. As I mentioned , in looking at this budget I do think it's bit of a gamble. And I don't think that the City in its current financial state is in any position to take any major risks at this point. As I mentioned , the Mayor and the Business Administrator said there are many moving parts. My fear is that if one of those moving parts stalls out or does not materialize , the taxpayer s will be left holding the bag next year. And I do think it could be kicking the can down the road. So give us a Plan B I think something that's a little bit more realistic and sustainable . One of the things that I had mention ed in my motion was to conduct a sensitivity analysis and a Plan B to give us an idea of how much room the City has for each variable in this budget, each moving part to go the other way, to go adverse . So change the assumption s of the budget if adverse actions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 happen and assess the risk because there are a lot of risks in my opinion in this budget. One of the items that we had talked about and that I am still unclear on especial ly with the logistics is the conversion of the refuse bill rolled into the real estate tax bill. For example , and I talked to Mr. Bulzoni and the Mayor last week about this. We'll take a commercial business like Kelly's Pub and Eatery. Right now they pay a private hauler to take their garbage away. Under this new plan to roll the refuse bill into the real estate tax bill, Kelly's Pub now will get their real estate tax bill and they'll have to pay the refuse bill according to Mayor Evans and Mr. Bulzoni . So they're paying twice. They're paying for refuse removal , the service that they're not receiving and then they're paying to privately haul it away. I don't think that makes sense. And I think that could be definitely challenged . The second thing is in relation to apartment buildings . For example , anything over four units, they have to have a private 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 hauler. Under this plan the apartment building anything over four units would get a real estate tax bill and they'd have to pay $250 for a service that they are not receiving . Again, I could see that being challenge d. And I don't know if we're on shaky legal ground. The other part of that is an apartment that has less than four units. So right now each apartment is paying $250 for the garbage -- or $300 for the garbage they put out. Under this plan from what I understand , now the apartment building owner, the landlord will get one bill for the whole building . So they'll pay $250. Well, that's not fair either because for somebody like me who is in a home, I pay $300. Now everyone else is kind of getting away with not paying the garbage bill. Councilman Donahue had brought this up. People with multiple pieces of property in the City, will they get multiple bills? Okay, John Smith has four pieces of property . Does he get a thousand dollars worth of garbage bills? And then is he expected to come down to the Treasurer 's office or wherever to fight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 with them about the fact that he has a vacant piece of land? And the reason that, you know, you would think that this would be thought out and maybe it was. But as we were talking about in caucus, the system is screwed up right now. We got so many complaints over the last few years about people getting garbage bills that weren't supposed to get them and so on and so forth. So if you make this move and the details aren't thought out, I think you'll have a lot of angry people on your hand and could have more lawsuits . Lowering the garbage fee $50, well, that's great in theory. But if all the things that I just mentioned are challenged , then we may lose significant revenue because we're charging $50 less, not that, you know, anybody wants to pay $300, but from a financial standpoint it won't make much sense. Then next year we'll have to raise property taxes to make up for that in some way. And also in mention ing all that, we're under the guise of a major lawsuit with the trash bill. There's litigation ongoing. So how does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that play into this as well and when will that be resolved ? So those are the things that the logistic s that I hope we can get answered and clarified here December 4th before we pass this budget. And I fear that, again, we may be taking a gamble. Also, just on some of the bigger picture items, the sale of refuse receivables , this budget is, you know, propped up by the 2.2 million dollars that the administration is saying we're expecting to receive from the sale of refuse receivables . Now, I could be wrong. But I remember a few years ago the City entered into a contract with a company that is escaping my mind at the moment doing the same kind of deal. We did this I think in 2014 or 2015. I talked to Mr. Bulzoni last week. This is a complicated transaction . We don't know that we're going to get 2.2 million dollars . And Attorney Dempsey had mentioned in the back that -- and I agree with her that we would like to know what kind of data they're using to calculate that figure and how they came up with that figure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 How does this play into the transfer of delinquent refuse bill collection away from Northeast Revenue Services ? There's another variable that we're not really sure of yet. So if that money doesn't come in, we're looking at a deficit for next year. The Amnesty Program that is mention ed in the budget, we need more explanation on that. What does that look like? How much extra revenue do they expect to gain from that? It's not clear in the budget narratives . I mentioned this last week but I was not surprised . The healthcare increases in this budget are astronomical . Mr. Bulzoni states in his budget narrative that he underbudgeted the healthcare expenses last year. And I had brought this up last year. I thought we are understating expenditures in that regard. So we have several question s for Mr. Bulzoni on -- in the healthcare -- from a healthcare aspect. I won't go through all of them. But hopefully we can get that answered as well. The other thing that is noticeable in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 here is the spending. The spending over the last five years, capital expenditures , non departmental expenditures , departmental expenditures , as I mentioned at the start of the meeting if, you know, I just did my own analysis which wasn't difficult . We're spending almost 17 and a half million dollars over what the Exit Plan projected for those three budget categories . Now, I know that there is some explanation as to project s that had to be done over the last few years. But that's a really significant amount to stray from our Exit Plan projections . And, of course, PEL, the Pennsylvania Economy League has no issue again this year with the budget, surprise , surprise . Attorney Dempsey has been on this as was detailed in the paper the lack of the audit, which hopefully next week we'll get answers on. So the bottom line here, ladies and gentlemen , is what I would like to know is if you take out all the variable s in this budget, all the moving parts, we will have a deficit . So what does a tax increase look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 like? The Amoroso plan that everybody was all about the last few years, the recovery plan that everybody says they adhere to calls for moderate tax increases every year. I'm afraid that we've fallen into the trap -- and I mentioned this the last few years is, not to raise taxes for a few years because it's politically expedient and then, all of a sudden, everybody gets nailed with a major property tax increase . So I do think that we need clarification from the administration . We need to know what that tax increase would look like if we need to go that route. And all these variable s that I mentioned again, I think we need to know what the analysis looks like and what the Plan B is. And that's all I have. ATTY. DEMPSEY : At this time I'd like to make a motion to table Item 6-A. MR. PERRY: Excuse me, we're almost there. Is there anyone else on the question for Item 6-A? If not, then all those in favor passing -- 6-A passing reading by title signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. The ayes have it. So moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I would like to make a motion to table Item 6-A. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor and a second to table 6-A. Anyone on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just want to mention that the reason that we're tabling the budget, I like the approach that we're taking this year. In years prior as I had mentioned I think two or three weeks ago, I could never figure out why this was done. But Council would hold a budget session with the administration prior to the meeting for a half hour or 45 minutes and I would be here with quite a few questions and the clock would run out. I don't know if that was done purposely or if, you know, that is just the way it was. But I think this year what we're doing is tabling the budget, taking our time, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 not rushing through things, having a caucus on December 4th with Mr. Bulzoni and the Mayor and there's no clock on the caucus. We're going to go through hopefully all these questions and concerns and then December 9th I think is the plan for the final vote. But we do have until December 15th. So I just wanted to explain why we are tabling the budget tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. The ayes have it. So moved. MS. REED: SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

I just want to thank the administration and Chief Graziano for putting forward this legislation . It's something that I think really came about based on the Castle in North Scranton and the shooting there months and months and months ago. Hopefully this legislation will improve that area and other areas where these establishments operate all hours of the night and there's really no regulations on them. So hopefully this will improve that. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Yeah, there's such a good effort on this from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 spark that created this which was the Castle. And it was just a joint effort right from District Attorney , from our local Police Department , Chief Graziano and this body just making sure we institute something that prevents further issues happening at four in the morning , five in the morning , six in morning .
