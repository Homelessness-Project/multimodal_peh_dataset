MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one comment . I'd like to thank Director Cipriani for providing 3-F which is the list regarding the grants awarded to the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick comment . So 3-G, this is the first time I'm seeing this where we get actual responses for concerns , the blight and what issues we send correspondence down to the City. Now, we're getting actual feedback that's on record that we could see and so can our constituents when they go in and take a look. This is definitely new because I haven't seen it before. I like it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Yes, I agree. I want to thank Director Cipriani and the Licensing , Inspections , and Permits Department . There was a gentleman I think his name was George Semian who came several weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 ago with several issues as Councilman McAndrew had noted regarding the downtown . And they addressed all of those concerns in Third Order tonight . So I do appreciate that. Also, I wanted to point out 3-H I had asked the DPW, Miss Jeffries had asked for an update on the sign inventory in the City and the replacement of faded street signs and stop signs and whatnot. And I do want to thank Director Preambo for getting us the report through July of 2021 on what signs have been replaced. Also, I wanted to mention that 3-I is the letter that was drafted by Solicitor Hayes. Council voted to send a letter to the Pennsylvania Auditor General requesting a performance audit of the DEP approval of the Keystone Sanitary Landfill Phase Three Expansion Application . Our office has been in touch with the Auditor General 's office and they are reviewing our request . Anyone else? Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? I have one. There's going to be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 summer picnic held at the Waldorf Park on East Mountain in memory of Bill Tonkin, Sunday, August 15th, 2021 rain or shine.

Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I'm still waiting for the Collective Bargaining Agreements for the Firefighters ' Union and the Single Tax Office to be reposted on the website . As of this morning , they were not there. Next, when will you hold a public caucus on the status of the Serrenti Center and its past and future costs? MR. GAUGHAN : That is current -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Do you have a date? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we don't have a date yet. That is being coordinated with the administration . I expect if it's not -- it won't be next week because the administration 's coming in. If it's not the following week it will be in September . MS. HODOWANITZ : In September , okay. Next, what is the mission of the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority and how does it differ from the propose d health department ? I agree with the recent Times-Tribune editorial that we need a county local health department not one that serves only the needs of Scrantonians . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 But I'm unclear about -- I honestly don't know what this health and welfare department does if it's got the word health in there. Please somebody explain to me what it does, what its primary mission is and how it's going to differ from this proposed health department . Next, are there any plans to develop a county wide regional stormwater management authority ? And if not, what is the status of Scranton 's plans, if any? And finally , with regard to the correspondence from LIPS that you referred to in Third Order, Item 3-G, violation letters were sent to at least three entities . Does LIPS follow up these letters or do they simply move onto the next situation ? And is this contributing to our problems with blighted properties ? Also, with regard to Item 1-F in their correspondence , resident claims sidewalks are being paved by various businesses downtown when they are require d to repair sidewalks with concrete . This is LIPS' response . Quote, this is an issue that the City is aware of. The City is unable to order the business to change 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the work, unquote. So what happens next? Is the City going to do something that they can make a change or create an ordinance or do we just suck it up? I don't know, you know, I was not impressed by the correspondence sent forth by LIPS. It wasn't all that informative to me. It didn't look to me like it took a lot of time. And then the resolution request cover sheets that you get on your legislation , two of them for tonight from OECD, I sat down and read them. And I don't know, maybe they're informative for you on Council . But I don't think they're that informative for the public, you know, just one-liners. It didn't seem a lot of thought and effort went into to them. And at the very end, you know, including any other pertinent details or relevant information that the Council should be aware of. Okay, it's directed towards the Council . But they should also be keeping in mind the fact that the general public is reading these. I don't know, maybe you and OECD have a secret code, you know, and it all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 makes sense to you. But I would like to see more on some of the answers provided . I'm sure that all the departments are aware that this is going on item three in your Third Order and will be read by some people in the audience . Also, I was surprised to see that Mr. Basalyga wants to build a 17 story high rise where the Red Carpet Inn stands today. Do you really think we need a 17 story high rise? I wonder how he's going to fund that and where he's going to be looking for funding . And I think that may be a little bit overreach. I think some thought needs to go into that before he starts pouring concrete and paving sidewalks . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a nice night. Next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton . And as all of you know over the last what, three, four years I have been on a rampage about the street signs. I returned to Scranton . I grew up in Scranton . And after I got married I moved 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 to South Jersey down in the Cherry Hill area. And after I became a widow I came back to Scranton . You always come back to Scranton for some reason or other. But when I returned , I just continuously got lost. And I'm only going through this because others may not know my story. And so I kept coming to Council giving them spreadsheet s of streets that were missing street signs because my GPS would tell me to take a right here and there was no street sign. So, you know, Council kept me informed as to how things were going. So finally they did say that they had hired K and S Engineering to take care of our situation . To me, I kept thinking what is that ever going to do to help us find our City streets and all. So they finished their project and they put up a database with all the missing signs. And, you know, and still -- I'm still not seeing any signs on the street. So let's fast forward to two weeks ago. I received a call from DPW. And I'm thinking , what the devil do they ever want to call me for? You know, what did I ever say at Council ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 So it was Tom Preambo and his office calling and they wanted to give me a tour. Well, I was going to be out of town the week that they wanted me to come down. But I did go last week. And I stand here tonight to say that they have an awesome operation down there. They have all the equipment to make the signs. And they took me through and showed the material that they make the signs with. And it's very updated. It's going to be -- it's reflective of the streets and sun so that it could last longer so that our children -- well, not my children but my grandchildren and any of those coming along, those street signs should last for quite a while. So we shouldn 't have the problem that we're having today. And the thing that really blew my mind completely was that Mr. Preambo did show me the database and, you know, it was just so interesting to see that. And there was 90,000 signs and street signs that are in that database . I was, like, 90,000? Do we even have that many corners and streets in Scranton ? But I guess we do. So that was a good $280,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 or whatever it was that was spent on that database because they do have personnel that goes in and they update that database with any street signs need to be -- that have been replaced. And he told me, they said start looking around. You'll see them. And I did. For the people out there, for the general public, you know, look around because your street signs are going up and they are busy making them. The team down there, they need help. There's only -- I think there was like four people that was there. One was part time or something like that. But I ask you, Council , and to anyone else that's on with the budget for 2022 if you could add some personnel . Because to get to those 90,000 entries on that database , we would be from here to kingdom come getting it done. And we all deserve to see good street signs, good stop signs as we go around for our safety as we go and we proceed , you know. And I read the paper where these businesses want to build new building s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 apartments and everything . That's all part of it to make our streets very visible to the public. So again, I just want to thank Tom Preambo and Celeste his supervisor that took me on the tour. Everyone was just so gracious to me. I even had a jacket, you know the jackets that they wear. And I had one of those and it was great. So I do thank them for that. Just one other thing that just blew my mind, I was never close to a DPW trash truck. They are huge. I stood there and because we were going around the whole place. And I thought , wow, you know, you see them from a distance when they take your trash. But that was my first experience being close up to them. And they are huge. And it's quite an operation down there on -- is it Popular Street? I think it is. So I just stand here to say thank you to everyone down there at the DPW and to let the citizens of Scranton , resident s of Scranton know that work is being done and their signs are going to be going up, okay? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Mrs. Jeffries . We appreciate it. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here tonight is that before this Council goes on its break, I think they should sit down with the Mayor and have a discussion about allowing people to put their name on the ballot to do a study of the charter so that the residents could determine whether they want to change the charter or abolish the charter . A lot of people come here and ask question s of this Council . And they don't get answers. But if this charter is rewritten in a certain way, there will be no need to come and ask Council any questions that have anything to do with City business because the resident s of this City could write a charter that would allow them to see anything legal by law for them to view by just rewriting the charter . It could also give them tools to hold Council members and the Mayor accountable to the public by writing into the charter . They could change almost everything about this City government in that charter and solve all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the City's problems just with one stroke. And I think that that's something that this City should really consider considering that the Mayor and the Council should be empowering the resident s of this City to make changes necessary to make Scranton a prosperous community once again as it's never been that my entire lifetime . We do study after study and squander millions and millions of dollars and the effect is blight, mismanagement , corruption and a host of other things. And I just think it's time to put the ball back in the court of the resident s and let them make a decision on the amount of taxation they want to pay, the direction they want their city to go in. And I hope someone in the school board would stand up and do something for the children in this district who are being shortchanged educationally by picking up an ink pen and taking yourself downtown to the courthouse . The other thing is, today in 6-A we're going to I guess consider something naming something after Joseph Biden, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 President of the United States. And I'd like this Council to vote no on that. And I have a host of reasons why. I think this president is a divider. I also think that this president is misleading the American people on a host of different things. He's fighting an audit of the presidential election and the right of the people to know how the votes were cast, where they were cast and if they were real. Not only is he doing that, but he's allowed our border to sit open as people cross the border. And in my opinion , people are losing their children to fentanyl based heroin and fentanyl is streaming across our border. Sixty-one percent of women have been sexually assaulted that come across that border. These were statistics . Okay, we need to take a good look at why the state of Texas is trying to stop the flow of illegal people that cross our borders and not just Mexican people but people from all over the world. And I think that the one thing the government was founded for was to protect its residents . We see a host of other things he's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 presented , none of them good. And when the things he says are studied under a light, they find that they are not true. His whole administration is falling apart. And I just hope that, you know, some of the people would wake up and see that it's all right to name things after people when they're deceased but not when they're alive and not when there is so much controversy tied to them. Now, there's not one street in this country from Wikipedia because before I came here I asked that question . There is not one street named after this man in this country . And do we want to name a street after a man tied up in so much controversy and later find out that he's just misused his office? Don't forget that his son has acknowledged that he's taken money from Mexico, Ukraine , Russia and he's used it to live on. Think about that as the President of the United States and Vice President . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . It's nice to see some fresh new faces out here, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 isn't it, in the audience . You know, I think there's a difference between criticizing someone and bad-mouthing them. I wasn't bad-mouthing the Mayor last week. I'm not mad at her about nothing yet the way things have gone. I hope she could terminate this firework sales. They're just nothing -- nothing good about fireworks. And I'd appreciate her interest in trying to save these foreclosed houses. I think Mr. Shapiro needs to come in here and do something about this 10 percent lawyers' fee before it ends up like the Sewer Authority just enriching a bunch of attorneys . But as I remember , I think it was three years ago that the county commissioners had litigation that limited it to five percent . Am I wrong or -- anyway, that's the -- I remember it from years ago it went on. You know, you're talking about the most precious thing that people ever have and to make it harder, they're going through enough. And the few that attempt to save their homes, it seems like everybody is against them. I haven't run into anybody yet. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 there's a couple organizations to help them. I have talked to a couple of people at the grocery store that are just really against renaming a street after Biden when there is so many locations that wouldn't cause all of this chaos. And while I think of it, I walk my little puppy every day at Weston Park. Yesterday the pool was open and today it was closed. Is that because of the lifeguard problem ? There was very few people there yesterday . I didn't know it was open until I went up there. You know, you had such a good idea last year paying to have them go to school so they could work. I don't know what happened with it. It just seems like young people don't want to work. Next door to me are a bunch of people from -- not Spain -- anyway, they can't speak a word of English . And they try to tell me -- they clean offices at night. They come and go all night long. They are the hardest working little guys. They don't -- they just don't give a problem . What, they've been there four 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 or five years. There's no radios blaring. No -- they bring my garbage cans up. It's just all kinds of help like that. There is a young boy that walks back to the grocery story. I asked him this winter if he wanted to do my snow. I have snowblowers and that. You know all he had to do was push it for 10 or 15 dollars . I never seen nothing like it. When I was young, we used to caddy nine holes for a quarter . That's when you had to carry them. They didn't have anything . Now nobody wants to do nothing . I tried to get a boy this week to change a tire on my son's truck. He didn't even ask me what I'd pay him. He just said no. I don't know where you're going to find lifeguards. It's a shame that so much work went into that pool because I pass there every single day and saw they emptied it and cleaned it. What a waste. What a waste. Anyway, it's hard for me to explain the difference between criticism . Maybe my criticisms are too harsh or something . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ELLMAN: What do you think? MR. GAUGHAN : No, I think you're fine. I think you're pleasant . MR. ELLMAN: It's time to shut up and sit down. I know. I hear that every -- MR. GAUGHAN : You said that not me. MR. ELLMAN: I think you got a loaded clock is what I think. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Danielle Fleming . MS. FLEMING : Hello Council . My name is Danielle Flemming . And I own Noteology Olfactif with my husband Mark Bonfiglio . We are proud Scranton business owners. We're on the corner of Wyoming and Spruce if you're not familiar with us. And I am here to just voice some concern s about renaming Spruce Street be Biden -- I'm not sure what it's going to be, Biden Way. It poses a couple of issues for us as business owners. The first part is sort of the obvious one with marketing . We have to change every single printed material that has our address on it. Just for example , I printed out everything for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 holiday last week. And that was to the tune of a thousand dollars . It would have to be reprinted . So it's all of our marketing materials . It's every single piece that we print with our names. And that is sort of an obvious one. There is also a lot time that goes into it. It's not just simply reprinting . We have to work with our graphic designers . We have to have everything reprinted again. And we have to contact all of our suppliers with our new address, which is free but putting them all together , we probably have over 200 different suppliers that we work with that we would need to contact . But probably the most significant impact for us, we're on the corner of Wyoming and Spruce. We go from 401 to 405 with our two business , Noteology and Olfactif . So we have significant real estate on that corner. And we have spent -- we have been there eight years now. We have spent a lot of money on SEO and search engine optimization as well as geotargeting to get people to come to that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 corner to come into our store. Our experience is about where you come in and make your own perfume with our scent designers . We get people coming from all over the country for that experience . Last time we calculated 36 states have been represent ed in our shop. Also, we have people coming all over from Europe actually , surprising to us. So to do that though, we have spent significant monies in geotargeting , engine search optimization to get recognized so that when you're searching for things to do in Scranton , we pop up. So that would all have to change because we would have to really erase the eight years of that work and put it towards the new address . So it's something that we built proudly . And we don't quite understand why it would have to all be erased when we could just do the Scranton Expressway -- the Central Expressway where it would not affect any of the business owners. We would stay on Spruce. Nothing has to be changed , no time has to be put in, no extra money has to be ever spent, no work has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to be redone. And it could just be on the Scranton Expressway which we 100 percent support and are proud of the fact that Biden is from Scranton . But it would not adversely affect the business that are on Spruce. So we are asking that you would reconsider naming the Spruce Street portion of the ordinance that you're looking to put into play. I believe that is it. Yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Mark -- MS. FLEMING : He just signed in with me. We're here for the first time so -- we're good. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. I don't want to mispronounce his last name. Next speaker is David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . The last speaker had some pretty pressing -- I had a small mailbox in a small town up in Susquehanna County. And I'd get all this mail. And I was only there on Saturday morning to pick it up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And I had my checks and everything else printed up with my address Box 36. And I received a sermon just about every day I walked in here. Years back -- many years back I mentioned on lifeguards would it be possible to set up a lifeguard course for senior students at the high school, maybe swim team or something like that that they could train in the winter time and possibly then we would have lifeguards because we never had lifeguards. Every year it's been the same story and with pools open late and they closed in the middle of August. And a thought popped into my head last week on that IT business . We always hear about all of this possible help from the colleges and universities . Could we possibly get some freebies from the Scranton University to provide courses to advance people that already work in City Hall and qualify them for to move up over years and also possibly lend us a hand with something like the IT Department . It's an interesting thought . It's been said time and time again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 we should go to the Scranton University for help with accounting and things. And I don't know if our last mayor was interested in anybody looking in the books but that's besides the point. It's something that could be done and should be done. In the automotive field your employer is also responsible for new model training and everything else so -- not that you really get it. It's usually learned while (inaudible ) program . That's besides the point too. Once again, the COVID cases are on the uptick slightly . And I think we'll see more. And please vaccinate . It's -- it would be terrible to see after these last 15 months that we're right back at square one maybe next spring or something like that. Not good. Once again, contact your Congress man, 188-453-3211, 202-224-3121 or 202-225-3121 and push For The People Act. I don't know if you've seen the news, but in Texas the people from Texas are AWOL, the democrats from the Texas Congress . And they can't pass voter suppression laws and all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 these ridiculous things. I mean, they're trying to make it a criminal thing for you to just do the wrong thing sitting there passing out ballots and taking signatures . It's totally ridiculous and it's undemocrat ic. We have two senators if you could contact Manchin and Sinema and put that filibuster aside, especially for voting. Everybody should have the right to vote. I don't care if I buy a ticket, a scratch off and it drops out of my pocket and there's somebody sipping out of a bottle down at the courthouse and it turns out to be a $50,000 winner, they have to pay taxes on that. And that being said, anybody that is taxable, not tax paying but taxable should have the right to vote. I mean, there is a man was put -- he had a month and a half of parole. And he's possibly going to serve four years in Texas for voting. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : He had a month and a half to go. So it's getting down the to wire. Have a good one. MR. GAUGHAN : Have a good night. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Thank you. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Speaking of extra training , it came to my mind as I was thinking last week we're moving towards a dot gov platform for our infrastructure for our electronic s and presentation in Scranton . It would be nice if the Mayor or Council got together with a City who is already on that platform whether they are mayor or whatever legislative body is on there and form the internship between them so that our people who are not trained in it because it's not present can go down there and actually view a live system beforehand and get a little hands-on or at least some observation of how the system works before they're presented with it. This would give them a wider scope and the platform actually provide d a list of cities and governments who are actually on that the platform. It makes eminent sense for people who are going to be thrown into the deep end of the pool beforehand if we can ease them in by sending them off to a live presentation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 of actual data being done by a city that's using this platform and viewing it themselves . The Avero contract , I find that putting it -- that it's putting the horse before the cart. We have Bedrock currently running the IT and infrastructure . I would love to see from them a mapping of what -- where they think we should be going. They've been working with the City for months now. They should have a concept of what the City needs, what change it needs, where it's lacking in infrastructure because they're now supporting it. Even if we don't have people in our own IT department who can give that map out, they're getting paid $12,750 a year for this input. We might as well use that input since it's not as Avero a per hour contract . It's a flat fee, tap into that resource a little bit and see if they can at least give us a direction before we throw more money at the situation . I understand the $50,000 is a grant. I don't understand if that $50,000 grant is specific to this contract or it could be used 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 for any other contract along the way or any other project that might be more beneficial for the City. I don't know the boundaries of the Act 47 grant itself as they haven't been made public. It's just there's a grant out there that's been directed towards this. Last for Biden Way, I do understand the impact for the City resident s on business and streets . There's a lot in business branding. There's a lot that is involved in paperwork . The mail service gets confused for delivering packages to homes that have been there for 50 years. And they have a new mailman and it arrives at a neighbor or some other street. Oak Avenue winds up at Oak Street. Now we're changing streets and businesses . Sarcastically , I think the highway is the best naming for it because at 11 years old, he was on the highway out of Scranton . I support Biden. I support the direction of this. But I don't think it is in the best interest of the businesses and the city involved to have the local streets named 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 after President Biden. I think it would be better just for the highway . And because I had extra time last week, I'm off early. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Is there anyone else in the audience who would like to address the Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, I would like to say that I hope that the stormwater report from HRG will be available before you all go on your August recess. I also hope that when you return in September that the sound system is improved. I have high hopes for that. But I came tonight because I was very interested in what the chamber had to say and I heard nothing , absolutely nothing back there. I tried to change. But anyway -- and it doesn't really matter but we need to be able to -- we need improvement in this body. I also want to state that I do agree with Lee Morgan. It's time for a review. We have not had anything since the I think it was 2001, 2002. And I think it's time we have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 review. Now moving onto 6-A. Our forefathers were -- named streets . They named them for common things and they named them for extraordinary people. The Lackawanna Avenue was based on an Indian name I believe that word meaning stream that forks. So that was named after the river. And then we go down, of course, we go Jefferson , Adams, Wyoming . Wyoming again is another word that comes from the Indians . It was first used by whites as the name for a valley in Pennsylvania where a portion of the Delaware tribe of Indians lived. And that is how Wyoming gets in. Mifflin , of course, was a delegate as you probably already know. Back when they taught school I think you all went when they taught civics. But he was a signer -- went to the Philadelphia convention and signed the United States Constitution . When you go the other direction , I'll get away from the avenues and you go to the streets. They were for trees. Starting with Spruce, which as we all know is a very -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 I think at least -- a majestic tall evergreen. Then you go from Spruce to Linden to Mulberry to Vine to Olive to Pine, Myrtle, Ash, Popular, Walnut, Larch and all of those are trees, the names of trees. And that is something that everybody can get behind. I believe that this whole thing has been with 6-A has been poorly done. The handpicked committee , I think we all knew going in what they would come out with. And I don't think there were any parameters for why it was -- and I don't think -- I did not see a legal notice for any public input from average citizens or from businesses , which fortunately at least one is here tonight . So I think you all look at a man and want to reward him for things that he had nothing to do with, where he was born. That's where his mother was in Scranton and things he otherwise had no control over; where his grandparents came from because they came from the same whatever place in Ireland, nothing that he did. And I think the basis for such an endeavor of this is something that should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 done for something extraordinary . And I don't think we've seen any extraordinary . And I do believe it's divisive and that you have jumped the gun and should wait until the Commander-in-Chief is out of office at least, if not deceased . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. MOLFETAS : Alex Molfetas , downtown Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : Excuse me, the clock didn't start yet. Okay. Go ahead. MR. MOLFETAS : Council President , you know, esteemed Members of Council , I'm here before you today regarding Resolution or Council No. 77 of 2021, which is to be approved to change the name of Spruce Street in downtown Scranton to Biden Street based on the report and recommendation of an ad hoc committee for exploring feasibility of renaming a prominent roadway in honor of United States President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. The report was dated June 30th, 2021. The committee recommended naming Spruce Street as opposed to the original idea of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Wyoming Avenue after our President , Joseph R. Biden. The committee set several criteria in which they based their decision , most notably Spruce Street is only comprised of six blocks. Renaming this roadway would have limited impact on City resident s and businesses who need to change their mailing address , end quote. They also stated, quote, because Spruce Street is a City street no approval from PennDOT or other state agencies would be required to name it. Lastly, Spruce Street's existing name has no historical or cultural significance to Scranton , end quote. Finally , they state that, quote, we believe that renaming two roadway s in honor of President Biden is both appropriate and feasible . The committee recognize s that there will be resident s and businesses situated along Spruce Street who will require to change their address and stationary and website s. However , we believe the long-term benefits of celebrating Scranton 's important role in the formation of a U.S. President and the history tourism it could bring would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 outweigh the short-term inconvenience caused by this name change, end quote. Myself, along with many other businesses and resident s of the City only became of aware of this change to Spruce Street recently due to an article publish ed in the Scranton Times on Saturday , July 3rd, 2021. In response , I am providing the following information and evidence clearly showing this resolution should not be passed renaming Spruce Street or any other street in downtown 's business district but only done on the Central Scranton Expressway . It's important for you to understand that this is in no way political or a suggestion that it would not be appropriate to name something in the City to honor our President , Joseph R. Biden, Jr. It just should not be Spruce Street or any street in the downtown district . I could say this comfortably knowing that as elected City Council members your state of duties is to represent the best interest of your fellow citizens , businesses and stakeholders in the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 And I know that the overwhelming majority of citizens , business es and stakeholders directly affected by the name change are opposed. I could state this because I've spent at least the last five days talking to and meeting with resident s and businesses located on Spruce Street as well as listening to the complaint s of direct opposition to the name change. Everyone does agree that naming the expressway would be appropriate and a much greater value as the first signage that people see when they come into our City much like the Welcome to Scranton in the opening segment of the Office. In support of this opposition I have obtained many signature s on a petition from business es and resident s of Spruce Street who are directly impacted and oppose the name change. I could also state that over a hundred people that I have interacted with across party lines cannot the see the value in making this change. There are also those on Spruce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Street who are unfortunately afraid to let their voices be heard for fear it may have a negative impact on their business . I know this is not what any one of you on Council would want. The statement that this change would have limited impact is only -- and is only about address changes is not the case. The statement that Spruce Street has no historical and cultural significance to Scranton is also not the case. Also, no one understands how changing the name will result in long-term benefits to resident s and businesses on Spruce Street or in the downtown that will outweigh the burdens of this change. Finally , it is not right to say to business es that this is a short-term inconvenience when, in fact, it's much more than that. It is financial as well as time, resource -- time and resource burden. I have had a few business owners confide in me that they would rather spend the money to relocate their business outside of Scranton if this change happens .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Rather than go on, I had a list prepared . I don't have as much time as I thought and all are supported by the attached petition that I e-mailed and, you know, I'm here to be the voice for my fellow resident s downtown . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. MOLFETAS : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. It's been brought to my attention on 9th and Eynon that there is a stop sign -- I don't know if it's not visible enough. I know there's been some situations , three cars have ran that stop sign and hit a -- actually hit a house on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 property . So, you know, a concerned resident reached out to me. Mr. Voldenberg , maybe you could send some correspondence to the Police Department . Maybe they need to check and see if anything is obstructing this stop sign and maybe add crosswalks , paint it like the City has done recently . I think that might be a help if you could please do that. And secondly, I asked for a job description for the new business manager . I'm close to four weeks now I think. Have we heard anything on it? MR. VOLDENBERG : Nothing yet, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Can you please inquire again? MR. VOLDENBERG : First thing tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 contact ed by a resident who is involved with the Scranton Little League. And there were some issues and concerns with Harmon Field that she's been working on for quite some time and trying to contact the City about. They're working on getting grants in order to pay for new LED lights on the field and also for handicap accessible bathrooms which are appropriate considering they also host the Challenger League for children with disabilities at that location . And I would request that we send correspondence to Mary Pat Ward and Brooke Newhart . Those were the people that she was in touch with that I would like to get an update from on this project . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just quickly going off of what Mr. Ellman brought up about Weston Park pool. It was closed for a couple weeks. But due to our lack of lifeguards we will -- the City will be opening Weston Park pool on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 12 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 6; and Connell Park pool is open in South Side on Tuesday s, Thursday s and Saturdays from 12 to 6. And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have quite a few. So the first thing that I wanted to mention tonight was that we are -- we did receive word back from the DPW Director . Council had requested a public caucus with the DPW on several matters . They are not available to meet with us in the next two weeks so we're going to see if we can have a public caucus in September . Mr. Preambo did call me yesterday and I did not get a chance to call him back yet. But I will call him tomorrow . And while we're on that topic, I am going to have -- I am going to have a conversation with the Mayor. We talked about it last year around this time about having a public caucus with all of the department heads to give us an update on things going on within their department and how the departments are progressing . At least quarterly I think would be a very, very good idea. I said that in the past to different administrations and it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 not happened . But I do think the last time I spoke with Mayor Cognetti about it she was very receptive to it. If we do it quarterly , that way it's built in. And we won't always have to be asking all of these questions . A lot of the department s in the City do a lot of great things. And I think that they should come before Council and have that interaction with us. They do this at county commissioner meetings , school board meeting s. And I think we should do it here in the City. As I mentioned earlier , we are still waiting on a date for the caucus regarding the Serrenti Center and when that will be scheduled . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could just double-check on that. I'm assuming that it will probably end up being in September since we are in recess in the month of August. I did speak with Larry West, the Business Administrator recently . And they are trying to put together a caucus which will also probably be in September at this point regarding the Meadow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Brook Creek Project . Council was suppose d to have a meeting on the status of upgrade s to Nay Aug pool and regarding the study that was completed . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could check on that. I did have a meeting scheduled but it had to be cancelled . So if we can try to reschedule that. We had within the last two or three months have had several discussions regarding the very comprehensive study that was produced regarding the Nay Aug pool. I think everyone is disappoint ed that it's not open. But it's very hopeful on what it's going to look like if we can put funding into that pool. I receive d a complaint about the 1800 block of Clearview Street, a hose broke on a DPW truck and hydraulic fluid spread all over homes and properties there. DPW was out to clean it up. I was out there this past weekend after a neighbor had stopped me and I do have several questions . So we did send correspondence to Mr. Preambo at the DPW. And I'm going to get in touch with him tomorrow for further 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 information on that. And then I had also recommended that they go out and meet with the neighbors . They did clean it up. But the one woman I was at her house, the roof is damaged . The pavement is -- has marks on it. The lawns are ruined and some of the shrubbery and other things have been damaged . So there is still questions about that incident . Also receive d a complaint from several residents in Minooka about the CVS on Davis Street. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could please send correspondence to the LIPS Department to send an inspector out there to cite them. They have been apparently warned repeatedly about weeds and sumac and other things that are littering the area around the business . And the people in Minooka are not happy about that. So if we can send something to Licensing and Inspection s I would appreciate it. Also the intersection s of Clay Avenue and Vine Street, the crosswalks have been painted. So I want to thank the DPW for that. That is a dangerous intersection in which there was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 very serious accident recently . Council received a flooding complaint at 1248 Snyder Avenue. We did alert the DPW who has already as we found out been in contact with the resident . So we're hoping that can be taken care of as well. I also receive d a call from a resident on East Mountain who is concerned about Wintermantle Avenue. It was just paved and work is going to be apparently performed by the utility company . So we asked -- Mr. Voldenberg has asked the DPW to look into this. I did ask within the past few weeks about why the City has not utilized $50,000 that Council specifically put in the budget in Parks and Recreation for the summer help for our park system. We did receive a response from Mr. Preambo . He stated that they reviewed the 2020 budget amendments and found the $50,000 increase made to other salary in Parks and Recreation line item 4040. The information related to this increase and purpose was not clearly relayed to the department . We can't find any memos or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 backup to support employees cutting grass as was the intent of the funding increase. However , with Council 's inquiry and clarity at this time we have assigned a summer help employee to the park maintenance team. I just want to clarify one thing. Council was very clear with the Mayor and the administration what that funding was suppose d to be used for. I am as I stated previously disappointed that it's taken this much time to hire one person. We put $50,000 in there so that we could hire several people to help the park system. One additional person is great but it's not going to cut it. We have 30-some parks and the people we have doing the work now do a great job. But they do need additional help. So hopefully that could be fixed and by next year we have a full complement of a summer program working on the parks. And we also did send a request in for a stop sign replacement at the intersection of Dorothy Street and James Robeson Way. And that's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , similar to the piece that we have in Seventh Order which Solicitor Hayes got additional information on in terms of the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority , I think we should request the same thing with this project .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 It was a little light on details. And in terms of Miss Hodowanitz 's question s, we will get those answers for you and a detailed explanation on what that authority exactly does. In terms of things that I've seen the authority responsible for over the years, it has been almost as a passthrough for financing different project s. But they should have a mission statement and values and things like that. So we'll get that to you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

On the question , first of all, I am thrilled that we are allotting 3 million dollars from the American Rescue Package that was passed by President Biden and Congress in order to help our small businesses in the City of Scranton . I think this is going to go a long way just like the funding from the CARES Act. I did speak to the Mayor earlier today. And the Mayor and other City officials are going to come to a caucus next week to discuss this agenda item and the use of the 3 million 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 dollars with Council . They are also going to discuss the use of the additional monies that are coming into the City from the American Rescue Package .

VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 77, 2021 – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE RENAMING OF SPRUCE STREET AND THE CENTRAL SCRANTON EXPRESSWAY IN HONOR OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , a few things. So first of all, I want to thank each member of City Council who has show their support for this measure over the last few months. I also want to thank every member of the committee who has put in a lot of work on this change that I think will eventually be beneficial . No matter your political affiliation I think we can all admit the extraordinary nature of President Biden's ascension from the City of Scranton to the U.S. Senate, the Vice Presidency and now the highest office in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 land, the Presidency of the United States. President Biden has made Scranton not just the focus of the country at times but also the entire globe because of his love, affection and respect for his hometown. Therefore , I along with my colleague s on Council and the committee that we put together to study this issue in depth find it appropriate to rename the Central Scranton Expressway and Spruce Street after President Biden. I personally do not think that we should settle for anything less or be weary of making this change. Remember , in the past city fathers honored president s Washington , Adams, Jefferson , Madison , Monroe, Taylor, Harrison , Arthur. Shouldn 't we bestow the same honor on a president who was born in St. Mary's Hospital in South Side and grew up on North Washington Avenue in Green Ridge? I appreciate the business owners that came tonight . And I think we all sympathize with them and their -- any experience that they have and any inconvenience 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 because of this change. And I could assure everyone that in speaking with the Mayor and the Business Administrator and Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow that we are all going to work with them to alleviate any inconveniences . I also want to note that I have heard from hundreds and hundreds of people across the City who support this and several businesses on Spruce Street who support the measure as well. We took everything into consideration as we were going through the process I as mentioned . Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow on our committee , was on our committee has a great rapport with the small business community who endorse d this plan wholeheartedly . I believe very strongly that this will in the grand scheme of things within the big picture actually enhance historical tourism in Scranton and in the long-term will actually benefit the business es in the downtown and on Spruce Street. This isn't -- you know, renaming a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 street isn't unique just to Scranton . This is done all over the country . It's been done thousands and thousands of times. I really think that we should celebrate the fact that President Biden grew up in Scranton and really I think made each of us proud to be Scrantonians . In terms of some of the address changes , we did check with our City Planner Don King. Once this change is made, it's not like it's -- everyone is going to have to change their address immediately . We will work with the post office. I believe there's a year grace period. Also as I mentioned , the administration has assured me and I will assure the business owners that we will work with them to alleviate any inconveniences . On our agenda tonight we have 3 million dollars that we're using from the ARP funds for small businesses . We're going to discuss that with the Mayor next week. But again, in the grand scheme of things, this is going to be a good thing for the City of Scranton . Also, there was a comment made tonight that this just kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 of popped out of nowhere in a newspaper article on July 3rd. There was an article previous to that I believe on the front page that we were seriously considering Spruce Street and the Central Scranton Expressway . So again, we certainly -- the committee and Council does not take this lightly. But in -- again, in the big picture , this is to honor a man who is the President of the United States who grew up in the City of Scranton . And I think it's appropriate to do that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 76, 2021 - AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 56, 2021 (AS AMENDED ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 WHICH AMENDED FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 8, 1987 AND FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 87, 1976 ENTITLED “PROVIDING FOR THE LEVY AND COLLECTION OF A LICENSE FOR ALL PERFORMERS , ENTERTAINERS , SPORTING TEAMS, MUSICAL GROUPS, BANDS, THEATRICAL CAST, DANCING GROUPS, RECITAL GROUPS, PAID LECTURERS AND SPEAKERS BY INCREASING FEES” TO REDUCE THE ONE DAY FEE IN SECTION 3 FROM $50.00 TO $20.00 DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC .

DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY – FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 188, 2021 – AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ACCEPT A GRANT FROM THE MOSES TAYLOR FOUNDATION , THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO SUPPORT THE CITY’S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , there's several things with this Item 7-B that I find issue with. Normally I would be in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 favor of accepting a grant from the City. But it seems the content s of this grant have already been spelled out for what they are going to be used for. So several issues for me were that the position isn't included in the Home Rule Charter . Secondly , the person was hired from outside the City with no residency waiver. There's been no posting or no bidding on the position . And we really haven't been presented how this position is going to be funded once the grant is depleted. So I feel like at this point we should be looking at control ling cost in this budget rather than adding to the budget. So I'd like to make a motion to table until the administration can provide how we will fund this moving past the three years of this grant. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to table agenda Item 7-B. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I do on the question have some concerns . So this was present ed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 us initiall y as a hire. Because of the interview process there was job description for this position too but this person was interviewed . And for the most part, my interpretation proposed as an employee . Well, in essence , it's a private contractor . So contracted service should be bid out. I don't know if this falls under professional services or be claimed that, you know, professional service we don't have to bid out. Just because you don't have to doesn't mean out of transparency you shouldn 't. Then it was brought to us, okay, we're not going to -- they are not going to get a W2 or benefit s. They're not technically an employee . But then I look at the actual contract and it says that this individual has to provide their own liability -- their liability insurance . Has that been done yet? We don't know that. So I have some other question s. And I too am concerned about the duplication of services between the county and City because we had this conversation before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 the budget. We said, you know what, let's wait for the county. They have authority . This person will not have any authority within the capacity of her job. So -- and I'm all for education awareness . I'm an educator . But I believe , you know, that 300-some thousand dollars over three years could be spent on things that are better or provide better -- better program s for the health, safety and welfare and not just PR. Because , you know, we have three hospital s that we could reach out to that could provide us education awareness for free. It's not at the school level. I just think that this money could be better spent on other program s because when I look at the proposal or the grant, the grant doesn't say anything about health coordinator . That piece comes from the administration . So the grant from Moses never lists a position just to help with the health, welfare of our community . So I have some questions . Obviously I probably talked too long but I'm in favor of tabling this so the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 administration can clarify some of these for us before we go forward with this. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I would agree. I'll vote to table it. I'm in favor obviously of this position due to the fact that we're in the middle of a pandemic . And I do think there's value there. But I do think that Councilman Schuster and Councilman McAndrew have made valid points. And one of the points that they made I think does make sense in terms of after the three year grant is up, how will we fund this position ? What is the plan to fund this position ? What is the plan to fund the salary and the benefits ? So I don't see any harm in tabling this. And the Mayor is coming next week along with other members of her administration and I think, Mr. Voldenberg , if this does get tabled if you could give them a heads up that we would also like to discuss this piece so that they come, you know, prepared for that. But I will vote to table it. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. There's been a motion, a second, on the question . All those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 in favor of tabling agenda Item 7-B signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.
