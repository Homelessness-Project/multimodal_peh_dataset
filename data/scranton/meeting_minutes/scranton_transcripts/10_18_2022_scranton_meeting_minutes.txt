That's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Item 7-A, the DPW contract is up for final passage . I thought I heard last week that the hard numbers on this contract would be in Third Order this week. Did I misunderstand that last week? MR. DONAHUE : I said if we received them. To my knowledge , we haven't received them yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, it's up for final passage today. MR. DONAHUE : As of right now, yes, it is. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, hopefully the other three contract s you'll give them fair warning that they should not send up the contract for legislation unless they have the hard numbers to accompany it because I just think that's -- that's putting the cart before the horse. But that's just my opinion . What is the status of the other union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 negotiations are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : I haven't gotten any updates on the 2021 audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : Second verse same as the first. Okay, moving on. Did I hear you correctly that next week's caucus is the Payroll Preparation Tax? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : You might want to start that at 4:00 or something . Are they going to bring in the numbers and show us the money? MR. DONAHUE : That's the anticipation , yes. It's an update on collection so far. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, let's hope they do. Speaking of money, the false alarm nuisance alarm legislation , I have no issue with it with one exception . Why is it that all of the information gathered and all the records be held in confidentiality ? It says for public safety. But I don't understand the logic. We're generating revenue with these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 charges . And it's right that businesses and residences if they have a false or a nuisance alarm should be subject to a charge. But why is all of this information being confidential ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have the answer to that question . But I'll hopefully find it out for you for next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : My personal opinion is all financial information with regard to the City, all taxes, fees, charges and delinquencies , all that should be a matter of public record. And it should be put on the City's website . And it should be a goal that the City works towards so that there is full disclosure as to the revenues coming in and expenditures going out. And it shouldn 't have to be a matter of coming to a Council meeting and asking questions or God forbid having to do a Right To Know request . So please pass that information onto the administration . 5-D, the Portnoff Law Associates getting the one-year extension on their contract for collecting the delinquent refuse fees, not an issue, but I found it interest ing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 that they've collected something like 2 million dollars for the period delinquencies from 2002 onto the present . Yet if you look at your City's website and the refuse database that's there as of one August, the City is owed over 10 million dollars in delinquent fees. So that's less than 20 percent . What would you consider to be an appropriate collection rate for delinquencies ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't think using that 10 million dollars is setting the appropriate bar either because like you said, that goes back to 2002. And there is a certain percentage of that that is considered uncollectible , whether the estate changed hands or, right, so I think that's a problem we've had going back, right, is having that data there to know what was what and it was really just handed to us in a pile. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, still, I still think that it would with be nice to see that database made current and hopefully all database s. Item 5-F, the one million dollar grant for the Biden Street Scape and stormwater 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 improvements , the only thing I don't understand is when are we going to give priority to the neighborhoods who have no sidewalk s who have actual flooding of homes and businesses because I'm not aware of any home or business on Biden's Street's eight blocks ever having been flooded. And at least they have sidewalks . MR. DONAHUE : And I get your point, but the RACP Program is set up for economic development . And it's for economic development with project s over a million dollars . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, hopefully they'll get some priorities for the neighborhood s. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I agree. But this specific program is designed for economic development with totals over a million dollars . It can't be applied for that unfortunately . Next on the list Angelo Jarman. MR. JARMAN: It's good to see you all this evening . I'd like to open with remarks specifically as a reminder that as an institution I do believe that our City Council should pay no mind to fascist rhetoric . I feel that the rambling of bigots should have no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 place in these chamber s and no influence over our politics . I also believe that the rambling of those who would defend such speech should also have no place here. But that is all for opening remarks . I would like to move onto more productive matters specifically on the funding for Biden Street, reading through the legislation I'd have to say I'm very optimistic about it. I do like that there has been money set aside for bike lanes, raised crosswalks , traffic calling measures as well as stormwater protection and in general favoring more pedestrian -centered development . So I would just like to come out in support of that. And another matter with the expansion of GCMC, I would like to speak up a little bit on that. For many, many years many people in my family have relied on the hospital s in Scranton specifically GCMC even before they were bought out by Geisinger for their special ist care as well as emergency treatment . And at the time the resources that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 were provided were adequate for them to get the care they needed. My grandfather suffered from Crohn's for many, many years and he receive his treatment at GCMC. However , today the hospital is overcrowded . There's not enough staff. There's not enough beds. Many patients find themselves waiting in stretcher s in the hallway for hours waiting to get seen even after they are taken back. One of those people was a dear friend of mine several weeks ago. They had admitted themselves to a hospital for psychiatric issues where they had to wait over 40 hours for a bed to open up at Lancaster Behavioral due to the closure of First Hospital in Kingston . During that time they were kept in the hallway on a stretcher . They were not able to be attended to or be properly safeguarded from any measures that they might have been able to take to harm themselves given that they were in a very dire mental state. They did not have adequate transportation to and from Lancaster Behavioral either. They ended up being transferred by a constable rather than any kind of medical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 transit, which obviously then if -- I'm sure none of you here have ridden in the back of a police car. They are not very comfort able to say the least and definitely not adequate for transport ing medical patients . In fact, they ended up taking an Uber back which I'm sure was very expensive considering that it was paid for by the taxpayers . I do believe that getting proper transit to and from the hospital should be a priority for the City of Scranton . Yes, these shortcomings in the care that my friend has received are not necessarily the fault of any individual nurse or practitioner or rather a shortcoming of the hospital as whole, as the City as a whole to fail -- who have failed to provide the proper facilities to expand the emergency room, to expand specialized healthcare in this area so that those who need psychiatric help do not make a three-hour commute down to Lancaster for the help that they need. I believe that's an undue burden. And I know that there are growing pains associated with expansion . I'm familiar with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 that myself, the parking lot across from the hospital now used to be my old elementary school Audubon . I do remember -- I still remember when that school ended up getting torn down due to mold. And I would definitely like to see something come out of it more than a gravel parking lot. I would like to see facilities opened up that will save lives that will make sure that the people who are injured and in need get the care that they need and the care that they deserve . Thank you very much. And thank you for the time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . Well, I think the first thing I'll say here is at a prior Council meeting I talked about the City of Scranton 's own government being the problem . And, you know, today I'd like to say that the gentleman who spoke before me today talked about mental health and healthcare . Well, the City of Scranton had an 8th floor hospital called the Scranton State Hospital that had psychiatric care and drug, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 you know, drug abuse counsellor s and care. But the government itself closed it and ripped it down and destroyed the State of Pennsylvania 's healthcare system. And when you take a look at what's happening in our country , we have terrible leadership . I watched the presentation here about taking over DPW. It's beyond ridiculous that the City can't after 150 years figure out how to collect trash. Now, there's a chemical could you add to latex paint that hardens it. But you know, by the same token, the City has a responsibility to furnish the resident s with, you know, trash removal . And if we're going to decide what we are and what we aren't going to take, that's a beautiful thing. But you know what, the City needs to create a stream to handle every kind of trash in the City because if it doesn't do that, it's going to be dumped somewhere else illegally . The major problem this City has is its government that and the country . I mean, look what's happening in the hearing s, you know, in regards to the Russian probe. We find out that all the warrant s were illegal and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 there was no reason to issue anything against Trump. It was all political on the inside of the Democrat 's party and Hillary Clinton . Joe Biden has a part to play in that. Look at where our country really is. We're in bad shape here. You know, we're talking about spending more money. The average taxpayer is complete ly out on their feet. They're completely broke. You know, we just got out of Act 47. We're going to agree to a contract the residents have no idea what the cost of it is and the government itself doesn't care. We're talking about spending more money when the truth of the matter is when you put somebody the head of DPW and they can't run that department , then why are they there? Look what happened to the Scranton Sewer Authority . We loaded it up with employees . A lot of them were political . And we torpedo ed it. And somebody said to me the other day, Lee, I'm paying $130 for water and sewer for two people in this City. Somebody is out of their mind. But, yet, the reserve fund went to Pennsylvania American Water. And like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 you said yourself, Council President Donahue , the City borrowed money to inject it into the pension plan and then took money and paid it off. But the vast bulk of that money disappeared and, you know, the other thing is -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't know where that money disappeared to because you know -- MR. MORGAN: Well, the government spent it. But it sold the Sewer Authority . And don't forget the Council President was opposed to the sale of the Sewer Authority but he introduced it. MR. DONAHUE : Introduced what? MR. MORGAN: The Council President was opposed to the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority but yet he introduced it. Nothing can get introduced -- MR. DONAHUE : Not this Council President . MR. MORGAN: Not you. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about our government being the problem . This City's government is the problem . You know what I'd worry about, that the Council has the right to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 do investigation s. And my question is, I'm tired of people in Clarks Summit telling me the Mayor of Scranton lives there, okay? So I think we need to do an investigation because does the Mayor really live in Scranton ? I don't care what her address is and I don't care where she rents. But you know what, a fireman and a policeman can't live outside the City. Somebody would investigate them and take their job from them. And we're starting to talk about where we're taking this City. The City just left Act 47. And we're going loose on everything we're going to. And the other thing is, what can the residents really afford and, you know, something , Council President , I think I'd do an investigation and find out where the Mayor lives for sure because , you know, there is probably cameras at Summit where she lives, okay, and let's see where the Mayor actually lives, okay, and let's start really looking at what we're doing here. And if we can't run DPW, I don't know what to tell you. MR. DONAHUE : The City Controller is responsible for verifying the residency of all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 City employees . Next on the list, Aaron Sepkowski . Mr. Sepkowski , I know you're not a resident of the City of Scranton . Are you a taxpayer of the City of Scranton ? MR. SEPKOWSKI : I have interest in the City of Scranton . MR. DONAHUE : Are you a taxpayer in the City of Scranton ? MR. SEPKOWSKI : I have multiple interests in the City of Scranton , growing assets and other. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. SEPKOWSKI : Mr. Donahue , may I ask why you asked that? MR. DONAHUE : Because Council Rules state that only taxpayers and/or citizens of the City of Scranton have the ability to speak at a City Council meeting . MR. SEPKOWSKI : Aaron Sepkowski , and, yes, I'm from Moscow, Pennsylvania . I'm a candidate for the 113 District . And over the past few months I came to multiple government entities and introduced myself with no issues. I'm just here simply to introduce myself to the Council and to the residents of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And I'm running for State Representative like I said in the 113th. Scranton is a big chunk of that district along with the North Pocono area from where I reside. And I'm just here to introduce myself like I said. I'm 41 years old. I'm a business man from Moscow. I'm a dairyman from Moscow. And I'm proud to say I'm a father of a 13-year-old son. I invite everybody here to look into my resume for why I'm running . I think a lot of us have the same interests . And I just want to build community between two parties . And that is all I would like to report on here today and invite you all again to look me up. I have a meet and greet tomorrow at the Olde Brook if you guys want to have interactions one on one, I welcome that. And thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , I really don't even know where to start. Last Monday the people in the house next to me, there's a duplex, the far side. They were evicted . Of course, I didn't know any of this. About 5:00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 they started putting out their garbage and like all the houses do for Monday. It's 7:00, 7:15 or so I came out to walk my dog. There was a mountain of stuff out there. There's a piano, baby stuff, a dumpster load full. So the next day, of course, when the people saw it they attacked it and stuff was scattered all over. It was just a big huge mess. Wednesday , number eight -- they won't tell me his name. Number eight puts a citation on my house for rubbish . I phoned downstairs . She said she'd have him phone me. Of course, nobody ever phones you back from in the City. Friday he put another citation on my house for rubbish for the house next door, you know, a little ticket like this (indicating ). Now, I got mad and I phoned downstairs . I said my neighborhood is a mess for years and you're worried about -- you keep giving me tickets for the house next door. Monday morning I got a hundred dollar ticket. This is nothing but a blatant abuse of his power. I think he retaliated because I phoned downstairs . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I've complained for years. This man never sees nothing wrong. Five weeks that tractor -trailer sat down there. They don't know nothing about it while they put a motor in and out of it. There is junk still all over the place. I got that behind my house where my lot is 160 feet, the next two houses on Throop Street is like junkyards . Next to him there's cars in the street for two years. He doesn't see any of this. He sees on my lawn furniture on my porch I had two 24 bottles of water I left there because I just didn't bring them in. Right here, rubbish . He gave me a hundred dollar ticket. It's got 48 hours to pay. But if you want to appeal it, you got 20 days for $300. That's like extortion . It's like legal extortion . They want you to just pay the hundred dollars rather than appeal it. But it says right here the first line you don't get your $300 back if you win. What kind of crap is that? I'm telling you. This man is a total disgrace . I've been complaining -- I remember a year or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 so I said he ought to be fired for the job he's doing in my neighborhood . No wonder he's so mad at me. I'm his boss. He's works for me. And here -- I'm -- he's the victim when you go downstairs and complain . Besides that it took -- I never seen such a mess trying to figure out how to park. I don't know my license number. I've had that license plate since '04. It's the sticker on it. I don't have an idea what it is. I never looked at it. I'd have to get the license and then -- this is ridiculous when you could put a bunch of quarters in a meter. Anyway, I'm going to appeal this. You know, the Mayor wants to put Bidenville on the map. I'm going to put it on the map and she won't like it when I start showing all of these picture s of my neighborhood that I'm taking for five years, six years. This isn't right though. This man is abusing his authority , his power. And what are you suppose d to do, pay $300 for a 100 ticket? I'm going to pay the 300 if I have to subpoena you people that I've complained about in my Will. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Ellman. Mr. Ellman, you called the department ? Mr. Ellman, did you call the department ? MR. ELLMAN: Did I what? MR. SCHUSTER : Did you call the Department of Licensing and Inspections ? MR. ELLMAN: No, I just talked to one of the girls in the office downstairs . And, of course, she defends the man and that's as far as I got. MR. DONAHUE : The rules apply to everybody . MR. ELLMAN: I have no complaint s about her. She gave me this form and told me to fill it out. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , you know, that was one of the things that kind of turned me sour on the leadership on the taxpayers was they pushed all of that. And I could see where somebody was going to be on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 losing end some day. It's really not right, especially when you have neighbors that actually in other towns I had neighbors would put it in front of my house, my side and the landlord would say, oh, you put that there you better pick it up. You know, it was like two and a quarter per bag and they weren't big bags. All righty. The property over here I still think that should be looked at by the City and maybe some consideration as to acquiring . We should try to settle our contracts . I don't want to see like the last time seven years just going down the tubes. And I hope that the unions are and pension boards are taking measures in this stock market to protect the amount of money in there. Now, inflation is a big issue this year. And 25 percent of our crops yields are down 25 percent . Saudi Arabia is siding with Russia and we have a war in Ukraine that Mr. Putin and I will point out that our last Republican president had a lot of good times playing footsie with him and negotiating imaginary Trump towers in Moscow and what have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 you. But I'm a little tired of when they finally win what they're making an issue of inflation that getting told -- being called unpatriotic ingrate because that's all I've gotten from that party over the last 40 years. And once again, the vote is up. And I can only consider what a person promised to try to do and if he or she achieves it, great. But if there is other forces precluding him from that achievement or her then that's the way it is. I can't hold it against them the next time around if they're running. And I don't fall for that type of -- so consider who you are voting for and what they are promising to do. And refugees which has been mentioned at times here, I'm not against any refugees at all. But there are so many refugees in the world that America can't take care of them all or take them all in. And it's sad that we can't do it but we have to get birth control and family planning to use and fund it for global family planning and stop these excessively large population s from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 growing and along with environmental refugees . And now I have that article here from last week, Flynn's Reawaken Road Show Brings With It the Army of God. And they're calling people pedophile s and they're calling people unpatriotic and they're calling people everything under the book. Here's another one that was in Sunday's paper. It's on pro-life. It's Doug Mastriano and Professor Coup d'etat there Mr. Oz. And anybody that wants to end Social Security , Medicare play with, destroy public education and everything else, I'm sorry, you're not pro-life. Pro-life is all life. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , first of all, I'd like to address a brief comment that was brought up before the body tonight . At one point in time in the U.S. history the black population was considered three-fifths of a person. This was used to suppress opinions , voting, and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 ability to express themselves , own property and control their own lives. Part of the reason why the First Amendment is there is because everyone has the right to speak. We don't have to like it. We don't have to agree with it. But because of people being marginalize d and told they cannot have a voice because they are unwanted or not a full person is part of the reason why the First Amendment right to speak is so important so that people who were formally three-fifths of a person are not stripped of the ability to express opinions . Now on from that, a number of months ago it was brought forth to this body by one of the participants a question on whether or not the recycling funds were put into a separate account . It was reported back by Mr. West to this body and to the public that because of ongoing legal issues that could not be discussed . The only issue I have with that is in following up with Mr. West was the entire conversation on the funds and where they went or an oral conversation . There is no paper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 trail. This was done direct one-to-one person leaving the body from an official question without record. Anything that's asked for by the City population should have a paper trail if you're going to follow through with it. I cannot get information on a question asked from one person to another person and rely on that in any documentation . It's important that when a citizen brings something forward that there be a physical track to go back to. Mr. Schuster asked Mr. West today on savings on whether or not it was 160, $180,000 or $300,000. He asked it clearly and concisely . Twice Mr. West rephrased the question avoiding it. First, going for a completely different question and then convoluting it by asking about whether or not the two figures are to be added together or separate . And the question he actually posed the first and second were actually just a reverse way of asking the same exact question . He avoided the concept of the comparable cities were not comparable and how did they get these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 differences . That was completely side stepped and it was wrong. I think it was direct subterfuge . Last, the Marketplace at Steamtown is doing a lawsuit against the parking operators for mismanagement . It was filed per the paper on September 16th. Basalyga and the Community Development Properties of Scranton were the parties . Under this deal prior, the City sold one of the garages to Steamtown for one dollar. And this was part of the arrangement to eliminate the mall as a competitor to the City Parking Authority . It's a amazing that we have to destroy competition in a marketplace and make something protected . I think a monopoly is what our government should go for because that helps the population . It's a seven board that includes the Mayor and City Council President . Yet, during that meeting last week when it was in the paper that they actually are having trouble paying on their bonds, not a single question was brought up about this issue, especially by someone who should be informed of it because they are a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 member of the board. That leaves a lot of questions that it would be interesting -- MR. DONAHUE : So what, you want to just talk about litigation strategy in a public meeting ? MR. COYNE: If we're going to increase the contract another seven years and they are already defaulting on money, it is a legitimate question to ask. If you cannot pay the money now because you're already defaulting on it, why should we continue to go forward ? It's a -- MR. DONAHUE : That was as a result of the pandemic . MR. COYNE: Does not matter -- MR. DONAHUE : When money is not coming in, you cannot send money out. Right? MR. COYNE: Does not matter what the fault of it is. There is a question on extending to a company from a company that is not paying its current debts. MR. DONAHUE : We've known they haven't been paying their current debts for months now. MR. COYNE: Why weren't they brought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 up? Why wasn't it questioned ? MR. DONAHUE : Because they answered the -- they said that they were refinancing and that this was a part of the plan in terms of refinancing their debt. But thank you, Mr. Coyne, your time is up. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. LEONARD : Council , Roger Leonard , DPW Union President . I wasn't going to speak today but one of you guys actually mentioned you said how does the DPW feel about the Rubicon systems . As one of you mentioned before, we have a different relationship now than maybe two years ago when they were talking about getting these systems together . And we did offer to actually do some organizations of routes that maybe are, you know, some routes start in different areas and they get kind of rotated around the City and spends a little more fuel than we could be spending . And we discussed that we would be able to work with them on that. We also -- one of the big things he said was with the people taking pictures of -- they have -- their systems , it's actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 like -- it's an iPhone basically . So when they pull up and there's a stop and there's a big stop and there's something there, they take a picture on the iPhone. It goes back to the Rubicon system. But that in itself, I mean, is basically everybody has an iPhone now, everybody has a cell phone. So if you buy a $200 laptop and you put -- a guy sends a picture from his iPhone to the e-mail address to the dispatcher , it does the same job. Basically I heard Chris -- and Chris is a good guy. I like him. I heard him say, like, you know, I need this in order to come out. Well, that's kind of the supervisor 's job is if there's an issue they come out. So I don't know -- it's kind of like an electronic supervisor . So when you're talking about $399,000 in savings , I don't know if it's because they're going to get rid of the garbage supervisor because they don't need one if they have this electronic system, I don't know if that's in that 399. But I did hear them talk about removing routes and saving on personnel . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Now, I don't know if you recall but they tried that before. They pulled a garbage truck -- has to be a few months back now. I don't know what it was. And we tried. They told us, well, follow the Rubicon systems. And we did it to a T. And it left garbage unfortunately all over the City in different areas because they are not complete routes, the systems that are going in there. We do understand that things -- routes do need to be optimized so that we're not running all over the City, but it's something really that is an easy fix. It's something that could be done inhouse. And I don't know if it was something that they could have done maybe two years ago with how the situation was. But as of right now we have a pretty good relationship . We all live in the City. We care about the City. We want things to work. I think $450,000 is a large price tag to have a bunch of iPhones and to not be able to say, hey, guys, you know, can we just pick up this garbage today, that garbage tomorrow . There is only 15 routes on a day.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 It's not a big process . And we would be willing to work with them on that. Another thing is, when they pull those routes and they had all of these problems , Rubicon didn't do what it was suppose d to do. It was supposed to send us to these areas and you were supposed to, you know, fix these problem s and, you know, just follow the routes. We followed the routes and garbage , I mean, you remember garbage got crazy. They also have to realize too is that they ordered five garbage trucks that are smaller than the ones we have right now. I don't know if they are trying to optimize how the City is with the trucks that they currently have. But if I don't know how you optimize if you're optimizing for 25 yard garbage trucks and 11 garbage trucks and you order five 20 yard garbage trucks, now you're not going to pick up the same amount of garbage . And then when you switch to these different -- I know if they're optimizations of the routes, I don't see -- I don't see people going and doing things that aren't required for them to do during the day, things that, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 know, our guys do on a daily basis that is above and beyond things that are -- we do constantly . So, I mean, what I heard was the savings comes from pulling a truck, throwing more tonnage on people's shoulders and backs in a time where it's suppose d to be, you know, we all care about workers. We're called essential employees . And to me when you say optimize , optimize , optimize , we are in a city right now that's growing population wise but you don't see it because you don't see houses going up all over the place. I see it because I own a bunch of rentals. So I know people that come into rent it's not one or two in an apartment . It's four, five, six, seven, eight. So our population is going up. I don't think cutting a route buying smaller garbage trucks is going to set us up for any type of future that we have coming up if -- you see how the housing market is going. I don't think we're going to be in a good place to actually take care of refuse two, three, four, five years down the road. If you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 have any questions . MR. DONAHUE : I mean -- I don't think I have any. Does anyone? MR. SCHUSTER : In Fifth Order I'm going ask Mr. Voldenberg to send something over to Larry because one of the questions I did have on my list that I never made it to tonight was the fact that 20 yard garbage trucks and whether that is going to change those routes in the system and if the savings still remain with the wear and tear and the fuel in those vehicle s. MR. LEONARD : Yeah, I don't see that. That's five times 20 -- five times five is 25. So you lost a garbage truck right there to pick up that route of garbage . So once you drop down, you cut yourself a truck already in that situation . I don't know where they're going. Again, I'm willing to work and us as a union are willing to work with them. I mean, I didn't see, you know, three years $450,000 (inaudible ) release the systems . Okay, so what does that mean, another three years for another $300,000 to, you know, to watch people like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 electronically but you already have a supervisor to watch people. I mean, how the systems worked before is you just call it in, hey, 144 Moosic or whatever , didn't have their garbage , okay. We wrote it down. It wasn't complicated . MR. DONAHUE : With all due respect , I appreciate your perspective . I think it's important . I think we all need to hear it, right, but I just need to stick to the time limit to keep the same rules for everybody else. MR. LEONARD : Yep. Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I appreciate it. Would anyone else like to address Council ? (Inaudible ) Scranton City taxpayer . I think it's important at this time that we should reanalyze how the City got to where it is and who built this City in the first place. My family is Polish. I'm a Polish son of an Irish mother. And the first Poles to come to the United States were military leaders during the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 revolution . We have statute s and monument s to them now out in the square. (Inaudible ) America 's first LGBT hero. (Inaudible ) who dedicate d his entire fortune upon his death to the freeing and education of Thomas Jefferson 's slaves. Thomas Jefferson we know didn't -- made sure that that did not happen. Next Poles to come to America came to Hati at the behest of Napoleon to put down the Hatian revolution . Instead , the Poles seeing the Hatians oppressed by a foreign power as much as we all know Poland was at the time defected and helped Hati overthrow the French wars. Later as oppression grew from the Russians , the oppressions , later the Germans and the Austrians , 700,000 Poles moved into Pennsylvania alone to work in the anthracite mines. The anthracite mines were predominantly mined by Poles around the turn of the century . But when they got here, the community was already built up by the Irish immigrant s. The Irish would come here from Ireland largely after the mass famine that was perpetuate d by the English Crown because the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 English Crown believed the goods that Ireland could produce were more valuable than the Irish citizen s. And million s died and millions were forced out of the county and came here to Scranton , to Pennsylvania and later on the Poles for much of the same reason came. During this time, during this mass immigration of 700,000 Polish, the Congo is experiencing a genocide . A genocide personally executed by King Leopold the second of Belgium who was given permission by the United States government , not the Belgium government, the United States government to go in and overexploit the Congo and destroy its people all because its natural resources were more valuable to King Leopold than the Congolese . Ten million Congolese were killed during this time. Only five million Poles died in the entirety of World War II in the concentration camps, the Holocaust , and general war. Over twice as many Poles were killed at the request of King Leopold the second to exploit and destroy the Congo. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Again, with the assistance of United States government this continued . After Leopold 's death, the Congo continue d to be exploit ed by Belgium . And later on when they vied for independence , the United States and Belgium conspired to execute their -- to assassinate their first Democratically elected leader putting them into a cycle of civil war that goes onto today. This is why there are Congolese refugees here in Scranton . This is why there will be more in Scranton . This is why we should be welcoming them because the Congolese are not here to exploit what we have. They are here for the same reason the Irish came, the same reason the Polish came because their own country is being destroyed by colonialism , by exploitation , by war. They're undergoing continuous war at the behest of governments benefitting from the natural resources of the Congo. As recently as 2019 that people were being judged for war crimes there, including but not limited to mass rape, destruction of villages , the enforcement of child soldiers , attempted genocide , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 destruction of communities . It is unacceptable that anyone would refuse immigrant s here, especially in Scranton . Anyone who has participated in the Italian Food Festival , the Greek Food Festival , the St. Patrick 's Day Parade has inadvertently celebrate d the success of immigration and the benefits it brings to our community . The Congolese refugees here -- and I hope to see more of them are merely the next people to come here to build up the City to make it great. They are no different from the Irish. They are no different from the Polish. They are no different from the Italians who came to escape the violence from the Italian reunification . They are and will be an essential part of this community . I hope to see more of them. Anyone who suggests otherwise is directly offending the Polish, the Italian , and the Irish community of Scranton and the surrounding area. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. So the first one, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could send correspondence over to Larry West and ask him if the 20 yard trucks that are being purchased in the capital budget over the next I think two years if they are going to have to address the Rubicon system for the size of those trucks and if we're going to maintain the same savings that was estimated at this point in time when it comes to the area of wear and tear as well as fuel. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. Also, if you could send over to Mr. West, ask him if he could send over who the two City officials are that are assigned to our Disaster Assistance Application Program and what actions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 have been taken on DR 4506 and DR 4508 up to this point. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Next, this one is going to be a comment . So I saw the news and heard about the slides coming down at Nay Aug, not very happy about this. I do understand that we know -- we had a presentation where the Mayor did say -- she present ed that the slides wouldn't be in the pool plan. And I understand that in that she said that we're not going to build a facility around these slides. But these slides were personal taxpayer money. We spent $200,000 give or take on these slides. And I think we should have at least left them until we had a final plan. The 9th of March of 2021 we had a presentation that came to Council in caucus. We had Nick Hughes from NKSD who did the facility study and we also had George Deines from Counsilman ·Hunsaker who is an aquatic design, planning and operations group agency who was an aquatic expert.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 On 3/9 of 2021 he said that there was no corrosion on the slides. There was no cracks on the slides. There was no leaks on the slides and they could be reused from their inspection . I don't understand why these slides were destroyed over the last few days. I think it's a big mistake. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. Thank you. I would like to take a minute and address the Mayor's decision to remove the slides at Nay Aug Pool Complex . First, I was shocked by the decision and I disagree with it. As far as I'm aware and what we've been told the slides are still in relatively good working condition . The Mayor said in the paper today that the slide manufacturer has gone out of business and that is the reason she's taking them down. This makes absolutely no sense. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 There are thousand s of water park slides in operation around the country . I can't imagine that the City couldn't find another way to get parts if they were needed. Where there's a will there's a way. Think about with some appliance and items you have in your house where the original manufacturer has gone out of business . It doesn't mean you throw it out the window. If it's still in good working condition there is always someone else that makes the parts. They don't make model Four Ts anymore but they are still on the road. All right. So did the Mayor investigate if there was any other company that would make these parts? Did she contact anyone? We don't know. We've heard numerous times from the Mayor about a park plan. But here we are today still with nothing . We don't need a plan from the Mayor. We need action. The slides that the Mayor is tearing down represent s Scranton 's revitalization 20 years ago, a pool complex that everyone was proud of and where thousands of residents came each year. The slide was the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 main attraction . Now, all we have is an empty space with overgrown grass, an unsightly blighted mess where a bustling pool complex once existed . Unfortunately this is starting to represent Mayor Cognetti 's administration , all talk, little to no action. The Mayor refuses to think outside the box on this project . When the issue first arose two years ago, Council was ready and willing to do whatever it took to get the ball rolling on this project . That included borrowing money when the interest rates were at their all time lows to fund this capital project and reinvesting in the park along with looking at some other creative financing mechanisms to refinance it. The Mayor refused . Instead the Mayor has decided to constantly delay this project and uses excuses after excuse. It seems to me the Mayor is waiting for something to happen when what we need is someone to take a leadership role to make this happen. It may be hard for the Mayor to understand how important this park and pool complex is to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 people. It's one of the main attraction s we have in the City. I along with many other residents were so disappointed in the Mayor's decision to tear down what once represent ed progress . I'm personally disappointed with her continual lack in action and leadership on this issue. I along with my colleague s will continue to fight for the resurrection of this pool complex. That is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have two things. Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to reach out to the administration specifically I believe the Fire Department on this firearm alarm legislation of 5-C regarding Section 9 that was brought up in Fourth Order and the confidentiality clause that is in there? Is that new to the ordinance ? And if so, why was it placed in. I know it does say that as long as, you know, what's being held confidential falls under the Right To Know request law. But could you just reach out and find out those answers ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And I also got a complaint about a drain on the 400 block of Crane Avenue back in Minooka . Apparently every time it rains, the drain just clogs up and creates a big puddle there. So I know we don't -- would you be able to reach out to both PA American Water and also DPW to see who is responsible for that drain? It's literally right in the middle of the block of the 400 block of Crane. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'll vote to move this. But, Mr. Voldenberg , remember last week I brought up some issues with Portnoff sending out bills to people who don't have delinquent garbage fees? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. We don't have an answer as yet. MR. MCANDREW : Did we get any verification on that or any followup or feedback? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : There seems to be multiple ones at multiple houses. There's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 problem . So we need them to fix that before I even think about extending their contract . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question in the backup document it says they collected about 2 million dollars . Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to get the actual number that Portnoff has collect ed to date? And then can we also ask if they've identified a number of delinquencies for the collection for the extension year that they've identified a number of delinquencies ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree I'd like a little bit more information on where we stand currently with the delinquencies and what percentage of delinquencies have not been collected from what they were previously trying to collect and how much we'll be looking to collect from over the past year. That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Just on the question just briefly , so the original agreement we had with Portnoff only covered between 2002 and 2020. So at this moment we don't have a delinquent refuse fee collector for 2021, or 2022. And that's what this extension covers and adds into that. At the same time we are working with since it's been put on the tax bill, we're working to try to figure out if the Tax Claim Bureau could pick up delinquent refuse for the years where it was on the tax bill. We're speaking with the Single Tax Office to see if they are able to take that up or if we're able to bring that in-house ourselves. But the delinquency rate has gone down significantly since it's been put on the tax bill. So it's not as a heavy of a lift as it might have been in the past. But we are working through that. That is why this is only a one-year extension just to give us some more time to work through that. All those in favor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.

MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , you know, I wish we weren't in this position where the Parking Authority even had to give up possession of the parking system. But unfortunate ly that goes back over a decade to a former Council 's refusal to pay off the debt payment that the City did guarantee for the Parking Authority which led to this agreement in the first place. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 You know, it's not an ideal situation . But really the alternative is that if the current -- NDC who is the current operator owner of the parking system is not able to pay off their bond issues, they are not able to pay off their debt, a receiver will come in and will charge whatever rates they want to charge in order to recoup their initial loan. So although this is not ideal, this is the best way forward not only for the parking system in downtown but also for the businesses and resident s that live downtown . Anyone else on the question ?
