If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So first of all, I'd like to congratulate the West Scranton Invader Swim Team for their win over Scranton Prep last week. History was made as the first time West defeated Prep at a score of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 93-66. The captain of the team was one of my culinary student s. So we're very happy for them and proud of them. And about 100 pounds ago and what feels like a 100 years ago, I swam for West and realized what a big deal this really is to beat Prep. So congratulations to them. And then this Friday, there's a pasta dinner, February 3rd. It's at the Ukavets also known as American Ukraine Vets Association . It's located at 237 Railroad Avenue. It's dine in or take out. The dinner includes ziti, two meatballs , bread, salad. So that's a nice event to go to. And then also in West Side the next night is the West Scranton Wrestling Alumni Night at the Races. This is at St. Peter's and Paul's Orthodox Youth Center on 1725 Academy Street in Scranton , obviously West Side. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . A lot of people asked me when I retired why I came back to Scranton having been stationed around the United States and Europe and other places. And, of course, I had family here and that was my immediate reason. But after my mother passed away and my sister passed away and my father passed away, I could have easily relocated to a warmer climate like Hawaii. If you've ever been there it's great and there's other places. But one of the reasons I opted to stay here with all -- some of the bad images that you see about Scranton over the years is that there's some of the best people in the world right here in Scranton and in this Northeastern Pennsylvania . And believe me, having been around the world more than once, a lot of nice people out there but none finer than right here at home. So was very pleased to see two interesting articles in the paper this weekend . The first one, Jeff Horvath wrote. And that was the recognition of former Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Dave Wenzel and his contribution s to the Shade Commission . But, you know, if you are not familiar with Scranton , if you're a new resident , you know, Dave went to Vietnam . I think he was in the country about three weeks before he stepped on a land mine. And so he's a triple amputee . Now, he could have come home after his medical discharge and not have to work for the rest of his life because the VA would take very good care of him. But he went onto serve as Scranton 's Mayor and after that, you know, constantly advocating for the disabled , volunteer ing in a number of position s. You know, the man's incredible . And I'm proud to come from the same city and to have worn the same uniform . The second article was on Sunday. It was a reprint of an article from the New York Times. It focused on Father Myron Myronyuk of St. Vladimir 's Ukraine Church down the road on 7th Avenue and how not asking for government funding and taxpayer dollars , but through his own fund-raising efforts and the efforts of a lot Ukrainian churches have raised a considerable amount of money to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 support the Ukrainian people in their efforts against Putin and his war. So next time you ask me why I decided to retire here, that's why. We have our occasional law breakers , every city does. But I don't know where you're going to find better people like Fr. Myron and Dave Wenzel. You just aren't. Having said that, do you have any updates on the audit? MR. SCHUSTER : Yesterday Larry West let us know that the only thing that they're waiting on is the GASB 75 from our HR Department . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, GASB 75, okay. Yeah, inch by inch slowly they turn. I still think that there should be a public caucus with Kohanski , Rainey and Rainey, and the BA's Office to go over the findings of the audit and to explain why it was such a labored effort and how it's going to be corrected in the future. What about the police and firefighter arbitrations ? Are they making any progress that we know of? MR. KING: All I know is that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 are in arbitration -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Inch by inch slowly they turn. MR. KING: I did speak to a fireman and they seemed pretty optimistic . MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. I will compliment IT, which I don't often do. I see they are starting to make progress and reorganizing the city's website . I hope they continue on it and once they get it up to the speed that they could keep it maintained . And those of who you who may have forgotten, it's tax time. Should you need the instructions or form, please visit your friendly public library . They'll help you. The IRS Office will tell you to go to the internet. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. Prior to the meeting Bob Bolus called me about Councilman Rothchild . I don't know, he just thinks you should put physical therapist after your name. I don't know how you feel about that, but I'd thought I'd say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that since he asked me to mention it. But the next thing I have is, you know, the venue is open at ECTV for the Council to appear and speak to the people in an open forum and take questions . But Council chose not do that. I don't know why. It's very troubling in a representative form of government when your representatives hide from the people they represent and can't take questions . Now, I asked the Scranton Times a long time ago to bring on an investigative reporter and start investigating instead of doing press conferences with people and taking verbatim the words they say and print them in the newspaper . And when you look at a country like America and you see what's happening to our country and you elect people who -- to be honest, there's nobody in city government other than Mr. Smurl that has all the answers . And as the Council President , I mean, you know, I just can't see why the Council in total would hide from the people they represent when you ran for public office 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 and you talked about being transparent and representing the residents . But this wasn't an interview with me. This had to do with the 75-page report. This had to do with the things that took place at the park. I mean, now we have the Mayor who has appoint ed new people to the Rec Board. What questions did the Mayor ask and what's the plan for Nay Aug Park and why is Mrs. -- Miss or Mrs. Duffy running around the park and, you know, why did the slide come down the way it did? And why is the pool full of dirt? And why can't the Council in total or even one of the members sit at a table and have an open discussion on any issue, not just that because I'm going to ask about other ones as we go forward . But it makes you look illegitimate because you come here and you pass borrowing and spending and you do your spiel about the spaghetti dinners and who died and we do the Pledge of Allegiance . But when it comes to being transparent and speaking to the very people you represent in an open forum, are you afraid to take questions ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 If you watch the interview I did with Frank Scavo, I didn't ask him one harsh question . Now, I don't know what happened to that video because obviously I have to wait for ECTV to get back to me on that. And I've done other interviews with people. And I've met and talked to people in local government almost for the last 40 years, never disrespected one person, not once in my whole life, just asked legitimate questions that should be answered not just -- I've sat down with the Bishop in Scranton , talked to him about issues. I'm a truck driver, just an ordinary person. But when you elect a government that hides like the Mayor sending up a memo to the Council , this is the person that ran and said that as Mayor I would come here at this Council Chamber and speak to the residents . It's not happening . But we've got tons of borrowing . We got talk about more authorities . We've got a Council that gets up, says the Pledge of Allegiance , says they represent us but won't answer a question . And we have the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Times that won't ask a question . It's troubling . I mean, the only thing I heard today is that -- about my video with Frank Scavo is that Mr. Kelly had some kind of problem with it. You've got to ask yourself one question , what's happened to our country because nobody is really representing us. You've got a president who's borrowed 6 trillion dollars and the American dollar is being chased off the monetary exchanges . And we name a street after him and an expressway exit and a Council that voted to make it happen. I mean, we've got to look at who represents us and how are they thinking ? Are they thinking ? He's got classified documents spread all over the country . He took millions and millions and millions of dollars from the Chinese to build the Penn Biden Center. This is the President of the United States. This is the person that this Council named a street after who has no respect for us. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'm not here to talk about my street signs tonight because I keep waiting and hoping that I'll see an advancement in the city and I haven't seen that yet. But last week when Marie was talking and she talked that -- she said something like that she wanted to know how many pedestrian citations were given. Well, I didn't realize that anything was ever -- pedestrian s ever receive d a citation . So that perked my interest as to the walkability of Scranton and the money that we've paid for our study, the walkability study in Scranton . And one of the things I went back to my folder and pulled out some papers on it, so I'd just like to read this little section here. It says that it was developed for the street design parking policy, property redevelopment , and multimodal transport in the downtown Scranton . It will examine how these ingredients make downtown more vital and more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 connect ed to surrounding neighborhood s. This plan will be making specific recommendation s regarding the revision to two-way traffic of Scranton 's one-way street network as well as addition of protected bicycling facilities downtown . So I started -- I was reading that and I read this whole thing of what was passed out to us at least a year and a half ago on the walkability study. And then it just -- I thought where is that? We put a lot of money on this design. And I know they had a meeting -- the last meeting that I knew of was over at Lackawanna College . And looks like it just sort of died. And I think that I see that a lot in Scranton , you know, things are talked about and mention ed and then all of a sudden you don't hear anything about it. We spend money on it, which we did with this study and we don't see anything . I was at the corner of Lackawanna and Wyoming waiting for my turn to advance . And I thought about the pedestrian s that are killed there at that intersection . And I could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 see why. I think it's a wide intersection . And if you're not very mobile on your feet to get across that street, you know, I could see how someone could be killed and hurt there. So I thought about that as I'm sitting at the light. And I thought at what time is the city going to do something about that intersection ? I'm not sure if that comes under public safety. It seems like it would because as you're coming out from Boscov's and you're walking across the street to catch the bus there, you've got to really hustle and bustle to get across that street which should not be. There should be something that should be able to be done with those traffic lights to assist the resident s that are walking and coming out of Boscov's or even coming to go across the street on Lackawanna Avenue. So I thought about the University at Linden and Jefferson . They stop all traffic for those students as they come out of the building there. Something like that should be able to be done for downtown Scranton where it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 hazard as people come with the traffic turning and the people walking in the street. So I'm not sure if it's on anyone's table or anyone's timeline to do something about Lackawanna and -- Lackawanna and Wyoming Avenue. And it's one street over Penn is just as bad. And I thought -- I says, well, that's why I went back to the paperwork to see if there was anything in our walkability study that was going to address the safety of the residents walking in downtown Scranton . They talked about bicycles and they talked about the parking . But I didn't see anything in there to help and assist the residents as they walk in downtown , specifically Lackawanna Avenue at Wyoming and Penn. And I hope it doesn't take another person to lose their life at that corner before something is done at that corner. That's all I have to say tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, good evening , Council . If there's one thing I know this -- my immediate neighborhood . I've walked around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 there for over 25 years with four different dogs. There's no policeman that knows it like I do, no postman, nobody from the city. I know those people that -- I've talked to them. And I listen to stories . You can't imagine some of the things they tell me and in just seconds standing there my neighbor s in the city and the government. Like I said, when I tell you 57 Parker Street is a bunch of undesirables living in that house and have destroyed the tranquillity of that whole neighborhood , you could take it to the bank. And let's just forget Parker Street. We'll bring it up again. I want to talk about the one block I live on the 2600 block North Main, not the block before it or after it, the block I live on. There's 16 properties . Of course, next door to me is this nasty slumlord and has -- he rents to people as low life as he is. They park on the lawn. They've destroyed house values and the house values of the whole neighborhood . It's a big muddy hole. They got a car with no muffler because it's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 out of town license plate -- out of state. These people, they don't care. They don't have nothing to lose. They don't have nothing invested. They're just no better than the mess they made. Across the street is an empty lot where they tore down the house. There's a man that owns the property next to it bought it late last year to, I guess, fix it up like his house is. Next to it is an abandoned house belonged to a guy in Long Island, I think. He bought it years ago for 15,000. And he's milked it dry. He told the last people if they wanted to fix the roof to fix it themselves . Now the roof has been caved in and it's been abandon ed. I don't know what's going to happen with it, of course. Next to that is the corner house where the people have seven cars. I don't know why. You know, I don't know what they do with them all, late model cars, not antiques . Across of it was a little piece of property where they tore the down the house. I guess it's 50 feet by 20 or 30 feet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 The man in that house next to it has maintained it, cut the grass and the shrubs and maintained it perfectly for 12, 15 years until the tenants that's across the street moved in a couple months ago and parked their three cars there, made a big muddy nasty mess in that place which is probably city property . It belonged to a company in California when the house was there. This is the kind of neighborhood I live in. These people -- they got Virginia license plates on their cars. They made such a mess. They put cardboard down trying to get a car out of there. They may leave that mess I guess to dry out and go down the streets and all. Now, who do you complain to? I could complain to you. Nothing 's done. Who are you going to tell, Oleski so he could send Andy Sunday down there, give me another ticket for complaining . That's all he's good for. They got a bunch of prima donnas in that -- overpaid prima donnas that don't do a thing for the people in the neighborhood . Tell me, where are we going? What am I suppose d to do to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 you're reassessing my house and my whole neighborhood isn't worth as much as it was five years ago because of the trash that's moved in there that nobody will do anything about. And then I hear every time there's an election we're going to have jobs in here. We're going to have high paying jobs and thousands of jobs and the blight stuff and nothing 's ever done. Nothing . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, last week I had the pleasure of going to the Planning Commission meeting . I would like to personal ly extend a thank you to Council member McAndrew and Schuster for appearing at that meeting . Though they were only in the back listening to it, it showed that knowing it was going to come before this body and it was of impact to quite a number of people who have spoken here that they understood the necessity to take the time out for such an important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 matter and sit there and listen to it before it got to this body. I appreciate their interaction in other parts of the governmental process , especially when it's that important to the community . Thank you both. The Recovery Act funds, original ly when it was brought before Council to distribute them, we were told that when the money was release d to the companies to start making the plan, our advisor group, that before any decision and distribution of that money would happen it would come back to this body for approval . I see a bunch of money that has gone out. It's been handed out. And I've never seen anything but a report come back to this body saying we spent it. Part of the handing of premoney over was the agreement that it would come back to this body and this body would at least be able to nod an approval or have an input on it. But it seems that is not being honored. We had a public poll that was put out and gathered and the slides of what the Mayor and the Business Office wanted prior and what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the community came back for allocating the funds were shown. The original allocation and its decided allocation , it completely ignored the public input. The management company said as we go forward with the second tranche , we will look into it. We'll look into the public input. And we will adjust our plans based on that public input because what we've done so far we're continuing with it but we'll address that again. I haven't seen them back here. I've seen plans. I've seen nothing that addresses what the public actually put in their percentages . It seems that the public input was just a farce to make it seem like the public actually had input on it. I look at the document on file for the Office of Community Development . Behavioral health and violence prevention , maybe that's why we have the front door locked because the City of Scranton is the highest draw on this program here. I guess for behavioral health, the City of Scranton and the employees have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 drastic need and maybe that door down there is to keep the public safe from the employees inside because they're the ones that took the highest tranche of money out of all the entire group. I take a look at treatment advocacy centers for Lackawanna . I look at the Lackawanna County Treatment Court and Lackawanna County Drug Advocacy Center, all very important . Why isn't this the county's problem ? The money is not for the county. The money is for the City of Scranton . If don't have any advocacies directly for the City of Scranton , maybe we should. Maybe we shouldn 't be giving money to county organizations from the city when the county has their own funding . I also look at the Wright Center, three grants, three grants for the Covid money for a group that was stealing from the people in this city by fraudulently billing medical and were removed from the program for giving the injection s because they were robbing the population , yet they get grants because they helped during Covid. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Oh, they certainly helped. They helped their own pocketbooks. Have you had a chance to look at the Treasury updates for what is allowed under the Recovery Act as I addressed beforehand. MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible .) MR. COYNE: I have updated criteria which I'll present to you after the meeting which is direct research on what is allowed and how it can impact Nay Aug Park. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I would like to acknowledge and thank Frank for forwarding to me the demolition material s that he got. And I have not taken the time yet to come back with some questions but I know I do have a few. So -- but I thank him for his work. Also, I have been trying to use the web and Joan was saying how great it was and I had some problems . I was looking for something in the budget, the operating budget for this year. And I was a little lazy to get up and go get my hard copy. Why should I, I'm sitting here in front of the computer and I tried to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 pull it up. I could find the budgets for, like, back to 2002 and up through 2022. But I couldn't find 2023. And that was approved , what, back in November ? Does anybody know where to find it on the web? No. And that was disappointing . MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you check with IT and see if we can get that -- if it's not uploaded to see that it is uploaded? I know Council , we all receive d a hard copy recently . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, the web in general I would think you might want to put some kind of a group together to work with IT on what they're doing and maybe telling us when they are going to make a big change and what the change was so we don't have to figure it out for ourselves. But I think it needs work. I tried to find the code. I couldn't find the code. It was there but it was very well hidden. But I did get help to find it. And I'm thankful for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And next, do we have -- well, next, I'm sorry. Next, I would like to thank the DPW for working on the drainage from Snook Street onto Seymour Avenue that ended up in the 4 or 5 inch ice for a couple of days there. So the thing I don't know because , of course, there's a stormwater contract on -- for the East Mountain for the stormwater and drainage . And I don't know how well DPW coordinates with the company that has that contract . So they know what's done if it's done well and it doesn't need anything else or if it's just a patch and something will still need to be done. I think that would be helpful . And then I think that we have an expert on Robert's Rules of Orders or those of us who attended the planning meeting would probably still be here. So I thanked him for being here and on the list. Now, the other thing I would like, do we have a list of the pilots -- the payments in lieu of taxes for our exempt -- our property exempt -- property tax exempt organizations ? MR. KING: I'm not aware that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 have a list. I know there's -- I think there's $250,000 that is built into this year's budget. But perhaps we could reach out to the administration to see if we can get a list of which pilots and how much each contributes if you could do that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that tomorrow , sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : I think it would be helpful too because I have requested a right to know the amount of the payroll preparation tax that community -- Geisinger Community Medical Center had paid to the City of Scranton last year. And I got back that my request was denied because as permitted by Section 707 of the right to know letter that nonprofit s are exempt from payment of the city's PPT. However , also on the city's website -- I'll tell you about it next week. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Would anyone else like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Anyhow, I don't understand this obsession with what type of doctor somebody is around here. You know, it's really like why do you insist on wasting our time? You were already told what kind of doctor she was. And a doctor could be a doctor of English literature or a doctor of history , European history or, you know, it doesn't mean that it's a medical doctor. That's an old term. And furthermore , they have a further description , doctor of ophthalmology or oncology , doctor of oncology . So I don't know why we're so obsessed with this. But it gets a little annoying after a while. I don't know, maybe I'm just getting old and I get annoyed really easily, but I don't think so. And another thing that was said tonight , well 25 percent of all the national debt occurred between 2016 and 2020. Furthermore , there was 20 million doses of vaccine s cancelled in September of 2020 because somebody heard that their outlook for reelection wasn't looking too good. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 On top of all the other stuff, refusing to hand back documents for a year and a half -- top secret documents and stuff. I understand how mistakes are made. And furthermore , back when the tea partiers took over the Congress they cut two years in a row 10 percent off of all of the budgets in the federal government . So I'm wondering if these documents -- if I go to the library and borrow a book they send me a letter if I'm late. And, you know, I pay fines at the library because I'm just obsessed with a reading a book and didn't get around to calling them. It was silly. You know, why don't we notice that this stuff is missing or it's been handed out and not recalled ? So, you know, really you're probably right. It's a waste of time to come in here and listen to national issues. But they seem to get their message out. And it's as twisted as a pretzel . I seen an article in the Scranton Times editorial . And according to PPL and PUC (inaudible ) duty. And last week I mentioned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 about an extraordinary high electric bill. Now I wasn't -- it wasn't 300 hundred percent like some people seem to think so. But they were given a 22 percent increase . Is that any kind of anti-inflationary coverage , you know, who in the heck is letting these types of things happen down in Harrisburg ? We have another bunch, you know, we have a Senate now that we can't seem to get rid of. And they even want to turn around and have regional Supreme Court judges. So once again, we got a bunch of bumpkins in there and, you know, it gets gooder and gooder. Build it back gooder. That's the way I like it. So, you know, it's just ungodly how in the heck are people even going to even afford to keep their houses lit with all the electric cars and everything else. And by the way if you followed the events in California last summer, you couldn't even recharge an electric car in August and September . There was fires once again raging all over. So, you know, so I'm a proponent of hybrids , but personally I think electric -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 totally electric cars are blatantly stupid. And this fall is what's causing a lot of our gas and oil uses to actually increase . Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn , you too. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . I wasn't going to come up here at all tonight . But I did want to thank Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew for coming to planning meeting . It was very good. And when Joan mentioned -- I believed that's her name, when she mentioned about going to the library for your taxes, I would like to mention that I believe you could go to the University of Scranton if you're a senior and get your taxes done there also. And I do want to say that Dr. Rothchild , it's like I can't believe this guy keeps talking about putting your thing after -- your physical therapy thing after your name. It's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. In that case, everybody should put their job after their name. So I suggest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 you all get a second name plate and then you put down what your job is or who you work for and then could it would be about the same thing. Okay. Thank you. Good night. And have a good one. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Koloski . Would anyone else like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Not at this time. MR. KING: Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Two, I guess, requests . So I did ask in caucus tonight if Council has the most recent up-to-date version of the new city zone ordinance . Frank, can we reach out to Don King just to make sure that we have the most recent up-to-date ordinance that has everything included so far? And then can we also ask about the comparable sheet that we've been waiting for quite some time that has had the changes on it from the previous zoning ordinance ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then could we also reach out to Miss Cipriani to see if she could come in for caucus to revisit our ARPA plan to see if there's been any changes since the original plan? I know some time has passed. So I would imagine that there is some changes there that we could revisit , see if there's any changes to the guidelines , things that we could adjust moving forward and just to review some of the things that we've done so far and what's to come. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll extend the invitation . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I also have the address , but I'm just going to send it over to you in an e-mail, Frank. Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : For Mr. Voldenberg , I wanted to request that we get an update on the walkability study and its status and the result of it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And then I also wanted to thank my colleague s who were able to attend the Planning Commission meeting last week. I would have also loved to have gone. It's very important to me too. But I was -- a preplanned trip so I was unable to attend. That's why I was unable to make the meeting last week too. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, yes. So the leaf blower is back again at Walgreen 's on South Main Avenue. So this was a big issue last year where they'd hire someone and they were blowing all kinds garbage and debris onto South Main Avenue. I know they -- the code enforcement was there. But all this -- continue to do this. And all of this debris is ending up on neighbor 's properties . So from what I recall, they were only given a warning . This was last year. But this might be the third time in a row it's been brought to my attention . And there's pictures . And I'll have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 them and I'll forward them to you. But I think at some point they should be cited because if this continues , DPW will have more clogged storm drains to deal with just because of this debris, let alone branches and everything else. So if you could please send this complaint along when I give you the picture s. I'll try to get them out to you tonight or tomorrow . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then also, we've been updated or I ran into someone last night as well as my colleague that there's still this really big hole that remains in front of 1452 West Locust Street. It's been there since 2019. A resident has told me this hole has been constantly patched since then but it's a hole. It's not just like a little pothole. It's a hole that remains . And they're worried about a child getting hurt. And I'm worried too after seeing the picture s which I'll also send to you, Mr. Voldenberg . This is a serious safety issue that needs to be -- immediate attention because we talked about it in caucus.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 We said that the water company is saying they're going to come by and do this. And then DPW says, well, we're going to pave it but I think until they're on the same page or the paving list or whatever , this hole needs to be fixed now. If you see the picture s, it's ridiculous . So it's a big safety issue. We can't wait for them to figure out when they're going to pave or dig up the street. I think we have to fix it now until then. So please send that over. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then Mrs. Jeffries brought up a good point. So could you reach out -- I know Dr. Rothchild just asked about an update with the walkability study; but could you ask -- also ask if there's anything reflective of more safety with regards to crossing the streets like mention ed like Lackawanna , Wyoming . Is that considered in the thought process ? If not, maybe we could ask Department of Highways if they could take a look at it. I mean, there might be some way to make a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 safer or extend the time you have to run across the street. Because I, myself, I tried to cross there once and you start hearing that noise and it doesn't seem like there's enough time most of the time to get across the street. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . You stole my thunder . I did want an update on the walkability study as well and street signs. Those are two of the priorities I have listed for this year as well. So I know -- I'm trying to remember the exact amount of money that was in the budget or dedicated towards the street sign. I think it was either 20,000 range. But I'm told that that is a priority , you know, also for DPW and for the administration . So if we could just get an update as to where we're at with that, it would be greatly appreciate d along with the walkability study. And I too would like to thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Council man Schuster and Councilman McAndrew for attending Planning Commission . I was unavailable that evening . So it was -- probably would have been a quorum actually if all three of us were here. But I appreciate them attending. And they have given us some updates as to what occurred that evening on top of what, you know, we obviously read in the newspaper . So that is a priority for this Council . So I want to thank them for that. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING THE MEMBERSHIP PROVISIONS OF THE HOUSING BOARD OF APPEALS . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I know we talked about it in caucus for quite some time. I know at first look I think I would be against the decreasing of the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 of members on this board here. I do see -- I do hear that, you know, there's issues filling seats on this board. And then they haven't really had a full board for quite some time. But there's a couple things that, you know, are of concern to me. If we're going to move this to a three member board, it would be a two person caucus there, which I think opens it up for having a split vote. So, I mean, I'll take some more time to think about it. But at this point in time I think I would be against moving the number of individuals on this board from a five member to a three member. MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, to be honest with you, I hate to see a five member board go to three and then a majority being two. I understand the issues with appoint ing people to this board because of the requirements and the criteria . It's a little more stringent than most of the other boards. I get it. I'll move it with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 reservation . I'm just glad because at one point -- part of the proposal was going to be wanting to reach outside of the city to appoint people for this board. I'm glad a -- I have no appetite for that. So with that said, I'll move it and then I'll have to take a better look and make a final decision . MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.
