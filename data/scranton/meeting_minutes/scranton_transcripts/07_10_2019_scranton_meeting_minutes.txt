Lee Morgan spoke on matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general concern . Marge Kravitz spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Jay Walsh gave resume to City Clerk. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just briefly . I would like to say that I entirely agree with Joan Hodowanitz 's assessment of Dave Bulzoni and the residency requirement . I voted against waiving the residency requirement because it was written in our charter or in our Administrative Code that we -- that you are required to live in the city. But I agreed that should be looked at because talent needs to be what we're looking for going forward . And so I would just like to say I agree with that. And also on Marie's point about PEL, we're looking to reschedule our public caucus with PEL before our summer recess. We haven't -- I don't believe we have heard back from them yet. Lori, have we? We're still working -- okay. So we're trying to reschedule that before recess to get an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 update on the exit plan. A date hasn't been set yet. And then just I'll be passing along some request I got regarding updates on the renovation at Crowley Park. And I will save the rest of my comments for agenda items. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: A few comments . First of all, on the City Hall renovations , I had some conversation s and asked Mr. Bulzoni to look at the options that we might have to see what can be done to finance the restoration of City Hall. Also we talked a little bit about do we have a space plan prior to that so we can incorporate that space plan into the ultimate plan? Because I think it's important after seeing how some of the employees are working within City Hall. It really is horrendous conditions . As Marie stated, effective July 1, 2019, the new common level ratio for Lackawanna County is 9.43. Last year it was 6.54. It hasn't been above 7.09 since 1986. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 currently we have the third highest common level ratio of any county in the State of Pennsylvania . And why is that significant ? Well, the common level ratio is a ratio that measures how a county's base year assessment compares with the real estate market values. This number is established by the State Tax Equalization Board or STEB to calculate a revised assessed value based on established real estate sales from the prior year. For example , if you presently have an assessed value of 20,000 and multiply that by the 9.43 CLR, your market value or revised assessed value is 188,600. So theoretically this could be considered the market value, but as we know based on Marie's comment s that's not necessarily true. What it really points to is the inherent unfairness to our current county assessments . And the higher the common level ratio is, is more of an indication of how skewed our current assessments really are. So being number three in the state is something we should not be proud of. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it's another reasons among the myriad of valid reasons for a countywide reassessment . On Monday I attended a meeting at the PennDOT office in Dunmore with Councilman Donahue . We met with the acting head of the district office, Rich Roman and his staff. The purpose of our meeting was two-fold. One was to revisit the problem s at the intersection of Pittston Avenue and Orchard Street. So PennDOT agreed to look at it again and come up with some addition al suggestions over the next few weeks that could create a safer environment , especial ly for pedestrian s. That's a big concern of ours. So we're hopeful that something positive could finally come out of that. But secondly, we met to create a better relationship with PennDOT ahead of the connectivity , walkability study that's going to be done for the downtown . There are quite a few streets downtown that are currently listed as state roads. And to develop a dialogue early in the process will go a long way toward working together once the study is finally on underway. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 So we all know PennDOT is the vast keeper of regulations . So it's important that they know our concerns and issues right up front before implementation takes place and the study begins. So we also discuss ed the possibility of turnbacks. Now, turnbacks are when state roads could be turned back to the city in certain cases that make sense. And what happens is, PennDOT in perpetuity will pay the city some maintenance costs for taking that street back. Also, there is the idea of a swap program which is swapping out certain city streets for state streets when that makes sense. It's important to have that conversation as well with PennDOT . And finally with PennDOT , there is a winter maintenance agreement where PennDOT would pay the city to plow certain state roads. And that may make sense for both parties because there are currently times when either the state or city plow trucks are lifting their plows for a few blocks and putting it back down because they are passing through someone else's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 roads. In fact, in Philadelphia County alone, PennDOT pays them 4.5 million dollars a year to the City of Philadelphia to plow -- for the city to plow state roads within city limits. So we talked a lot about that. And I would like thank Mr. Roman again and his staff for agreeing to meet with us and allowing us to create a dialogue and conversation . And I think it will be very, very important as we move forward . And it was encouraging . And everybody knows I'm very much a critic of PennDOT . So it was very helpful for me. At yesterday 's meeting we met to establish our paths to appoint an interim mayor for the rest of this year as well as having a special election for a new mayor in November . And then that person would begin serving the first Monday of January in 2020. So all I could tell you is we'll do our very best to have a professional open and transparent process . And as I stated before, we'll continue to do our best to do our best for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 city. You know, there's a saying that I've used over the years. I think everybody 's probably heard this. If you are not part of the solution , you are part of the problem . I'm asking everyone as part of this government as well as our citizens and business community to do your part to be part of the solution . So maybe together if that happens we can all begin to heal a little bit from the deep wounds that have been inflicted on us. And then maybe we can start seeing the other side and begin to thrive again. And finally , my weekly reminder that I've said for months and months at these council meetings may be more relevant than ever. Every day is your chance to make this city a little better. That's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I think everybody at this point feels like we're in a state of purgatory . I've run into a lot of people over the last few days who've asked what exactly will happen over the next six months, what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 going to happen over the next two to two and a half years and even further down the road than that. I have a few suggestions . The first is the Ethics Board. I sent a letter on June 25th -- or this Council sent a letter on June 25th to the City Solicitor asking that legislation be drafted to officially appoint the four members to the Board of Ethics. We'll have to wait for the fifth person to be appointed by whoever the next Mayor is. But we do have four members. So those four people will provide a quorum. They can have a meeting . And I do think we need to get started as soon as possible on that. I think that's important to start to restore confidence and credibility in the city government . Because if you remember , the Ethics Board had been dormant for a number of years. And I think some of the things that we put in the new Ethics Code are important . I think part of that process is education of city employees , of city officials . I looked to what the school board did where elected official s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 are require d to take a course in finance or something to that effect. I think we need look at doing things like that. The second thing that I would recommend and that they are already doing is an assessment of the Licensing and Inspections Department . I think that's really important , again to restore credibility to city government . I think every department in this building needs to be reevaluated . Everything . At this point, I know that there is a lot of negativity . And I understand that because of what happened . And what happened was horrible . But as I said two weeks ago, we now have an incredible opportunity . We have an incredible opportunity to turn things around and do things the right way. And I think that starts with evaluating every department , evaluating every process that goes on inside City Hall. One of the things I would recommend and I have been recommending for the last few years is communication . There is -- there has been a total lack of communication between City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Council and the Mayor's Office and the Administration . And there's been a real lack of communication between our government and our residents . We have provided several ideas on that front. One program would be see click fix where you would start to actually blog and record citizen 's request s and problem s that occur throughout the city. That's just one way to start to change the narrative here where people call City Hall and can't get an answer. I do think that we need to come up with a communications plan over the next two and a half years or however long it would take. Again, I think communication is key. And I don't think we have done a good job -- the city has done a good job on that. The third thing would be our website. I think this is an incredible opportunity to change the way we put information online. Council started to do this a few years ago with putting everything that you see on the agenda online. Where in the past you would have to come down and physically get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 copy. I think all financial information , anything that is public that we can put on the website we should put on the website so that you do not have to make a right to know request or anything like that. I also think we need to evaluate -- reevaluate the way we operate down in DPW and our Parks Department . I think we could do some things more efficient ly there. But again, every function at this point of city government needs to be under a microscope , needs to be reevaluate d and needs to be put on the table. I had a conversation to that effect with the Business Administrator , Mr. Bulzoni this morning . And he agreed. I also think whoever the next mayor is needs to establish a monthly meeting schedule with the neighborhood leaders. Again, for all of the negative things I've heard over the last week, one of the things that we have going for us in the city is that we do have very strong neighborhoods . And for the most part, we have very strong neighborhood leaders and very strong neighborhood groups. So I think whoever the next mayor is over the next six months or two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and a half years, they need to reestablish a very close relationship with the neighborhood leaders and meet with them at least once a month. I know that in the past few years there has been neighborhood summit between the police department and the neighborhood leaders. I think we need to reestablish that. The mayor needs to take a major part in that. You know, just listening again to some of the people that I talked to over the last few days, I do think we have to remain positive here. You know, my family just like a lot of families in this city have been in Scranton and in this valley since the 1800s. I don't think it's time to give up. I don't think it's time to shut the lights off. I don't think that we have any place other to go than up at this point. I mean, if there is a rock bottom I think either we hit it or we're pretty close. But I think that all of us need to step up to the plate at this point and really reevaluate where we are and come up with a plan to continue to move toward. So that's what I have to say on that whole situation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mrs. Reed, if we could find out from Mr. Gallagher and our City Engineer an update on the Paving Program . I've gotten several requests from people who are curious as to when that exactly is going to take place. I know we recently voted on the legislation for the engineering contract . I just want to know when the actual Paving Program is going to take place. I mentioned this a few weeks ago, Mrs. Jefferies who is not here today usually gets up and asks about the Sign Program. We had a company come in and they were taking a look at all of the street signs, stop signs, any other signs throughout the city. And when I talked to Mrs. Jefferies , I incorrectly stated a few weeks ago that their assessment was complete . I was under that impression . But I was actually wrong. We received an e-mail from Mr. Bulzoni . The company has completed seven nights and have three more to go to finish the retroreflectivity portion of it to see how signs are viewed at night which is a major problem .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 They sent in a report to show that the signs that they've rated so far have been very poor. There's many speed limit signs, street name signs, and stop signs that are -- you can't see at night. They're going to set up training for the first or second week in August and then eventually we should start to see some movement . I think the plan is to replace these signs section by section in the city. So I thank Mr. Bulzoni for the update. Another update that we haven't talked about in quite some time is the Kiosk Project that was kind of butted up against the Streetlight Project replacing all the streetlights in the city with LED. This was held up according to Mr. Bulzoni because of PennDOT approval . So he finally received banner information regarding the Digital Media Project with the kiosks throughout the city and they will now approach PennDOT for approval . So we should start to see movement on that. Also, we received a liquid fuels tax fund audit for the period January 1st, 2016 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 December 31st, 2017. And I would ask that this be put in Third Order for next week. In reviewing this document , there was one finding of a nonpermissible expenditure . And that was the city expended $22,550 during 2016 from liquid fuel tax redecorative street lighting in the park which was a nonpermissible expenditure . They also in a previous report recommended that the city file all required documents and information timely to receive its allocation during the first week in April. And during this current examination , they noted that the city had complied with their recommendation . Also on the Linden Street Pocket Park Remediation , we did receive an update from Mr. Bulzoni , although not a good one. The $50,000 LSA grant that the city was going for was not approved . So we are now on the hook for $55,000 in direct funding. He reported that that amount would likely be a component in the 2020 budget or they can revisit the LSA again. The Keystone grant was approved in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the amount of $62,500. And just a reminder that Scranton Tomorrow at this point has a $400,000 grant for those improvements. I mention ed a few weeks ago some good news. The pharmacy benefit manager that the city had entered into a contract with, we have seen significant savings on that end. We received another note from the HR Director that we have $416,000 worth of savings for the nine month period from July 1st, 2018 to March 31, 2019. And in the first quarter of this year alone, we've already saved $137,000. So that actually has turned out to be a very good decision by the Administration and by this Council . Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Kravitz got up and talked about the Ferdinand Street flooding issues. If you could just check with maybe start with Jeremy Hulen{sic} and see if they have a timeline on when that is going to be taken care of, I would appreciate it. Also receive d quite a few citizens requests -- I'll just quickly run through them. Division Street between Keyser Ave., and Dale 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Ave., is getting very narrow. On each side there's a drainage ditch that is between 2 to 3 feet deep. The edge of the road is deteriorating being slowly washed away by every rainfall. If you have a chance to take a ride up in that area and it is very dangerous . We did forward that to the appropriate department and hopefully they will take a look at that. Also, the 300 block of Ferdinand Street received some quality of life issues. So we did forward that again to the Licensing and Inspections Department . 824 Pittston Avenue, this has been a problem property now for the last few years. And a tree had fallen down over into a woman's yard. So we did send that into Licensing and Inspections . So hopefully that gets taken care of. Let's see. What else do I have here? Oh, the last thing I have is when we're talking about the renovation of City Hall, we received in our mailboxes July 9th the following petition from City Hall employees . I just want to read it. It's only a paragraph . It says, "We, the employee s of City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Hall are request ing our building be secured during working hours. Due to the recent event at City Hall, we feel as though our safety is of the utmost importance and we should be able to come to work and do our jobs knowing we are safe. We are requesting measure s be put in place at all entrances to ensure people who may wish to do us harm are kept out." And there are several City Hall employees here and their department . And they signed this petition . I had a conversation this morning with Mr. Bulzoni about this petition . And I do think that the employees who work in this building are correct in their assessment . There was actually a threat assessment completed of City Hall by the Scranton Police Department . And I have it in front of me here. There are several issues that are delineated in this report with security issues with this building . So I don't know if -- I want to double-check to see if this can be made public because it says that the document must be kept secure at all times. And then some other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 things in here are privacy statement s. So I want to triple check with the police department to make sure that if that can be made public before that would be done. But I talked to Mr. Bulzoni this morning . And as part of the overall improvement , the improvements of this building , security would be number one on their list. I think he had a conversation with the IT Director this morning about possibly putting security cameras in the front of the building . And I'm sure there are some other things that they are going to do. But I just wanted to let the City Hall employees know that we are taking those complaint s very seriously . That's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just very briefly , I know most of you that are here were here at our meeting yesterday . And I did mention that at the beginning . Just to recap, regarding applications for the vacancy , we will be taking those until exactly one week today, July 17th at noon. After that point, Council will likely have a special meeting to discuss and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 have an appointment . It may take place at a regularly scheduled meeting if the schedule coincides . But I know all of our goal is to do this process as quickly and openly as possible . So I do want to thank all of my colleague s and all of our staff as well because I know this has been a lot of work, especially on our solicitors , our clerks, all of our assistants . So everyone really has come together during this difficult time for the city. And we are continuing to do our business as well. Council -- we did table a couple of items last week when this first -- when everything transpired . One of those items is coming back for a final vote this week. We're working on rescheduling our caucus with PEL before the end of the month. There is also a couple other items of outstanding legislation that we are working on getting wrapped up over the next couple of weeks as well. So although much of our efforts are going to be focused on this process of selecting a mayor for this appointment , our day-to-day business is still continuing . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So we're going to still continue to push forward with all these different initiative s that are in front of us. And most importantly in my opinion is the caucus with PEL because Scranton is right on the brink of getting out of distressed status. Despite everything that has happened , that has not changed . We're going to continue to work with the Pennsylvania Economy League and our Business Administrator to keep things moving forward on behalf of the residents . That's all. MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at the time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. Previously tabled FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES FOR ADOPTION RESOLUTION NUMBER 127 2019 AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN UGI UTILITIES INCORPORATED , THE CITY OF SCRANTON , AND PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO SETTLE LITIGATION FILED AGAINST THE CITY AND PUC BY UGI. MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Committee on Rules I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question . I am going to be voting against this resolution tonight just because I think it's a bad deal for the taxpayers of the city. And it will negative ly impact the quality -- further negatively impact the quality of roads throughout the city. And I think this is just one more example of the natural gas industry just thumbing their nose at residents . And that's why I will be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I will be voting yes for this. And I'll just be very blunt on why. We had an executive session tonight with the Assistant City Solicitor , Joe Price. And, you know, the crux of the whole conversation is that we don't have a leg -- the city does not have a leg to stand on. We already lost part of the lawsuit . UGI took us right to Commonwealth Court. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 permit fees have to be commensurate with the cost associated with the fees. They were not. We lost that part of it -- or excuse me. We lost part of the lawsuit where we wanted the utility company to get permits to work on PennDOT roads. If we all voted against this and it went back, we would probably lose and it would be even worse. So is this a great situation ? No. But I honestly don't think we have any other choice. Mr. Price also brought the fact that UGI is currently involved in lawsuits with Reading and Lancaster for the same type of reasons . I don't know if they have been successful against those two municipalities . But at this point, you know, I don't think we have a choice. We really do not have a leg to stand on legally . So rather than put the city in more legal harm and potential cost, I'll be voting for this to settle the lawsuit . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I would agree with those comments . And it's one of those situations where I don't think any one of us is happy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 about the settlement agreement . But it is the best that could have been done under the circumstances based on the laws in the state. Obviously as Mr. Gaughan mentioned , if we do vote this legislation down it will continue through the courts. And the city is likely to lose which will end up costing us more money in the long run. So unfortunately , it is -- you know, it is the situation that is before us. But it is the best decision for the taxpayers long-term. MR. EVANS: On the question . Previously we tried to take the path of more stringent guideline s and this is where it got us. But the reality was we were trying to fix a problem . Everybody knows how difficult it is to get around the city and how the pave cuts affect the roads. But what this will also do is put us in direct syncing up with PennDOT and their guidelines . So there will be some consistency there between state roads and city roads. I think there's a benefit to that. So it is what it is. And we're going to have to move on from this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to add one more point. Again, I think this is an opportunity to reevaluate the Pave Cut Inspector's office. There is only one pave cut inspector for 26 or I don't know how many square miles we have in the city, which is in it of itself ridiculous . Again, we talked to Mr. Bulzoni about that. Whoever the next mayor is really has to evaluate the way that we're doing this. I've had reservations about it since I got on Council because it's I don't, you know, think we're really doing it in the most efficient manner. Having one employee to cover all of that ground doesn't make much sense to me. So I think as part of this, you will see possibly a reevaluation of how we do that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : And I agree with Mr. Gaughan on that point about the number of people we have in the pave cut. And that's why I believe we can make -- there's administrative decision s and legislative -- quick legislative changes we can make to be -- to get us to a point where we stand on firmer legal ground. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 And I think that should be the way we go about it.
