Next,inmid-December oflastyear thecitybusiness administrator announced thatthecitywasclosetolanding a$5 million loanwhichwouldbeapplied tothe Supreme Courtawardtotheuniformed employees .Eightweekshavepassed without anupdate.During motions Iwouldlikean update because Ifinditincredible thatthe business administrator wasabletofinda loantorepaytheScranton Parking Authority loanthatwasnotguaranteed bythecity, butpaysofftheloantohisformer employer withtheScranton Parking Authority rather thanpaying whatwehavebeenowingfor several yearsnowtoouruniform police and firemen ?Itjustdoesn'tmakeIsense.

Stating thatitisaconcern Ithinkatthis timeisanunderstatement . Inregards toanother issuethatI havebeenworking on,theDuffypark statute ,currently rightnowweareinthe process wehavefoundalocation foritbe stored inthenextcouple ofweeks.The statute isactually goingtogoovertothe National ParksService.Wehavean agreement withthemforstorage .The evaluation ofthestatute hasbeen completed .Therewassomebadnewsinthat thestatute probably should notbestored outside anymore .Thereissome contemplation ofperhaps making abronze casting ofthestatute .Thebronze statute wouldtaketheplaceofthatinthenew DuffyParkandtheoldDuffyParkstatute1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 willbeplaced somewhere inside for safekeeping .Itisonlyoneofthefewleft intheUnited States anditdeserves tobe protected andrespected andthat'swhatour goalisfromtheverybeginning ofthis,so rightnowthereisnothing setinstonebut theoriginal ideaofrestoring thatstatute andputting itbackinDuffyParkdoesnot seemtobepractical forthestatute . Myothercomments IhaveIwill reserve untilmotions . MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,anumber ofitems briefly .Councilman McGoff mentioned the extension ofthediscount period toMarch17 andIthinkifsomething wereallconcerned about.IknowIwascontacted byanumber ofresidents whowerewonderingwhenthey wouldreceive theirtaxbillandtogetit inunderthediscount period.Ialsospoke tothemayortodayregarding thisissueand onethingIthinkthatshould belooked into moving forwardismaking thediscount period outtoMarch17onapermanent basis.I thinkthreeofthelastfouryearsithas1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 beenextended onatemporary basis,butI thinkwithrising taxesIthinkitwouldbe makesensetoextend thatoutatleastto March17onapermanent basistomakeit easier forresidents topaytheirtaxes. Secondly ,justareport,demolition ofhazardousstructures through thecityhas begun.Afewproperties inSouthSidewere --Ibelieve onewasthedemolished already , afewothers arereadytogosothatis ongoing . Acouple ofissues thatwerebrought upfromthepodium,theissueregarding the OECDloans,IdidspeaktoAttorney Hickey andIdidrequest reportsfromLindaAebli, Ihaven'treceived areport fromMs.Aebli asofyetbutIdidspeaktoAttorney Hickey atlength aboutthedelinquent loanswhich hasbeenalongoutstanding problem forover adecade nowandtheyaregoingbeinglooked into.Twolawsuits havebeenfiledandthey arecontinuing togothrough each delinquency anddetermine thebestcourse of theaction oneachcase. Aquestion wasalsobrought up1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 regarding anantidote forthosewhohave beenoverdosedoncertain drugs.Thisis nasalsprayandit'sastatewide program thatpolice departments across theentire statearebeingtrained toadminister this antidote tohopefully savelives. Andfinally ,thetwoissues Iwanted totalkthemostabouttodaybesides the agenda items,thefirstoneisthearticle thatwasinthenewspaper andtheFacebook pageregarding Ithinkit'sReading Terminal atTheMallatSteamtown.Ispentmuchof theweekreading manyofthepostsonthere andIknowCouncil McGoff hadcommented on someaswell.Itisaverygoodideafor themallandthereareanumber ofgood ideasthathavebeenbrought upby face-to-facewithus,atthatpodium here, outinthecommunity ,onsocial media,and thelistgoesonandonandallofthegreat ideasbuttheonebigproblem --thebig obstacle thatwearefacing regarding this mallistheownership ofit.Itwouldbe greatifthefiveofusuphereandthe mayorcouldsaythisiswhatwewanttodo,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 themallisaprivate property .It'snot ownedbythegovernment andMr.Boscov has, unfortunately ,driven themalldownapath whereyouseethesehighvacancy rates. Somepeople believe thatthatisbeingdone intentionally todrivedownthepriceofthe mallsocancomeinandbuyit.Thereare manyideasoutthereforthemallandI thinkithastostartwithnewownership of thatbuilding ,newprivate ownership .The ideathecounty commissioners floated of making thebuilding government offices would beadisaster ,buttherearesomanygood ideasouttherefromthepublic.

Manyotherstories thatwerefloated around orahybrid whereyouwouldhaveloft apartments onthetopandshopsand restaurants onthebottom.Therearemany ideasandtheyareallgreat,butIfirmly believe thatthebiggest problem facing that mallrightnowistheownership and Mr.Boscov.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Finally ,regarding thearticles in thepaperregarding thedouble pensions ,I knowthatCouncilman Wechsler touched on thisalittle bit,obviously moving forward wewanttomakesurethisdoesn'thappen again,butyetit'salsoourobligation to findouthowthishappened underthe previous administration andthecity controller 'swatch. So,Mrs.Reed,ifit'sagreeable couldweplease sendaletter toCity Controller Rosanne Novembrino asking fora report onhowthiserrordidoccurandwhat sheisdoingtotryandcorrect thismoving forward soitdoesn'thappen again.

Andregarding Mr.Bulzoni ,IguessI1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 willcomment onthisnow,IknowIspoketo Councilman Evansmultiple timesonthis issueandheprepared someamendments to makethatissueregarding Mr.Bulzoni 's residency morefair,requiring himtopay thewagetaxtotheCityofScranton and placing Ibelieve it'stotheendofthe yearlimitonwhenthewaiver willexpire andhewillhavetomoveintothecity. Aswasmentioned ,somepeople have said,well,thisissetting precedent for future employees ,andinthepastablind eyewasjustturned totheseissues.This issetting aprecedent thatthereisa proper procedure tofollow ifthereisan employee thatdoesn'tliveinthecityor thatisconsidering oneofthesepositions thatdoesn'tliveinthecity.Ifirmly believe thatanyone whodoesworkforthe citythat'sliving outside should paythe wagetaxtothecity.Idiscussed withsome ofmycolleagues thatformethatwasthe bigitemandifthatwasn'tincluded I wouldn'thavevotedforthewaiver.SoI'm hopeful thatthiswillpass,theamendments1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 willpassandmakeitmorefairsituation , andthatisallfortonight .Thankyou.

MR.GAUGHAN :I'llgofirst,thank you.Iwillbevoting against this legislation tonight .Extending contracts until2021inlightoftheCity'sAct47 deadline anddirefinancial situation along longwithpassing contracts inadvance of therevised recovery planisgrossly irresponsible andextremely short-sided. Giving outraises,giving back retiree health care,giving morevacation timeandtaking thecapoffsickdaysisnot something afinancially distressed city should bedoing. It'scleartomeandmanycitizens I havespoketooverthelastfewweeksthat MayorCourtrightishoping thatourproblems willjustgoawayandmaybesomeone else willmakethetoughdecisions lateron. MayorCourtright should understand that kicking thecandowntheroadisn'tgoingto workmuchlonger because heisrunning out ofroad.Mydecision tovotenoontheboth1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 contracts isn'tsimply tobeacoginthe wheelofthisadministration .IwantMayor Courtright andourcitytosucceed .Myjob, however ,istoreview allofthefactsand makeadecision thatIfeelisinaboutbest interest ofthetaxpayers andthefuture of thiscity. Itbothers methatgoingbacktothe police contract Isubmitted atleast15or 16specific questions andIhavenot-- stillhavenotreceived answers tothose questions whichIfindoutrageous .They werelegitimate questions ,andeventhough thepolice contract haspassed Istillwant thosequestions answered .Isubmitted two questions aboutthefirecontract andI haven'treceived aresponse tothose questions asofyet,sohopefully Iwill receive thoseatsomepointwithin thenext year. IfeelCouncilman EvansandIhave presented legitimate ,validarguments and concerns overthepastfewweeks.Irespect mycolleagues ,butIstrongly disagree with theirvoteontheseissues andIdonot1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 thinkthisisagooddealforthetaxpayers ofthiscity.Thankyou. MR.EVANS:Onthequestion ,aswe enterintoourclosing arguments ,lastweek Imentioned partoftheproposed MOUandI certainly appreciate theefforts bythe bargaining teamsonwhattheywereableto accomplish onmany,manyfacets ofthe contract .However ,inreviewing the firefighters MOUIcametoseveral different conclusions onthesavings aspect andthose thatwerepresented . Firstofall,thesavings ofnearly $1.5million wasachieved onthepremise thatifthecitywenttoarbitration the salary increase sof3percent wouldbe expected ,yet,therehavebeensome indication thatthistrendmayhave shifted ,especially consider ingthe financial status ofcities likeScranton . Ifarbitration brought in1percent less thanprojected ,thosecostsavings wouldbe eradicated andneither scenario is speculative atbest. Additionally ,savings through the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 sickdayenhancement ,vacation increases and retirement changes arebasedmostlyon expecting changes inbehavior .Byoffering enhancement tothesickdaypolicy byadding vacation time,bygiving retiree health care,theyaretaking averycarrot anda smallstickapproach tosaving money. Frankly ,insomecaseswearehoping forchange andcostsavings byrewarding evenbadbehavior ,particularly asrelates todisability pensions ,butifbehavior doesn'tchange projected savings maybe reducedoreliminated andweareleftwith onlythecosts. Whilethismightbeavery interesting casestudyforfuture labor contracts through theuseofhumanbehavior patterns andpsychology ,Iamfinding it difficult toholdtheprojected savings in ashighregard assomeothershave.Yet, thefuture legacycoststhatIhave discussed during theFOPcontract arereal. Theadministration putadollar amount of $224,000perretiree fromtheFOPcontract onretiree benefits .Basicmathwilltell1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 youthatifall99ofthosepolice officers takethisbenefit itwouldcostaminimum of $22million . Whileit'smoredifficult to determine thecostofretireehealth care forthe60elderly firefighters ,because we haven'tseenanestimate provided inthis MOU,butbecause thelanguage istighter in thefirefighters 'contract,evenifwe conservatively estimated thatwouldbe75 percent oftheFOPcontract or$168,000per retiree,thiswouldstillmeananadditional costofaminimum ofover$10million . Thesearelegacy coststhatwill begininthe2020to2021timeframeand extend forthenexttenyearsandbeyond. Thesearecoststhatarenotaccounted for. Ifeverything somehowgoeswellfinancially , almost perfectly overthenextfewyears,we couldexitthedistressed citystatus in 2020orearlier andthenfindoutthatwe haveanadditional $32million ormorestill waiting forusontheotherside. Therefore ,Ican'tingood conscience voteforsomething thatIbelieve1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 willsubject future taxpayers and Scrantonians toincreased long-termlegacy costsinexchange forshort-termgains,some ofwhicharesimply tiedtothechange in behavior .IcanonlyhopeandpraythatI'm wrong,butItrulybelieve thisMOUwill ultimately bringusbackfullcircle to financial distress orworse,andforthose reasons Iwillbevoting "no"tothis legislation .Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Anyone else? MR.ROGAN:IguessI'llrespond ,I wascontent withvoting onitbecause I thinkwehavealldiscussed thisquiteabit overthelastfewweeksandtherearemany reasons whyIbelieve thisisagoodplan forthetaxpayers andIthinkthemajority ofthiscouncil whenwewillvotewill agree,andthefirstoneis,andthisis whereCouncilman EvansandIstrongly disagree ,isregarding arbitration .You heardlastweekandalsowiththepolice contract whatgoingtoarbitration underthe previous administration costthecity.The costswereastronomical .Raises over501 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 percent topolice officers andfirefighters whencompounded .Anarbitration awardthat westillowethatwasinexcessof$40 million ,isnow--itwasreducedthrough a unionconcession toapproximately $20 million andtheinterest onthatawardis growing atarateofapproximately $100,000 permonth.Thatwastheresult ofletting oldcontracts expire andfailing to renegotiate .Although itispossible that whenthecitygoestoarbitration wecould getabetter dealthenwecurrently have, judging bythepastarbitration softhis citythatisvery,veryunlikely . Inaddition tothecostsavings that wereoutlined inthisproposal ,andIhave toagreewithCouncilman McGoff'searlier statement sthatthereporting fromthe Scranton Timesregarding thefirecontract hasbeenmuchmorefairthanthereporting forthepolice contract ,butanother item thatisveryimportant outside ofthe financial aspect iskeeping ourfirehouses open.Wesawwhathappened whenformer MayorDoherty closedfirehouses onEast1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Mountain andinotherareasofthecity.It wasadisaster .Thisproposalwillkeep neighborhood firehousesopenanditcould possibly reduce theovertime costtozeroif wegettheSAFERgrantintheamount thatwe areapplying for,whichisamuchlesser amount because ofthelowerwagesinthis contract compared tothewagesunderthe current contract . Forthosereasons andmany,many morethanIcanprobably goonforanother 15minutes ,Iwillbevoting "yes"forthis contract andI'llbeveryhappythatitis goingtopasstonight . MR.WECHSLER :Ijusthaveafew things here.Number one,acopyofthe confidential agreement wasprovided tothe Scranton Timesthisweekincluding allof theinformation incolorsothatwas--I thinkit'spartofthereason whyreporting onthisissuewasabitmorefairthanthe previous one,theywereprovided more information sothatwasgood. Iwouldliketoaddress thechanges inbehavior .Thechanges thataregoingto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 berequired ,asMr.Evansmentioned ,weren't determined bythecity,thesechanges in termsofthephysical fitness ofthe officers ,thetraining oftheofficers ,the different reviewsofdisabilities ,those camefromthemembers .Ourfiredepartment rightnowisintransition .Thereare several younger firefighters andperhaps the newonesthataregoingtocomeonboard haveadifferent attitude towards firefighting .Theyarefirefighting professionals .Manyofthemhavecollege degrees invarious firescience ,someof themareaccountants ,someareeven attorneys ,sothereisgoingtobeachange inbehavior justbecause thefaceofthe organization ischanging . Another thingthatIwouldliketo mention ismanyoftheseconcessions that werefinally agreed uponwereverysimilar totheonesthatweresuggested inthefirst recovery planthat70percent ofthe citizens ofScranton votedfor.Wegot thoseconcession s,wewentatitadifferent waythistime.Thelasttimewewentatit1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 itcostsus$40million ,latertobereduced to$22million withinterest stillgrowing onthat. Also,intouching onwhatMr.Rogan said,keeping neighborhood firehouses are veryimportant tome.Coming fromEast Mountain ,wewanttoseeEngine10remain openandoneofthewaystodothisisto addmorefirefighters toourforceandthe onlywaywecandothatistogetsomenew personnel inthere.Thisnewcontract as ratified willmakeiteasier fortheSAFER granttobeawarded tous.
