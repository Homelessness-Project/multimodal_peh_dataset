MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY HELD OCTOBER 7, 2020. 3-H. MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING HELD OCTOBER 1, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Just one, Mr. Gaughan , we when we're looking at 3-F, we got correspondence from the Pennsylvania Economic League on the review of taxation exempt properties . In that it said that the coordinator does not perform this function . But I guess my question would be, who is it that is able to perform the review of these nonprofit organization s? And would it be the right place to say to make a motion in Fifth Order to have Mr. Hayes explore the possibility of reviewing these? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, so I know the answer to that. We had asked the -- it would be the administration that would be able to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that. And that would be their responsibility . And the administration did respond to a question that we had posed to them. And they said that they have not been able to perform a tax exempt analysis this year. But they do have plans to do one in 2021. And the Mayor was sending pilot request letters to all tax exempt entities this month. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else with any comment s on any of the Third Order items? Okay, if not, received and filed. Do any Council members have announcements at this time? MR DONAHUE : I have one, just a reminder about the 2020 Fall Leaf Pickup and Recycling Program . All leaves must be placed in biodegradable brown paper bags. Unfortunately , the City has run out of their share of biodegradable bags. I guess we went through about 15,000 of the brown paper bags in the last month. You know, but I think you could still -- you could still get them at Lowe's, Home Depot, Gerrity 's or any other home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 hardware store. All collections are curbside of streets and avenues , no collection s in courts or alleys, no loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash in the leaf bags. The remaining weeks for the pickup are this week then the week of November 24th, which is Thanksgiving week. And then the week of December 7th. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Does anyone else have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So, first of all, tomorrow is Veterans Day and thank you to all of our vets for your service . With that said, Victor Alfieri 's Club will be having a dinner, spaghetti dinner tomorrow 4 to 8 p.m. All right. It's $10. But it's free for veterans . So I hope they get the chance to take part of that. Also I have something else coming up. So every year this is -- this is a proud announcement I like to make. Every year my family, we have this McAndrew Family Cookies For Kids Cancer bake sale, all right. This is our eighth year coming up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And, you know, the past two years we gave two local children that were -- had this horrible disease , you know, half the money that we raised. This year we racked our brains out with how we could still continue to do this because of COVID. And during COVID presented some challenges . But when we found out from this organization , you know, I'm a member of that a little kid -- I don't know if you could see his face here, this little kid named Arthur who is battling brain cancer himself. He's six years old. He had his own bake sale last year and raised 17,000. But he came up with a fantastic idea that we're going to implement this year. It's called a cookie tree. So it's just a safer way to raise money. And all this information is on our Facebook page. We have one. And basically all you need to remember to do is three things, you can bake some cookies , okay, you could deliver them to family members safely, to friends with a little note that we have some templates on our website. And then you make a donation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 It's a page link to Cookies for Kids' Cancer. And then, you know, this continues the chain. So I very much love, you know, the fact that our community always supported us. We raised tens of thousands of dollars . But this was our way to continue our mission and I'm very excited about. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . And thank you and your family for doing that. That's a really great cause. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : I would just like to say Happy Veterans Day to all the veterans out there tomorrow . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few announcements . First, tomorrow , Wednesday , November 11th, City Hall will be closed in observance of Veterans Day. And to all veterans of all branches , thank you for your sacrifice , your bravery and the example you set for all of us here in the United States. Thank you for your courage in fighting for our people in the United States 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and our values, for your service to defend our nation and our freedom and to all those who have served in our City and our state and our country and those who continue to serve, Happy Veterans Day. May God bless and protect all of our active military and veterans . And I also want to wish a Happy Birthday to the United States Marine Corps, turned 245 years old today, so semper fi. My dad is a proud United States Marine. So Happy Birthday to the Marines . DPW will also be off on Wednesday for the holiday . Refuse and newspaper collection s will be one day behind for the remainder of the week after Tuesday collections . This Thursday , November 12th, at 6 p.m., Council will hold a work session for the purpose of discussing the 2021 operating budget with the Mayor and the Business Administrator . This work session will be livestreamed and broadcast on ECTV for the public to view. A second public work session is planned for the following Thursday , November 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 19th at 6 p.m., as well. So the plan would be to take a look at and have the administration present the budget -- tentative budget this Thursday to Council , work through any questions and then the final budget will be -- that's presented to the public will be on our agenda for Tuesday , next Tuesday . And then we'll have a followup session with the administration next Thursday , the 19th at 6 p.m. And that's all I have. Anyone else? Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And during this the Citizens Participation portion of the meeting we have Mr. Carl Deeley here tonight who is our Business Administrator who requested to give a presentation on healthcare savings and a general update I think on healthcare in the City. Mr. Deeley, I'll turn it over to you. MR. DEELEY: Thank you. Good evening , Council . I do believe we have our administrator in the waiting room if we can let them in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, you know what, I didn't let them in because I didn't know who they were. So how many people are there? It seems like there is quite a few. I want to make sure we're not letting in any -- MR. DEELEY: Maximum of three. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, there's one, two, three, four, five. Do you know the names of these people, Carl? MR. DEELEY: It's Charles Walters , Denise Lang and Brian -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, Brian. How about Melissa Hughes? MR. DEELEY: Oh, Melissa -- she's welcome . MR. GAUGHAN : I'll let them all in then and hope for the best. MR. DEELEY: Great. Excellent . So we did send a presentation I think ahead of the meeting . If you've got that that we can maybe put up on the screen or maybe you would like me to share. Either way is fine. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, Carl, you could share that. That would be great. MR. DEELEY: All right. Can we see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that? MR. GAUGHAN : And you know what, Carl, if you want to have all of the people that just came in identify themselves just for the record so that we know who is in this meeting and who they represent . MR. DEELEY: Absolutely . So Willis Towers Watson recently appointed consult ants benefits broker so on the call here -- so maybe, Chuck, if you could introduce the team? MR. WALTER: Sure. My name is Chuck Walter. I'm with Willis Towers Watson. Also on the call with me is Brian Terpak who is the financial consultant for the City as well as Denise Lang who is the client advocate . MR. DEELEY: Great. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And then we also have I think Melissa Hughes. And is she with PFM? MS. HUGHES: Good evening . MR. GAUGHAN : Good evening . Okay. Go ahead, Carl. Thank you. MR. DEELEY: Okay. So we have a few slides that we're going to go to and review where we are so far. And so, Chuck, I'll leave it up to you. Just tell me when you want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 to progress to the next slide. MR. WALTER: Perfect , yeah. So thank you for giving us the time to present and give you guys an update. We are excited about the opportunity to work with the City of Scranton . And we wanted to kind of walk through where we are in the last 60 days that we've been working on this. So I'll just kind of maybe do a quick background . We're looking to maybe get about 20 minutes of your time. If you guys want more, that's fine. But we don't want to take up too much time. So when we were first appoint ed, one of the things we wanted to do was really review all of the program s you have, do a deep dive and see if there were opportunities for savings , savings that did not impact employees , did not impact the benefits that were offered by City but just efficiencies and ways of just negotiating better terms and conditions . So we went through all of the data. And one of the things we do is we kind of compare it to our benchmarks. So we look at, you know, what are you paying for certain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 service s, what are discount s, what are the contractual languages within the program s to see if they're up to standards and if there's ways to improve the efficiencies . And I think we had some pretty good successes in the first 60 days. That's kind of what we wanted to present here today. Carl, if you go to slide two? So we're going to talk about not all of your lines of coverage , but we're going to talk about the ones where we had some impact. So that would be your pharmacy , your stop loss marketing . So we did market your stop loss insurance . Stop loss insurance if you're unaware is basically insurance -- the City is self-funded for your medical and prescription programs . And when you are self-funded you need protection from large claims as a whole and overall bad claims experience . So we did shop the stop loss. And we did find some efficiencies there. We'll talk about Highmark administration . We'll talk about the Performance Health Program . Perform ance health is a program -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 there's six hospital s and about 70 medical facilities within the area that if employees go to these, they get -- the City is supposed to get better discounts on these. And the employees benefit because they don't have to pay their copays. We went through that contract and we negotiate d it for you. We got some savings there. We'll talk about the Benistar Retiree Program and then we'll talk about the reduction in the fees commissions and then give you a total savings analysis at the end. Carl, slide three. Okay. I'm going to turn this over to Brian Terpak. And again, he's your financial consultant . He'll walk through the pharmacy . By all means, if you have some questions , please speak up because some of this can be confusing if you don't (audio interruption .) MR. TERPAK: Yep, thanks, Chuck. So I'll pick it up from here. Good evening , everyone . My name is Brian Terpak. As Chuck mentioned , I'm the financial consultant for the City. And we're going to go through a few of these -- some of the early success that we've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 had. So as it relates to your pharmacy program , it's a very significant portion of the total dollars spent on the medical programs , probably about 20 -- 20 percent and growing every year. And so what we found when we looked when we start diving deeper into the program that there were a some clear efficiencies that we would be able to gain while not interrupting any employee experiences or member experiences . So we compared the contract that's in place with what we're used to seeing with a group of Scranton 's size. And we're really able to find savings through two avenues . The first is, better discounts . So every time a member goes to the pharmacy and fills a script, you're getting some type of discount with your pharmacy program right now. And so what we saw was, that you were lagging behind some of the major categories of both brand and generic drugs. So we negotiated with Elixir. And we were able to as you'll see in purple there under negotiated , we obtained some better discount s that will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 have an immediate impact on pharmacy spend moving forward in 2021. The dollar amount estimated associate d with the discount s is about $220,000. That can change plus or minus, you know, five percent or so depending on what kind of year you're having. But in terms of, you know, trying to control , minimize and contain some of the growing pharmacy cost, that was certainly an important juncture . So the second component is towards the bottom of the page. So being a self-funded plan sponsor , the City receives pharmacy rebates from these drug manufacturers . And these rebates are not insignificant . They -- the City has been receiving about $400,000 of rebates annually from Elixir. So the dollar amount of these rebates that you're getting every time a member fills a 30 day, a 90 day or mail order specialty script are fair. They're where the market should be. But you were only receiving 80 percent of the total rebates that the City was, you know, was allotted . And so we negotiated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that again with Elixir and now the City moving forward will be getting 95 percent of those rebates . And that was an incredibly conservative figure of a hundred thousand dollars of annual rebates that you'll get next year. We've seen, you know, 10 to 20 percent growth in rebates year over year. So I would not be surprised if that were to exceed that number but conservatively about $320,000 of total savings through the pharmacy program . Are there any questions on that? Okay. So the second thing we're going to talk about is the stop loss. So and stop loss is incredibly tedious . It's a -- there's a lot of nitty-gritty in terms of all the different contract provisions . But, you know, one of the things that we, you know, we pride ourselves in is we've got these preferred pricing arrangements with certain carriers . So we took your current contract and marketed to some of our preferred vendors . And we were able to find that just simply through the marketing we were seeing something around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 $74,000 of savings to your current cost. And there's about an $86,000 reduction to the best renewal we got from your -- the incumbent stop loss carrier Vista. So that's -- as Chuck mentioned , this is a benefit that does not phase employees . This is all on the back end. So not only did we find some efficiencies in the savings, we're also able to secure a far superior contract terms. I'm not going to go through everything that's on the bottom of the page. But suffice it to say that, you know, the current plan had some provision s that your spend could have easily been a million dollars more last year if, you know, certain claimants had particularly bad years. But, you know, we're able to get -- we were able to get a better contract and better contract terms for the City through marketing . So, Denise, I believe you're going to take the administration ? MS. LANG: Sure. Thank you, Brian. So here this is for the Highmark administration , the medical plan. And so here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 it's showing us that for the Highmark PPO administration where there are currently 536 employees , the current Highmark is -- the total monthly administration cost is almost $32,000 again monthly . It amounts to total annual administration cost of 300 -- almost $380,000. That's under the current plan. The initial Highmark renewal increased the monthly administration cost to almost $35,000 which would have made it total annual administration cost of almost $417,000. With some additional negotiation with Highmark , they agreed to a flat renewal based on the current plan. And so they kept the monthly administration cost at the $31,652 with a total annual administration cost so $379,829. So this flat renewal represents an administration that is increased current -- excuse me, I'm sorry. The initial cost would have increased the current medical administration expenses by $37,000. But again, because we were able to negotiate with Highmark . There will be no increase to this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 particular spend. So for the Performance Health administration also taking effect January 1st, 2021, again the current PPM is $10 which is the percent of savings fee is about 10 percent and estimated cost of percentage of savings fee is $160,000. The total administration and percent age of fee cost is currently $227,560. The initial renewal was a flat renewal so it would have remained -- the current spend would have remained in effect. But with some additional negotiation we were able to achieve some savings . So the PPM went from then $10 to $3. The percent age of savings fee went to 7 percent . And the estimated cost of percent age of savings fee is now $112,000 which makes this a total administration and percentage of fee cost of $132,268. So the cost difference is minus 41.9 percent . And the dollar cost difference is $95,282. So again, with negotiations , we were able to reduce the Performance Health cost by $95,000.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. WALTER: Just, you know, to add onto this, I mean, this program -- our understanding of it from employees is some employees are aware of it, some employees are not aware of it. It really depends on what card you give at time of service if you go through the Performance Health, Commonwealth Health folks or if you go through Highmark . What we had found and what Brian did some analysis of this is the cost that you were paying to have Performance Health in effect was actually offsetting the discounts they were -- the additional discounts they were getting by negotiating with these hospitals . So we really felt at the end of the day you weren't gaining by having this in effect. And really, it was just costing the City money. You know, obviously we don't want to take away any benefit s. But we went back and we feel that at this point by saving this $95,000 it should at least make it worthwhile . But I think this is a program that, you know, I think we all need to have a discussion on as we move into 2021. One additional note I'll put on here is, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 we did the analysis based on 1.6 million dollars in usage that went through that in 2019. And we used 2019 because it's not impacted by COVID. So it was a true year. And there was 1.6 million dollars in gross claims. And they get 10 percent of that 1.6 million dollars . So it was a pretty good deal. Getting it down to where it is now I think is a much better deal for you guys. And I still think that they are being paid fairly. Any questions on that? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, Mr. Walter and Miss Lang, now will that -- that's going to be for the 2021 year. How many years will that go at that rate? MR. WALTER: Well, I mean, listen, they're not going to increase it I could tell you that, you know, because I think they realize it that I don't think it was a great deal. So the way it was set up was they were reimbursing these hospitals and these doctors at what's called Medicare. And they're reimbursing them at about 145 percent of Medicare I think is what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 they told us. When you compared their discount -- so gross charges came in. We looked at the reports. And they were getting about 71 percent discount off of what the gross charges were to what they were paying after factoring in their bills. If you look at what Highmark gets, it's about the same. So at the end of the day, the City was kind of paying $10 a month for this. But I don't know if they were really gaining savings. I think based on where we are now, yeah, you'll probably get some efficiencies out of it. I think we have to decide if it's something that we want to keep, do we try to drive better negotiations as far as what the reimbursement level is to the hospital s and providers . And that's something that I think we need more work on. But at this point this fee that they're agreeing to is a 12 month fee. But I don't see it going up. I don't think we would allow it. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, I mean, the previous provider also had a similar service , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 correct , where it judged -- I mean, each cost off of Medicare or that Medicare standard ? MR. WALTER: That's what Performance Health is. That is them. Though Performance Health is the administrator that processes and pays those claims from the hospital s that are out there, the six hospital s in that area. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And when we were looking at the -- you were doing the Highmark renewal and you got -- there was an increase this year with the previous provider but you negotiated a lower fee. Will that continue into 2022 or it's just the 12 month as well? MR. WALTER: The Highmark administration renewal is a 12 month renewal . I think their fees are fair. I don't think they're high. I don't think that they are low. I think again, you know, I think they would be hard-pressed to push through much more than what they're getting . But we'll have to see how it goes next year. I mean, they may want to get a 1 or 2 percent . They were looking at 9 percent . And that's just not market based.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. WALTER: No problem . Okay, Carl, next slide. So I'll through the Benistar program . So Benistar is your retiree program . And these are for folks who -- you do have some retirees that are on Highmark . But these are folks who are on the retiree program . It's a very rich program , a great program for the employees . We spoke with them. We basically told them, listen, you know, the City is not going to be accepting an increase this year. They initial ly came out at 3.9 percent increase which was going to cost you about $130,000. After negotiating with them, they came off and actually reduced costs over the current year. So they're coming down 7.1 percent or about $237,000 over 2020's costs. Again, a lot of pieces go into this puzzle with Benistar . There's the piece that you pay. But they're also getting money through the Medicare premiums and the government . So again, great program and it came on this one. And I think they did the right thing. So this slide here is basically when we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 were appointed we said that we would much rather work for a fee, especially on a public sector group. So we removed commissions . We did go through all the program s. And this kind of outlines where commission s were found and the estimated amounts . They may not be dollar to dollar. I kind of rounded them here. So the stop loss had 15 percent commissions in there. We removed that effective 10/1. When Brian was showing that report that had the stop loss on it, that was the rates you're paying net of commissions . So commission s were already removed out of that. So that additional savings we show you on that plan is in addition to the $90,000 here. There was a company that Elixir was paying. And Elixir was paying this company $3 per script. That equated to about $70,000. The name of the company was Remedy Analytics . And I did see some reporting that they had provided the City, didn't really know what else they were doing. The decision was made that you guys wanted to remove them. We do a lot of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 analytical work anyway. So I think it was a smart move. And this money has been removed I believe as of October 1st as well, the $3 per script. And that's about $70,000. Millennium was getting through Elixir $4,500 a quarter . That was also removed . That's 18,000. The Benistar Program also had commissions built in. There was a one and a half percent commission for the medical and a $4.10 percent per employee per month or per retiree per month on the RX. That's about $43,000. And then they were also I believe getting a consulting fee directly through the City. So adding that all up, that came to the $249,000. Note, there was no commissions built into the Highmark administration , the Delta Dental or the vision provider . And we confirmed all of that. So this is additional savings that have been removed and the City is enjoying these savings now. Any questions there? Okay, Brian, do you want to handle this slide? MR. TERPAK: This is a big picture view of some of the early success es that we've had. So, you know, the supporting information 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 is on the previous slide. So I wouldn't go through it in great level of detail. But, you know, we really -- the things that we talked about today were the Highmark administration , Performance Health administration , the retiree program , your pharmacy contract , your stop loss and the consulting income that Millennium was previously receiving versus what we have agreed to on a fee basis. So, you know, what that amounts to so far if we look at that based on how it would compare to what your renewal would be, for instance . So, you know, if you made no changes , you let everything renew and kept Millennium as the consultant , it would have been roughly a $219,000 annual increase over what you were previously paying. What we, you know, what we -- since we've entered the picture , we'll look at the negotiated renewal column. If we look at how you're now compare d to current costs, you're going to save about $876,000 compare d to what you would have -- what you were currently paying. And that number actually jumps to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 about 1.1 million dollars of really cost avoidance when comparing it to the initial renewal positions and keeping Millennium as the consultant s. So, you know, these are a few quick and dirty ways that we've been able to drive efficiencies while not impacting members . And I think really this is the way we view it as this is really just the first step of, you know, some of the potential what we would like to accomplish long-term. But, you know, without affecting any bargaining without affecting really any employee experience at all, you know, we've had success in driving some of these savings . Chuck, I don't know if you have anything to add on that? MR. WALTER: No, I mean, I think this is a good picture . I mean, again, it's not all your lines are covered so can't say, oh, we were only paying 4.6 million dollars in benefits . It's a lot bigger number. But we've been pretty pleased with where we've been able to get things in the short period of time. And we're trying to line up some of these renewal dates. They were kind of all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 over the place. So we're going to try to have it so that moving forward , everything is renewing on a one-on-one basis and we can kind of, you know, keep an eye on things and really go throughout the year. And our goal is and one of the things we do kind of going off this topic is providing you guys financial reporting at least quarterly or at least every so often, you know, if we can get on a call like this is to kind of tell you where things are going with benefits . You know, 2020 was a very unusual year. 2021, we believe will go back to normal. So it will be more like 2019. But this is kind of the stuff we do. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. I appreciate the update. And I would appreciate the, you know, update once a quarter or whatever works for all of you. And I think it is important to note as you did at the bottom of the screen that, you know, the City's -- I mean, you've only been here for how long, sixty days? MR. WALTER: Yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. So we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 already seeing a savings of nearly a million dollars and that according to your slide is without impacting any City employee . So, I mean, I just think that's great news. And I appreciate the work that you've done so far. MR. WALTER: Great. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else have any questions ? Okay. MR. WALTER: Thank you, guys. MR. DEELEY: Appreciate the opportunity . Thank you, Council . MR. GAUGHAN : And, Carl, would you be able to stick around for just a few minutes ? I think there was some questions on the TAN. I know I had some questions . MR. DEELEY: Yes. MR. WALTER: Thank you, guys. Have a great night. MS. LANG: Thank you. Bye-bye. MR. TERPAK: Bye-bye. MR. DEELEY: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Carl, thanks for sticking around. I just had -- real quick, I just had a question on the TAN. Let me grab my notes here. Okay, so we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 do have the TAN in Fifth Order as you know, tonight , Carl, 5-B. So can you just explain -- I know the last few years since I've been on Council , the City has historically gone for a TAN of 12,750,000 dollars . And that's really been for the last I'd say five or six years. This year we're going for an amount of 12,200,000. So can you just explain to the Council why the reduction in the amount of money that the City is going for? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so the purpose of the TAN is just to ensure we've got sufficient cash flow to get through the year and take into account the ebbs and the flows that we have with our revenue stream. A couple of things is, first of all, the realization of the revenue s. I was looking back at historical realization -- and also what we're planning to do as we go into next year is level out some of the fees. So the refuse fees, for example , is leveling that out. We'll talk more about this when we talk about the budget. The but the plan right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 now is to put the refuse fee on with the real estate. And that will -- two things. It levels out the realization of that revenue . But it also allows for residents to kind of smooth that payment of taxes throughout the year and it also gives us a single point if you like the payment . So it's lot more efficiency and a lot more convenient . But effectively , yeah, the way it's calculated -- and obviously this is not a number that we kind of pluck out of the air. It's really based on expected expenditures throughout the year and the flow of those expenditures versus the receipt of the revenues . So with that in mind we played with the models several times. And that is the number that comes out because we have to be able to (inaudible ) and we have to be able to obviously support the TAN payments . But also we don't want to over subscribe . That's the other thing is, you know, for the City -- we've got a lot more of maybe a closer look at the way the expenditures are kind of running going into next year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 And because of COVID we've had to as everybody is aware kind of take some actions to kind of slow down the expenditures . And so we're managing things a lot more closely than we have before. So we do manage cash flows now on a weekly basis. So when you look at that, you know, we're confident that the 12 to be sufficient . But also, you know, we're not overstretching that because again, it's, you know, we don't want to lend money that we don't need and obviously pay, you know, the interest on that. And also I think it's important that we do put a little bit of stress on the City system to make sure that we do stay in touch with the actual requirements . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And second question in looking at the interest rate, the fixed interest rate this year for the TAN compare d to last year, it's 1.209 percent this year. Last year I think it was 2.50 -- 2.570 percent . So that's lower which is a good thing. But the question that I had if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 could explain , in the term sheet it says the rate is subject to a floor of 0.80 percent and will be capped at a maximum rate of 4 and a half percent . When I was looking at the legislation last year, the interest rate floor from the TAN last year was 2.4648 percent and the interest rate ceiling was 3.7500 percent . So it seems like the interest rate ceiling went up quite a bit. Will that make a difference or -- MS. HUGHES: Councilman , is it okay if I address this? This is Melissa Hughes. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, yeah, sure. MS. HUGHES: Because that's a really good question . So what that floor and ceiling is so today that 2 point -- or 1.209 percent is an indicative rate until the rate can be locked in. In this case it will be locked in on the date of your third reading just because the City's approval process takes significantly longer than most other municipal processes . So it's kind of governing highs and lows during that period of time until things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 can be locked in. And we've had this rate for a few weeks now. It's only varied up to 4 basis points which would equate to like 1.24 percent . So it is a difference . But it's not one in the current interest rate environment that gives PFM as your financial advisor a whole lot of agita if that makes sense because it is going to be locked in a fairly short period of time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. That makes total sense. And last question from me, I did -- last year we got a breakdown of the sources and uses of funds so like the fee for the -- the bank fee, the bond counsel fee. I didn't see that included in the backup. And there was a fee for PFM obviously unless I missed it. But are you going to provide that before final passage so like a breakdown of closing costs? MS. HUGHES: Yep. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. Does anybody else have any questions on the TAN while Carl and Melissa are here? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan , thank you for that breakdown of closing costs. I was going to ask for the same. So I'm glad that you got -- MS. HUGHES: It will look pretty similar to last year. MR. GAUGHAN : That's good. Appreciate it. MR. SCHUSTER : How about when it comes to that interest rate, where do you see that tracking at this point in time? Has it been tracking up? Has it been tracking down? Is it fluctuating back and forth but staying around the same area? MS. HUGHES: It's fluctuating back and forth plus or minus 3 or 4 basis points. So, you know, I would not be surprise d if we end up at a 1.25 or to a 115. That's kind of, you know, where I'd expect it to be. ATTY. HAYES: Melissa , it's Kevin Hayes. If it's within that range, then why do they need a ceiling that high of 4.5? If it's fluctuating -- MS. HUGHES: That's just their kind of standard language . We could have taken a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 truly variable rate option and let it flow through that whole year. And that's what that four and a half percent would reflect . But that's not we're going to do. We're going to lock a rate in because that gives the City more certainty . ATTY. HAYES: But just to be certain though, the rate that you could lock in could be up to 4.5 percent though, correct ? MS. HUGHES: It could theoretically be that but you'll know that on the night of final passage . We'll know what the rate is. We don't know it today. ATTY. HAYES: But how do we know that's the lowest rate that's available out there from the other financial -- within the financial institution s? MS. HUGHES: Because we did -- that's a very good question . We went through an RFP process . And the next lowest rate was a 1.49 percent . So it would have to go up pretty substantially and that proposal also included higher fees. ATTY. HAYES: But we're not really -- but you're -- what we're saying here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 is the rate could be higher that we're locking into with this bank, correct ? It could be higher than 1.209. MS. HUGHES: It could theoretically be higher, yes. But we'll know that. We can't know it today. But we will know it. ATTY. HAYES: We'll know that at -- so will you -- the ordinance -- the legislation that will be passed, we would be in position on that night to lock it in? MS. HUGHES: Yeah, we'll get a final updated term sheet. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. That's good. All right. MS. HUGHES: Yep. Yep. MR. MCANDREW : I have a question . Okay, so, you know, I get the floor to ceiling because of our three read rule. What if after the third read we don't like it? So are we -- how long are we locked in? How long -- because I know in the district we had like -- we had a timeline . If we didn't vote on it that night all bets were off. So, you know, third read comes around and it's close to four and we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 don't like it. Where's the wiggle room? MS. HUGHES: I mean, so we could theoretically -- and I think we're getting like really into extreme scenarios here. But we could theoretically , you know, if you wanted to do a special reading of something different suspend the rules. You could do all three reading s at once. The City has done that once before in 2014 I want to say. So I mean that is a path that we could go down. But things would have to go dramatically wrong in the interest rate market to need to pursue that path. SCOTT: Yeah, sorry. This is Scott with PFM as well. Sorry, I couldn't get myself off mute for a little bit. No, Melissa is absolutely right. But maybe one other thing that we can do is for your second reading next week, we could also give another indication as well just to keep you up-to-date. So the interest rates could go both up and down. We're seeing volatility a couple basis points here and there if we're up or down. So, you know, again, it's just something that we're keeping in touch with the bank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 We'll keep your administration up-to-date. But we're happy to also Zoom into your next meeting for the second reading as well to keep you up-to-date. But again, overall as Melissa said with the RFP process that we did it was, you know, a good competitive bunch of proposal s were received . This proposal from Webster Bank was, you know, by far in the better interest of the City from the fee perspective and from the interest rate perspective . So I think, you know, we have a lot of room here for rates to move around before the second place bidder would become better. So we'll keep in high communication with the administration and with you all between now and the time of the third reading . MR. GAUGHAN : And, Scott, this is Bill Gaughan . I know you have been working with the City now for a number of years. And it's safe to say we're in much better position in terms going for a TAN than we were when I first got on Council when it was just, you know, we were in a really tough situation . SCOTT: Oh, absolutely . Yeah, since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Melissa and I have been working with the City for quite a few years, we've seen the yield of your TANs come down from like five and a half percent or so all the way -- I mean, this is by far the lowest. We had a couple that were in the two handles , the kind of the high twos, I believe . We had one in the mid threes. So we were, you know, we were extremely pleased to see the various proposal s come in at these levels. Now granted , the short-term interest rates because of what the fed did earlier this year, the short-term rates are lower than they were in the past. However , credit spreads which is another key component of how the banks set the rates are also higher in today's environment . So the more challenged the credit of the City or the school district or the county, whoever is issuing the TAN, the higher that rate may be. But, Bill, absolutely spot on. This is by far the best rate that we've seen. So, yeah, I think that's also acknowledgement of the initiatives that the City has been tackling and undertaking here in addition to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the overall interest rate environment that we're in. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. MS. HUGHES: You heard earlier about savings that doesn't impact your employees , this is another place that you'll get some. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, definitely . MR. DEELEY: Yeah, and, Bill, remember we had that comment about the 511 decision recently . Again, we actually postponed the opening of the bids so that that could actually possibly have an impact as well on the bid itself. Credit rating could have a huge affect on that number. SCOTT: Good point, Carl. That was a good move to delay the receipt of the bids by a couple of days. Yeah, so very good point to note. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Does anybody else have any questions for Carl or Melissa or Scott? Okay. Carl, Melissa , Scott, thank you very much for sticking around. And we really appreciate it. And have a good night. Thank you very much. MR. DEELEY: Likewise .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 SCOTT: You bet. We'll see you next week. Thank you. Bye-bye. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. Very good. All right. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Dave Dobrzyn and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comment s into the record? MS. REED: Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . The first submission was from Mr. Dave Dobrzyn as follows : I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS TRASH AND RECYCLING ISSUES AS I HAVE HEARD AND READ DISCUSSION BY COUNCIL AND THE MAYORS OFFICE. I HAVE HAD SEVEN ADDRESES SINCE 1976.IN DIFFERENT TOWNS IN NEPA. IN MY OPINION PAY PER BAG TRASH RESULTS IN SEVERELY UNTIDY SITUATIONS AND MUST BE PICKED UP IRREGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY.

Again, that was submitted by Mr. Dave Dobrzyn . The second submission submitted by by Miss Marie Schumacher as follows : Why is the City's website not secure? (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MS. REED: And that is the end of this Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. We thank Mr. Dobrzyn for his suggestions and we'll take those into consideration . Miss Schumacher 's comment , I would need more specific s. I wasn't aware that the City's website was not secure. I don't know that to be true. So we need more specific information on what Miss Schumacher is referring to there. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of accepting public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Fifth Order. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple and they're ongoing . It's very disheartening , but I have to bring it back. So this one is from a couple years ago. So this is a property -- I don't have the exact address . But it's on Lenahan Avenue, the 1200 block. The gentleman that actually , you know, reached out to me also, you know, put this out on social media that it's -- that this property is in deplorable condition meaning there's a huge amount of garbage and I can't even identify from the picture s, a lot of stuff in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 the yard. All right. I guess it's been going on. I guess he reached out to you, Mr. Gaughan . This goes back three to four years. So this was an issue if Mrs. Reed could please look into. And this other one is -- here we go again. So this is that -- this is one of the garages I've been speaking of, right, so I brought it up two weeks ago. I went back to my notes. So they received , you know, this certified letter that, you know, you have 10 days. After 10 days the LIPS Department won't contact you. And, you know, there will be some you know, there's some citations . And then part of that letter, you know, $500 a day. And then part of that says, okay, you have a month to appeal. A month ended the other day. And on Saturday I drove by and this is the property on 1149 Sloan Street. So I drove by Saturday . There's two tow trucks there. They're not towing vehicles that are parked illegally . They're bringing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 cars to be painted. Today there was -- I don't know, one of them windshield companies Safelite or whatever . They're putting a windshield on a car that they're working on. And I guess, you know, this continues . It's not being rectified . You know, now there's some vulgar language and there's some really, really loud music. People can't even watch their TV. So this has not improved . If anything , it has gotten worse. You know, I have all the documentation here what's suppose d to be done. But obviously , it's not being done. And it continues . I mean, every one of us here we break the law, there's consequences . This is continuous for over a month. So I hate to bring it up again. But if you don't bring it up, it doesn't get fixed. So please, Miss Reed, you know, I'll send you some more of the information I have. But it's -- you know, we have a bunch of e-mails on this. It's 1149 Sloan Street. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment . I know we had a quite a few presentation s and a lot of information thrown at us tonight . But I was very pleased to see the healthcare savings in the presentation of Willis Towers. And, yeah, I just -- excited that already there have been those changes without it affecting those who are involved in the plan. That was all that I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to start off by congratulating Scranton 's own Joe Biden for becoming President -elect. I had the opportunity while I was in college to intern in then Senator Biden's Senate office, on his presidential campaign in '08. And also, I worked on his Senate campaign in '08. And I just -- I could guarantee you that I know that he'll work for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 all of us, whether we voted for him or not. Now, going to the Birch Street issue again, I think we need to call in American Water for some sort of update. There was a point last week where there was Birch Street's closed, Mattes Avenue was closed and also Elm Street was closed in the same day. That's three of the five, you know, access points from South Side into the flats. And then on top of that you add, you know, all of the construction that's happening on Cherry Street at, you know, the Scranton Counseling Center and it really does become a pretty big headache down there. So I just think we need to, you know, we need to start coordinating this stuff better so it's not affecting , you know, full neighborhoods . You know, people get in their routine s and they go the same way, you know, every time. And it's really just becoming an issue down there. So I really think we need to reach out to American Water, you know, just to have a sit-down with them and maybe just try to start coordinating some of this stuff a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 better. Also, Miss Reed, I think it was back in June or July I gave you an address . It was 518-520 Emmett Street about a storm drain. It still hasn't been fixed. And I guess it just continue s to get worse. And now it's at the point where you could see the, you know, the brick that was under the road. So the storm drain is literal ly just falling in. If we could send that out to DPW and/or the water company . Also I got a few calls on the 200 block of Prospect Avenue. And I actually drove down Prospect Avenue today. And it is absolutely terrible just the condition of that road. So at the very least it needs to be patched but then also, you know, to be put on a paving list, you know, going into next year because I believe we will have double the paving programs next year because the one was just pushed -- this year's paving program was just pushed back because of the pandemic . It wasn't completely cancelled . And that's all I have tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comments . First, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 I'd also like to congratulate President -elect Joe Biden. Obviously , we as Council members at an official meeting we remain, you know, nonpartisan here. But we have to mention kind of this historic occasion where you have someone who literal ly grew up for the first 10 years of their life on North Washington Avenue who is now going to reside as the president of our country . I think that is just an unbelievable accomplishment . And also one of the things that has been pointed out by quite a few people over the last few days is that our City will now have a president , vice president , governor, a senator , an auditor general and a former mayor -- and maybe I'm missing one or two from the same street in Scranton . I don't know that that has happened or occurred anywhere in the country or anywhere in the world for that matter. So I think that, you know, this is a great opportunity for the City to have somebody in the White House who grew up in Scranton . And I'm really looking forward -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 and I know that the Mayor and her administration is looking forward to working with Joe Biden in the White House and his administration . ATTY. HAYES: Bill, Joe McDade was born on the 1600 block of North Washington Avenue too. MR. GAUGHAN : There you go. I forgot Joe McDade. So if you want to be a big time politician , apparently you have to live on North Washington Avenue. But it's all good stuff. And it was just really -- Saturday was a great day for the City. If anybody was over in that part of Green Ridge and took a drive by Joe Biden's childhood home, there is a crowd of people all wearing masks thankfully . But it was just really great to see. It was a great day for our City. And I think better days are ahead. A couple of other things, I just want to announce once again just briefly the budget timeline . We are now quickly approaching the 2021 budget. And we are going to have a work session this Thursday at 6 p.m., that will be open to the public.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 So it will be broadcast on YouTube as our Council meeting s are and also on ECTV. And that work session is going to be where the administration present s the tentative budget for 2021 to the Council . And I believe that we're going to receive the budget -- tentative budget that morning . So we'll have a little bit of time at least to review it and really just get kind of a first glance at it, first run through with the administration . And then that Tuesday it will be introduced on our agenda. And that following Thursday , the 19th, the administration will come back and will, you know, I think get into detailed questions and question and answer session with the administration . And then I did send out just kind of a timeline -- a budget timeline on what it will look like from there. Our public hearing it's going to be December 1st, Tuesday , December 1st at 5:45 p.m. And that will give an opportunity for the public to make any comments on the budget, submit any questions . And they could obviously do that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 before then if they would like to submit it to Council at our regular meeting . But December 1st will be our official public hearing . And then by the -- per the home rule charter we have to entertain the budget for a final vote on December 15th. So if anybody has in any question s or any concern s about a timeline , please let me know. But it looks like that works with everybody 's schedule . The second thing I wanted to mention was the Center Street legislation that we were entertaining a few weeks ago. We had asked that that be tabled for the simple fact that we wanted the county to get in contact with any of the neighbors in the vicinity of Center Street to make sure that they are okay with the proposed changes . They have been in contact with the Citizens Savings Bank on Wyoming Avenue. And there has been some changes to schematics and to the plan. And I know, Kevin, you're working on a memo or you completed a memo. And that will be in Third Order next week. And I think we'll probably have to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 an amendment to the legislation , correct , when we bring it back? ATTY. HAYES: So earlier today I circulated what would be the revised ordinance in a memo explain ing what the changes are. They are not significant . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: The new design plan submitted by the county's engineer , Mr. Summa which includes the addition of, I believe , one additional sign and an additional parking spot. That it's. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, great. Okay. Thank you. We did receive a memo from Eileen Cipriani from -- the OECD Director just giving us an update on COVID-19 expenses that were going to be submitted to Lackawanna County for reimbursement . So that will be on our agenda next week. We did receive something from the county and this was reported in the newspaper that the county is going to reimburse us for $500,000. Now, obviously we've spent more than that. So I do have a question . And we'll probably talk about it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 next week when we get the 2021 budget on exactly how, you know, out of what account we're going to pay for those additional expenses since we're only being reimbursed $500,000. We did receive an update from Kohanski and Company . We're receiving weekly updates now on the audit, the 2019 audit. So that will be in Third Order next week for everyone and the public to take a look at. So they're making some headway and some progress there. Also, I mention ed in the caucus and I know Councilman Schuster has asked about the tax exempt analysis . This is something that has been in every recovery plan going back a number of years. And it's been something that I have requested that previous administrations do because I think it makes sense. It's an initiative in the recovery plan. I don't see any harm in doing it. I only see a benefit . So the Mayor did respond to us that they obviously have not been able to perform a tax exempt analysis this year. But they are planning on doing one in 2021, which I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 think is good news. Also, Miss Schumacher had asked a question about no truck traffic sign at River Street and Prospect Avenue. This sign was updated by DPW due to the original sign being unreadable and faded. The restriction of no trucks on River Street runs up to Meadow Avenue for many years now. So that's not a new -- that's not a new sign. The DPW did report that as far as the orange no parking signs that are placed there, they weren't sure what that was. So I don't know if that was from a private company or what's going on there. But in terms of the no truck traffic sign, that's just a sign that has been updated . On the stormwater presentation that was presented tonight to us, you know, this has been something that has come up time and time again over the last few years in front of City Council . And I know they're going to do a regionalization study. And I really appreciate the work that's been already done. Based on what we heard tonight though I do think -- and what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 I've heard previously from this company is that it definitely makes sense to have a joint effort between the City and the county, especially when you look at how much this will probably cost and the type of endeavor that it will be. I think it makes sense for a regional approach . It will help us streamline requirements and bring costs down and make us more efficient . So I look forward to hearing more updates on that. And I think it also gives us a better opportunity for grant funding . And finally , the other thing I want to mention is the Coronavirus pandemic . You know, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I think anybody that is paying attention to what's going on in our City and in Lackawanna County and in the country obviously realizes that we are in for a very, very difficult few months. It is not going to be easy. The number of hospitalizations , the number of cases, it just seems every time I open the newspaper or get an update on it, it just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 continue s to go up at a rate that is out of control , not only in Lackawanna County but across the state and across the country . So I would just like to say to anyone that is watching to continue to follow the guidelines put forth by our State Department of Health to continue to wear masks, to social distance where possible and to utilize any of the City resources available for those who will experience a very difficult time with the upcoming months where it's going to get very cold and people are going to want to congregate indoors . And I understand how difficult it is to want to get together with friends and family and do the things that we normally would do. But we really need to watch out and look out for one another . This is going to be an unprecedent ed situation . We're definitely in the middle or at the start of the second wave of this pandemic . There was recently I think good news about a potential vaccine . But I think people should really start preparing that it is going to get worse -- much worse before it gets better. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 So as City official s we always want to make people aware of that. And I'm sure everybody watches the news and is aware. But I am very concerned I have to be honest on what lies ahead for the next few months. But I'm comforted in the fact that the Mayor and her administration is meeting with I think weekly or biweekly with the officials in our local hospitals , our local medical professionals . And we are as City official s on top of it in case there were to be a major outbreak. And we do have the Serrenti Center for a second kind of site for a hospital , a field hospital if we did need it. And hopefully it won't get to that point. So that's all I have for tonight . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION THROUGH THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT 47 GRANT PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000.00 TO BE USED TO HIRE A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST THE CITY IN THE RE-DESIGN OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this grant opportunity -- I hope we get this grant because this is so vital and so important to the operations of the City. We are so far behind the times in terms of our operating system that it makes us I think as a City less secure. We've seen that with the cyber attack that we endured a few months ago. And in terms of being efficient , I think having the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 current operating system makes us less efficient . So I'm really glad to see that the administr ation is taking steps to update the operating system. And I think the goal is to be able to have a level of transparency where members of the public would be able to go on like they can in other cities and get updated figures , financial figures daily. They would be able -- it would be able to streamline those processes and have departments be able to better work together and collaborate with one another . So this is going to really bring us into the year 2020 rather than the current operating system that we have. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

I just know this because working at a career and tech center that like -- so this is vital to that educational process . And I think it's great that we get to use that for an educational resource. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I'd like to add I agree. I think this is a great opportunity for us to collaborate with a local college and to provide them with something to help with the students , something that is no longer useful for the City.
