This hearing will take place on Monday, March 5, at 5:15 p.m. Are there any other announcements ? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers gave public comments : GERARD HETMAN. JOAN HODOWANITZ . LES SPINDLER . RON ELLMAN. LEE MORGAN. BOB BOLUS. FAY FRANUS. MARIE SCHUMACHER .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Prior to Mr. Perry speaking and since I speak last, I'm going to address the item of the transcription of the public participation portion . This is something that was discussed , as I mentioned previously , two years ago when Granicus was rolled out. This was in some member's minds the offset to cut some of that cost. At the time it didn't happen. During the reorganization we did discuss this idea. The majority of the council thought that it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 was a good decision to save cost savings . As I mentioned , every city council meeting is broadcast life through ECTV. Every city council meeting is on record at the Scranton Public library . Every city council meeting is permanently uploaded to YouTube through the ECTV channel , and personally , again, maybe it's because I'm younger and I have been different perspective on some of these things I think video and audio is much more transparent than the written word. Often times there are things that may have been said in jest or sarcastically that don't translate through on pen and paper. So I personally believe being able to physically see the meetings from gavel to gavel are more transparent than anything . Secondly , council did look at what other towns in Lackawanna County are doing and there is not one council that's more transparent than what Scranton City Council is doing. From live meetings to repeat broadcast of live meetings to being available literal ly the next day on YouTube 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 for anyone to review what was said. All of councils ' motions and votes are still recorded word for word. That's the most important part of our meeting is the votes of council . That is, like I said, the legislative portion of the meeting . I would be interested in seeing if what Mrs. Hodowanitz mentioned is something that we can do if it's free of charge. MS. HODOWANITZ : It's free. MR. ROGAN: I don't see why we wouldn't do it if it's something that's legal and can be done so that's something I am willing to looking into. Again, this was strictly a cost saving measure because of the duplication and how many different ways the meeting s are transmitted and I personally believe the audio and video component is the most strong and I will continue to believe that. I'm sure there will be more discussion on that. Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes. I have a couple of comments . The first one is I received a call about West Hampton -- Hampton Street in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 West Side. There seems to be an issue with the six, seven and eight-hundred block with parking on both sides of the street. If I am remember correctly , this is just a one-side parking section of Hampton Street with no parking on the south side, but I'm not 100 percent sure, I would have to go back and check previous ordinance s. But if we could, Mrs. Reed, do a follow-up with that and the issue is right now the signs aren't there anymore, so I don't know if -- I don't think they were taken down by DPW or the Scranton Police Department , they might have been taken down other meetings so let's make sure that ordinance is still on the book for single street parking in the six, seven and eight-hundred of Hampton and if is we are going to need DPW up there to install some new signs and then maybe just a follow-up reply or e-mail to the Scranton Police Department to do a follow-up on enforcing the one-side street parking . And, also, Mrs. Reed, I got an e-mail, I think we all did, over the weekend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 about streetlights , I don't know if anybody forwarded it to you yet on the corner of 17th and Division . There was a pole down, PPL replaced the pole and a light isn't on the pole yet. The lights been ordered, but it hasn't been installed yet. So if we can do a follow-up with DPW to see if they received the light and if that's going to go up any time soon to get a status on that. I want to thank Mr. Evans and Mr. Gaughan for the idea session on Thursday . I know they'll have more to say about that. I thought it was a great collaboration between business and commerce to come together and for the sole purpose of removing barriers that prevent current businesses from succeeding and prospective businesses from moving into the city. I think it was a great first step. Second step to that idea session was having Mr. Durkin from the Greater Chamber of Scranton come in today to caucus and spoke with us. I thought he backed us up greatly and I think his input as we go though this is going to be fantastic. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 won't take too much of guy's thunder , I know you want to talk about it, but it was great to be a part of it and, you know, I definitely want to look forward to this and move on. Finally , I just want to throw my thoughts out to Tony DiBileo and his family for that unfortunate event two nights ago. His injuries were severe and, you know, we are all pulling for him to get out and make a quick recovery. God bless. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Just to keep going with what Mr. Perry just said, I would like to also offer, and I believe I'm speaking from many people throughout the city by offering our best wishes and prayers for a speedy recovery to Tony DiBileo and the entire DiBileo family. I can't begin to imagine what they are going through , but hopefully it will give them some comfort to know that there are countless people across the city and beyond that will be there to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 support and assist them in their recovery . One of the best things about our community is our ability to come together to help those in their time of need. On Thursday night we had our first idea session and I would just like to commend the session 's cochairs Councilman Evans and Gaughan for a job well done. From my perspective being new to council , I found it to be tremendously informative as well as productive . You know, we must put those ideas into action. I think the main theme that was expressed throughout the session was the need for the city to be more user friendly from a customer service perspective and I look forward to working with my colleagues on council and with the administration to continually work to, you know, solve that issue and to continuously get better. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Just a few things. On the minutes , our intent with the $5,000 we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 are saving was to actually increase some of our ways we can use Granicus even more and create a more transparent meeting in place of that, but I will agree that if Mrs. Hodowanitz can take that up and we can find a way to make that work then we should absolutely take her up on her offer, so we'll definitely look into that. In many ways it's been kind of both tragic and hopeful week in our part of the world. You know, the senseless tragedy of a young 28 year old being struck and killed by a car by walking near the Heritage Valley Trail a view days ago still resonates with me. For one, I'm a regular walker in that area and mostly because one of my sons is 28 years old, so I can only begin to imagine the pain the family is going through . My deepest thought s and prayers for all of his friends and his family. And then this morning you wake up and see another tragic occurrence to read about in the morning paper, another senseless shooting . One troubled life is over, another life changed forever . Another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 senseless shooting . I count Tony DiBileo as a friend. He served many years ago on the Home Rule Charter Study Commission , and I think we have mutual respect and friendship ever since then. Tony is a decent guy and a caring person among his many attributes , and thankfully according to his brother Gary he is responding positively so we will continue it pray for Tony and his family, and we should continue to pray for an end to this seemingly unending violence that we have in our society day in and day out. On another note, while it doesn't quite seem important in light of those events, our idea sessions were encouraging , well-received , positive , and yes they were hopeful . We will begin working on several of those intentions very soon that some of the work has already begun. So thank you again for all who participated , my fellow councilmen who have supported this idea from the very beginning , and members of the administration who attended . It was remarkable to have such a positive meeting within these chambers last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Thursday evening . And finally , Thursday is March 1. It is St. David's Day, the patron saint of Wales. I would like to wish my family and all of those of Welsh descent in our community a very happy St. David's Day. Cymru am byth. Wales forever . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. First of all, I was unaware that transcription of public comment had ceased. I wish somebody would have told me that. And I would like to know who authorize d the solicitor to sign off on it and what was signed off on. Now, I will say that there were several discussions held about -- and I actually brought this up about automating , possibly automating that process to save money, but it wouldn't -- it would have taken place after we would have talked about Granicus first, which I was in the process of doing and possibly linking the video with the transcription which would have been automated through the audio, if that makes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 sense to anybody , but it would have been a way to save money. But, no, I do not agree with, first of all, not publically discussing making a move like that, number one; and number two, doing it without making members aware because I was not aware that apparent ly since January 1 the public comment portion of the meetings were not being transcribed , so I do not agree with that, number one. Number two, there were several issues with the Greenridge senior apartments off Dickson Avenue that I mentioned a month or two ago, and I have been in contact with the Lackawanna County Department of Human Services Area Agency on Aging. There will be a meeting held with Jason Kavulich , who was the director of that department and Nancy Barrasse , who is the solicitor . She specializes in elder law. That meeting will be held Monday, March 5, at 3 p.m. a 2300 Adams Avenue on Marywood campus the Tony Domiano Center for Student Life. There is parking behind the building and all of these seniors who were sharing their concerns with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 me are urged to attend and there will be flyers passed out at the apartment building . The Arcadis storm water study came up tonight . It's my hope that when that is complete we attempt to schedule a public caucus with both the administration and members of Arcadis so that they can present their report to city council and give us an opportunity to ask questions . I also received several complaints about the area of North Scranton on West Market Street turning into East Market Street, the intersection where the cobblestone meets the pavement is treacherous and people are actually losing the front end of their car from the bump there. So Mrs. Reed did reach out to DPW and hopefully that situation is taken care of. I would also like, as my colleagues did, send my prayers out to Tony DiBileo , the tragedy that occurred this past weekend . Just senseless violence and he is a good family man and I think we are all pulling for him to pull through . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 And also the recent tragedy down in Florida . You know, this may not be the forum to talk about this, but I feel it's necessary . To me, it just seems like we have plunged into this darkness of violence and just this crazy, crazy world that we live in where everything seems backwards at this point, but if there was any good that came out of the tragedy in Florida it was the movement that is occurring across the country with the young people who survived the tragedy as part of what they are calling March for Our Lives. So I would like to take a second and read the mission statement because I think it is important for this council and for any elected official , for any leader, and all of the people in this community to be aware of the movement that is taking place. Not one more. We cannot allow one more child to be shot at school. We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the lives of students . We cannot allow one more family to wait for a call that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 never comes. Our schools are unsafe. Our children and our teachers are dying. We must make it our top priority to save these lives. March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by and lead by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar . In the tragic wake of the 17 lives brutally cut short in Florida , politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes that time is now. On March 24, the kids and families of March For Our Lives will take to the streets of Washington , D.C. to demand that their lives and safety become a priority . The collective voices of the March For Our Lives movement will be heard. School safety is not a political issue. There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives of futures of children who are presently dying when they should be learning , planning , and growing . The mission and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 focus of March For Our Lives is to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues. No special interest group, no political agenda is more critical than timing the passage of legislation to effectively address the gun violence issues that rampant through the United States. Every kid in this country now goes to school wondering if this day might be their last. We live in fear. It doesn't have be this way. Change is coming and it starts now. Inspired by and lead by the kids who are our hope for the future. Their young voices will be heard. Stand with us on March 24. Refuse to allow one more needless death. And I bring this up and I read that mission statement because I believe a vigil and a march is being organized in the City of Scranton on March 24 to coincide with the march on Washington the same day and this march in Scranton from what I understand is being organized by our local high school and college students and, obviously , I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 announce more information when it becomes available . But just to end my comment on this, you know, I refuse to accept this. As a leader in our community , I refuse to accept this violence as a new norm, you know, that we have to live with this. I think we can do better. Violence breeds violence and it starts with our community , it starts with the City of Scranton and places where those children live down in Florida , so I think we can do far better than we are doing now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . I did mention this during the prayer at the beginning of the meeting , but I do want to mention again my thoughts and prayers with Tony DiBileo and his family. I grew up just a couple of blocks away from Bigsy's. My mom still lives a couple of blocks away from Bigsy's where the shooting occurred and it's very scary that something like this is happening in our community , just a completely senseless , you know, completely random. So, again, our thoughts and prayers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 are with especially Tony and his entire family. I do want to read a postcard that we received , I think we all received it. It was addressed to the city council members , Mayor Courtright , Police Chief Carl Graziano . This was regarding the alternative to incarceration program that was set up. It says, "Thank you for setting up an alternative to incarceration for drug addicts. My nephew died of a drug overdose last May and might be still be alive if he had this opportunity ." I'm not going to read her name, but it is pretty powerful that, you know, people are recognizing that this program may save somebody 's life and give them a second chance versus just locking them up and throwing away the key. I want to thank Councilman Evans and Councilman Gaughan for hosting the idea session last week, I apologize , I wasn't able to make it, I was out of town part of day for work, but I did communicate with Councilman Evans and did receive a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 items that took place at that idea session and I really do think that it gives us some different perspectives , you know, on the weekly meetings we do tend to hear from some of the same people, not that that's a bad thing, but it is nice to hear from other people sometimes , so I'd like to thank them for a job well done with that idea session and it's definitely something that, you know, I'll continue to support and continue to do as the years go on. Today Bob Durkin did give us a brief overview on some of the economic development items that are going on in the city and in the county. I would like to thank Mr. Durkin for his leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and for coming in to give us this update. There are a number of items where I think the city and the Chamber of Commerce can work together much more collaboratively to achieve these goals. There are many different items, some of them that we tried to do and tried to initiate over the last few years, different tax incentives for development in this city, but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I think we need to work with the chamber and take that a step further . Nationally the economy is very strong, even within our county the economy is very strong and, unfortunately , it seems that Scranton for decades has been left behind, so anything that we can do that's creative working with the Chamber of Commerce to help attract good family sustaining jobs to our area is something we have to do. One of the items that really struck out that Mr. Durkin mentioned to me is that in the past when a business was looking to locate to a city it was more of what are you going to give me or what are you going to get for us and now it's more based on workforce. So it really starts with our education and our educational systems , and within the City of Scranton we are very fortunate to have great universities , great medical school, trade schools . We need to continue to work to keep that talent here. Unfortunate ly, many of the people I went to college with at the University of Scranton don't live in the city and many them don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 live in the state anymore and, you know, that, unfortunately , is the norm and that's something we have to work to change to help foster economic development within our city. And that is all for tonight . Thank you. MS. RED: 5-B.
