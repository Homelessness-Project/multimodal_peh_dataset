MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING HELD JANUARY 11, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order item? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcement s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this Saturday , February -- no, I'm sorry, February 19th Divine Mercy over in Minooka section of Scranton is having a Divine Mercy platter takeout dinner, presale only. Tickets are available for our famous Divine Mercy platter , which consists of two piggies , perogies , halushki , kielbasa , which will be held on Saturday , February 19th from 12 to 3. This is takeout only and it's presale only. So the tickets are $15 and could be purchased at the parish office during regular business hours. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else have any announcements ? I just have two real quick. I just want to clarify a comment I made last week regarding the Land Bank. So with the OECD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Director it used to be Linda Aebli. But then it moved onto the Treasurer and also Marion Gatto is the other representative on the Land Bank that was appointed by a previous position and then she was reappoint ed by this administration to the Land Bank. So I just wanted to clarify that that I misspoke on that last week. Another announcement I have, I got an update on that from the Tax Office and also from the administration just to give some reminders since real estate refuse bills all in one are arriving in mailboxes . They want to remind people for in person payment methods that taxpayers paying with checks at the Lackawanna County Government Center are require d to utilize the drop box in the vestibule of the building . All payments made via the drop box will receive a receipt in the mail. It will be accessible Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Taxpayer s paying with cash will be permitted to enter the Single Tax Office to make their payments . Social distancing will be enforced and masks are required . Taxpayer s who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 mail their tax payments should include a stamped self-addressed envelope to receive a receipt . Online payment methods are listed on the STO website at Scranton taxoffice.org. In terms of the refuse fee payment and exoneration procedure , the Single Tax Office is collect ing the refuse fee for the City of Scranton and it's included in the tax bill. The City and School District real estate taxes cannot be paid without the refuse fee. City, School District , and refuse fee can be paid quarterly using the coupons at the bottom of the bill. Quarterly payments do not include county taxes. No other partial payments will be accepted . Taxpayer s who believe they are eligible for an exoneration of any part of their refuse fee should contact the City of Scranton 's Treasury Bureau. Application s are on the City's website or at the Treasurer 's Office. All refund request s will be processed in December of 2022 or January of 2023 once sufficient proof that a vacancy has existed for the full calendar year. And also, advanced exonerations will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 not be granted. This was a request made by the Tax Collector and the administration to announce tonight . If no one else has any announcements , Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . First some nice stuff. I don't talk about the library often enough. But I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of this awful weather . So it's time to have fun. Tomorrow , Wednesday at 2 p.m., the library will be showing a free movie Dune, a science fiction thriller which is up for 10 Oscars. So it's free, 2 p.m., bring your own popcorn . And Sunday is family mini golf. We did this in January of 2021. It was hysterically funny. Bring your kids. Bring yourself . It's 18 holes of golf in the Scranton Public Library and the Children 's Library . What they've done is they set up the holes through the stacks. And the kids love 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it. It's $5 for children 12 and younger . And older children , it's $10. And all of the money goes to children 's programs . So if you want to get the tickets for that, you could call 348-3000 and press the pound sign. And they'll help you out. So get out and enjoy yourselves so we don't have to have any more of this awful weather . My audit, where is it? MR. DONAHUE : We still have not received the audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. You know, actually they could do two years together . You could get a twofer at this rate. 5-B, the zoning ordinance , very long documents . I didn't read it very closely . But I scanned it. And two things popped up in my imagination . One was, there must have been maybe upwards of 50 words on the stormwater management . And I don't know what they're thinking . But somehow there's got to be an impact on zoning with stormwater management . So hopefully , you know, they're going to -- somebody is looking at that issue. And the other thing was, I saw there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 were two sections which addressed gas stations , you know, about how far they're set off and pumps and this, that and the other thing. But I bet you 10 years from now there will be more electric vehicles than gas powered vehicles . I didn't see a word about charging stations . Now, I live downtown in Samter's. That building has 24 apartments . I'm the only tenant that doesn't own and drive a car. All the other tenants do. They park on the street. Ten years from now when there are more electric vehicles than gas powered vehicles , where are our charge stations going to be? All of these downtown apartment buildings , you're going to have plan for that. There's not a word about it. And I think, you know, that's a major oversight . I saw in the paper that our City Treasurer , Meghan Rade is home on unpaid administrative leave. And I understand it's a personnel matter which you can't discuss . But I do have one question . If she's home on unpaid administrative leave, who's the City Treasurer at this point? MR. DONAHUE : We have yet to get an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 answer on that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That office if I remember is staffed with three people, the Treasurer and two assistants. God forbid one of them gets sick or has to take some kind of vacation . I think that's awfully thin. And I think that needs to be resolved one way or the other very quickly . Though I am happy about the fact that the Mayor will be able to bring in even if it's only for one year, a finance director because I think the administration needs all the little help they can get on the financial side. I think, you know, we just come out of distressed status and right now things are looking a little wobbly in some areas. We need to get a handle on this, you know, late audits, no treasurer , you know, somehow we got to get this all under control . Finally , any progress on resolving the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : As far as I'm aware they're still in negotiations . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, it's February 15th, 12.6 percent of the year is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 gone. And those contracts can have an impact on the 2022 budget. And the longer it drags on the bigger the impact. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening . Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'd like to start off first by thanking the residents -- citizens of Scranton on the successful food drive that we had at Nay Aug Park. We ran it for two days, Saturday and Sunday. And we were able to supply four food pantries throughout the City. And when I say food pantries, these are facilities that are in churches , not the big facilities where people can come and pick up food on a particular day. These are facilities for people that need a box of cereal right now, peanut butter and jelly right now. So I just want to thank everyone that came and made our food drive a tremendous , a tremendous success . The second thing I wanted to talk about is the things that we come to City Council to talk to you about. Each of us has a hot button, something that we come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 here every week or maybe every month and we look for an update. We look for some information on that thing that's really something that we're passion ate about as Joan mentions the audit, as Marie, stormwater and what do you think I'm mentioning ? Traffic signs. So I was looking for an update. And I called down to the DPW looking for an update they sent me to the website . So I said, okay. And then they further told me that they don't handle it anymore . Any other updates I want will be on the website and if I have questions , I need to go to the OECD Department . I guess that's handling it from now on. So I did go to the website and I pulled up multiple pages of information . I printed it off just so I could look at it and see what it is. And basically it starts off street sign activity replacement report, first, second, and third quarter 2021. And it lists all -- just pages and pages of streets . It says good. And I'm thinking , now it makes me wonder. I'm going to have to get in my car and go checks these out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 because I don't see any new street signs. I do see them in my neighborhood . I do see them in a few. But basically I'm still seeing so many street signs that I cannot get people around the City. I'm working with this lady right now from the Philippines . You should see me trying to explain to her how to get from her area over to West Side. We sat here last week and heard West Side talk about -- I'm sorry, NeighborWorks talk about the redevelopment over in West Side. I thought , are the street signs over in West Side going to be legible that they're going to do all this fantastic work over there which is good. And they're not going to have any street signs up. So I just want to read what's on the first page of the report online. It goes on: Department of Public Works is constantly working to improve the safety of pedestrians and increase driver awareness, making improvements to crosswalks makes it safer for school students , elderly, residents , and drivers citywide.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 We're updating crosswalks -- you know, it goes on talking about crosswalks . I'm thinking where is it about the street signs? So I get down to the bottom. It says our traffic department is working hard throughout the City to maintain and upgrade the City signs to make our City easy to navigate . I'm not sure about that these days. Being able to make out the lettering and adhere to safety signage is very important to this department . And we are constantly finding a way for improvement. The attachment below includes the list of improvement s made for first and second quarter of 2021. And there must be 20 pages here that I printed off. And it says replacement 2/25/2021. Retro status good, Vine Street. I go up and down Vine Street a lot. And it just goes on talking about Olive Street, Vine Street, Pine Street, Kresler Court, North Washington . It just goes on and on and on. I don't see these improvements . And maybe I'm just not looking in the right spot. But I will be going down these streets and stopping and pulling over to see if they are. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 That's my hot button is traffic signs. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . And thank you for keeping us on our toes on that one. Like we said before, it will take a little time. It will take a little time to work our way through the City. You know, but hopefully sooner than later. MS. JEFFRIES : Well, I've been back in town four years and I'm still finding -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. Well, I haven't been here for a couple weeks. I've had a conflict with my job and the Council meeting s. But I haven't given up on the idea of the Home Rule Charter and petitioning the Council to put it on the ballot. But, you know, I came here on the tail end of a discussion about cyber schools . And I just think that the discussion that is taking place here is quite twisted in my opinion because cyber schools exist because when I was a child, parents determined that the public school system was doing an absolutely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 terrible job of educating its children . And it decided to look for avenues of change. And cyber schools were created . Now, as a father who had children in this City, I did not allow my children to attend the Scranton School District because their product was beyond terrible and it would have really stifled your ability to be successful in the future. So I removed my children and never ever sent them to the Scranton School District . And it didn't have so much to do with all of the teachers . But, you know, as you watch the decisions being made at the administration building and politics in play, you just realize that somebody has to get a clear mind and make changes in the City. And I would hope that parents petition their state senator and their state representatives not to change the way cyber schools are funded because I think that definitely offers a leg up to parents because the public school system is broken. And whether you having been on the board at the Scranton School District or not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 wants to accept that or not, that's up to you. But, you know, the troubling thing is that we've done a lot of terrible things -- not just to the Scranton School District but to the public school system across the Commonwealth . And it's all tore up from politics in my opinion . And the children in this Commonwealth deserve a much better education and they're just not getting it. And you know, with saying that, I think that all the people in this country need to open their eyes and take a good look around because they're responsible for everything that's taking place in our country no matter what it is, good or bad. You know, as you see what the special investigator is doing in Washington -- I'm going to say that, you know, we named a street after Joe Biden and exit off the expressway . And I think that before this investigation is done and you find out now that, you know, news organizations hounded President Trump when he was president through the whole -- through his whole presidency . And now we find out none of it, not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 one word of it was the truth, not one single word was the truth. So we had a sitting president who was being spied on by the Democratic party in the White House. That's what we've determined here. And then this Council came forward and named an exit off the express way and a street after Joseph Biden whose presidency has just been a tragedy to be blunt. And I just think it's time for the people to see in this City because , you know, Mrs. Evans had the right idea when she put the Scranton Parking Authority into receiver ship because that was the answer. And coming out of Act 47 the way we are all tore up and pretending that something 's changed , I'd say to this Council open your eyes and look at this City. And when you start talking about taxpayers , they can't support the burden on their property -- not just seniors , but anybody . I mean, it's time to be realistic here and understand that we need a change in the Home Rule Charter but not only that, we need a change across the whole Commonwealth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 because you cannot fund a modern society on property tax because all you do is create poverty and Democrats have been pimps of poverty my whole life. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , being a full moon tonight I think I would vary some different subjects here. Reading on striking down and moving off the agenda, the Treasurer issue, considering that they will not be bringing that back and there's an argument on whether or not City Council has authority to actually do that and the Mayor's office insisting that you do not have the power, I would have not taken that off the agenda. And I would have gone through and pushed it and I would have voted it down for no other reason to say we're not going to take it down and just stop this argument . We're going to go draw a line. I think that even though she's off since this was on here, it deserved a vote to at least put a point out that City Council is not going to go acquiesce its power. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I will be presenting Council with a rebuttal to the letter from the Parking Authority . I just want to let you know it will take a week or so to put that in place just to push it forward to you as an informational . Back 20 years ago, the Pennsylvania Economic League put out guidance in their documents about charities , about pilot programs , about the need to increase the amount of funds coming into there because they saw an imbalance , a severe imbalance between what is being given by the charities , what the cost of the taxpayer s were and what the fair share was. They put guidance into that -- I think it was back in the 80s. I'll have to go back and look at the documentation . But I also have a problem with PEL coming in for the new year after the service is done to teach the City and make those reports for the financial reports for the City. I would figure that in multiple decades that someone in City government would have combined with the Economic League to be able to teach City people how to make those reports to make a sound fiscal structure once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 they leave, that coming in after the City is out of receiver ship and say we're going to look at reports is again backwards. It should have been done -- the City should have been taught how those reports were made so that they could have moved forward once leaving with the knowledge of how to make those reports . We're looking -- the Mayor did not increase taxes this year. A lot of people think, oh, that was wonderful . Well, that's because we were not allowed to make changes to the tax structure because when we changed from one form to another , it's legislatively banned that it has to be neutral -- tax neutral . So they could not change or increase the tax this year purely for the reason it was not allowed by -- MR. DONAHUE : That tax has to be revenue neutral . It's not all taxes. MR. COYNE: Okay, revenue neutral . I don't -- I don't really think that passing it off this year was good. But I understand that there is a -- going to be continued tax burden of over 20 percent in the next six years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 supposedly . Looking at donations , drug and alcohol rehab gave us $200. Private citizen for K-9 gave us a thousand dollars . Boys and Girls Club gave us a thousand dollars . There was a personal donation for $5,000 for the firefighter s. I understand that drug and rehab is a very important thing to the community . But I know that drug and rehab also gets a lot of insurance and gets a lot of money. I think $200 which is probably one insurance claim is a little bit thin for an organization like that. And I take a look at the University of Scranton which I gave you a report from Providence where they actually touched and had it increased . The same pilot program because it was an unfair burden, we had $200,000 present ed this year by the University of Scranton . Looking at that, people who live -- work outside of the City pay a 1 percent tax. The City of Scranton -- the University of Scranton just on its school but not any other assets, pays less than 1/10th of 1 percent in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 private taxes. I think they need to be asked and pushed to increase that donation to help the City get off its financial knees. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello Council . A few statement s that I'm going to make aren't accusations or assumptions . They're facts. So don't get excited . If you don't mind, I'd like to read this so I don't lose my chain of thought . For the last two weeks I've watched the news, listened to the news, read the news and not a word about the most vile, contempt ible foul presence investing our City, drugs. I'd like to try to get away from this but I don't want to miss any facts. I live in North Scranton , 2600 block, Main. Since last summer a drug cartel has been buying up property . They bought 18 properties for $3,264,000. It's right here. They have done everything they can to conceal what is going on. First, a Florida company bought all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 of this property up. Then they sold it to a California company which plans to lease the different sections of this property to warehouse and grow and harvest marijuana . You know, if a dog can find a marijuana cigarette in a bus, you could imagine how tons of this marijuana is going to smell in the neighborhood . I have smelled it before in my younger days, you know. These people, they are doing everything they can to conceal what is going on right under our noses. This is very serious . As Mr. Powell, the attorney -- our Attorney General here has stated with drugs comes crime. There's already one of these units up in Scott Township . This is primarily to feed New York is the assumption that I could make about that. They are everything except above board. They are secretive . I don't know how you could stop it. No. It's a done deal. They bought the property . They plan to build a warehouse and grow right here under our noses. This is bad. This isn't going to end well for the City. Bidenville is going to be known as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 drug capital, not a president 's home -- birth place. Like I said, I don't know -- I don't know how the City can combat this. But how come for two weeks I knew all of this is going on and there's no word -- I don't blame Council . I just -- nothing in the paper. How come you don't know what's going on? Nobody seems to have any interest in this. It just doesn't -- this is a very serious matter having a drug cartel buy property right in the heart of the city. You know, we're getting all of this garbage from New York City in one door. And it looks like we're going to be sending it back to them in the other door. I drop this information in your hands. Now it's a hot potato for you guys. Something has to be done. Maybe Mr. Powell can get involved . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. All right. Thank you, Mr. Ellman. We'll look into this for you. Next on the list, Al Young. MR. YOUNG: Albert Young, Scranton resident . Some of these remarks do not pertain to the folks sitting at the dais and so forth, just to be clear. After this -- the Times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 article last week -- I suppose this is not a surprise to some of you. It mystifies me as to how this City continue s to run. First, we elect official s from federal , state, local levels. They have nothing to do with Scranton until it's election time. Everyone has one thing in mind, money and power. And they get it. Then we get most appoint ed position s and they could give two hoots about what's going to happen to the residents . But they come book smart and common sense dumb. I sit home watching Council caucuses about the budget. When Mrs. Cipriani was asked about the garage situation , all I hear is the Mayor sitting at this table respond with a very different opinion , not that of the owner and the reply was not true. Also she's never stepped foot in the area to assess the project of the garage or see how things were left on the temporary repair. Now the litigation the Times quoted me. We left some facts out purposely . The City states that we have not lost any enjoyment of possessions or property . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Boy, we end up with 7 and a half feet of water in our basement . We lost two furnaces and one of them was only five years old at the time; two hot water heaters , two complete electrical systems , a complete laundry room and a family room, all my office equipment , all were paid for out of pocket, no flood insurance . My wife ended up with a fractured vertebrae . Good thing we didn't sue for pain and suffering . The City would be in deep doo-doo. Now, the City claims that the political subdivision Tort Claims Act was exceeded . The limit on that is $500,000 per claim. We have not even come close to that as yet. The City also claims that during the trial we were making a profit by charging rent for the other side of my building . I think that's what landlords normally do. But it was okay for the Solicitor at the trial to produce to Council a year ago a bill for $150,000 plus for excess trial expense . Three days? Come on. For that it would take me 16 years to make a profit and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 look at the picture in the paper of that 14 ton piece of concrete that's sticking out of my property because of the temporary repair. Then we have a solicitor that is writing briefs and appeals from his office in Clarks Summit using his staff. This is City business , not personal . And it's all on his personal stationary from work. Wrong. Shouldn 't be allowed . We hope appoint ed solicitor should have some compassion . But not this group. Not one has allowed the contract or to finish the job of regrading and repaving the yards. Why? They might have to dig it up again and they don't want to have to pay for it. Duh, what are they going to do put the permanent replacement on top of the temporary ? Don't figure. I just -- I don't figure this. I produced picture s to some of the people here at City Hall for the blocked culvert but apparently has fallen on closed eyes. I think the City thinks that if they make enough excuses and drag it out long enough I'll go away. Guess again, I'm not going to go away. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 We have had water 10 times in the basement since the temporary repair was made. And since September of the past year, we called the fire company five different times to pump us out. But we have not lost any enjoyment of property . We don't sleep at night when there's a heavy rain storm because we get water. And it's a lot of water. It's time the City elects people to take care of the resident s, not just the downtown or West Side. There are more sections of this City that need upgrading . I do not care whether they're Democrat , Republican , Independent , or whatever . I'm out of time and thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Young. I appreciate that. You know, we're all sympathetic to your -- and I was told -- MR. YOUNG: But some of them aren't sympathetic enough. MR. DONAHUE : And we're trying to do what we can do from where we sit. MR. YOUNG: I understand that. MR. DONAHUE : And the goal is to get the remainder of the culvert cleaned as soon as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 possible . That -- and as soon as I get an update on that I will provide that to you, okay? Thank you, Mr. Young. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . When I walked in tonight to the caucus, I thought I was at a School Board meeting . We had legislators here and I didn't hear one word about the percentage of tax exempt properties we have. We had someone years ago who tried to take the tax of the -- what was it -- for Johnstown flood that is still being collect ed and try to give that to some of the municipal ities who have a heavy burden of nontax exempt. Nothing . That should have been brought up. That should have been the very first thing you said. But that's only me. I think -- I want to thank the Times-Tribune because they defined the City of Scranton last week on February 10th, two sides. One side -- well, the first thing that -- that is important is the name of the street where four of you and your one other colleague last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 year ignored the resident s and business people of Spruce Street that came begging for you not to do it. And the four of you and one other said -- voted to go ahead with this. And it was then that I knew you don't care about the taxpayers and the residents . What you care about is what you guys want. And that is very, very painful . So that's what I see. That's on one side of the paper. And then we have the -- here's on one side. And we have a lot downtown at Wyoming and Linden Street that has already taken $775,000. And if the money continues being poured into that one, we had the company that had it, RSM. The City was suppose d to do the remediation . And they didn't do it. So the City bought it. What the heck, it only costs $375,000. And then we had gotten another $400,000 and there's even more. So that's okay. But when it comes to residents on the other side, what's the City doing? They're going after people who have been paying taxes who have been -- well, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 just heard Mr. Young. How many times have they been flooded ? It just is not right. And it continues . I mean, of course having -- being able to go bed at night and not worry about whether it's raining outside or not because we have wonderful necessities . We need -- we need period light bulbs. We need night shades. We need colored -- raised colored intersection s. We need to redo the handicap . They're already done. HUD already paid for them once, and yet we're going to pour all of this money into sprucing up six blocks where downtown is the money pit. Over the last 20 years since I came back to town we poured -- I didn't even look it up but a lot of money in the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue. And what has that done for the City? I don't think it's done a lot. And the neighborhoods , let them go. People who have problems with stormwater , they're -- just kick the can down. We'll get around to that. You people need to change your priorities . You need to start looking at what the taxpayer and residents need and not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 worrying about these frivolities of whoever comes up with these. And remember , you told us we were going to have a public hearing on the RFP money. But here we are spending it like -- MR. DONAHUE : Nothing 's guarantee d to be spent there. That was a grant that was applied for in terms of Biden Street. MS. SCHUMACHER : Time will tell. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And we will be scheduling a Recovery Act caucus in the month of March. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Here I am. Like bad news I never go away. Okay. We had a little tirade here about how we're all -- and I do sympathize with Mr. Young. I agree with him entirely . But this is different . We have an article here that appeared yesterday in the paper. Now the Democrats were just accusing -- don't get insulted . But I'm not that in love with anybody all that much. Fiscal watchdog budget reports 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 become political clash (inaudible ) school funding fight. And the test scores don't improve even if they give money. I'll tell you what does improve, my property tax bill. And, you know, it's not that big. But it just keeps getting bigger every year. And we're shorted 30 million dollars with the school district . Who knows what all of this is costing the City because they should also be pouring some more money into the City. In view of the fact that we're 36 percent tax exempt and growing at an exponential pace, it's really a shame. So, you know, they deduce that the school, we get the immigrant s. We get -- I'm not complaining about anybody . Okay. But let's be honest because their comment s are basically an insult. They think I'm at least or just barely as smart as them. Well, I'm a lot smarter than that. The only thing they're good at is getting elected . Now, here I have -- and if we could get it for the camera, excuse me, redistrict ing. Now we're being all split up every which way. We're getting a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 representative from out in Stroudsburg or something . And here's the original . Now, if you did it in a straight line, it would eliminate most gerrymandering , okay. PA straight line. And no more districts looking like a ball of Lucky Charms breakfast cereal. They're always after me Lucky Charms, just like the commercial said. They're all after me Lucky Charms. And I know what they're doing. They're trying to split Scranton up. Personally , I don't want Mario Scavello or Dan Meuser. He voted against seating Joe Biden on the 6th of January . He's unacceptable as an American , period. And getting to the antivax people, there's over 2,000 people a day dying from that. And they equate that with some kind of freedom ? You have the right to go out and infect somebody else or grow or drive somebody else's insurance because we all insure each other. Health insurance is going up, up and up and up every year. We don't need 25 percent of the people in the hospital and in intensive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 care as a COVID victim because they didn't want to vaccinate or just carelessly expose somebody else. You know, we just had a guy in here crawling and blaming the Democrat party for everything . Oh, we get blamed for a couple things. But, you know, I told him out front that marijuana should be considered -- which was under Carter 45 years ago -- Jimmy Carter wanted to decriminalize it and it went nowhere . He used it as a license to slander me all over town. So take a hike, buddy. You're not my friend. Don't walk up to me and you're probably unvaccinated . Have a good day. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I do not. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yes, I do. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 would have liked to have spoken about this in caucus but we didn't get a chance to speak about it. But tonight I would like to make a motion for Council to direct Solicitor Gallagher to write an ordinance to amend pertinent sections of the City Code to enumerate and ensure that all department director s and bureau directors as the City administration has referred to them are appointed by the Mayor with advice and consent from Council . And this would also include the City Treasurer . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : We have a motion and a second on the motion. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , three words. Advice and consent, it's our role. It's our responsibility . It's unfortunate that we have to go this route. But we have to fight. So I'll be voting -- definitely voting yes for this motion. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I do believe that the code needs to be clarified 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 from reading it and the changes in titles, I think that we need to do some work there. So I will be voting in favor of this motion. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I would just like to say it's my understanding that there is a meeting later this week to discuss the situation ; is that correct ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. KING: So I'm going to vote for this motion. However , I'm hopeful that that meeting can help resolve the situation that it can result in an understanding that we do have the authority to approve these positions . But if it doesn't result in that, I think that we need to take some action to ensure that our authority as legisla tors is not just violated . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , I would agree to the same. A little while ago I did send an e-mail about receiving some of the resumes of the appointment s that were sent down. So tonight I'd ask Mr. Voldenberg if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 would please send again correspondence to the administration to get the resume of the new appointment for HR Director . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. On the question , I agree we do need to make some, you know, improvement s to our Administrative Code. And I am hopeful that, you know, we can come to a resolution with the administration regarding that appointment issue. There are other things we need to address in the Administrative Code. And, you know, we're going to do that in due time. But at the same time we can't get bogged down in this nonsense of the, you know, who gets -- what Council 's advice and consent role is because I think we do have an important advice and consent role. I think we've seen that in the last week. And I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement , you know, with the administration so that we can put this aside and actually concentrate on the things that matter to our taxpayers , such as stormwater , such as going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 after, you know, our non-profits and so on. So I will be support ing this motion. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Nays? The ayes have it and so moved. Anything else? MS. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple. The first thing is a complaint that I received that I want to send along -- I'm not sure if both code enforcement and SPD would need to be involved with this one. But it's with regards to some of the residents placing cones and garbage cans in parking spots on the street. And it's not just happening when there's snowy weather which is when we often see an increase in that occurrence . But this has been a consistent problem for a while now that the resident 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 complaining about. So he's noticed it along some areas of Pine Street nearby Prescott and then also on Prescott in the 700 block. I believe the address was 718 Prescott Avenue. So if you can have someone go to check out those locations . It's not fair to other people to be trying to save a spot on the street. It's not your spot. I myself don't have any parking . So I park on the street. And it's not always convenient . We have a bar nearby and sometimes on the weekend s it gets crowded . But you know what, we find a spot. And then if something opens up later on, we move it there. So that's just what, you know, what you have to do. You take the chance that someone else may park there. So I'd like to make sure that that is enforced . And the other thing I wanted to bring up, someone had mentioned last week with regards to our public health coordinator , Dr. Saxena. I am interested in receiving updates on what she has been doing. And so I plan on meeting with her to just have a discussion . And I will report back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 after that -- that meeting to let you all know what is going on within that office and that position . And if any other Council members are interested in that, they're more than welcome to join us so long as we keep it to two people. So I just wanted to put that out there. And lastly, I'm not sure if other Council members have had a chance to do this yet. But I was real happy to have gained access to OpenGov . And we had someone from IT go through training to do that. And now it will be a lot easier for us to take a look at, you know, specific addresses and see what complaints there might be, especially with regards to code enforce ment. I think that's where it will be most useful for us as Council members and will help I think close the loops quicker when we do receive complaints . So that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have a few comment s. So I'd like to take a moment to explain my concern regarding Mayor Cognetti 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 recent actions that are shroud in secrecy and a complete lack of transparency . The Solicitor 's memo from January 31st which states the Mayor refuses to send Council legislation approving cabinet head appointment s is shocking . I served with Mayor Cognetti when she was on the School Board. And she constantly preached transparency . It seems to me that within the last few weeks the Mayor has complete ly reversed course and would rather do business and hire people -- cabinet members in important position s without Council 's input. What's even more concerning is the recent news that the City Treasurer which the Mayor refused to send to Council for approval as always was or has been done in the past is now on nonpaid administra tive leave. The Mayor will not discuss anything further which is absolutely outrageous . Council and the public deserve an answer as to what is going on with the City Treasurer . Is this the reason the Mayor was refusing to now send down these appointment s to Council ? It just doesn't -- I don't like the looks of this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 As I stated last week, the Cognetti cabinet has been a revolving door. Now more than ever, the Council 's role as watchdog on behalf of the citizens is of utmost importance . Council has always been the check and balance to our strong Mayor form of government . It is unfortunate that the Mayor has chosen this path of secrecy . I will not and cannot stand for that. Something as simple as an interview or a sorely needed vetting process for new hires would have flushed this out -- the issue we're dealing with now. So I have three questions , Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please send to the administration . Why is the Treasurer on unpaid administrative leave? And how long will this leave last for? I know it's a personnel issue, but this is about the position . All right. Who is filling the duties of the Treasurer currently ? Number three, how many employee s are currently working in the treasury full time? And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have two quick things. Mr. Voldenberg , if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 everyone remembers we did -- we contracted out with for Portnoff Law and Associates to collect delinquent refuse from 2020 going back. So I would just like an update from Portnoff on what they were able to collect to date, some sort of report because that -- it included about 16 or so million dollars . And I just want to see how much they collect ed to date. We haven't gotten an update from them. Would you be able to request that, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : And also, I spoke with a resident today on Birch Street. And they're having some issues with American Water Company just up from the 200 block where they were doing the -- so I do have to check and see if that's an actual water company project or if it's the sewer portion of the water company 's project . And they've also complained about increase in truck traffic there. That might have initially been a result of the work that American Water was doing on Mattes. So if they were coming off the expressway there, instead 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 of taking the right because Mattes was closed, they'd take the left to go down Cedar Avenue and take a right on Birch. But there has been increased truck traffic there. So we're going to look into that as well. And that's all I have tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR THE LOCATION AND USE OF LOTS, LAND, BUILDINGS , AND OTHER STRUCTURES ; THE HEIGHT, NUMBER OF STORIES , AND SIZE AND BULK OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES ; THE DENSITY OF POPULATION ; OFF-STREET PARKING ; AND SIMILAR ACCESSORY REGULATIONS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA , AND FOR SAID PURPOSES DIVIDING THE CITY OF SCRANTON INTO DISTRICTS AND ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES THEREOF , PRESCRIBING CERTAIN UNIFORM REGULATIONS FOR EACH SUCH DISTRICT , AND PROVIDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF ITS PROVISIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPALITIES PLANNING CODE (MPC), 53 P.S. §10101 ET SEQ., AS AMENDED . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , just in terms of the process that Council is going to use here, we're going to -- this requires three reading s. So we'll introduce it tonight . We'll read it in Sixth Order next week. We will then immediately table it. The plan is, you know, to hold a public hearing on March 1st at 5 p.m., instead of 5:45 to give resident s enough time to come out and, you know, express their opinions related to the zoning code. And then we'll take it from there. You know, it's not like we're going to immediately bring it off the table. If we were to amend it in any way, there's a process that we have to follow then where we send it back to the county Planning Commission for 30 days for review. Then it has to go back in front of the City Planning Commission before then we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 would be able to take a final vote. So just so everyone 's aware, you know, this is going to be a lengthier process than most legislation we require to have a public hearing on. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.
