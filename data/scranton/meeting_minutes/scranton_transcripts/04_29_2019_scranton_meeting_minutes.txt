PERRY: Yeah, just a couple comments . Mrs. Reed, if we could just send a follow-up on Dorothy Street to see if there was any movement on that or if they were able to at least check the situation . Maybe they got onsite but they just haven't made any repairs yet. Also, the 3200 block of Pittston Avenue there has been several requests for speed enforcement there so if we could maybe get the speed indicator put on a list to get moved into that block of Pittston Avenue that would be most helpful to see if there is actually an issue there or what time of day it's happening . We talked a little bit about -- mostly about the multi-units and the garbage fees, something that I don't know if we talked about and maybe, Solicitor , Minora, you can kind of help me with and if you guys 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 are in agreement if we can maybe make an amendment to our rental registration that we are doing right now with multi-units or even any rental, because rental is a business in the City of Scranton , that's what it is, and I think, you know, we need to hold our businesses accountable first within the City of Scranton and we need to do it consistently and fairly not just who decides they want to pay and who decides they're not going to. You know, and I spoke on this point before, we are in two -- we are fighting two battles right now with the past due garbage fees. How are we going to collect what we already lost and what are we going to do going forward to make sure we don't get ourselves back in the same sand trap and we are swinging the sandwich to get out again because we don't want to do that. Some of what -- you know, we have been through this topic quite a few many times and I know something that right now I'm doing right now is right now I'm on the fence of the side of going to magistrate for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 a little quicker result. I'm not there yet where I would like to leave garbage on the street, I'm just not comfortable with doing that, but I definitely don't think the liens that are posed on those properties are doing absolutely anything for us and we need to do more. As far as going forward, I know we did talk about embedding this into the tax structure of the city which absolutely makes sense. You know, it needs to be done, it needs to happen. We are taxed. We do pay a good chunk of our hard earned money into city taxes and it needs to be made easy for us and it doesn't need to come in a separate bill and it should be absorbed in our property taxes and that's something that the city is responsible to make sure happens . Getting back to the multi-units that's something what we can move quicker on. They shouldn 't be able to operate a business if they are not paying their garbage fees. If just should not be because we know what happens , and we have all been in the city and for quite some time, and we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 have many people that own property properties and one or two or three properties and what happens , you know, I think someone made the point of, you know, robbing Peter to pay Paul. They will take whatever assets they have in one piece of property , they will take whatever they could from there and they will move onto purchase another property and they just kind of keep going and going and whatever asset has the most -- whatever is the most liquid they could pull more money out of they use that to balance it and just kind of grow their landlording empire and it then it falls down and it's awful and most times they're out-of-state people, they don't live here and so they are not invested in our community , they are not invested in our city. They are saying, "I'm just going to collect my rents and live where I live and whatever you have to look out at every did or put up with every day is okay." And I think we need to say that's not okay and we need to not let them operate the business of renting property in the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 of Scranton if that's how they are going to operate , and one of the things we can do right now is holding them accountable for their past due garbage fees and if we need to go back and make an amendment to rental registration then I say that's what we do and we do that as soon as possible and we also need to make sure that that -- and again, Mr. Minora, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but past due fees also triggers inspection s and inspections will lead to safer places and that's what it's about. About it's having a safe place, a good neighbor , a good -- and somebody good in your community , not the blight of the community and too many places and too many parts of our neighbor hoods these multi-unit out-of-town landlords aren't a good neighbor . Some are, but for the most part they generate most of the blight and it's just not fair for all of us and so I think that's something we need to do. On a lighter note, I just want to say thank you to Minooka Lions. They put on a great autism awareness , you can see I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 wearing my pin for autism awareness month. Every last weekend of the month they just put on one of the best benefits that benefits autism and that's something that's close to my family and, you know, it was very nice seeing the community get together and just seeing everybody for such a great event. All of the volunteers they just work tirelessly for weeks and weeks and weeks to plan this and it was a success and they are already planning next year so I just want to say thank you and they did a great job, and that's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. First I'd like to just start, I've had some complaints on the road conditions if we could send these along to DPW, especially East Mountain Road which wasn't paved too long ago. Also, Linwood and Florida Avenue on East Mountain as well as the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Webster Avenue. The hill mostly on the 1800 block is especially bad to the point where it shouldn 't even be considered a road. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I've also been getting some complaints regarding storm water issues with all of the rain we have been getting and it seems like a lot of the issues that stem from area where storm drains are either inadequate or they just don't exist at all. Cray Street in Minora is one of the examples that I had brought up this week where at the bottom there just isn't any storm drains so the water just flows down the sidewalks and into the river, and also the Pennwood section doesn't have many storm drains either. Also, the flooding issue, the residents in the area of Pittston Avenue and Kane Street that it's been incurring over and over again, but I believe DPW is supposed to go out and fix a broken pipe on Kane Street that would alleviate the problem . So, Mrs. Reed, would you also be able to send a letter to DPW to see when they would be begin work to fix that pipe on Kane Street? Now, onto to PSN Realty and Ken Bond. First, I'd like to thank Chris Kelly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 for his outstanding reporting to bring this particular slumlord to light and also to all of the member of the South Side Neighborhood Association for passing along all of that information , I'm going to pass it along to my colleagues on council and also to the administration . But in terms of what we can do to begin to address these issues, I'd like to first request from the -- send a request to the administration for an immediate emergency declaration for the demolition of the structures located at 1616 Cedar Avenue and also 1620 and 622 Pine Street. Both properties have had fires in recent years. Because of the damage caused by each fire the structural integrity of these properties could pose a threat to public safety and I believe immediate action is needed. Such an emergency declaration is used at least twice last year, once for a property that caught fire on the corner of Hickory and South Webster Avenue and also another on the 500 of Palm Street. I'd like to also request Licensing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 and Inspection and the city engineer assess and complete a written report to council on all other condemned PNS properties by next Monday's meeting . In addition , I'm requesting that Licensing and Inspections inspect and report on all other PSN properties and to please provide photos, inspection reports , citation s and/or notices of violation on PSN properties . The city's Law Department can also begin to take action so I'm requesting that they perform what's called as a bring down or title search consisting of deeds, mortgages , liens taxes of every property owned by PSN. In addition to that, I also think the Law Department needs to send a letter to the New York Bar Association reporting Mr. Bond operating as PSN realty for his consistent failure to pay taxes and/or fees, failure to properly receive notice and failure to maintain his properties . And then, finally , I'd like to touch on the settlement of a lawsuit brought against Mr. Hinton alleging bias and selective enforce ment. I'd like to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 from the city's Law Department why the city's insurance did not cover the settlement and if the city must also cover any attorney 's fees as part of that settlement . I'd also like to know if there are any other current lawsuits concerning Mr. Hinton the city is also engaged in. So, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send those requests along to the administration ? And just over a year as a councilman the number one complaint I consistently get over and over again are complaints concerning Licensing and Inspection . The ineffective leadership in that office has not only forced contractors to refuse to work in the city, it has also contributed to the deterioration of the quality of life in our neighbor hoods and is now costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars . People are absolutely fed up with this nonsense and they want to know when will enough be enough. I have had countless people tell me since Saturday that they think that Mr. Hinton should be forced to resign for his incompetent . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Quite frankly , I don't think Mr. Hinton should be given the luxury to resign. I believe he should be fired so somebody can be put at the head of that office so that the job could actually get done. And that's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Well, I'll just keep on going down the PSN realty rabbit hole and maybe add a layer to this exposé, if I can. So I did a personal driving tour of all of PSN properties , and I what I found, what we all know, were mostly abandoned and blighted properties . However , in at least several cases I found investments properties that would appear to be producing income through the occupancy of tenants . 447 Colax, 1708 Linden, 442-444 North Irving, all appear to be occupied . Several other properties gave the appearance of being occupied , but I wasn't able to confirm that, 1700 Rosalind , 732 Harrison , 1024-26 Clay and 1012 Clay. So under the city's rental registration ordinance that this council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 passed, in fact, this council wrote, the following sections exist, Section 373-9 Violation and Penalties , Subsection C, "Any landlord or owner with outstanding fines resulting from violation of municipal ordinances as well as delinquent taxes and/or garbage fees shall be eligible to obtain a license to rent residential real estate in the municipality of Scranton unless such fines, taxes and fees are paid in full." So according to the newspaper article as noted, the LIPS Department said that none of PSN's properties are even registered with the city. Yet, several are operating as rental units and apparently PSN is collecting rent. So under Section 373-10, Rental Escrow Program, "In addition to all other penalty and enforcement remedies established by this chapter or by any other Scranton ordinance including , but not limited to, the property maintenance code owners/landlords of residential rental units within the municipality of Scranton shall be subject to the municipality of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Scranton Rental Escrow Program which is hereby established by this chapter ." I'm going to read a few chapters . I know it's a little dry but we have to get through it. "Subsection A. Owner/landlords of residential rental units that have not been registered by April 1 of the licensed year pursuant to this chapter shall be sent written notice of non-compliance by registered or certified mail addressed to the record of the such property on the tax records of the County of Lackawanna County. Failure to receive said notice shall involvement effective ness of the transmittal of said notice." "Subsection B. Effective with the next monthly rental period following transmittal of said notice, the owner/landlord is prohibited from receiving rents from the unregistered residential property ." "Subsection C. Effective with the next multi-rental period following transmittal of said notices , the Scranton Code Enforcement Officer is to inspect the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 unregistered unit for the purpose of determining if a tenant or tenants are residing in an unregistered unit." "Subsection D. Should tenant be found to be residing in an unregistered unit, the tenant or tenants shall be provided a copy of this chapter together with a written notice or directive from the Code Enforcement officer that rent for the first calendar month following the inspection and for the ensuing calendar months is to have to be paid to the municipality of Scranton for deposit into the Scranton Rental Escrow account unless otherwise directed ." There are several over sections in the escrow program but that's the basis of what can be done so I would like to ask our LIPS Department , again, to begin the process of enforcing Section 7373-10 in it's entirety by sending letters to all of the properties owned by PSN realty and then enforcing the balance of this action to the point where any occupied units and their tenants are giving the rent check to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 City of Scranton while all PSN realty taxes, garbage liens, etcetera , are still unpaid. It is disgraceful that we are allowing this landlord , the worst of the worst in what he owes to the City of Scranton , almost a quarter of a million dollars , to operate and collect rents in some of his buildings when we have an ordinance , we have a law that specifically addresses and forbids this situation to ever occur. It's unbelievable . So we can do it. We have the law on our side, we have the rules on our side, it just has to be enforced , along with the suggestion made by Councilman Donahue , there are tools in our tool belt to stop this kind of egregious activity by absentee landlords that have permeated our city for far too long. And, finally , on a totally different subject , I didn't do this last week so I was called out from a friend of mine but as I do every week my final words are every day is your chance to make the city a little better. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, you know what I don't even really know where to begin at this point. First of all, let me just say this, because I was thinking of it as the -- after the news article and then listening to some of my colleagues speak, I'm sure there is other Mr. Bonds out there. I mean, this is just one case, maybe not as egregious at $250,000 but I'm sure there are others -- in fact, I know there are others just from going to the neighbor hood meetings that owe these different fees and don't keep their properties up. And, you know, I applaud Chris Kelly and the Scranton Times, but it is a -- you know, as an elected official it's a little sad and embarrassing that a reporter from the Times has to uncover this and, quite frankly , we all should be take a bit of responsibility in this and accept some blame. You know, we are elected officials and this has happened under our watch even though we don't have as much control as the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 administration does, but, I mean, just from myself I think we should accept some sort of responsibility because it is -- there is only one word for this and it's embarrassing . You know, listening to the different fixes and I agree with what Mrs. Schumacher said about two or three weeks ago, I hope this doesn't happen, but I have seen it happen over the last five years, this is a hot button issue, it's a hot topic and then it will eventually peter out and it will die out. People will either forget about it and we'll be back here again in five years and the reason that I think for that, and I want to be careful that it does not seem like I'm, you know, blaming anyone but there is no coherent vision to deal with this problem and a lot of other problems that occur in this city, especially with blight, and I'll give you one example and Councilman Evans can back me up on this because he was there. The county had a Blight Task Force. There was -- every municipality in Lackawanna was invited to it. Councilman Evans went as our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 representative on council . Councilman Evans, was there anyone from the administration there present ? MR. EVANS: No, there wasn't. MR. GAUGHAN : No. Again, part and parcel of the problem . Now, I have talked about what Mrs. O'Malley talked about for the last five years and, again, I don't want to drone on because I have said this before there is no leadership . Zero. Zero. What happens in this city over the last five years is there is a fire, we put it out. There is a condemned building and we respond . There is no coherent vision. There is no forethought . That's the problem . So Mr. Bond is just a morsel of the bigger issue and, you know, I blame Mayor Courtright, but you can blame mayors going back 150 years. It's the same problem . We will sit up here, we will talk about it, we'll have Mrs. Madsen and other come from the neighbor hood groups and I can almost guarantee , although and I hope not, we will be right back here in five years unless for once city officials come up with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 a coherent vision. You have people from the administration that actually attend a task force that people put together that from what I understand was pretty well done. There was all different things that came out of that meeting , but then there is never any follow-up. Again, I think we should all take a little bit of blame for that. There is a major disconnect between this council and the administration I don't care what anybody says. I have seen it over the last five years. We waste ink on paper. I sent a letter asking for information , I'm not asking for anything that's not relevant , just like Councilman Donahue , Councilman Perry, Councilman Rogan and Councilman Evans, yet it either goes unanswered or we get some kind of bizarre answer. I mean, I can go through example after example , and we are on the front lines here every Monday and sometimes we sit up here and look like doofuses and maybe sometimes we are, but we don't have answers because we can't get them from the mayor and the administration . Take Mayor Courtright out of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 picture , Mayor Smith, Mayor Jones, when you are you the mayor you need to step up and let people know what the plan is, what the vision is. We could sit up here all day and talk about different things, and we are going to send Councilman Donahue 's letter which I think he was right on every point he made, but it makes no difference if you don't have the leader of the city standing behind. The question is how did Mr. Bond get to this point? How was he able to buy up all of these properties and go scot-free? Didn't pay any rental registration fee or nothing . Now, I'm sure we'll send another latter to Mr. Hinton and it will go unanswered . And, again, take Pat Hinton out the equation . Bill Jones, Bill Smith, Bob Jones it doesn't matter. It does not matter. The fact of the matter is Councilman Donahue brought up Mr. Hinton, the mayor, the mayor allowed this to go on over the last five years. We just had to pay out, you are going to have to pay out $245,000 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Mr. Brunell . The city's insurance policy won't cover it and there is another one from I think his brother and my guess is we are going to have to pay on that so we could be looking at close to half a million dollars who knows. All the while, Mr. Hinton is worried apparently about a coffee shop at Nay Aug Park which for the love of God it's the most -- it's the most ridiculous thing. And, again, take Mr. Hinton out of it because I have nothing against him, I know him personally , I think he is a fine person. Put in anybody else, Bob Jones, Bob Smith and what -- in whose right mind would you let a city employee open up a -- or even bid on it and open up a coffee shop at Nay Aug Park? And he said in the newspaper he has got to get contractors to come up there. He is the head of Licensing and Inspections . I mean, you've got to be kidding me. And this is allowed to go on. And, again, this is part and parcel of the problem and I'm blaming people but I'm taking responsibility for it as well because we are all to blame. Every elected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 official that's come here and every elected official that's come before us. So my plea is to the mayor and the administration that they will take our suggestions and do the things Councilman Donahue had recommended but don't stop there. Come up with a coherent vision. All five of us live here, we are willing to work with the mayor and the administration . That's why two weeks ago I had requested that just like other cities do, it's not brain surgery , they would come at least quarterly . I would even take twice a year and sit before the council and answer questions . Nobody is going to bite, you know, we are going to be respectful , but we need better communication because we sit up here every Monday and it's -- it drives me nuts. We have been -- I've been doing this for five years. I just talked to my mother the other day. I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing this for anymore ." We go through the same thing and there is never any real action so maybe Mr. Bond, maybe finally , you know, maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 some day we are thank him because maybe this is the point in the city that people start taking this stuff seriously , and the 75 percent of the people that actually that do pay and the good people that do take care of their civic responsibilities can finally be relieved that they know the city is actually going to do something serious for once. And I had other things but that's it for tonight . Thanks. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. I guess I'll address the PSN Realty issue as well. I did a little research as well on this and specifically the property at 616 Cedar just to give some background for those who are watching and may not understand the real estate business or landlord business , so this purchase was purchased in February of 2004 for $85,000 by Mr. Bond through an LLC. It's a seven-unit property . Now, when it was purchased the rents were certainly much lower in 2004 than they are now, but just taking an extremely low rent of 500 per unit on those seven units in one month this property is generating over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 $3,000 income for the landlord when it was operation al so you could see how short of a time it is for a landlord to recoup their money with a rental property . Unfortunately , what Mr. Bond has done, and I know Councilman Gaughan mention ed it, he is not the only one and I'll give the newspaper credit for giving -- putting a platform out there for this issues, but there are many, many other landlords that are doing it, maybe not as egregious but are doing the same thing. They primarily out-of-town landlords that purchase the property for a very low price, which was the case with this property for seven units. They rent it, don't repair a thing and just extract every penny they can out of the property . Don't pay the taxes, don't pay the garbage fee. When it goes up for a sheriffs sale or a judicial sale they make a payment arrangement , make a minimum payment , it goes away until the next year and continue to string this out as long as they can and at the end they just say, well, I got my money out of the property and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 abandon it. That's what's happened in this situation and there are other landlords that have done the same thing through the years, maybe on not as large as a scale as this case here, and it's one thing if a landlord has a property and they fall on hard times and they can't, you know, can't keep it up or can't manage it and they lose it to tax sale or something but there is no question that this individual knew exactly what he was doing. He is not behind he didn't do a good job managing rentals or, you know, things didn't go well for him, that was his whole strategy was to get as much cash out of the property at possible , pay as little taxes and fees as possible and then at the end just wash his hands of it and say, "I'm done." It's not a good business model long-term, but in the short-term I'm sure he extracted just from this 1616 Cedar property well in excess of $300,000 over the 14, 15 years that he has owned this property . I would like to go back and see exactly which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 years all of these taxes are owed for, what's been paid on each other year on all of these properties . Not to punish him and, obviously he is a huge offender , but so the city could reforms into place so people cannot take advantage of the system in this way. The reason why the city and the county is typically lenient on people who are behind on their taxes with setting up a payment arrangement and allowing them to make payment s is because the last thing any governmental body wants to do is take away a home from a homeowner who is struggling . This is not that scenario . What this individual did is took the system that was put in place, and it's a lenient system as far as paying your fees and your taxes for the homeowner, and for homeowners I believe there should be some grace period. Somebody loses their job, somebody has health issues, they should be able to go on a payment plan. A rental property that's bringing in 30, 40 thousand dollars a year in cash flow shouldn 't be given that same leniency that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 one individual in a single family home is given, so I think there needs to be a change on how the tax sales are done. If this property was up for tax sale after a year or two we wouldn't have gotten to this point, and I understand he played the game, he's a lawyer. Instead of focusing on having a good rental business he decided to do it the other way and try to pay as little as possible during the years. I agree with the recommendations that Councilmen Perry and Evans made regarding using the rental registration as a tool to try to crack down on landlords , but I do think, especially with the first one, and it's going to wind up in Court and it's going to take some time, but I think we need to take and all the above approach , but I truly believe that the biggest way to deter this from happening in the future is to have a different set of rules for those who fall behind on investment properties versus people who fall behind on a single family home, and as I said before, there should be some leniency when you are talking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 somebody 's home. When you are talking about a rental property if somebody fell behind and they are not doing a good job as a landlord, which is a business , as Mr. Perry mentioned , they should lose the property and it's plain and simple as far as I'm concerned . That's all I have to say on that issue, I'm sure we will talking about it much more. Just two citizens ' requests to add to the letter that Councilman Donahue mention ed, on East Mountain Road I was contacted from a resident on Seymour and the curbing is all eroded away. I know the ones you mention ed also had pretty much the same issues. If we could add that to that letter as well. And then also another property that -- and I know e-mailed about this earlier in the week, I don't know if anyone remembers about a year or so ago a boiler exploded in the basement of a property on the 600 block of North Bromley Avenue in West Scranton . That home has been condemned . It was basically partially blown off the foundation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 from this explosion and if we can also, and I know we went sent it earlier in the week, just follow up on that because if it really is a dangerous situation that part of West Side the houses are very closes to one another and with the foundation issue the neighbors are concerned that one of these storms that we have or just over time that he house is going to collapse on one of neighbors around it. And that is all I have. MR. EVANS: Councilman Rogan, if you don't mind I rarely interrupt , but I have one more comment on PSN, if I might, and your math sort of got me thinking about this, the properties that I mention ed, even if they are only two families and all of them are occupied and they all average about $600 a month in rent, which is probably a modest amount, we are looking at approximate ly $100,000 a year in rental that is now being put in that -- that landlord 's pocket while he is not paying anything else so just keep that in mind. $100,000 in potential income that he is earning on his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 properties so we'll know more as hopefully LIPS goes out and does some investigation but I just want to get that point across.
