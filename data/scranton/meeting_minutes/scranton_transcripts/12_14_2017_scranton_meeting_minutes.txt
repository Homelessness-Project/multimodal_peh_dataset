REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 PARTICIPATION . MR. WECHSLER : Leslie Collins . MS. COLLINS : Good evening , Council. I'm Leslie Collins and I'm the executive director of Scranton Tomorrow . I would like to thank council for your consideration of the legislation that is on the agenda this evening in the amount of $250,000 for the implementation of the downtown economic development strategy . I would also would like to thank you for your support the years for Scranton Tomorrow . Scranton Tomorrow is a nonprofit , nonpartisan community and economic development organization which was founded in 1992, and for more than two decades we have worked to address critical challenges facing the greater Scranton area. Within the past decade, our organization has focused primarily on the downtown core business district as a State of Pennsylvania designated and nationally accredited Main Street organization . The national Main Street approach produces both tangible and intangible results. The strength ening of public participation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 through grassroots driven initiatives , the building of strong community partnerships for the betterment of our region, and providing advocacy and serving as a community convenor and intermediary , all intangible services very vital for forming a cohesive downtown community . More tangible outcomes including safe, clean and green activities , small business promotions and historic preservation efforts that we have produced through our facade improvement program all aim to rekindle entrepreneurship . Scranton Tomorrow has emerged as an important ally to a community that faces many challenges and guided by it's vision of Scranton is a vital and vibrant urban center of northeastern Pennsylvania . Our organization has marshalled resources to tackle old problems and to embrace new and exciting opportunities . Looking to the future we recognize that maintaining a healthy central business district is essentially to improving the economic climate of the greater Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 region creating jobs and retaining and attracting young people to our community are critical . Within the past year we have had the pleasure of working very closely with the City of Scranton , the national resource network and community stakeholders in developing a strategy serving as a catalyst for a business improvement district . This model, the group business improvement district , has been proven to be successful throughout the country and also serves as the next step for the national Main Street formula which we have undergone over the last decade. The plan includes items which are outside of the realm of municipal duties. The activities which would be undertaken will come with the great work of the municipal departments and will allow for private public partnerships to drive and to drive future economic development activities . We have recently successfully secured a local share account , the LSA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 funding grant, in the amount of $115,000 to be utilized solely for downtown beautification purposes , and this process will begin in the spring of 2018. We are continuing to work diligently on applying for additional grants for physical downtown improvements , website design, downtown branding events and all of the components that go along with driving economic structure . We also continue to meet with stakeholders within our community and foundation s in preparation of putting forth the economic development strategy . Scranton Tomorrow is energized by the tasks at hand and we respectfully ask for your support for this collaborative economic and development initiative . Thank you. MR. EVANS: Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident and taxpayer . Any word on the Knowel's insurance list? MR. EVANS: You know, it's been almost nine full months. I could have had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 baby in that amount of time. MR. WECHSLER : I hope not, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, but I'll keep asking in January . How about the Arcadis storm water management study, have we got any kind of idea when that's going to blossom into a product ? MR. WECHSLER : Sometime maybe first quarter next year, maybe second quarter next year. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, good, God, okay. I'm interested in the revitalization of the downtown largely because of self-interest because I live downtown and have for 18 some years, but I've got to tell you, I often feel bad for the residents of the other sections of the city, the vast majority of the Scranton taxpayers do not live downtown like I do, and I sometime s wonder if they don't feel that they don't get equal an focus, and I understand that the downtown is an economic driver, but think of people like Mr. Young and his odessey on Wyoming Avenue. Think of the projects that have languished over the years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 like the Novembrino pool complex , things like that. Sometimes I think that the other section s of the city get short drift and I don't know the answer because I know this resources are limited and funds are limited , but as we revitalize the downtown we shouldn 't ignore the fact that the burden of the tax base is not downtown , it's in those surrounding neighbor hoods, o, I hope that in 2018 you can find some way of focusing on that, also. And, finally , Mr. Wechsler I know this is your last council meeting , I want to wish you well. I maybe didn't always agree with you and your decisions , but I respect the work you have done for the city and I hope you continue to serve in some capacity in the future. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you very much. MS. HODOWANITZ : And I wish you all a wonderful holiday , Happy Hanukah and a Merry Christmas . If that's politically incorrect too bad, and hopefully I'll see you on January 1 for reorganization . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. Bring your baby. Lenny Srebo. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council. Lenny Srebro, Scranton resident . I'd like to put council stuff aside for a second really and wish you a happy holidays . All right, I came here actually to come down on Bill Gaughan , not really, but I understand , you know, like, he has got medical problems , but I really did come to see him, I didn't know he was sick. What I'm going after right now is the commissioner , Laureen Cummings , said she is in the process of writing a letter to the mayor and if he doesn't respond she wants to go there I'm assuming she means his office. Well, about a month ago Bill said the same thing, he was upset about, you know, like, that nobody is answering or nobody is giving any answers to this and, you know, he said that he wanted to go there if somebody doesn't get back to him. So we got two people, I'm hoping that after he recovers, I understand the medical problems he is having, I even have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 him them myself, I have a fear of water, but if somebody would get a message to him, you know, that that's what I'm going after. MR. WECHSLER : A message to who, Mr. Gaughan ? MR. SREBRO: Yeah, but, you know, I'd like to follow up on if he didn't get an answer, you know, like he said he wanted to go down there. MR. WECHSLER : Well, he has been in touch with the office on a daily basis, Mrs. Reed will pass the message onto him if he calls in. MR. SREBRO: She'll pass the message onto Bill? MR. WECHSLER : Correct . MR. SREBRO: All right. That's it. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council. Bob Bolus, Scranton . On 7-C last week I had raised some questions I had about it, I'd like to applaud Leslie for coming in and setting straight exactly what Scranton Tomorrow is about and what they intend to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 and I think she very clearly justified the spending of the $250,000 which is going to benefit the area, and I'm glad she came here because we had doubts, I know I had a bunch of them, and she did a great job on telling us whether they are heading and what they wanted to do and that was the questions , like, what are we getting for our money, so I think it was well worth her coming here today and I think people appreciate the fact of what they really can do and that they didn't run and hide, she came right out here in the open, so I'd like to wish her a Merry Christmas and everything else and the group that's going to do it. I hope they are successful in their venture because we need it. One of the things I had was last week was about the parking garages over at the mall. I still want to know where our VIP parking spaces are and that we are not going to pay to go in and out of the mall and I think there is an accountability to has to be done and I would ask counsel to send a letter and have Basalyga tell us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 exactly what we got for our money. That's something we haven't had so far and to share the money that he took on St. Patrick 's Day back to the city and the citizens here because those were our spaces. He has no right to give them out to anyone else but us. The other thing I do have is it's a little thing, but what is Christmas and what does it really mean to everyone ? Well, to me for 24 years I've doing a Christmas dinner here and I'm inviting , again, the 24th annual Bob Bolus senior Christmas Day dinner that's held at St. Patrick 's Church on Jackson Street and it's from 12 to 6. You don't need a reservation . All you need to do is bring your appetite , bring yourself and come and an enjoy the comradery and what the spirit of Christmas means. It's an all day buffet. If you attend the dinner you take the takeout home. We also deliver to people. We are delivering two meals to a family. Anybody has more than that there then they can come to the dinner and enjoy what it's about and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 take a takeout home. You don't need a reservation and what you need to do is just call my office, and I'll give you the number, it's area code 570-346-7659. And doesn't matter -- make a difference who you are or what you are, it's hoping that everyone who just doesn't want to be home alone on Christmas and it's something that when I started it I never thought I would ever get to the magnitude it is today, but we had over 3,000 people last year, and I want to thank everybody that participates in it, especially the people that come to the dinner, and eat what we prepare and volunteers that show up. Just shows what Scranton is really about and that kind of ties into Scranton Tomorrow and the other thing of who we are because we are doing things here that nobody else is doing. Just like I said with the mayor with the spirit ride on the move over laws with our first responders and everything else, Scranton out of 140 cities is the only one that gave the key to the city, and that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 remarkable and now after I raise the issue and presented the key to the spirit riders and the organization they are now making it something that everybody else does in other states they are asking them to do it, also. And those are some of the things that we have done around here and made a big difference in who we are and what we are all about. I know we all have our battles , but one thing that we need to see on Christmas Day we all put them aside and remember when Christmas is about. It's about family, it's about unity and it's about all of us enjoying the one day where everyone is equal and that's the most important thing that goes on. One thing I would like to say is, I'm sorry Bill isn't here, I told him we could have did the surgery for him and had him in here a lot quicker , but from the skunk family I want to wish him a Merry Christmas , I really do, and I hope he has a speedy recovery , you know what I mean? The skunks are going to around a long time whether he likes it or not, he is going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 have to engage them at one point or another , but I think we have accomplished a lot. Joe, you and I have had our battles , but we can still walk outside the door and shake hands and go forward. This is what life is about, that's what we come here for, this is the room that's built on debate and that's what the intent is, everybody comes and debates that they have to do, but in the end we all hope that we follow a pattern that rebuilds this city and makes it stronger for future generations . Again, I'd like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and if you all get thrown out of the house you know where to come for dinner. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Ron Ellman. MR. BOLUS: May I give this? You can put it on your site if you want and might help out. Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council. I wish everybody a good new year and a Merry Christmas . A few short -- you know, this reminds me of a kangaroo with a pouch, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 like these kind of shirts. A few short months ago Mr. Bulzoni was telling the city that that downtown is in dire need of a half million dollars , some grants, loan forgiveness and tax incentive s, and as far as tax incentives , look at all of the people downtown not paying taxes. The list is unbelievable . Linden Street, Vine, Jefferson , Madison , Wyoming , Lackawanna and Spruce, what's being the jewel of the city are living off the people, the other 99 percent of the people around here paying their taxes. Then last week Mr. McKenna wrote this flowery article , all of a sudden people are beating the doors down to live downtown we need more apartments . We need the streets cleaned . We need more bars and restaurants . I haven't seen a street sweeper on North Main Avenue probably 15 years, 12, 15 years. Everything that everybody in government in this city does it's for the 1 percent of the downtown . Downtown is a dinosaur , people. What was good then isn't necessarily good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 now. The mall is a dinosaur , a mall is supposed to be shops. Shops, not businesses like classrooms and aquariums , shops where you can buy things and they failed to do that. A couple of the years ago, two or three years ago, I don't remember when, I said just in a marketplace in that building like they have at Allentown and Pottstown it's informal and they are absolutely packed every time I have been there. People they just -- this one nobody -- it's just not handled right. Well, my friends , for every sunny day nature balances it out with rain and in our case snow, I guess, and just as the weather can change fate can change, too. I hope this coming government does well. I'm even going to lift my hex on you, Wayne, for the holidays anyway. MR. EVANS: Thanks very much, appreciate that. MR. ELLMAN: But I wish everybody the very best New Years. MR. EVANS: Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. I got one thing, if somebody knows how to housebreak a puppy I wish you would tell me. I'm not being very successful . He even seems to avoid the paper that's all over the house. Thank you. MR. EVANS: Thank you. Merry Christmas . MR. WECHSLER : Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council. Dave Dobrzyn , resident . We have a little bit of snow, I hope tomorrow is paper day in upper South Side. I have a lot of stuff to go and the next time I'll see it gone it's probably around the first of the year so -- MR. WECHSLER : They took them down on East Mountain , they took them all. MR. DOBRZYN : All right great. I try to recycle everything I can and, by the way, my coffee grounds and stuff like that go in the garden, you know. I mean, all of that stuff, but it's really kind of -- I don't want it there through the holidays . Don't forget to tune into DCReport.org online, a lot of interesting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 things on it. One of the things that occurred it me, I know it's a national issue, why don't we start granting a few tax breaks for corporation s that raise their wages so people don't have money in the pocket. You are not going to have any economy anyway. You can have all of the stores you want but if the stuff sits there on the shelf it's not doing any good and if you have 300 houses on your roster that's not help for your business so we really need to look at the type of wages people are being paid and they are working people and 80 percent of the people that collect food stamps or SNAP, if you want to call it that, and Obama care and so forth they are working people, so they just don't have enough to go around. I guess it was last week we had the people in about the gerrymandering and I think my idea is a little better with the straight line geographic to take in the necessary amount of people, however , at any rate we also have -- I spoke to a lady about Pennsylvania back with Obama and she was 88 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 years old, she lived this Carbondale and she went down for her photo ID and it was -- she didn't know better, but it was the day that all of the high schoolers come in to get their photo idea license , so it was like standing in line at 88 years old for two hours and finally get your photo ID. She couldn't stay and, fortunately , she was allowed to vote, but we have to stop the silliness here. If everybody just got a little friendlier, they could get themselves elected . PA America Water, 11 percent , that's kind of concerning . I was opposed to years back when they came up with that law that we are going to do be paying or cool the socks out in the country , occupied by a lot of wealthier people hanging out in the country driving forever and then they want their water service s subsidized . Well, when it comes to us poor people in Scranton forget about it, you know, that's not acceptable so some consumer group took it to court. We should have took the law to Court to begin with and forgot about all of this. I hope 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 things turn out all right, but it doesn't look good. And we have a state representative that is from -- represents part of Scranton in the paper every day that he is not showing up in Harrisburg and I would appreciate it if some of the officials from Scranton called him and please try to find it in his heart to show up and take a vote. For instance , he missed a vote on the gas line or the Marcellus shale gas and when those pipelines go in they can distribute it here or they can take it to the Chesapeake Bay or somewhere else, liquify it and sell it to China if they want, so it may not -- we have had some fair gas prices originally , but some day they may not be so fair. They may be based on a world market. Thank you and have a nice holiday . Merry Christmas , even from a doubting Thomas here. MS. SCHUMACHER : Evening . Marie Schumacher . I'd like to start by requesting that since you are going it be off for two weeks in December that you all end tonight 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 meeting before you adjourn by singing us a Christmas carol. I think that would be appropriate . MR. WECHSLER : You don't think we tortured you enough this year? MS. SCHUMACHER : 7-C. You know, going back in time, the 70's there was a big urban renewal program . In the 90's, there was another program for downtown . In the first decade of this century we spend a bundle downtown , and I would like to know you are getting the materials for the double pension to find out what went wrong and change things. I don't think you should be handing out a quarter of a million dollars until you can tell us why, what's going to be different this time? This is four separate -- this will be the fifth investment in the downtown. Why did the others fail? Why do we need another one so fast? I think those are important questions , so I would like to hear those. I would also like to maybe during Fifth Order if the pension issue with the investment , if the pensions have not been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 revised to your liking would you please tell the public what it is that needs to be done yet to make it acceptable to get that money transferred into the pension fund? That would be appreciated certainly , and another thing that would be nice to close out is the issue of the trash. I do not understand two things, and maybe you could tell us tonight who is doing this study that is supposedly being done? The agency we can follow-up with that and then I don't understand why the recyclables , all of which we taxpayers buy and put out to the curb and pay to have it picked up, why the proceeds of that do not go into the trash fund, into the same account as our $300 or I don't know is still going to $300 next year or is the same thing going to apply that you get 10 percent off? MR. EVANS: Yes, the discount will still apply next year. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, but I think that would help to reduce it further and I think all of the proceeds from the recycling should go back into that account . Are we going to be changing -- either changing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Home Rule Charter or are we going to just keep ignoring the fact that it exists and we are mishandling the way the trash is -- the trash deposits are made for the fees and the dispersals ? MR. EVANS: I'm not sure. I don't think. MS. SCHUMACHER : Maybe we can have that answer in January . It's important . If are you not going to do it, I think it should be done, but if you are not going to do it then change it. As a matter of fact, I think the new council , one of the things we have to start, it's certainly been a lot more than five years before we reviewed the Home Rule Charter , I think it's time that we have a Home Rule Charter review because not everything is going the way it should be, I don't think. Have any of the newly created positions for next year been advertised and if so where? MR. EVANS: I'm not aware of anywhere . MS. SCHUMACHER : Could we find out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 or ask at least? MR. EVANS: Sure. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then the parking board, Mr. Wechsler , last week you said something about before -- I thought you said before the meeting there is going to be something ? MR. WECHSLER : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : So if the regular meeting starts at 6:00 that means -- MR. WECHSLER : No, it will published days before. There is going to be a report days before this SPA meeting so that the documents can be reviewed by the public. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, the meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday and you haven't seen anything yet? MR. WECHSLER : No, not yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : Now, you are the representative on that board, who will and the representative next year? MR. WECHSLER : The way it's established is it's the mayor, the control ler and the council president . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I don't understand the problem , what is our insurance premium based on if not the properties and capital that we have to ensure? Are we not paying it? What happened to the insurance ? I mean, if we don't have a list of what's being insured how can we know that we are paying the proper premium ? MR. EVANS: Well, we have a list we just haven't seen it yet because it's still circulating I guess throughout the department s for final okay to make sure there is no errors in that final list. MS. SCHUMACHER : That's going on too long. Somebody needs to -- MR. EVANS: Totally agree with that. MS. SCHUMACHER : -- light a fire. MR. EVANS: I agree. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, I hope everybody has a blessed Christmas and a beautiful white Christmas and healthy new year. MR. EVANS: Okay. Thanks. You, too. MR. SBARAGLIA : Andy Sbaraglia , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 citizen of Scranton . Fellow Scrantonians , too I wish everybody a happy holiday before I get into this. As you know, the water company is planning to charge us 11 percent instead of the 1.9 percent like you so touted and everybody -- politician got up and said this the best thing to go. They are going to do this, they're going to do that, they had no intention s of doing that. You plan to ask the Sewer Authority to file lawsuit for breach of contract with the water company , okay. I didn't think you would answer. Tell me the truth, how much is Bockavitz (ph) for leasing the Electric City garage? You are on the board, you should know the amount they are being paid? Don't answer that either. MR. WECHSLER : No, this is your comment period, Mr. Sbaraglia . MR. SBARAGLIA : I know that. It doesn't matter, you're not going to answer it anyway. MR. WECHSLER : This is your comment period. It's not my question and answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 period. MS. SBARAGLIA : I know. Why answer people's problems ? MR. WECHSLER : Because this is not the place for it from that podium. It won't be the place come January either. This is your comment period. It's not question and answer period. Continue . MR. SBARAGLIA : I think you are all involved in a cover up. You should have known that the water company couldn't do what they planned to do and you touted it before the people of Scranton . Somebody told a lie. I know you are not going to answer who told the lie because you don't like the answer people's problems anyway. MR. WECHSLER : That's the best. That's not true. MR. SBARAGLIA : So you don't have to worry about that. MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Sbaraglia , we have been helping people with problems for four years here. MR. SBARAGLIA : The man back here has been having a problem for the last three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 years -- MR. WECHSLER : And we helped him the best we can, so I will not sit here and hear you say that my colleagues don't help people. That is a false statement . MR. SBARAGLIA : You didn't help him. MR. WECHSLER : That's a falsehood . MR. SBARAGLIA : You didn't help the city. MR. WECHSLER : Continue . MR. SBARAGLIA : I don't care what person you might have helped, I know you helped Bockavage if that's what you are referring to. MR. WECHSLER : No, we are referring to the people that came here with problems we helped them. MR. SBARAGLIA : But yet you weren't out to help the citizens of Scranton . MR. WECHSLER : Yes, we have. MR. SBARAGLIA : What are you going to do about the 1.9? I know you don't have to answer it, don't answer it now. MR. WECHSLER : That's the Pennsylvania Utility Commission . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. SBARAGLIA : I don't care what they Home Rule Charter say, we don't have to do what the state says -- and they are suing the state telling them that and we don't have to do that. MR. WECHSLER : The Pennsylvania American is have to -- MR. SBARAGLIA : We are a Home Rule Charter , we don't have to abide by state laws. This is what you said, and this is what the administration said and we are suing for that, too, so how you can sit there and tell them that that is' this or that, it's not. You have sitting there and done what you consider doing people favors. Maybe you do did a lot of favors. MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Sbaraglia , you are way off base tonight . MR. SBARAGLIA : What do you call that? Is that a favor you are going to give the man? MR. WECHSLER : We tried to help Mr. Srebro? MR. SBARAGLIA : Did you help him? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. WECHSLER : As best we could. Yes, we did. MR. SBARAGLIA : Yeah. No. MR. WECHSLER : Yes, we did. MR. SBARAGLIA : How? MR. WECHSLER : As best we could. We had a team out there, they tried to help him, it didn't work. He went onto someone else now, maybe some else can help. That was his decision . MR. SBARAGLIA : It's your job to help the citizens , not anyone else. MR. WECHSLER : We did. MR. SBARAGLIA : It's your job. The four of yous. You should turn over backwards and frontwards, you should go out there with an auger if you have to and bring out his pipe if that's what his problem is. I have sat and watched you tear the citizens of the city. The parking garages was a fiasco, you can cover it up anyway you can. Why there isn't a federal investigation , I'll never know. MR. WECHSLER : Because there is nothing there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. SBARAGLIA : No, there is something there. When you sell a garage for a dollar that was bringing $300,000 and then you release it something is wrong somewhere and that's the truth. It's no lie. You can't cover up something like that. MR. WECHSLER : That's why there is no investigation , Mr. Sbaraglia , there is nothing wrong there. MR. SBARAGALIA : No, the right people ain't being called. I've asked for a federal investigation . The FBI is the only one that can really come in and do -- MR. WECHSLER : Did you contact them? Did you contact the FBI? MR. SBARAGLIA : I shall because that's the only thing to save the city. MR. WECHSLER : There is nothing there. MR. SBARAGLIA : We can't let you yous continually run the city down into nothinginess . Thank you. MR. EVANS: Merry Christmas . MR. WECHSLER : Anyone else? MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Scranton resident . I wasn't going to talk again tonight , just came to observe and to wish Mr. Wechsler the best going forward, but I couldn't sit here when the gentleman was saying about that you haven't done anything for the city because I know both things that I have come to the city about have been taken care of, and I know that when I ride around in the Hill section and I can see the street signs I'm very pleased, and other people have said the same thing that the street sites are there. Last week when I was here because of the road conditions and the repairs to the city, I had very good positive results of that, and I don't have my paper with me, but they did put me in touch with Pennsylvania 611 or 711 or something like that, and they were very helpful and they did come and take care of some issues of cars being splashed and dirtied up because they had some big holes and you would wash your car the one day and it would be dirty the next, but they did come and fix that this week so when I hear the gentlemen saying that about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 city I do -- I just had to say something that I have had positive responses for anything that I have come to you for and I do thank you for that. And I am working on another project and, Mr. Wechsler , you won't be here because it's taking more time than I thought , but hopefully by next year I'll have another project that I'm working on, but I do like to come with facts and figures when I do come. So I do thank you and for that and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. Anyone else? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Perry? MR. PERRY: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Wechsler . A couple of brief items to touch on, some housekeeping from last week. I just want to thank Mr. Santoli for getting out to Maple Street that quick response , he was out there the next day to take a look at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that tree. That has been marked for removal and that situation will be taken care of. Also, Mrs. Jeffries , I got a follow-up from the city engineer about that road work on making it more publically known. He thinks it's very feasible to do a public notice. He thinks that's the best way to get it out there for most people just to put a public notice on the roadway that's being done when it comes into this office. So that should help get the word out there when it's going to be done. What else do I have on here, I just went to throw my get wells out to Mr. Gaughan . He is having a road to recovery I wish him a speedy recover y. And I also want to send out a deep heartfelt thank you to Mr. Wechsler . Joe, you served with great honor and hard work since I have been here, and I know even before I have been here. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. MR. PERRY: You're a testament to what the job means to the city and means to us as a colleagues . You have been nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 but support ive to us and I know that via e-mails, phone calls, texts he was always available to me and he is going to be missed sorely. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. MR. PERRY: Very much proud to call you a colleague and even more so proud to call you my friend, so thank you very much, Joe, you really have helped me grow in this position so thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. MR. PERRY: And, finally , I just want to send out a very Merry Christmas to everybody out there and a happy and safe new year, and again, it's been a Lackawanna or serving this year and I can't way to come back in January and get some more stuff done. So thank you very much. MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Rogan? MR. ROGAN: Yes. Just a couple of brief items. First, the housekeeping item, a memo was sent out down to inform the public, council will be meeting on January 1 as was mentioned for our reorganization . Our first regularly scheduled meeting will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 be on January 8, which is a Monday. Council meeting s will be on Mondays next year at 6:00 p.m. A caucus will proceed every meeting at 5:15. So our caucuses are going to be a little bit longer, the meetings are going to begin at 6:00. One citizen 's request I want to mention , I was contact ed by a business owner who has a furniture company and he had a delivery crew go out on Theodore Street in a box truck and anyone that knows Theodore Street and the railroad bridge there is in very poor condition , and even worse, that bridge is only 11 foot 2 inches. Most box trucks are 11 foot 6. Now, this is actually pretty common throughout the city, there is a number of other bridges that are much smaller , but this one has no markings . So as the driver drove up there was no indication that bridge was too low for his truck to fit under so, of course, when he drove to it the top of the truck went away. And to make matters worse, it was a snowy day and another resident driving down the hill slid into the truck so it was a real 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 disaster over there. So I have some pictures and I'm going to send to our city clerk, I want to ask if we can send an urgent memo to the DPW to get signage up there, going I believe it's one direction there is a very small sign, but going the other direction there is no signage and at all stating that the bridge is a low clearance and that box trucks will not fit under and this wasn't a tractor trailer . This was a furniture delivery truck going to deliver to one of our residents , so hopefully that's something that can be taken care of immediately before this happens again. I'd like to echo what Mr. Perry mentioned and thank Councilman Wechsler for his leadership and support over these last four years. I think we voted together at least -- almost every time, maybe once or twice we differed , so if it wasn't for Council President Wechsler 's leadership the city would not be in the position that it was in to have no tax increase s the last two years and be on the verge of leaving Act 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 distressed status. So I want to commend him and the next council president will certainly have large shows to fill. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Finally , I would like to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Hanukkah to those in the Jewish faith and a Happy New Year to everyone . MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Evans? MR. EVANS: Thank you. A couple of brief comments as well. First, I want to comment briefly on State Representative Carrollo 's action on the house floor this week. I have known State Representative Mike Carroll for quite a few years now and I will tell Mike's actions this week in Harrisburg as it related to Representative Haggerty 's record of absences speaks volumes to the person that I know. Mike is an individual of the upmost character an integrity and the constituents of the 118th district are very lucky to have him as their rep. To my knowledge , Representative Carroll was the first person to speak out on this issue in Harrisburg and it takes a very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 special person to speak out when everyone around you is silent. But I would also like to thank State Reps Mallory and Slossburg for their action on the floor following Representative Carroll 's lead. I would also like to recognize Representative Flynn for his comments in expressing his frustration over this situation . As was mentioned before, this is our last meeting before the holiday break so I would like to wish everyone a Happy Hanukah and Merry Christmas , and for everyone else, a Happy Festivus . That's a little Seinfeld slang. MR. PERRY: For the rest of us. MR. EVANS: But seriously , for those of us who have been lucky enough to have friends and family around us for the holidays , for those who are lucky enough to be able to give others -- to others during the holiday season, please take some time to think of those less fortunate and pay it forward whenever you can. And finally tonight I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 recognize , because it is the last meeting we will have with Councilman President Joe Wechsler . Joe, it's been a pleasure serving with you the past three plus years. I hope everyone who is listening tonight understands the sacrifices you have made for our city, but not only to serve our city but to serve our city in the right way, and it is my hope that we will work together long into the future as we continue to try to effect positive change. To me, you are the very definition of a public servant and a community leader and I know that as you move forward you will stay involved with me as you always have, I would expect nothing less. So, again, Joe, it's been a pleasure and thank you for your leadership . That's all I have. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Evans. This evening my comments are going to quite brief and really what they're going to amount to is just a thank you for everyone I have been able to work with for the past four years. Our city council staff, who are here every day and answering questions and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 solving problems , are fantastic to work with. Lori Reed, Kathy Carrera . When I hear people say that we don't answer questions and we don't provide any service I can just take a look at Lori's calendar and take a look at Kathy's calendar . I'll be honest with if you, if you want to get something done in Scranton if you have a problem you are better off calling the City Clerk's Office or Kathy Carrera 's desk or contact a Councilman directly . We do listen to comments at the podium, but it is quite difficult to answer questions as they are sprung on you live. I have tried to answer every question that's ever been asked from that podium, but when you spring questions in a "Gotcha, I got you" it doesn't work for the person asking the questions or it doesn't work for the councilmen either. Recently , we have applied a method of even dealing with the administration and providing them questions ahead of time when we have caucuses , because as I have been saying all along for the past two years is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 that the answers are more important than the questions . There is a lot of issues that have been just questions that have been thrown out to stir up the pot and really nobody even cared what the answers were going to be. It was just a matter of attacking someone or just as I would like to say stirring of the pot. The amount of people that we have helped through the council office and through the gentlemen that I work with, a lot of them you will never hear and you will never hear of the people that we helped get a pothole fixed, a curb fixed, you know, get some yards cleaned up and things like that. A lot of stuff happens that you never hear of and to be honest with you we never take credit for it because we are not here to take credit, we are here to help the citizens and we do that as well. So I'd like it thank Mr. Perry, Mr. Rogan, Mr. Evans, especially Mr. Gaughan in his absence , this council has raised the level of constituent service to a greater level than any other council that I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 ever worked with, and I have been working with councils for 25 years. I just didn't plop down in the seat, I was a neighborhood activist and neighborhood president for 25 years before I got here. So I know how this operation works and I know where we get our results and where we don't get results . City council , we are here every week and I'd like to say I think we are the only form of government that faces the public live every Thursday night, now every Monday night. Without any preparation we don't know what's going to be said at the podium, what type of question , what type of problem and we have to deal with it here either if we can right here or get into it the next day with the council staff. Solicitor Minora is a great help to us as well. And I'm disappointed that in my last meeting I have to hear someone say that we didn't do any help here. I can't believe that someone would say that. You can't be anymore wrong than that. This council has driven to help a lot of people. Mr. Srebro we didn't have any access yet, we are still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 working on that. Mr. Young had a problem , that's getting resolved . We got streets paved that have never been paved before. We have just done a lot of things that aren't appreciated and to question our integrity and to question our ability that's really misplaced . The FBI is welcome to come in here at any time and if they had wanted to they would have been. The Auditor General has been here. The auditor General has been down at the Scranton School District , so I would invite any investigation to come in this building . And the one thing I'm not going to miss is having my integrity question ed as I sit here. That's not fair and it's not right. I don't question anyone else's integrity and I think to say that is an insult to the people that work every day and I think that was a low blow. That's all I have. MS. REED: 5-B.
