Do 9 any council members have announcements at 10 this time? On Wednesday, June 21st at 6 11 p.m., PEL, the city's Action 47 Recovery 12 Coordinator will hold a public hearing at 13 City Hall in Council Chambers on PEL's three 14 year exit plan for the city to eliminate the 15 financially distressed state designation. 16 We encourage city residents to attend PEL's 17 public hearing. The Mayor will hold a town 18 hall meeting to explain the sewer sale next 19 Thursday, June 22nd at Lackawanna College's 20 auditorium on Vine Street from 5 to 7 p.m. 21 We urge all city residents to attend. 22 Council's regular weekly meeting scheduled 23 for the same evening, Thursday June 22, will 24 be cancelled. It is important for council 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 5 to 8 of 94 2 of 24 sheets5 to attend the Mayor's town hall meeting, 1 therefore we will not meet until the 2 following week, June 29th. We did look at 3 the schedule and attempt to reschedule the 4 meeting, but Wednesday night as previously 5 mentioned was being taken up by the PEL 6 hearing. So there wasn't another 7 opportunity for us to reschedule the 8 meeting. The electronic recycling program 9 is ongoing and will continue through June 10 26th. Your items should be placed outside 11 on the curb for the DPW to collect. Each 12 household will be allowed one television and 13 one computer monitor. Please be aware that 14 the pick up of these items may occur at any 15 time and not necessarily on your scheduled 16 garbage day. If you have not had your items 17 picked up and they've been out since Monday, 18 please call the DPW dispatcher at 19 570-348-4178. 20 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. CITIZENS 21 PARTICIPATION. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Gerard Hetman? 23 MR. HETMAN: Good evening, council, 24 Gerard Hetman from the Lackawanna County 25 6 Commissioners Office. To begin this 1 evening, our Farmers Market Nutritional 2 Voucher Program for seniors is now available 3 and will run over the next several weeks 4 with our distribution schedule. This is a 5 project that is in collaboration between the 6 Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging and 7 the Pennsylvania State Department of 8 Agriculture. The vouchers are distributed 9 on a first come first serve basis at senior 10 centers and other select locations around 11 Lackawanna County. The dates for 12 distribution in the City of Scranton are as 13 follows: Monday, June 26th, at the West 14 Scranton Senior Center 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 15 Wednesday, July 12th, at the Jewish 16 Community Center 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. And 17 Thursday, July 13th, at the marketplace at 18 Steamtown, 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Seniors must 19 provide proof of age and address, a driver's 20 license would suffice for both. They could 21 also use a birth certificate for age and 22 also a utility bill for address. Medicare 23 cards, we should note, are not acceptable 24 under the state guidelines. The guidelines 257 are, they must be 60 years of age or older 1 for recipients by December 31st of this 2 year. Recipients must also meet federal 3 income guidelines of $22,311 in annual 4 income for a single payer household. 5 $30,044 for a married couple. And $37,777 6 for a three person household. Proxy forms 7 are available for eligible seniors who 8 cannot pick up vouchers on their own. But 9 the forms are available at all senior 10 centers, the Lackawanna County Area Aging 11 Office in the county administration building 12 and also online at www.LackawannaCounty.org. 13 They actually have a sample form that we'll 14 leave with council's office so if anyone 15 contacts you, you'll have a copy also and 16 you can send them or give them or make a 17 copy. If there are any questions on the 18 program, please contact the Lackawanna 19 County Area Agency on Aging at 570-963-6740. 20 Second, our Senior Fun Day event, our second 21 annual Senior Fun Day takes place tomorrow, 22 Friday June 16th. The event is set from 10 23 a.m. to 1 p.m. at McDade Park in Pavilion 1. 24 It is a rain or shine event. So we'll be 25 8 under the Pavilion with everything in case 1 of inclement weather. There are free 2 activities for seniors including music and 3 dancing, refreshments, Bingo games with 4 prizes, and free runs on the Lackawanna 5 County Coal Mine Tour. And I should note, a 6 very important part of this. If you attend 7 the event, you may or may not see certain 8 county commissioners break out some of their 9 dance moves to the music that we have. That 10 alone is worth attending this event for, if 11 you can make it, I assure you. Come one, 12 come all to that. We don't check ages or 13 anything at the door. It's just geared 14 towards seniors. So anyone that considers 15 themselves a senior citizen and the guests 16 accompanying them are more than welcome. 17 Third, our Family Fun Day series once again 18 is set for our county parks. This is kind 19 of an open house that we have in the park. 20 It's very similar to the Senior Fun Day. We 21 just gear it a little bit younger in terms 22 of the music, the prizes that we have. And 23 also, we have face painting which we learned 24 is very popular for kids and families that 253 of 24 sheets Page 9 to 12 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM9 attend these events. The dates are June 1 24th at McDade Park. July 15th at Merli 2 Sarnoski Park. July 22nd at Covington Park. 3 And August 5th for Aylesworth Park, 11 a.m. 4 to 2 p.m. for each of those dates. The 5 McDade date we should note next Saturday is 6 also combined with our Bike Safety Fair 7 Event. We had to postpone that last month 8 due to inclement weather. So we'll have 9 free bike helmets and bike safety lessons 10 for all children in attendance at the McDade 11 Park date. And last but not least, our 3 on 12 3 basketball tournament was opened for 13 registration. It will be held downtown once 14 again, our sixth straight we're doing that 15 on the 100 to 200 block off Wyoming Avenue. 16 The dates are July 28th and July 29th, 17 Friday and Saturday. Sunday the 30th is a 18 rain date if we have to push the tournament 19 back due to inclement weather on the first 20 two days. We have teams from Grade 3 up to 21 the adult open divisions, minimum of 3 22 players, maximum of 5. Cost is $90 per team 23 for a student aged team. The adult open 24 division is $110. And for info or to 25 10 register, call 570-963-6743 or just visit 1 LackawannaCounty.org. And that's all we 2 have. Last but not least, we would just 3 like to thank everyone who is participating 4 in the electronics recycling program. We 5 appreciate council, the Mayor's Office and 6 everyone on the city's end especially the 7 DPW for working with us to make this a 8 success. A lot of them we'll see out on the 9 curb. In my neighborhood, there's a lot of 10 folks that have TVs and monitors out. We 11 appreciate the cooperation. Thank you. 12 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Joan 13 Hodawanitz? 14 MS. HODAWANITZ: Joan Hodawanitz, 15 city resident and taxpayer. Today is June 16 15th, 15 days from the date the audit is 17 supposed to be completed. Do we have any 18 status on whether it's moving on down the 19 road? 20 MR. EVANS: I was told it's still 21 expected to be completed by June 30th. 22 MS. HODAWANITZ: Okay, that's good. 23 And we're 145 days from the general election 24 on November 7th. Do we have any feedback on 2511 how the Arcadis study is progressing and 1 when that might be completed? 2 MR. GAUGHAN: I did get an update 3 from the business administrator. And 4 Arcadis is having trouble apparently getting 5 information from the sewer authority. 6 MS. HODAWANITZ: Oh don't say that. 7 Say that's not so. 8 MR. GAUGHAN: And the 9 administration. So, it's going from the 10 notes that I received and I can't recall 11 everything that was in the email. But from 12 the notes that I received are, it's moving 13 at a slower pace than they had originally 14 anticipated. 15 MS. HODAWANITZ: I'm sorry, but I've 16 just got to laugh. So they're having 17 trouble getting information from the sewer 18 authority board. 19 MR. GAUGHAN: I shouldn't say-- 20 MS. HODAWANITZ: And the city? 21 MR. GAUGHAN: That's what my 22 recollection is from the notes, it's moving 23 slower than they had anticipated. 24 MS. HODAWANITZ: It should be 25 12 completed shortly after the election? 1 MR. GAUGHAN: That, I don't know. 2 MS. HODAWANITZ: We'll see. 3 Speaking of surprises, I got the May 4 controller's report today. And I see in 5 here a couple of things. Number one, 6 there's a refund from Knowles Insurance 7 Company for $3,950 for some--that occurred 8 sometime in May. So, thinking of Knowles, 9 can you tell me the status of their updated 10 list of insured properties for the city? 11 Anybody know? 12 MR. EVANS: No. 13 MS. HODAWANITZ: Remember, it's 14 supposed to be three weeks and today was the 15 third week. And it's been two and a half 16 months since we passed that resolution to 17 give Knowles the contract. And are we still 18 insuring the Scranton Public Library by two 19 different entities? 20 MR. EVANS: I was told not, but we 21 haven't had the final report yet. So we 22 certainly know about that. 23 MS. HODAWANITZ: Do they still 24 intend to share with the public their 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 13 to 16 of 94 4 of 24 sheets13 corrected list? 1 MR. EVANS: Certainly, yes. 2 MS. HODAWANITZ: Okay, we have no 3 idea when though. 4 MR. EVANS: Well, again, you were 5 told what I was told. 6 MR. WECHSLER: The way I understand, 7 it's supposed to be quarterly. It's just 8 like your declaration sheet with your 9 insurance policy that changes when you make 10 changes to it. So it sounds like every 11 quarter there's going to be a new dec page. 12 MS. HODAWANITZ: Well, they 13 shouldn't have been carrying the Scranton 14 Public Library for 7 years. That's a little 15 outrageous. Okay, then, how about the 16 status of the RFP for the third party 17 administrator? Any progress on that? 18 MR. EVANS: Not that I'm aware of, 19 no. 20 MR. WECHSLER: No. 21 MS. HODAWANITZ: Okie dokie. Oh and 22 by the way, in case you were wondering, the 23 Mayor said he would have a third party 24 administrator on March 18th, 2016 and that 25 14 was 454 days ago. I'm counting. Okay, how 1 about the status of your request to the 2 Commonwealth's Attorney General to look into 3 the sewer authority sale? 4 MR. WECHSLER: We have not had a 5 response yet. 6 MS. HODAWANITZ: Okie dokie. And 7 finally, also on the controller's report is 8 a payment of turn key taxes for $8,530.90. 9 So what are we getting for our money from 10 them? 11 MR. EVANS: Turn key is any 12 percentage of money they collect over and 13 above what was collected by the single tax 14 office for the business privilege and 15 mercantile tax. So that's a percentage for 16 what they collected. So I think they get a 17 percent. So we'll have to do the math. 18 We'll find on out what the amount is that 19 they collected in order to get that 20 commission. 21 MS. HODAWANITZ: Okay, alright, 22 that's all I have. Thank you. 23 MR. WECHSLER: Fay Franus? 24 MS. FRANUS: Yes, I want to talk 2515 about the town hall meetings next week. 1 First, I'd like to start off by saying I 2 think this council has a lot of guilt in 3 this. Had you asked the right questions way 4 back then when you met with the sewer 5 authority before you voted on this and got 6 the answers to all these questions that 7 you're looking for now, I want the Attorney 8 General to look for it. If you had asked 9 those questions in the first place before 10 you voted on this, maybe we wouldn't be in 11 the shape we're in. It's not just the Mayor 12 who screwed up. Although, he's the number 13 one screw up. But you take some 14 responsibility. Mr. Wechsler, I say you so 15 more than anybody because you didn't want 16 him to come in front of council chambers 17 because they didn't want to. 18 MR. WECHSLER: Well, that's your 19 opinion. 20 MS. FRANUS: No, it's a fact. 21 MR. WECHSLER: It's incorrect. 22 MS. FRANUS: And a lot of things I 23 say are opinions. All of the things I say 24 are opinions. My opinions also are facts. 25 16 And that's why you didn't get elected. But, 1 as far as the town hall meeting, do you know 2 what the definition of a town hall meeting 3 is? Do you see them on television with all 4 the Congressman and all the Senators? They 5 go to a town hall meeting. They stand on 6 the stage by themselves, nobody else 7 speaking for them. They get asked questions 8 by their constituents. This town hall 9 meeting, I understand Henry Amoroso might be 10 speaking. We did not elect Henry Amoroso. 11 We did not elect any lawyers either. So I 12 hope Bill Courtright, which I doubt very 13 much, because he has not answered one 14 question ever presented to him without 15 turning to a lawyer. Because he didn't have 16 the brain cells to do it. And everybody 17 should understand this. He should be taking 18 full responsibility for this, which I doubt 19 that he will. But considering the fact that 20 he wants this town hall meeting, you know 21 there's something really shady going on. 22 The fact that he's having it at 5 o'clock to 23 7 when people aren't even home from work and 24 are having dinner with their families on the 255 of 24 sheets Page 17 to 20 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM17 same night that the council meeting is 1 supposed to take place, what does that tell 2 you it? All I'm telling you is he should be 3 there by himself. The Scranton Times should 4 put an editorial in the paper demanding that 5 he be there speaking and allowing every 6 citizen that wants to speak to ask any 7 question they so choose and to not listen to 8 their lies. And if they say anything that 9 aren't true, people should have a right to 10 question them and what they say that we know 11 are not true. So if he's having this, you 12 know, he's going to have his own little 13 justification for everything he did. We 14 want to know, I wouldn't mind seeing Ned 15 Abrahamsen and some of these younger lawyers 16 that got paid hundreds of thousands of 17 dollars for their legal work. I wouldn't 18 mind seeing them stand in front of the 19 people and explain how they bill for this, 20 how they justify this. We have lawyers that 21 work for the city that get paid. Why 22 couldn't they handle it? Why did they have 23 to hire 50 lawyers, all their buddies, all 24 their friends? That's why we're in the 25 18 shape we're in. Where's the twelve million 1 dollars? What about, not just the legal 2 fees, how about all of the other stuff? Are 3 they going to justify that? You still 4 didn't get the paperwork on that. How come? 5 Why didn't you get all the rest of the 6 paperwork on all the money that you spent? 7 Do you have it? Did you get it? I asked 8 this last week. 9 MR. WECHSLER: You just accused me 10 of getting answers to questions that weren't 11 right. And now, we didn't get that and-- 12 MS. FRANUS: You didn't get answers 13 to questions. 14 MR. WECHSLER: We did. The answers 15 that are out there came from that meeting. 16 MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? 17 MR. WECHSLER: The answers that are 18 out there right now from all the bills came 19 from the meeting that we had with Mr. 20 Shrive. 21 MS. FRANUS: Weeks, you just got 22 those retracted things last week. 23 MR. WECHSLER: Right. 24 MS. FRANUS: For months, you haven't 2519 been able to get them. But you met with 1 them months ago and still never got them. 2 That's what I was talking about. All the 3 months that you never got answers to any 4 questions that you were asked. 5 MR. WECHSLER: We asked them and 6 that's when we got them. We continued to 7 ask and ask and ask.8 MS. FRANUS: But then, you voted for 9 this before you got the answers to these 10 questions which is sort of stupid. 11 MR. WECHSLER: Or else the money 12 could not have come into the city. 13 MS. FRANUS: Oh, maybe the money 14 shouldn't have come into the city. Did you 15 ever think that maybe that should have been 16 the way? Because now there's no money going 17 to come in-- 18 MR. WECHSLER: Well, then we would 19 have lost the authority and not get any of 20 the money. So how would that be-- 21 MS. FRANUS: Oh, so now what you're 22 going to do is now there's no more assets 23 coming in, no money coming in so any bill 24 you get, you have to tax the people. What 25 20 do you care? Just tax the people, Mr. 1 Wechsler. Oh, don't even get me started. 2 But I just hope that somebody does something 3 to make sure the people get answers to these 4 questions. I have no use for you, Mr. 5 Wechsler. And all the stuff that you 6 haven't done, it's despicable. So, are you 7 going to see to it that the people get to 8 ask questions? Do you have any say in this 9 whatsoever? 10 MR. WECHSLER: It's the Mayor's 11 meeting. We have no say. 12 MS. FRANUS: None. You couldn't 13 even ask him to have it another night 14 because council--that's probably the way it 15 was planned. 16 MR. WECHSLER: No, it's his meeting. 17 MS. FRANUS: Yeah. Is ECTV going to 18 film it, do you know? 19 MR. WECHSLER: I don't believe so. 20 MS. FRANUS: So you don't know 21 anything. 22 MR. WECHSLER: I'm not sure if 23 you're hearing me. It's the Mayor's 24 meeting. 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 21 to 24 of 94 6 of 24 sheets21 MS. FRANUS: I know that. But you 1 never thought to call up. Ms. Schumacher 2 did. To call up and try to find out the 3 people speaking and how it's going to be 4 run? You never even thought to do that so 5 you could possibly tell the people?6 MR. WECHSLER: It's the Mayor's 7 meeting. 8 MS. FRANUS: Weren't you curious as 9 to what was going to transpire that maybe 10 you could tell the people tonight or the 11 people will get a chance to speak or they 12 won't get a chance to speak? You didn't 13 even do that. And one more thing, I think 14 there should be many debates between Jim 15 Mulligan and Bill Courtright. And I hope 16 Bill Courtright has the nerve to go through 17 with it. Because he absolutely has to 18 answer to the people one on one for a 19 change. We elected him. We want to hear 20 from him. Nobody else. Just him. 21 MR. WECHSLER: Ron Ellman? 22 MR. ELLMAN: Mr. President and 23 Council, you must think I'm Harvey 24 Wallbanger trying to get up here. 25 22 MR. WECHSLER: I am liking the cats 1 though.2 MR. ELLMAN: I didn't come to argue 3 or fight with you tonight. You can relax. 4 I didn't realize how deeply a supporter you 5 were of Mr. Bulzoni. Your last out--at 6 being enraged last week like I was a 7 criminal or something for opposing this 8 administration. I'm a tax payer. He's not. 9 I substantiate almost everything up here all 10 these years nobody's confronted me whether 11 they liked it or not. He lied to you people 12 week after week after week. And then, of 13 all things, Mayor Courtright hires him, does 14 away with a law that's supposed to be not to 15 have this. And council voted for it. All 16 this was wrong. People remember it. I've 17 heard it. In fact, I've heard it when I was 18 wasn't thinking of it no more from others. 19 But this seems to be the--Scranton's just 20 turning into the land of the forgotten it 21 seems. All this money for downtown and 22 that's all we hear about. We don't hear 23 nothing about swimming. I guess you're 24 going to leave that up to Mr. Jackowitz and 2523 Andy and the rest of the people like they've 1 done year after year. $500,000 for a friend 2 of the Mayor downtown that owes hundreds of 3 thousands of dollars in back taxes. In 4 fact, you're talking about three million 5 dollars because he wants to give a grant, 6 the city to get the grant for them. What 7 about the swimming for--these are future 8 voters. No one cares about the parks, the 9 skating. There's supposed to some kind of 10 skate board park. I don't know if that was 11 ever built. Somebody told me it wasn't. 12 Like I said, I've been almost 25 years and I 13 don't have any sidewalks and curbs. My yard 14 floods. All this money for downtown. If 15 they whine about something, they get it. It 16 doesn't matter how much money in back taxes 17 they owe. I'm going to give a quick example 18 of how many times I've come up here and 19 said, you people just are out of tune with 20 the people in this city. Last month if you 21 paid your fee before the first of May, you 22 saved $30. Is that right? The people that 23 needed that $30 the most were the people on 24 social security. Do you realize when the 25 24 social security checks come out? The third. 1 That's why there was so much turmoil 2 downtown downstairs. This was--would have 3 been so simple if you had somebody that was 4 in touch with the people of this city. It's 5 just another example. You guys just don't 6 care about the people of this city anymore. 7 And we're the ones paying for everything and 8 not getting our money's worth. But, I 9 promised I wouldn't offend you tonight. I'm 10 glad you all didn't sit here and drink water 11 and have to go to the bathroom to hear my 12 couple minutes. That was an effort. Thank 13 you. 14 MR. WECHSLER: Bob Bolus? 15 MR. BOLUS: Evening, council, Bob 16 Bolus, Scranton. It's kind of interesting 17 to come here and listen to everybody and see 18 everything that's been going on. One of the 19 last times I was here, I gave the analogy of 20 a horse in a barn. When the horse leaves, 21 what he deposits in the barn and they leave 22 you a shovel to clean it up. This is what 23 happened to your sewer deal. Your parking 24 garage deal. And the mall. You guys 257 of 24 sheets Page 25 to 28 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM25 honestly think the horse is now going to 1 back up into the barn and redeposit money 2 into the shovel that he left you? I don't 3 think so. It's not a reality. It's not 4 going to happen. The attorneys aren't 5 giving you one bloody dime back for costs, 6 expenses or anything else. Forget it, it's 7 gone. You know, you guys and the Mayor, I 8 don't know who is confused or who is 9 incompetent in this deal. But it really 10 stinks just like that barn. Because what's 11 happened to the people in this community, I 12 can't put in words. Or I'd probably get 13 thrown out of here if I really said what I 14 really think. You know, transparency, I'm 15 so sick of hearing Mr. Gaughan and 16 everybody, we want transparency. Guys, you 17 signed the recovery plan. Where in God's 18 name was the transparency when you did this? 19 You weren't there. You were clueless. And 20 now you want transparency? Get realistic. 21 It's not coming here. Let's talk about the 22 six million dollars? You want transparency? 23 That you gave to the mall. Parking garage 24 for a dollar. The mall bought his building 25 26 for him and everything else. You guys all 1 signed it. You and the Mayor. Want to talk 2 about transparency? What you cost the 3 taxpayers? Money could have went to the 4 pension fund, money could have went 5 anywhere. Money could have went to the 6 swimming pool. But you gave it to the mall 7 for zero. Transparency. It's a big word 8 around here, but it's a word that you start 9 looking at the mall, the parking garage, the 10 sewer deal. It's like looking for fool's 11 gold. That's what you's are doing. You're 12 making a fool out of yourselves. You're 13 making a bigger fool out of us, when you 14 think you're going to regain something. 15 Remember a little saying. The past is gone, 16 the present is now, the future belongs to no 17 one. Look where you are right now and you 18 can't predict the future, gentlemen. Don't 19 even come close. You know, when you turned 20 around and we keep watching the nonsense 21 that goes on here, Mr. Gaughan, you keep 22 using the word transparency in the 23 neighborhood meetings. Well, where were the 24 neighborhood groups? The Marinucci's, the 2527 Spano's and all the other leaders in the 1 groups, where the hell have they been? Have 2 they been here or here? Look around. Who 3 is here? A handful of people, a handful of 4 citizens. They're the know-it-alls. They 5 know everything. Now, they want us to talk 6 about transparency? They should look in the 7 mirror and realize they were part--a major 8 part of what happened because they allowed 9 this to go on. They allowed, don't come 10 crying, don't sit here whining that you want 11 us or something's going to change. It's not 12 going to happen, people. You sat on your 13 butts. You did nothing. Now, you're paying 14 the consequences. And it's only the tip of 15 the iceberg as this city sinks. And you're 16 not looking at any way you or anywhere else 17 can bring in revenue. You're just looking 18 at ripping these people off. Remember, the 19 Mayor rules. He's in charge. You're going 20 to have a stupid town meeting in a couple 21 days. Which is going to be dumb. 22 Cancelling meetings. You're changing things 23 around. You honestly think a sugar coated 24 meeting is going to mean anything? You want 25 28 to think that the Mayor is going to sit 1 there and hand you money back, transparency? 2 What are you going to look for? Are you 3 looking through a looking glass? It's not 4 going to be there. You blew money. Just 5 been careless. You've been negligent. And 6 I'm sorry to say some of you's even came 7 back on this council to be very honest with 8 you. Because you didn't give the people 9 what they deserved. And what they deserved 10 was integrity, honestly, to get the right 11 answers. Before you ever signed the 12 recovery plan, you should have asked your 13 solicitor or all the other solicitors in 14 this city. You should have precluded the 15 Mayor from hiring anybody out there. We 16 have enough solicitors in the city and in 17 the county to do the job that we're already 18 paying for. Those are the things that 19 transparency is about. It's integrity, it's 20 honesty. But most of all, it's 21 self-examination. And something of you guys 22 need to do if you're going to sit here for 23 four more years. You put us where we are. 24 Don't think you're going to get any benefit 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 29 to 32 of 94 8 of 24 sheets29 next week, next Thursday, listening to the 1 Mayor sugar coat what he's done and what 2 he'll continue to do. You're not going to 3 win the battle. You lost it. As I said, 4 you're looking for fool's gold. And if you 5 think you're going to run the city for four 6 more years after this, you guys better wake 7 up and smell the coffee. Look at the debt 8 we're facing. Look at the pensions, look at 9 the issues. But you're not realistic. 10 You're living in the sky, you got a pie in 11 the sky attitude. It's time to bring it 12 down and get real because we've got serious 13 issues. Look at all the for sale homes and 14 none of you guys are doing your job. 15 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 16 Bolus. 17 MR. BOLUS: And last off, Mr. 18 Wechsler, I'm glad-- 19 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 20 MR. BOLUS: Mr. Wechsler-- 21 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 22 MR. BOLUS: I'm glad the people 23 spoke and kicked you the hell out of here. 24 Thank you. 25 30 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 1 MR. BOLUS: We'll be happier for it, 2 buddy. Glad you're gone. 3 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 4 Bolus. I'm not going anywhere. I won't be 5 on council, but I'll still be in the city. 6 MR. BOLUS: I know you will. And 7 unfortunately, that's the sad part of this. 8 But you will be gone. That's the happy 9 part. 10 MR. WECHSLER: I'll still be in the 11 city, Mr. Bolus. 12 MR. BOLUS: I can't wait. And thank 13 you because I threw a great part-- 14 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 15 MR. BOLUS: --to get you the hell 16 out of here. 17 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 18 I'll be here until December. Thank you. 19 Les Spindler? 20 MR. SPINDLER: Good evening, 21 council, Les Spindler, city resident, home 22 owner and taxpayer. Two weeks ago, council 23 up here, I asked you to check on that hole 24 on Dorothy Street. I walked by there that 2531 following Tuesday and it was filled in with 1 nice soil. So, I thank you. 2 MR. PERRY: Well, I passed it along. 3 DPW took care of it.4 MR. SPINDLER: My thanks a lot to 5 Director Gallagher and his people. 6 MR. PERRY: I'll pass that along. 7 Thank you. 8 MR. SPINDLER: Quick action, thank 9 you. For a long time now, Councilman 10 Gaughan, I've asked you why you have such 11 destain towards the Mayor. He can't do 12 anything right in your eyes. And I finally 13 found out. You worked for OECD under Chris 14 Doherty. And when Mayor Courtright took 15 over, you lost your job. Now, I know why 16 Mayor Doherty--Mayor Courtright can do 17 nothing right in your eyes. 18 MR. GAUGHAN: That is patently 19 false. I left OECD to run for council. So 20 you just lied at a public meeting. Don't 21 stand at the podium and lie, Mr. Spindler. 22 Get your facts straight. I left OECD. I 23 resigned from OECD to run for city council. 24 So get your facts straight before you talk 25 32 about anything that has to do with me. 1 MR. SPINDLER: Mayor Courtright is 2 trying to fix something that the person you 3 supported, he ruined this city. And Mayor 4 Courtright is trying to fix it and he can't 5 do anything right in your eyes. You and 6 Councilman Evans and everybody else who 7 supported Chris Doherty are part of the 8 reason Mayor Courtright has to do what he's 9 doing. Because Chris Dorothy ruined this 10 city. Two weeks ago, I also brought up 11 about the gentleman who spoke here a while 12 back about Leggitt's Creek. And I think 13 it's a DEP issue. They should be brought 14 in. Has Council taken any action on that? 15 I think that's two weeks ago. I think a 16 letter should be sent to DEP. That's an 17 environmental issue. Nothing was done. 18 MR. GAUGHAN: I've been in contact 19 with Bernie McGurl. So it is being looked 20 at. 21 MR. SPINDLER: Okay, thank you. 22 Okay, something on a positive note, watching 23 the news tonight, there was a story of three 24 West Scranton students who recently drew a 259 of 24 sheets Page 33 to 36 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM33 mural or painted a mural of a firefighter. 1 And yesterday it was hung in the gym at fire 2 headquarters. And Chief DeSarno spoke. He 3 said that while it was hanging, the 4 firefighters there, I guess it was covered. 5 They asked him what he was doing? When they 6 unveiled it, they said it was beautiful. 7 They loved it. They said that's going to be 8 there as long as fire headquarters is there. 9 And I think the parents of these children 10 should be proud of them. It's something 11 very nice they did. And it really speaks 12 well of what's going on in West Scranton 13 High School. Lastly, Ms. Franus was here 14 criticizing the Mayor again, what time he's 15 having the town hall meeting. You know 16 what, in her eyes, I don't think it would 17 matter what time he had the meeting, she 18 would criticize it. She's criticizing 19 having it 5 to 7 because that's when people 20 eat. If he had it during the day, she'd 21 criticize him saying for having it then when 22 people are working. Some people in this 23 city, no matter what the Mayor does, no 24 matter what times he does it, it won't be 25 34 good in their eyes. As I said, I think the 1 Mayor is doing a fair job with the mess he 2 was left by 12 years of Chris Doherty. 3 That's all I have tonight. Thank you. 4 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Lee 5 Morgan?6 MR. MORGAN: Good evening, council, 7 Lee Morgan. I think I'd like to say that 8 I'm still interested in people calling me 9 about a write-in for Mayor and Council. I 10 have received some responses to that. But 11 I'd like to give my phone number. It's 12 570-604-1212. And this is really something 13 that can happen here because the general 14 populous is really disgusted with this 15 council and this administration. And 16 there's been over 25 years of pain and 17 suffering in this city. And it's worse now 18 than when we went into distressed status. 19 And you can, you know, discuss issues from a 20 multitude of various points. But the truth 21 of the matter is that the residents are 22 responsible for the mess that this city is 23 in. Because they've elected one incompetent 24 elected official after another. And that 2535 burden falls on them, not the people they've 1 elected. But I'd like to say that I 2 recently talked to somebody in the PUC about 3 the sewer deal. And they want me to send 4 them a complaint and I will. But I think 5 they understand when I spoke to them whoever 6 the chairman is exactly the kind of 7 silliness that took place in this city. And 8 you know, the pathetic sad part is that you 9 five people were elected to take care of the 10 city and its residents. But not one of you 11 will step forward and do that. It's really 12 pathetic. And as far as the deal for the 13 Scranton Sewer Authority, well, you know, 14 Mr. Wechsler, you said you were opposed to 15 the deal, but yet you introduced it. And 16 the sewer authority couldn't have sold 17 itself without permission from council. And 18 I think that people in this city have been 19 lied to for a very long time. And I don't 20 know if they're--I really don't know if 21 they're smart enough or they care enough to 22 do something about it. And I think that 23 we'll find that out in the general election. 24 And I hope there are a few people that are 25 36 willing to do it right and just to prove to 1 the smug people who think they run 2 everything with money and votes that there 3 comes a point where the huddled masses in 4 this country which is the electorate finally 5 stand up and tell the people that are 6 fiscally connected to the people that are 7 pulling all the shots that they've had 8 enough. They did that in the election of 9 Donald Trump. Don't forget that the 10 Republicans against him spent an awful lot 11 of money and an awful lot of democrats came 12 across party lines to vote for him. The 13 only problem is, the American people don't 14 really understand the kind of shape 15 financially that America's in. And it's 16 worse than Greece. And they're going to see 17 it because Medicaid funding is ending in 18 some states. And there are a lot of other 19 things taking place in this country. And as 20 far as the council and the Mayor, you know, 21 running the city, I wouldn't say in a 22 business like way. Because government isn't 23 business. But in a legitimate way that 24 protects the interest of the populous. 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 37 to 40 of 94 10 of 24 sheets37 We've got city pools that have been closed 1 for a decade. We're going to build a splash 2 park, a bankrupt community is going to build 3 a splash park in place of the Novembrino 4 pool. All the easy money that flows around 5 to be politically spent has been funneled 6 into the city. The bridge down in the 7 gorge. The treehouse. I mean, the 8 treehouse comes up because of the way it was 9 constructed. But the bridge down in the 10 gorge is beyond ridiculous. You could drive 11 a tractor trailer across that bridge and it 12 goes nowhere but to a walking pad. It's 13 absolutely asinine considering the state of 14 our city. And you know, you take a look at 15 the streets. The machine we bought to make 16 permanent repairs to potholes in the city, I 17 don't know, not existent. Probably went 18 somewhere for scrap. But you're our 19 guardians. You're here to protect our 20 interests and serve us. But is that really 21 what's happening? And being smug and 22 holding meetings in the back room over at 23 council chambers is ridiculous. Because it 24 just proves that you're not willing to come 25 38 out into the light and discuss issues. And 1 I understand that some issues should be 2 discussed there. But there's an awful lot 3 of issues that should be discussed in 4 public. And in regards to the sewer deal, 5 it wasn't a deal. It was a theft. 6 Pennsylvania American Water would have built 7 a sewage collection system and a treatment 8 center if they could have made a profit 9 doing it. But no, the residents of the city 10 paid for it all with bonds and you are its 11 guardians. So you know, when you're trying 12 to be somebody's guardian and it turns out 13 to be an elected official, you know it just 14 goes to prove one thing, my last point, the 15 shooting that recently took place of an 16 elected official from Washington, that may 17 be only the beginning. Because don't forget 18 one thing here-- 19 MR. WECHSLER: Mr. Morgan, we're not 20 going to go there. 21 MR. MORGAN: Hold on. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Please, we're not 23 going to talk about shooting as an option. 24 MR. MORGAN: When Mrs. Gatelli was 2539 here, they posted a guard here. They had a 1 policeman come in here. And there's a 2 reason for that. 3 MR. WECHSLER: People talk about 4 shooting--5 MR. MORGAN: People--don't talk over 6 the top of me. 7 MR. WECHSLER: Well, I'm asking you 8 not to--9 MR. MORGAN: No, I'm asking you to 10 stop and let me make my point. 11 MR. WECHSLER: I'm asking you-- 12 MR. MORGAN: I'm asking you to stop 13 and let me make my point. You run this 14 meeting, but I have a point to make. And 15 freedom of speech-- 16 MR. WECHSLER: I think you're out of 17 order talking about shooting. 18 MR. MORGAN: Well, then you should 19 take me to court and have me arrested and 20 then we'll see what happens. 21 MR. WECHSLER: No, I'm asking you to 22 stop. Your time is up and you're talking 23 about shooting. 24 MR. MORGAN: Here's my point, Ms. 25 40 Gatelli had a guard posted here. They put 1 monitors in the doorways so that nobody 2 would bring a gun in here. 3 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. 4 MR. MORGAN: But you know what 5 happens here is this, is that we have 6 elected officials that have such contempt 7 for us, they want to control what we say, 8 what we do as they steal every one of our 9 assets. And Mr. Wechsler, any time you want 10 to meet me in a public forum and debate your 11 performance here, let me know. 12 MR. WECHSLER: That's fine, Mr. 13 Morgan, but I think it's out of-- 14 MR. MORGAN: Please don't talk to me 15 when I leave the podium. Thank you. 16 MR. WECHSLER: I'm making a general 17 comment. I think it's disrespectful-- 18 MR. MORGAN: General comments at 19 council? 20 MR. WECHSLER: For a-- 21 MR. MORGAN: How about doing your 22 job? How about doing your job? 23 MR. WECHSLER: Thank, Mr. Morgan. 24 MR. MORGAN: Yes, thank you. 2511 of 24 sheets Page 41 to 44 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM41 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 1 MR. DOBRYZN: Good evening, council, 2 Dave Dobryzn, resident of Scranton. And if 3 you see me have any--4 MR. PERRY: Mr. Dobryzn, I'm sorry, 5 I can't hear you. I'm still--my ears are 6 ringing from the last--7 MR. DOBRYZN: Yeah, I hear you. 8 MR. PERRY: Just give me a second to 9 regather my hearing. 10 MR. DOBRYZN: Reset the clock, 11 please. 12 MR. PERRY: We went from one type to 13 the other, so. 14 MR. DOBRYZN: I try to be a little 15 less shrill. I don't care much for talking 16 to the secret service about my comments. If 17 you see me out at the parade or the concert 18 downtown, don't give me the dock like some 19 people did last year from the 20 administration. I don't carry a shotgun 21 under my trench coat, okay. I don't believe 22 in it. Okay, let's get started here. A 23 word from our sponsor. Tuck's. You like 24 this shirt? Very nice. 25 42 MR. EVANS: It's not cats. 1 MR. DOBRYZN: It was designed a 2 little. So, you know, my point about Tuck's 3 is they never received 27 million dollars in 4 loans. Obviously, never will. And it's 5 time we start to support businessmen that 6 actually do something for the community. 7 And the poor guy slipped last winter and 8 busted up his hip. And he was out for six 9 weeks. The store was closed, so give him a 10 couple of bucks. Get in there and get a 11 nice t-shirt. I'll even let you wear it to 12 council. The sidewalk up here, I seen the 13 tables on the way in. And the thought 14 occurred to me that we're so obsessed with 15 stopping and preventing restaurants from 16 having a smoking area separate from eating 17 area that we outlawed it. Somehow everybody 18 needs to be sprawled out on the sidewalk. I 19 really, with my luck, I'd pay 30 or 40 bucks 20 for a dinner and the pigeon would fly by. 21 But the thought occurred to me with city 22 taxes and fees, too many are due at winter's 23 end. And we have taxes fall through and 24 then the trash bill falls through. And the 2543 dog license is due. And you know, it gets a 1 little overwhelming. I often wish that we 2 could find a way to space these things out 3 without--I'd gladly it be later in the 4 summer, pay half of my trash fee for next 5 year as long as I could get my senior 6 citizen's discount then. You know, it's 7 just too much. And I don't think that $300 8 is too much. But it's too much at one time 9 to have to pay my two properties. And then, 10 the $300 and it gets difficult. And once 11 again, on trash, I contend that 80 percent 12 of the cost or similar to that is the cost 13 of showing up at your front door for a crew 14 and trucks, fuel, insurance, go on and on 15 and on with that. But I spoke to a newbie 16 last week and he didn't have his trash 17 sorted right. And then, he found out that 18 we had to put it down front, and I'm not 19 going to do that. So, you know, we rush in 20 with some new thing that, like new idea like 21 pay to throw. And we don't try to make the 22 old system work. And sometimes, at 7 and a 23 half million dollars over several years not 24 collected for trash fees, most people are 25 44 living off the people that pay. And if you 1 don't have the money, I apologize, but there 2 are a lot of people that have a lot of money 3 and they have fancy cars and they have 4 rental properties and income properties and 5 you name it. And they just don't pay up. 6 They just don't pay up and it's a shame. 7 It's really a shame. So, it's time that we 8 at least look into a study as to what's 9 going wrong. And we may have to step on a 10 few politically powerful toes and tell them 11 it's their turn to pay too. We really do. 12 Because I do happen to know, I see recycle 13 buckets in the back of people's income 14 properties and everything else. And I see 15 what's in the trash. And it's time to hold 16 the people responsible causing the problem. 17 Don't punish the people that aren't. Thank 18 you and have a good evening. 19 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Anyone 20 else? 21 MR. JACKOWITZ: Good evening, 22 Scranton City Council, Cathy, Stenographer, 23 Lori, Amil and a good welcome to Mark in the 24 back room who makes this all possible. Mark 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 45 to 48 of 94 12 of 24 sheets45 is one who's been with us every week. And 1 I've been neglecting to say good evening to 2 Mark. So shout out to you Mark. Okay, 3 first of all, I need to admit that I made a 4 mistake when I said that the Mayor wasn't 5 going to hold this town hall meeting until 6 after the election. I was wrong. He showed 7 more courage than I gave him credit for. 8 So, kudos out to Mayor Courtright for 9 holding his town hall meeting. Although, I 10 think the town hall meeting really isn't 11 going to accomplish anything. Because like 12 the speaker before me said he's going to be 13 sitting up there with a whole bunch of his 14 cronies sitting next to him, lawyers and 15 whoever else he's going to bring along with 16 him. And I know if I get an opportunity to 17 ask a question, I'm asking Mayor Courtright 18 the question. I hope no one else tries to 19 answer that question for Mayor Courtright. 20 I hope Mayor Courtright--I will make a point 21 that Mayor Courtright answer the question, 22 not one of his lawyers, not one of his 23 cronies, but Mayor Courtright himself answer 24 the question. And as far as the time limit 25 46 goes, I take it was pretty slick on his part 1 to have it on a Thursday from 5 to 7. It 2 should be from 5 until question mark. There 3 should be no time limit at the end of it. 4 If people want to talk until 9 o'clock, 10 5 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night, then they 6 should be allowed to do it. Because we 7 only--this is the first town hall meeting 8 we've had and this is a very important 9 meeting. This meeting basically is going to 10 resolve this whole city, where the city's 11 going and what's going to happen with it. 12 So there should be no time limit as far as 13 ending time. And people should be allowed 14 to ask their questions. And no one should 15 be rushed and no one should be hurried. And 16 they should be allowed to go to until, like 17 I said, if there's enough people there--I 18 mean, I have no idea how many people are 19 going to show up. It might be a big crowd. 20 It might be a medium sized crowd. It might 21 be a small crowd. I have no idea. But 22 everyone who has a question at that town 23 hall meeting should be allowed the 24 opportunity to ask that question. And 2547 again, the only person that should be 1 answering any of the questions is Mayor 2 Courtright. No one else. And I hope city 3 council can relay that message to the Mayor 4 for me. I've been trying to, but he won't 5 accept my phone calls. So, I hope someone 6 on city council gets a hold of the Mayor and 7 mentions this to him: Hey Mayor, it's your 8 town hall meeting like Mr. Wechsler said. 9 It's the mayor's meeting. He's the one 10 conducting it. He's the one who scheduled 11 it. So he's the one who should be answering 12 the questions. And he's the one who's in 13 charge of that meeting and no one else. 14 Hopefully, I hope he's up on the podium or 15 on the stage by himself. That would be the 16 best thing possible would be for him to show 17 up and sit on that stage all by himself. 18 And with his glass of water and that's about 19 all that should be up on that stage. The 20 Mayor and his glass of water or bottle of 21 water now a days. But, anyway, I hear 22 that--now this is just--I don't know if this 23 is fact. I don't know if it's made public. 24 But I hear Mayor Doherty's nephew got the 25 48 health care contract for the city employees. 1 Is that true? Has anybody heard anything 2 yet? 3 MR. EVANS: No. 4 MR. JACKOWITZ: I heard that today 5 that Mayor Doherty's nephew got the contract 6 for the health care for city employees. And 7 well, it doesn't surprise me. But I 8 understand he wasn't the lowest bidder 9 either. It doesn't surprise me, but we need 10 to find out if that's true or not. And I 11 guess that's about it. Pretty feisty 12 meeting today. Kind of reminds me of the 13 old days, you know. Maybe I'll get to get 14 my boxing gloves back out from the closet 15 and start bringing them to the meetings for 16 me. It was a little feisty today, but a 17 little feisty is good in life. It kind of 18 motivates people and gets people's spirit 19 up. So you all have a good night. 20 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 21 MS. SCHUMACHER: And so it starts, 6 22 a.m., tonight's agenda, last Sunday's paper, 23 "Something should be done. The property at 24 the former Serrenti Army Reserve Center on 2513 of 24 sheets Page 49 to 52 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM49 Colfax Avenue in Scranton has fallen into 1 disrepair with overgrown grass and poorly 2 maintained appearance. The city which has 3 control of the property is in the process of 4 formally acquiring ownership. Neighbors 5 complain that the condition of the site has 6 become a detriment to the neighborhood. 7 Something should be done." So, we have the 8 issue of maintenance. We have the issue of 9 everybody extolling the need for it because 10 of all this sophisticated equipment that's 11 being stored there. And that leads to what 12 is going to be the insurance increment for 13 that property. Has anybody inquired of 14 Knowles? 15 MR. GAUGHAN: I inquired with the 16 business administrator and he said he would 17 get me that answer. 18 MS. SCHUMACHER: When? 19 MR. GAUGHAN: He didn't give me a 20 timeline. 21 MS. SCHUMACHER: Okay. And not this 22 one inspired me, because this was this 23 weeks, but last weeks's inspired me to 24 think; what could possibly be done to 25 50 correct the problem at Seymour Avenue and 1 307? So I went over the next Monday and I 2 with my tape measure, I walked over and 3 measured the rectangle that is at the top 4 on--which the grill, which is missing, 5 should be placed. And I measured the depth 6 which was 30 inches. Protecting that was 7 some of that pink or orange florescent paint 8 around the three outer edges and two cones 9 of similar color. So I submitted that and 10 that was in the morning. And in the 11 afternoon, I was taking the little guy to a 12 dental appointment. And I just laughed when 13 I got to 307 because the two cones had been 14 placed on the Seymour Avenue where the last 15 rain storm had washed out a big chunk of the 16 pavement and it was a nasty hit. So, the 17 cones were there and there were two horses 18 placed over the 30 inch hole which is right 19 at the corner. That doesn't cut it guys. 20 We really have to address things. That 21 whole corridor of 307 is fading away again 22 on the shoulder. It's eating into the--it's 23 now eating into the line at the end. And 24 there's some nasty drop offs. And I for one 2551 am not going to beg the state to do it again 1 this time because we don't do our part. 2 That whole pipe has to be replaced. And 3 yet, nothing happens. We get horses and 4 paint and cones. Well, moving on to paving. 5 I did go as I--I did not get through all the 6 backup last week. But I did go home and 7 after Mr. Gaughan noted that it was, the 8 tentative paving list was in. For the East 9 Mountain, there are nine streets. The first 10 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, are 11 in a development on the Dunmore side of 307. 12 They--some of them are only out on one 13 block, some are two or three. But I would 14 encourage all of you to go and drive those 15 streets and see if they are one of the worst 16 in this city. And then, when you leave 17 there, drive down Elmhurst Boulevard and get 18 onto 307 down at the foot. And see what 19 that's like. If anything needs to be done 20 on the side of the hill, it's a big chunk of 21 Elmhurst Boulevard. I don't know what our 22 criteria is, but I sure hope you ask how 23 these are arrived at. Mountain Lake Road, 24 there are places where the road just 25 52 disappears and it's not too shabby when it's 1 dry. But when it rains, you're into a great 2 big mud puddle. I think we should be doing 3 the works. And Mr. Gaughan, did you ever 4 share that pothole truck information that I 5 gave you with Mr. Gallagher? 6 MR. GAUGHAN: I did, I forwarded it 7 to him. I didn't-- 8 MS. SCHUMACHER: Okay, I have a lot 9 more. I think we should pursue that. I 10 really think we should be doing the works. 11 Some of these, that pothole machine would be 12 perfect for some other things and I have a 13 lot more and I will try to be back in two 14 weeks I guess, it is now, huh? Or are we 15 going to have a different night next week? 16 MR. WECHSLER: No, there was no 17 available evening. Wednesday night was 18 taken with the PEL meeting, so Tuesday is 19 too early, so we tried. 20 MS. SCHUMACHER: Thank you. 21 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Anyone 22 else? 23 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5A. 24 MOTIONS. 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 53 to 56 of 94 14 of 24 sheets53 MR. WECHSLER: Mr. Perry? 1 MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you. I just 2 have one thing tonight. I promised last 3 week that we would do some research on which 4 is 6A which is the Serrenti building. We 5 did get some information from Chief Graziano 6 on some of the minor studies that were done. 7 And it was 11 pages with some enclosures. I 8 picked out some of the more permanent 9 things. I'll address them right now. First 10 of all, this one is--was done in March of 11 2014. The purpose of the finding is 12 suitable to transfer or affose it to 13 document the environmental suitability of 14 the property of the Serrenti Memorial 15 Building, the reserve center located in 16 Scranton, Pennsylvania for the transfer to 17 the Scranton School District. If you 18 remember at that time, that's when the 19 school district was potentially interested 20 in it. And that's when this study was done 21 in March of 2014. This study covered 22 numerous environmental situations such as 23 storage, release or disposal of hazardous 24 substances, petroleum, petroleum products, 25 54 polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos, lead 1 based paints, radiological materials, radon, 2 munitions and explosives of concern. And 3 after all the findings, a finding of 4 suitable to transfer. Based on the 5 information above, I conclude that all 6 removal or remedial actions necessary to 7 protect human health and the environment 8 have been taken. In addition, all 9 Department of Defense requirements to reach 10 a finding suitable to transfer have been met 11 subject to the terms and conditions in the 12 environmental protection provisions that 13 shall be included in the deed for the 14 property. The deed will also include the 15 access provisions and other deed provisions. 16 Whereas no hazardous substances were stored 17 for one year or more known to have been 18 released disposed on this parcel, hazardous 19 substance notification is not required. And 20 this was performed by Jeff Hirsick, Chief 21 Environmental Division USAR Land Division 22 RSC. That was done in 2014. We had another 23 study done by FEMA. This was done just 24 recently, April 26th of this year. And this 2555 was done by a Raymond Palmer. And he, based 1 on the usage that the city wants to use it 2 for, to not going forward to contaminate, we 3 assessed the environmental impact of the 4 identified use that the City of Scranton 5 would be using it for. Minimal, if any. 6 The description of the proposed use as 7 provided by the City of Scranton does not 8 indicate any special issues that would 9 suggest a different level of impact in this 10 case. The City of Scranton, any agency 11 funding, issuing permits or enacting the 12 property transfer or project limitations 13 should consider additional information as 14 appropriate to comply with several involved 15 state and federal fire laws and executive 16 orders. We recommend inserting the 17 following clauses to transfer. And then, it 18 just goes on. So as far as the 19 environmental impact, I was pleased that we 20 did get this information before we were 21 given the--I guess you can say the domain to 22 use the building. But now that the deed is 23 going to be transferred, we just--Councilman 24 Gaughan and myself, we wanted to see this 25 56 one more time, find the date line and make 1 sure. I'm sure he'll have comments on it as 2 well as his findings on the readings. As 3 far as the grass cutting, that's basic. 4 We've just got to take care of our own. I 5 mean, there's no reason for that. Anybody 6 who owns property in the City of Scranton 7 has to take care of their own. I'm not 8 going to sit here and make excuses why that 9 is like that. But, you know, I'll make a 10 phone call tomorrow and see what happens. 11 We need a plan in place. It just can't 12 happen. We're the City of Scranton. We own 13 the building. We have to take care of it. 14 We have to own it. If we're going to 15 enforce laws on other people, it starts and 16 ends with us. So that's an embarrassing 17 mark on us, I do agree. So that has to be 18 fixed. And I'll reserve the rest of my 19 comments to other agenda items. That's all 20 I have today, Mr. Wechsler. Thank you. 21 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Mr. 22 Rogan? 23 MR. ROGAN: Yes, just two brief 24 items I want to speak a little bit about 2515 of 24 sheets Page 57 to 60 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM57 more at length. I do want to mention, we 1 did receive a letter from the Street Cats 2 and Dogs Group that operates the old Nay Aug 3 Zoo. And they're going to be having some 4 ceremonies regarding the zoo turning 100 5 years old this year. And for anyone who 6 doesn't know what this organization has been 7 doing is they trap, neuter and release feral 8 cats within the City of Scranton. And I 9 just want to give a big shout out and a 10 thank you to Joanne and the entire 11 organization for the good work that they do. 12 They're all volunteers. It's done strictly 13 as a volunteer basis. And what their 14 program does is it cuts down on the 15 population of feral cats within the 16 community in a safe and humane way. So I 17 want thank them for all their hard work and 18 I hope to be able to be at the ceremony for 19 the 100th anniversary. I remember as a kid 20 going up to see the elephant up at the zoo. 21 We did receive correspondence regarding 22 demolition of hazardous structures. Seven 23 structures that are under contract are 214 24 Wheeler Avenue, 608 Mineral Avenue, 224 25 58 Ferdinand Street, 326-328 Rear South Hyde 1 Park, 1303 Stafford, 1011 Cedar and 925 2 Slocum Street. This is $87,000 that's 3 allocated for the demolition of these seven 4 hazardous structures. And there's an 5 additional $150,000 allocated in the 2017 6 CDBG allotment. Obviously--and I've been to 7 a number of these properties, these are some 8 of the worst of the worst. There's 9 obviously a number of other properties in 10 the city that need to be demolished or 11 rehabbed as well. And Councilman Evans and 12 myself had some discussions this week and 13 we're going to continue to work on changing 14 the condemnation policy in the city and 15 hopefully try to provide some incentive to 16 have these properties rehabbed versus having 17 them torn down. Finally, I read in the 18 Scranton Times today or was it yesterday 19 about the county assessment. And as much as 20 this is quite common, I have to disagree 21 with many of the comments that are in this 22 article, particularly the comments of 23 Commissioner Cummings. Commissioner 24 Cummings states when she was 25-years-old 2559 and house hunting, real estate taxes didn't 1 cross her mind. Anyone who has purchased a 2 property or is looking to purchase a home in 3 the city or anywhere, real estate taxes 4 certainly have to cross your mind. Because 5 there are properties within the city that 6 are the exact same size in similar 7 neighborhoods that have--that pay different 8 taxes. And that's just not fair. For 9 instance, if a home for $100,000 has a tax 10 bill of $3,000 or a tax bill of $2,000, not 11 only is it an extra thousand dollars out of 12 your pocket every year, it may cost a 13 potential buyer, they may not be able to 14 obtain the loan because of that extra cost. 15 So for Commissioner Cummings to say when she 16 was looking for a home, the real estate 17 taxes didn't cross her mind, I don't see how 18 that could be the case. She goes onto say 19 that there's no fairness in property home 20 ownership. On this point, I completely 21 agree. Because Lackawanna County hasn't 22 done a reassessment in almost five decades, 23 there is no fairness in real estate taxes 24 throughout Lackawanna County. And 25 60 particularly, in Scranton. Looking 1 throughout the city, you could find homes on 2 the same block on the same size log with 3 very similar square footage in the same 4 condition paying up to a thousand dollars 5 difference in taxes, not in assessed value, 6 a thousand dollars difference in taxes. 7 There are homes in the city that pay as 8 little as $800 in tax a year. I know that's 9 hard to believe for most of you out there. 10 But there are people that pay as little as 11 $800. There are other homes that are large 12 homes that are much higher. And if you're 13 buying a more expensive larger property, it 14 should be taxed at a higher rate. But it 15 needs to be fair. And going 50 years 16 without a reassessment certainly highlights 17 that, you know, what we see with the appeals 18 that it's a race to the bottom. It's the 19 people who have the money that could afford 20 an attorney are filing appeals and getting 21 their taxes lowered while the average 22 people, working people and senior citizens 23 just continue to pay the bill because they 24 don't have the means or the knowledge of how 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 61 to 64 of 94 16 of 24 sheets61 to appeal their taxes. So, I would like to 1 appeal once again to the commissioners to 2 move forward with this reassessment. You 3 know, this article goes onto say that 4 Cummings fears a reassessment will lead to 5 tax increases for low income elderly 6 residents and force them out of their homes. 7 Commissioner Jerry Notariani rightly rebuts 8 that those are the residents that will 9 generally see their bills decline while it's 10 the affluent areas that will see their taxes 11 increase because of a reassessment. And he 12 goes onto say that the lack of a 13 reassessment in Scranton depresses property 14 values and continues to discourage economic 15 development in the city. This council 16 passed the tax abatement on new construction 17 that would give, you pay zero tax on new 18 construction for the first three years. And 19 I don't believe there's been one person 20 that's taken advantage of it yet. A big 21 part of it is that if you build a house 22 randomly, your tax bill is probably going to 23 be double of purchasing a house the same 24 size in the same neighborhood. That's not 25 62 fair. And that's part of the problem. 1 Again, I would just like to reiterate, I 2 hope the county comes out with their final 3 report. I know Chief of Staff Wallace is 4 continuing to do research on what it would 5 take to conduct a county wide reassessment. 6 It says he's expected to deliver his 7 findings to the commissioners within the 8 next two weeks. So, we'll certainly be 9 looking at those findings very closely. And 10 for the residents of Scranton, particularly 11 senior citizens and those who have lived in 12 a home for a very long time, you're probably 13 paying more than you should be. And there 14 are those particularly outside of the city 15 on the county tax that aren't paying their 16 fair share. And a reassessment is the only 17 way to set that straight. So I would hope 18 Commissioner Cummings would reconsider her 19 position. And I'd like to thank 20 Commissioner Notariani for his support. 21 That is all. Thank you. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Mr. 23 Evans? 24 MR. EVANS: Thank you. Okay, 2563 first's things first, I would like to make a 1 motion to send correspondence to the 2 business administrator requesting that he 3 draft legislation to create a special fees 4 account for revenue from the Smart Cities 5 Program. And that all revenue would be 6 directed into that account for the exclusive 7 use for the downtown and neighborhood 8 commercial districts for infrastructure 9 improvements and/or economic development 10 initiatives for those areas. Any use of the 11 funds shall require approval of both the 12 mayor and city council as well as input from 13 the stake holders of the identified target 14 areas. 15 MR. ROGAN: Second. 16 MR. WECHSLER: There's a motion on 17 the floor and a second. On the question? 18 All those in favor signify by saying aye? 19 MR. PERRY: Aye. 20 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 21 MR. EVANS: Aye. 22 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 23 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? The 24 ayes have it. So moved. 25 64 MR. EVANS: Thank you. I'd also 1 like to announce that, we had this at 2 council last year, but I wanted to bring it 3 to everyone's attention again, the City 4 Council Cup will be given to the fastest 5 female and male runner over a three race 6 road running series beginning tonight at the 7 Run Around Scranton that started at the 8 Terra Preta Restaurant in the 200 block of 9 Wyoming Avenue. The second week will be 10 running around the Run Around Scranton race 11 in July and July 20th tentatively scheduled 12 to leave and finish at Bar Pazzo in the 100 13 block of North Washington Avenue. And of 14 course, the final leg will be the second 15 annual Bob McGoff Memorial 5K on Sunday 16 August 27th 9 a.m. Prize money of $200 each 17 will be given to the top male and female 18 runners over those three races. The two 19 second place finishers each will receive a 20 $50 gift card from the Scranton Running 21 Company. The winners will receive their 22 prizes and awards immediately after the Bob 23 McGoff Memorial 5K. We all felt this was an 24 appropriate way for this city council and 2517 of 24 sheets Page 65 to 68 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM65 other future city council's to continue to 1 honor our colleague and friend, Bob McGoff. 2 Also, I'd like to personally thank Dunmore 3 Borough Council for again stepping up and 4 asking the Attorney General to review the 5 SSA sale and joining Scranton City Council 6 on the quest for information on the 7 transaction. As much as I am encouraged by 8 the solidarity shared by Scranton and 9 Dunmore Councils on this issue, I am equally 10 disturbed that the Mayor of Scranton has yet 11 to see the light of transparency and has not 12 yet joined in on this effort. Another issue 13 on the newspaper, I was disappointed to read 14 that the house known as the Castle in 15 Greenridge took another step towards 16 demolition. It is my personal feeling that 17 we should continue to do everything we can 18 to avoid that end result. I would prefer 19 that those resources that would have been 20 used for demolition of that house--and I 21 believe, they would be substantial, because 22 it's a large house well built, could be used 23 for other demolitions of properties in the 24 city that have been around for much, much 25 66 longer and on the list for much longer than 1 that one. And I'll touch on the 2 reassessment as well. Councilman Rogan did 3 an excellent job explaining the housing side 4 of it. And I don't want to comment so much 5 on the comments that were made. Because if 6 I did, it would take the rest of the night 7 to correct some of the things that were 8 said. So I'll take that on for another 9 time. But I will simply say that if you 10 want true tax fairness, if you want true tax 11 equity, there's only one way to achieve that 12 and that's through a complete county wide 13 reassessment. If you want to unleash the 14 economic growth in the City of Scranton and 15 maybe throughout the county, you will only 16 do that through a county wide reassessment. 17 And another point that I feel is important 18 that wasn't part of any article, property 19 tax reform also known as SB76 and 20 reassessment both can be achieved and are 21 not mutually exclusive of each other. In 22 fact, together they would be a powerful 23 remedy for property owners everywhere. And 24 finally, I am again asking for all the 2567 borough councils, township supervisors, 1 school district board members throughout 2 Lackawanna County to join the Scranton City 3 Council and the Jermyn Borough Council in 4 urging the Lackawanna County Commissioners 5 to finally get off the sidelines and endorse 6 the first county wide reassessment in nearly 7 50 years. That's all I have for tonight. 8 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Evans. 9 Mr. Gaughan? 10 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, thank you. Ms. 11 Davitt was here last week from North 12 Scranton with concerns about speeding on 13 Rockwell Avenue and Gilbert Street and we 14 have forwarded her concerns and requests for 15 additional signage to the DPW and to the 16 police department. So I'll update everyone 17 when we get information on that. A resident 18 did reach out to our office about M80's 19 being exploded in West Scranton near 20 Walgreen's over several evenings. Our 21 office did reach out and forwarded that 22 concern to the Chief of Police that will 23 hopefully handle that issue. I agree with 24 Mr. Evans on the Castle house demolition in 25 68 Greenridge. I think that the city should do 1 everything it can and first try to put that 2 in the hands of someone who will fix it up 3 and live there rather than demolish it and 4 let another vacant lot sit either empty for 5 a number of years. I would also like to 6 make a request that the city administration 7 put the condemnation and demolition list on 8 the city's website and update that list 9 monthly. I took a look at some other cities 10 in Pennsylvania and across the country and 11 they do this on a regular basis. I think it 12 would be helpful not only to city council, 13 but to the residents to be able to look at 14 that information and it would become a much 15 more transparent process. So I would ask if 16 we can make that request this week. Last 17 week, I mentioned asking Former Executive 18 Director Gene Barrett to come into a council 19 meeting. And I do think that we need Mr. 20 Barrett to come in and answer questions 21 asking if the proper oversight was provided 22 in relation to the approval of legal bills 23 and other expenditures in relation to the 24 sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority to 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 69 to 72 of 94 18 of 24 sheets69 Pennsylvania American Water. I'd like to 1 know his thought process behind why he 2 approved these bills. Some of them without 3 backup. What lawyers got hired. When they 4 got hired. Was a search done to get the 5 lowest rates or bids? Who hired the special 6 counsel to the city, Ned Abrahamsen? Mr. 7 Barrett can also shed some light of who 8 recommended the hiring of Buchanan, 9 Ingersoll and Rooney to the board since that 10 was not bid out. So I'd like to know how 11 they were chosen, who brought their name to 12 the sewer authority board. So I would like 13 to make a motion at this time that Scranton 14 City Council invite former Executive 15 Director Gene Barrett to a public caucus to 16 discuss how legal bills were paid, how law 17 firms and consultants were hired during the 18 Scranton Sewer Authority sale to 19 Pennsylvania American Water. 20 MR. EVANS: I'll second that. 21 MR. WECHSLER: There's a motion on 22 the floor and a second. On the question? 23 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question, 24 just to add to that, I'd like everybody to 25 70 remember that Mr. Barrett was the executive 1 director for a number of years. This body 2 votes to appoint the members of the Scranton 3 Sewer Authority Board. Those members of the 4 Scranton Sewer Authority Board appoint the 5 executive director. So I think it is within 6 our right to ask Mr. Barrett to come in and 7 answer these questions. 8 MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question, I 9 have no issue with asking Mr. Barrett in. 10 Any information, any light that he could 11 shed on it would be first hand. And I think 12 would be valuable if he does decide to come 13 in. 14 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor 15 signify by saying aye? 16 MR. PERRY: Aye. 17 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 18 MR. EVANS: Aye. 19 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 20 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? The 21 ayes have it. So moved. 22 MR. GAUGHAN: And that's all I have 23 until agenda items. Thank you. 24 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 2571 Gaughan. Just a few items. Last week we 1 heard from residents from the 1400 and 1500 2 block of South Irving Avenue. This evening, 3 we are going to try to find a remedy for 4 that solution. As we spoke about, the list 5 that's provided to us is a tentative paving 6 list. And as such, there's going to be 7 engineering done to determine the cost for 8 those streets that had been listed. So, 9 it's our goal as a council to include 10 Irving, those two blocks of Irving Avenue to 11 be reviewed for engineering purposes. From 12 listening to the description of the problems 13 there, it doesn't sound like that road 14 really falls into the classification of 15 these other streets that we're looking at in 16 terms of paving which really need to be 17 looked at more or less than just a mill and 18 a pave. So what we'd like to do is include 19 an engineering study for the 1400 and 1500 20 block of Irving Ave to determine the true 21 cost of what it would be to do a permanent 22 fix of that road. I don't believe a patch 23 job there or a quick mill and patch job is 24 suitable for what's been described to us in 25 72 terms of my visit there and also seen 1 pictures as provided by the residents. So 2 this is our attempt to see if we can get 3 some relief down the road for those 4 residents. One of the items, tonight we 5 heard about some problems up on Seymour 6 Avenue. I was at Conroy and Snook Street 7 this week. Same time of problem exists 8 there. There actually was an accident there 9 this week where somebody hit the open hole 10 resulting in some serious damage to the car. 11 I know it's not a solution, but I do think 12 we should have some temporary warning 13 stickers there. I did send some information 14 to DPW on my own this week. And I'll follow 15 up with this reading when Mr. Gallagher is 16 back in the office next week. We've also 17 been communicating with the city business 18 administrator in terms of getting an RFP out 19 for engineering work on Stafford and Meadow 20 Brook Creek. Mr. Bulzoni has gotten that 21 RFP to the purchasing office here for it to 22 be issued. There was some comments this 23 week about temporary repairs. So this 24 study, this request actually is going to be 2519 of 24 sheets Page 73 to 76 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM73 for the entire Meadow Brook area which also 1 stretches into Dunmore. The request is that 2 the--that entire area be looked at for 3 temporary repairs for anyone that may have 4 problems right now in that area. That would 5 include the Youngs and the Kennedys 6 properties. The RFP is intended to be able 7 to be used for matching grants that we are 8 required to do when the state comes in to do 9 the overall repair on that project. And 10 hopefully, we can get the study done so we 11 can get repairs done on the Young's 12 property, the Kennedy's property and also 13 anyone else who has problems along that 14 line. The goal is to get some temporary 15 repairs there. It's a dangerous situation. 16 And this is our attempt at the best way to 17 go to try and get some relief there for 18 those residents. Last evening, I attended a 19 re-dedication of the Colonel Frank Duffy 20 statute over at Steamtown Historic Site. 21 The members of the veterans group, 22 Rabiega-Gorgol Post, still owns the statue. 23 They are quite proud of that statute. And 24 right now, it's going to be on display at 25 74 Steamtown through 2018. Colonel Duffy was 1 an amazing man from the stories that we 2 hear. He actually worked for the D&LW 3 railroad. So he actually, for the first 4 time since April 1918, Colonel Duffy is home 5 in an area where he walked everyday until he 6 went over to France and was killed in war. 7 So I'm very proud of the work that I have 8 done with the VFW and also the work that the 9 VFW has done themselves maintaining their 10 interest in that statute and making sure 11 that it was taken care of in such a manner 12 that will be there for another 100 years for 13 people to enjoy and I congratulate them on 14 all their efforts. That's all I have at 15 this time. 16 MS. REED: 5B.

WECHSLER: At this time, I'll 19 entertain a motion that Item 5B be 20 introduced into its proper committee. 21 MR. ROGAN: So moved. 22 MR. EVANS: Second. 23 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 24 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 77 to 80 of 94 20 of 24 sheets77 I'm going to make a motion in a second that 1 we invite Mr. Patel into a public caucus. 2 And I realize that this is an unusual 3 request and probably an unusual motion to 4 make. But in light of the serious matters 5 that have recently taken place, the lack of 6 transparency, the stone-walling that's gone 7 on for the past six and a half months, I 8 think that every single appointment to this 9 board is of the utmost importance. I think 10 it's extremely important that this 11 legislative body find out what Mr. Patel's 12 views are on the Scranton Sewer Authority, 13 what he believes his responsibilities are as 14 a board member, is he in favor of having the 15 Auditor General come in to audit the 16 Scranton Sewer Authority transaction? Would 17 he be in favor of the Attorney General 18 coming in as Scranton and Dunmore Councils 19 have requested? We need to make sure that 20 this appointee to the Scranton Sewer 21 Authority Board is going to be an advocate 22 for the people, the ratepayers of Scranton 23 and Dunmore and not for Mayor Courtright. 24 Remember--and this is what causes my 25 78 concern, the Mayor actually at one point 1 said that he thought the board members of 2 the Scranton Sewer Authority Board were like 3 members of his cabinet. He wanted them to 4 share his vision. It causes me concern 5 because the Scranton Sewer Authority Board 6 should be independent and autonomous and 7 totally separate from our local government. 8 We need to make sure that Mr. Patel shares 9 the vision of independence for the rate 10 payers of the City of Scranton and Dunmore. 11 Mr. Patel's letter of interest is a little 12 light on details. I think we should 13 investigate this further. And I do think 14 that we should ask him to come to a caucus 15 and answer questions. So at this time, I 16 would like to make a motion that Scranton 17 City Council invite Mr. Patel into a public 18 caucus to find out what his views are on 19 Scranton Sewer Authority. 20 MR. WECHSLER: The motion dies for 21 lack of a second. All those in favor of 22 introduction signify by saying aye? 23 MR. PERRY: Aye. 24 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 2579 MR. EVANS: Aye. 1 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? 2 MR. GAUGHAN: No. 3 MR. WECHSLER: The ayes have it. So 4 moved.5 MS. REED: 5E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A 6 RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER 7 APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF 8 SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A 9 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE 10 CITY OF SCRANTON CLERICAL WORKERS AND LOCAL 11 LODGE NO. 2462 AFFILIATED WITH DISTRICT 1 OF 12 THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS 13 AND AEROSPACE WORKERS, AFL-CIO IN ACCORDANCE 14 WITH THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF A 15 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH AN 16 EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2016 AND 17 RATIFIED BY THE MEMBERSHIP. 18 MR. WECHSLER: At this time, I'll 19 entertain a motion that Item 5B be 20 introduced into its proper committee. 21 MR. ROGAN: So moved. 22 MR. EVANS: Second. 23 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 24 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question, 25 80 I'm still reviewing this memorandum of 1 understanding and the contract. But I do 2 think in light of the city possibly exiting 3 Act 47 in three years and us getting the 4 exit plan from PEL recently, that we need to 5 make sure that we do our due diligence and 6 make sure this contract is in the best 7 interest of the taxpayers and the city. So, 8 I would like to request a few items. I did 9 so in the caucus before the meeting tonight. 10 I do believe and my colleagues agree that we 11 should ask the Mayor and administration 12 officials to come into a caucus and explain 13 this memorandum of understanding to City 14 Council, how it fits within the three year 15 exit plan, how it benefits the city. And 16 again, I think it's important and especially 17 in light of the city's financially 18 distressed status. I'd also like to request 19 that had our recovery coordinator, the 20 Pennsylvania Economy League give us a 21 written response or attend the public caucus 22 and give the opinion on whether or not this 23 memorandum of understanding fits within a 3 24 year exit plan and the work force cost 2521 of 24 sheets Page 81 to 84 of 94 06/22/2017 01:56:45 PM81 containment provisions included in it. I'd 1 also like a cost benefit analysis from the 2 business administrator. The retiree health 3 care language is a little confusing. So I 4 think we need clarification on this. I'd 5 like to know how much this will cost the 6 city, if anything. And is this in line with 7 our three year exit plan and the work force 8 cost containment provisions. Concerning the 9 areas of job descriptions, it states that 10 modifications made during contract 11 negotiations. I'd like to get an opinion on 12 what these modifications were? It's 13 extremely difficult to have any opinion on 14 this without seeing each and every job 15 description as it applies to the needs of 16 city services. Concerning the pension 17 language in here on the surface, this option 18 is being presented for employees being 19 available to transfer into another pension 20 seems to place an additional burden on the 21 city if multiple individuals made the 22 transfer. It's not clearly defined what the 23 burden would be on the city. It mentions an 24 additional annual contribution of 25 82 $10,000--roughly $11,000. I'd like to know 1 exact total or is that per employee. And 2 again, I need more clarification on this and 3 more explanation. Concerning the retirement 4 severance, I'd like to see a value set to 5 this based on a potential number of 6 employees who are potentially going to 7 retire over the next four years. Section 6 8 regarding certifications; it says, the city 9 must provide existing housing inspectors 10 with materials, study guides and information 11 about the location, timing and details of 12 the certification test within 90 days of 13 ratification of this contract. I'd like 14 more information on that. Where do the 15 tests take place? How much do the tests 16 cost? Materials, study guides and other 17 things like that. So I would like to get 18 more information on how that process works. 19 That's all I have. Thank you. 20 MR. ROGAN: I also agree with some 21 of what Councilman Gaughan mentioned, 22 looking for additional information. I do 23 want to mention, on the face of this, this 24 looks to be a very good contract for the 2583 taxpayers, particularly on the salary side. 1 For 2016, there will be no pay increase for 2 clerical workers. 2017, no pay increase. 3 2018, there will be a $750 bonus. 2019 to 4 2020, a 2.5 percent pay increase. So on the 5 salary side, you can see these are very, 6 very, very small pay increases. And 7 actually, '16 and '17, there's no increase 8 whatsoever. I also do like that the pension 9 contributions for the members will increase. 10 It's not a very large increase, but there is 11 an increase of the members into their 12 pension. So actually, for years one and 13 two, these employees will actually be making 14 less money than they're making currently 15 because of the increased pension 16 contribution combined with no pay increase 17 for two years. That being said, there are a 18 number of other items in here I do have some 19 questions on that I wanted to investigate a 20 little bit further. But on the face of it, 21 it does look like it's a very fair contract. 22 And it should be a basis for starts of 23 conversations with the DPW for no pay 24 increases for the first few years of the 25 84 contract. As you know, I have a number of 1 other issues with that department. But as 2 far as this, it does look good on the 3 surface. But we'll be doing some more 4 investigation. 5 MR. EVANS: On the question, yeah, I 6 think we established the protocol of having 7 the administration come before us to explain 8 the MLU with the Police and Fire Department 9 contracts. And also, it involves the last 10 PEL in the past and make sure it's 11 consistent with the recovery plan. There 12 are some good things in here I like. And 13 there's also things in here that are missing 14 that I want to ask about because I think 15 they're very, very important, especially on 16 the pension side of it. So I think some 17 sort of public caucus can be very, very 18 helpful for everyone. 19 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor of 20 introduction signify by saying aye? 21 MR. PERRY: Aye. 22 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 23 MR. EVANS: Aye. 24 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 2506/22/2017 01:56:45 PM Page 85 to 88 of 94 22 of 24 sheets85 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? The 1 ayes have it. So moved. 2 MS. REED: 5F.

WECHSLER: On the question? 17 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 18 I appreciate Chief Graziano providing the 19 environmental information. I still will be 20 voting no against this for the reasons that 21 I stated last week. The cost analysis to 22 determine the impact on future operating and 23 capital budgets has not been done. And 24 according to the business administrator, 2587 will not be done. And I can't get over that 1 concern. Because I do not think that at 2 this time we should be adding additional 3 unknown maintenance costs to our budget. 4 Thank you.5 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor 6 signify by saying aye? 7 MR.

GAUGHAN: I'd like to make a 10 motion to amend Item 7C per the following: 11 Amend the tentative 2017 city paving list by 12 adding an additional section entitled South 13 Scranton 1400 and 1500 blocks of South 14 Irving Avenue which will then make it a 15 total of 25 streets on the list. 16 MR. ROGAN: Second. 17 MR. WECHSLER: There's a motion on 18 the floor and a second. On the question? 19 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes. On the question, 20 I'm very pleased to be able to make this 21 motion tonight. The residents of this area 22 who attended the meeting last week expressed 23 and have been expressing great concern about 24 the condition of these two blocks. I think 25 92 it's not only a public works issue. I think 1 it's a public safety issue. I have been up 2 in that area several times. And nobody 3 should have to live like that. There 4 basically is no road left. So I think that 5 this is a start to find out how much it 6 would cost to pave it and hopefully get 7 these two blocks on a paving list as soon as 8 possible. Thank you. 9 MR. WECHSLER: Yeah, I think the 10 important thing is is that we find out the 11 cost to do the proper repair of these two 12 blocks. The serious condition that they're 13 in requires something more than what we're 14 looking at under our paving program. So, we 15 will take a look at this and make a 16 commitment to get it completed. All those 17 in favor signify by saying aye? 18 MR. PERRY: Aye. 19 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 20 MR. EVANS: Aye. 21 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? The 23 ayes have it. So moved.
