Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou,Mr.Gaughan . JustIbelieve thatthezoning ordinance for housing isfournon-related people living in onestructure oronehouse. MR.GAUGHAN :Yeah,butthereis-- andthat'sbeingviolated ,Iguessallover1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 theplaceandthat'sthemajor,forwhatI tookawayfromthatmeeting ,thatwasthe majorissueinthatareawasthat,youknow, besides parking people arebuying single family homesandthenturning theminto student housing dormitories . MR.MCGOFF:Thathasbeenaddressed tomeandIhave,youknow,brought itup before.Itisaverydifficult thingto enforce asweallprobably knowfrom experience especially incollege housing you areneverquitesurewhoisstaying inany oneplaceandforhowlong,butcertainly it isanissuethatneedstobeaddressed and should beaddressed . Acouple ofthings that--alotof things actually .Firstofall,onthe2013 auditthatwasbrought up,thecityhad received anotice fromDCEDthattheyhave notreceived the2013municipal auditand financial report thatwasdueApril1oris dueApril1,'14,andwhattheyaresaying isthatifthat'snotreceived thenthe municipality Scranton willnotincompliance withtheirreporting requirements andwould1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 beineligible foranyDCEDfunding ,sothat thereispressure beingplaced onthecity andtheauditor tohavethiscomplete . Iknowthisisaconcern ,it'sbeen anongoing concern formanypeople around andhopefully ,youknow,thisisan indication thatthestateandothers are interested inthisbeingdonenow,thatthis needstobecompleted ,andcertainly wedo notwanttoloseanysource ofthefunding especially through DCEDandhopefully this wouldexpedite thecompletion oftheaudit whichhasbeenmentioned isseverely overdue . Asfarasaforensic audit,Ihave spoketoaperson whodoesforensic audits formunicipalities andtheonethingthat wassaidtomeisthat,number one,forensic audits aredonewhenthereisanindication ofmalfeasance ,andwhattheyneed--they arenot--somebody isnotgoingtodoan auditovera30-yearperiod.Whatthey woulddowouldbeaforensic auditwouldbe foraspecific itemofmalfeasance ,a smoking gun,ifyouwill.Theyneedtohave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 something thatsays,"Here'ssomething that wasdonewrongoveraspecific period of time,"notjust,"Let'sgolookandseeif wecanfindsomebody something ." Andtheotherthingisthatforensic audits tendtobecostlyandifthecity weretotryand,youknow,conduct a forensic audititwouldbecostly tothe citytodothatforevenashortperiod of time,sowhileitmaysoundlikeagoodidea it'sreally notnecessarily agreat possibility thatthiswouldbedonebythe city.Perhaps thestateorsomeone elsemay comeinanddoit,butasfarasthecity conducting aforensic auditIdon'tseethat happening merely because ofthefactthatat thispointintimethereisnotanysmoking gunthatpoints toaspecific item,andplus wedonothavethefunding todothat. Somebody brought upaboutthe financial advisor doingnothing orit's costing ,everymayorgoingbackasfarasI knowhashadafinancial advisor .Thisis notsomething new.Ibelieve almost every municipality hasafinancial advisor and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 theyareworking atwhattheyareaskedto do,youknow,advise thecityoncertain financial matters including ,andI'llgo downtoincluding thesaleorthe monetization oftheparking assets. Somebody said,youknow,thatthere isnointerest ,thefactwasthatwhenthe RFQ'swentouttherewere15different groups thatresponded .That'sbeennarrowed downnowwiththeRFPthatwasbeingsent outIbelieve tofive--ofthosefiveor sixofthosepeople thatwereinterested ,so thereisinterest inthegarages . Theproblem thatmaybeisbeing brought upisthatmostofthebidsormost ofthepeople interested areinterested in boththeparking garages andtheparking meters,sothattheycouldconsolidate both. Now,areweawareofthat?Yes.Beenaware ofthatforanumber ofyearsthatthese things wouldprobably beunited iftherewas tobeasaleoralease.Simply by including themeters itincrease sthevalue ofthesaleorleaseandthat'swhatweare looking at.That'swhattheyarelooking1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 at.I'msureifthereisawayofkeeping theparking meters through thisprocess the citywouldbeinterested ,butgoingback again,thisisnotsomething that'scome before council yet.Wedonothaveanything tolookat.Weneed,youknow,ifthereis goingtobeasaleoraleasethenitwould comebefore usandthenwecouldvoteyesor notothat,butasfarasvoting onanRFP, youknow,that'snotwhatweareheretodo. Sothattakescareofatleastmythoughts ontheparking situation . AsfarasPELisconcerned ,yes, theyhavebeenhereforawhile.Mr.Cross hasnotbeenhere,again,Iwouldstatefor theentire extent ofthis,sotoblame Mr.Crossfortheentire 22yearsis inaccurate .I'mnotsureexactly howmany yearsMr.Crosshasbeeninvolved ,Iknow it'satleastten,butjustsoweare straight onthat. Andparking signs,yes--orstop sign,yes,thestopsignsareinterrible condition throughout thecity.Throughout thecityyoucanfindsignsthatarebarely1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 I'llsayvisible asstopsignasfarasthe colorisconcerned .Oneoftheproblems is thatthepeople thatareresponsible for taking careofthesignsarenowpicking up refuse andrecyclables .Theyhavebeen taking offthoseduties because ofthe manpower issueatDPW. Also,therepainting ofthesignsor replacing ofthesignsiscostly.Youknow, itcostsmoneytodothatandinthebudget yes,istheremoneytodothat,butit's something thatbecomes ,again,anissueof manpower andmoneyatDPW.So,yes,dowe needthosesigns,youknow,redone.Please, theywill--itwillbeaddressed .Ithas beenaddressed withDPWandhopefully allof thoseproblems ,thesignproblems ,canbe takencareof. Nobody'srighttospeakhasbeen violated bycouncil .Everyone has-- anyone,citizens oftheCityofScranton or people withaninterest intheCityof Scranton areallowed tocometothepodium andspeaktocouncil .Nowheredoesitsay youhavetherighttobeontelevision ,and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 ifthat'swhypeople cometospeakbecause theywanttobeseenontelevision thenthey should gettheirowntelevision show. That'sludicrous tosaythat,youknow,you havearighttobeontelevision andweare notgoingtopursue thatmatter inanyway andifsomeone feelsthatthat'swhatwe should dotheyareentitled tothatopinion , butwearenotgoingtoaddress thatissue beyond tonight . AsfarastheAuditor General,I knowI'mgoinglonghere,buttheAuditor General whenhewashereinScranton abouta weekagodidspeakabouttheideaof receivership fortheCityofScranton and whathesaidwasthatreceivership isnota goodidea.Hesaidwhatreceivership does istakepoweroutofthehandsofthepeople andplaceitinthehandsofthereceiver andifthereceiver doesn'tlikewhateither theadministration orthecouncil isdoing theycansimply supercede thepowerofthe cityanddowhatever theywantandthat couldberaising yourtaxes,youknow,100 percent .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 Theydon'tcare.Theyare--the jobofthereceiver wouldsimply betoput thecityorthemunicipality ,youknow,back ontrackfor,youknow,backonabalanced budget.Theydon'tcarehowtheydoit. Theyarenotgoingtolookforotherwaysto bringthatabout.Thereceiver willsimply lookatthesimplest answer andthatwould beraising realestate taxesorothertaxes. SotheAuditor General,whilehesays Scranton maybeontheroadtothatdoesn't believe thatit'sagoodideanordomostof --Iwouldsayallofthemembers ofthe council donotbelieve it'sagoodideaas domanyoftheadvisors thatwehavetothe city,including PELandMr.Amoroso . I'llspeaknowtotheideaof emergency certificates .Yes,council has saidthatthisisnotsomething thatweare comfortable with,withwhichweare comfortable .Ithashappened I'llsayfar toooftenoverthemonths theyhavebeen here.Iwillattribute thattoanew administration ,anewlawdepartment ,and theattempt asweareseeing tonight to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 rectify problems overthepast.Not problems ,notsituation sthatwerecreated byeither thiscouncil orthis administration .Someoftheseareproblems astonight goesbacktowhat1987?AndsoI applaud --I'msorry,Ihaveaproblem with myeye.Whatwearetrying todoisjust rectify someproblems thatexisted anda number ofthesethings havecomeunder emergency certificates .Dowelikeit,no, butwedoneedtodealwithsomeofthese problems andwewillaccording toour abilities . Lasttwothings hopefully .The stormwaterproblem ,yes,itwassomething thatwasbrought up,PELbrought uptheidea ofaStormWaterAuthority .Thisisnot something thatisbeingdone--the authority isanideathat's,youknow,being proposedbyPEL,buttheseparation ofthe stormwatersituation andthecompliance is compliance withstateandfederal regulations .Thesearethings thatare beingaskedofusortoldthatweneedtodo byDEP.Weneedtoseparate thesystems,we1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 needtoimprove thesystems ,andbe compliant withregulations .Thisisgoing tocausemoney.Andifthecitycan'tput thisinthehandsofanAuthority thenit becomes theAuthority 'sresponsibility to takecareofthosecostsandnotthecity. Someone mayagreewiththis,butitis something thatweneedtodobylawandwe willattempt tofindthose--Idon'twant toseeconvenient ,butthebestwayfor everyone tobringthisabout. Andthelastthing,somebody brought upMr.Loscombe andhispension ,thatwasa situation thatwasdetermined ,thatwas finalizedbythecourts orbyanarbitrator andthat'snotsomething thatwasdecided by anyoneperson oranygroup.Wasit something thatwasunfortunate ,maybe,but itwasnotcouncil ,itwasnotthismayoror thisadministration ,itwasadecision made bytheCourtorthrough ahearing ,andI thinkI'mdone. MR.GAUGHAN :CouldImakeone additional comment -- MR.MCGOFF:Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 MR.GAUGHAN --onsomething you said?Thefadedstreets signs,Iagreeit isamajorproblem .Everyneighborhood meeting Ihavegonetointhepastyearand ahalfithascomeup.Ibelieve underthe Connors 'administration theyreceived avery largegranttoreplace averylargeamount offadedstreet signssoIthinkmaybewe should askthecitytoinvestigate andsee ifthereareanyavailable grants outthere fromthestatesothatwecangetthatdone. Thankyou. MR.EVANS:Yeah,aquickfollow-up tooneofthespeakers andIthinkPresident McGoff mentioned toisthefadedstopsigns.

Itwasjustrecently announced that thecitycouncil meeting thatyouintend to makechangestothepolice ordinance to mirror theothercityunions benefits .This action wasnotbargained between thecity andtheFOPduring ourrecent contract extension .TheFOPisasking citycouncil toproceed withcaution whenmaking any changes tothepolice pension benefit without negotiating thetermswiththeFOP. Weareunsure ifyouareawareof the1984Pennsylvania Supreme Courtdecision whichaddresses pension benefits unilaterally beingchanged afteranemployee ishired.Thisaction isstrictly prohibited andwillcauselitigation if changes areimplemented bythecity.

PaulHelring .UnionPresident ." I'djustliketosayafterreading thatletter thatthepolice unionshould firstunderstand howgovernment works.In Mr.Helring 'sletter heaskedcouncil to proceed withcaution whenmaking anychanges tothepolice pension benefit without negotiating thetermsfirstwiththeFOP. First,council doesnotnegotiate contracts .Thatresponsibility ,asweall knowafterthepastfewmonths,lieswith themayor. Second,I'dliketoclarify that it'snotcouncil 'saction thatwouldtrigger litigation .Themayorhastheoption to vetothislegislation ifhechoosesto.It wouldonlybechallengeable ifthemayor implemented it.Theexecutive isthebranch ofgovernment thatexecutes thelegislation . Mr.Helring should becognizant muchthese factsbefore heaskscouncil toproceed with caution ,andjusttobeclear,council can andshould passthislegislation . Mr.Helring inhisletter tocouncil1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 alsothreatenslitigation ifthis legislation ispassed which,again,I'll pointoutsimply corrects aclerical error. I'mdisgusted andoutraged thatthepolice unionhasdecided thisisthecourse of action theyplanontaking.Theymustnot understand thatdirefinancial situation the cityisinandthecondition oftheir pension whichisclearly onlifesupport . Manypeople Ihavetalked tofind thisrecent newsunbelievable ,buttobe honest,Iexpected it.MayorCourtright has giveneveryindication during hisfirstyear andhalfinoffice thathewillmeetthe demands ofthepolice andfireunions atany cost.Weneedtobeclearonwho's responsible forallowing thepolice unionto thinktheycandothings likethis. Forthepast14months Mayor Courtright laidoutthewelcome matinfront ofhisoffice.Let'sremember howanxious MayorCourtright wastorenegotiate the police andfirecontracts inadvance ofthe revised recovery planandprovide them protection until2021.Werarelyeverhear1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 directly fromthemayoronmostissueunless itdealswiththeunions.

MayorCourtright gaveawaythestoreandthe shelves atthispointareempty.Theonly thingwehaveleftistobegthepolice unionnottobankrupt thepensions and, therefore ,thecityandif27employees are allowed toretire earlybefore age55my fearisthat'sexactly whatwillhappen. Thedelusion andgreedthatis involved hereisbothastounding and disgusting .Government should existto servethepeople.InScranton itseemsas ifgovernment exists toemployee people and paythemmoneyandbenefits itcannolonger1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 afford.Thankyou.

And,also,Iwouldalsoliketo pointoutthatI'msureinthenewcontract ifthesepeople areeligible toretire the newhealth benefit doesnotkickin.It's veryclearthatthehealth benefit doesnot1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 kickinuntil25yearsofservice and55 yearsoldsoI'mnotsureifthese-- somehowthishappened thattheretirees wouldbeeligible forhealth careuntilthey are55.

Really?Icommented lastweekthat wehaveagovernment thatappears tobemore employee -centric thancitizen -centric .This latest situation hasdonenothing but enhance thatperception .That'sallIhave.
