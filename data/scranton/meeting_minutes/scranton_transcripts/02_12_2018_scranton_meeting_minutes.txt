(THE FOLLOWING SPEAKERS GAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS : JOAN HODOWANITZ . LOUIS MARANGO . LEE MORGAN. RON ELLMAN. MARIE SCHUMACHER . DAVE DOBRZYN . CHRIS BEDNAR.) MR. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I have a few brief comments to make. I'll be brief and then I'll save everything else for agenda items. On January 29, I made a request for a crosswalk to be installed on Olive Street and that was for the runners to get to the Heritage trail. This week I'm going to be having a phone interview with one of the guys from Lackawanna Heritage Valley trail, they have taken over some of the responsibilities of the crosswalks and we will get together and we are going to make sure that we get an additional crosswalk installed for the runners that actually do some parking or come from across Olive Street to there because I know there has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 been some issues, and the last thing we want is someone that's going down there for some recreation to run and get hit with a car, so I am going to be speaking with someone from the LHVT this week and see if he can get that all squared away. Also, I just want to -- and it's very hard to single out one thing that the Scranton Police does because so many of them do so many things on a daily basis it's almost, you know, dare I say insulting to bring one thing out and thank them for it because they do so many things well, but in this particular case I just wanted to throw a big thank you and a job well done to the Scranton Police Department yesterday for a shot fired call down in Pittston Avenue. It was a very dangerous situation . They had streets for blocks and blocks closed off going both on Pittston Avenue and then on other side of the streets in South Side. The situation was resolved quickly and without any officers using a weapon and as peacefully as absolutely could be done. I know the citizens in that area were very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 concerned . I have family that live down there, like most of us do, and it was a very scary situation for a brief period of time and the Scranton Police and some other police departments did a fantastic job and that's just one of the many things that they do well and it's a privilege to have them in our city and they really do a great job protecting us. And, finally , before I wrap up, I just wanted to send a big congratulations to Adam Rippon, I know most of you guys watch the Olympics . You know, I was home texting my family back and forth. My mom is in Florida this week and, you know, we are all over but we all come together for the Olympics like a lot of the families do and it was nice to see his performance last night. It was fantastic and I know his community and as we and his family must be very proud of him, he did a great job. And that's all I have and I will reserve everything else for agenda items. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you. Really the only comment I have is in relation to the Girdo's complaint last week about the situation on Meadow and Birch street. Myself and Mr. Gaughan went up and talked with the Girdos yesterday , and the only way to describe the situation is just unacceptable . The main issues I have with it is the the fact that PA American Water only give them a two-day notification and I think the scope of the project required a lot more communication between PA American Water and the neighborhood . Also, you know, the notification they did give was like a flyer that you would get if they were cutting up your street or, you know, putting in a new water main on your street which, although , the inconvenience is significantly more minor than what they are actually dealing with. And another issue I have with it is also, you know, how does the city allow this to happen? So one of the things I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 like to request is that we put a request in for the permits that were issued for this project and could we also see if there is a policy in place that would require work sites of this magnitude to be inspected during the course of the work? And that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. First of all, I would like to echo Councilman Perry's remarks . My real estate is on the corner of Pittston and Hickory Street in the corner block of Pittson Avenue, so I was pretty much at ground zero what was happening yesterday and we were very lucky to have as a professional police department as we have. They're exceptional . I don't think we all appreciate them as much as we should and I just wanted to make that comment . I really do appreciate what they do on a daily basis and put their lives at risk and yesterday was a perfect example . Finally , one brief comment , I want to make sure everybody knows that the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 of the revised idea sessions will be next Thursday February 22 at 6 p.m. in council chambers . Scranton City Council will be the host. Councilman Gaughan and myself will be the cochairs of that particular session . The subject for the session will be small business retention and recruitment , what can we do better? And, by the way, when I say "we" I mean a collective "we". The city council , this administration , the business community , the small business observer , the citizens and the consumer , we all have a stake in trying to grow our small business community so what ideas do you have that will make the environment better for small business owners please bring them, because I previously explained the format is quite simple, the first 30 minutes or so the meeting will be dedicated to drawing out ideas on what we can actually do better and the final 30 minutes or so will be to put those ideas into six workable and doable ideas that we as a council and the city and the community get behind and make happen, so it will be six ideas in 60 minutes . So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 would urge anyone who has an idea on the subject to attend and participate . I remind everybody , everyone that this is not an idea session , it's not a complaint session , so come prepared for positive a brainstorming session and leave your complaints at the door. That's all I have tonight . Thanks. MR. ROGAN: Thanks, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I did ask had caucus tonight for an update on the issue we are having in the 700 block of Pittston Avenue. Several residents have complained about a property there, a storefront property , so we are continuing to reach out to the DPW and Licensing and Inspections there. The 1300 block of Brook Street, I continue to receive complaints on East Mountain about blight up there and have been talking for quite some time with a gentleman who is very knowledgeable about the situation and what has really gone on there in the past few decades . So, Mrs. Reed, if we could get in contact with the DPW again I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 can -- I failed to mention this in the caucus, but I can give you his information . Hopefully someone from the DPW will get in touch with them. Mrs. Schumacher brought up the exit plan recommendations . I have read those. They are not something that I think should sit on a shelf and gather dust because I think they are important , but if you remember during the 2018 budget discuss ions I asked the administration for an update on each one of those recommendations and what the status was and I haven't received that yet, Mrs. Reed, so if we can send a letter asking for an update on each recommendation I would appreciate that because I do think it is important . Also, Mrs. Schumacher , you asked about last week I believe about or the week before about storm basins and how many storm basins are in the city and how many storm drains, the city planner replied that he doesn't think anyone has a real handle on that number. The latest information that the city received from Pennsylvania American 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Water Company was 1,491 storm inlets, however , many of these drains -- many of these drains that are combined sewer system and would remain the responsibility of the water company . The database also lists quite a few inlets that are unknown so some of them are most likely a city responsibility , and Mr. King reported that in the very near future the city is proposing to issue an RFP for mapping services to find out and he lists a whole paragraph of regulations here so I can give that to you, if you would like. The other request that I made in past week was regarding an article that was in the newspaper February 2 concerning the Scranton Civil Service Commissions postponement of a fire department promotional test, so I had a few questions about that. We sent a letter to Jeff Mackey, who was the chairman of the Civil Service Commission . I would like him to explain the current process for the dissemination of information to union members regarding civil service tests. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 would like to know how that process has been handled in the past. I would like to know the list of individuals other than the deputy fire chief who had access to the distribution of the testing material information . I'd also ask for a copy of all e-mails between the current Scranton Civil Service Commission members and city employees and then an explanation on the process for selecting test books. Also, in looking at that information and becoming curious about the Civil Service Commission I asked for a copy of the rules and regulations . Mrs. Reed was looking for that and in that process we found that the last copy we received is dated May 25, 1999, so we did ask the Civil Service Commission for a complete set of rules and classifications that governed their decisions and that those would be updated so I would appreciate that. As Councilman Donahue mentioned , he and I met with some of the neighbors on Meadow Avenue who were here last week and who have been effected by the American water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 drilling project , and to say that their lives have been turned upside down because of that project is a complete understatement . As I mentioned last week and it was confirmed in our meeting yesterday , neither the water company nor the city in my opinion did their due diligence in sitting down with these families and explaining the major inconvenience they would be facing for months due to this project . And in conversations with them yesterday and last week it was passed off to them as it would be another run of the mill water line replacement project that we often see throughout the city. It turns out, after being on the property that heavy equipment , drills among other things, rattle their homes from 7:00 in the morning until 7:00 at night with constant vibration and extremely loud noise that makes living conditions simply unbearable and, quite frankly , unbelievable . Not to mention the fact that there are quite a few elderly people in this vicinity who are homebound and already had trouble 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 getting out of their houses. The quality of the life at these neighbors ' homes has been diminished so greatly that I really don't know how they are able to live there at this point. Does this project need to be completed ? Yes, there is no question . Did the city and water company consider the lives of these people who this project would be effecting ? In my opinion absolutely not. And the most concerning part of the visit yesterday was the fact that many of the safety issues that Mrs. Garigo pointed out, some of the holes that had opened up in the back yard and in other places that were unsafe were only addressed with fencing and other things once she had complained . So thankfully there is somebody that is watching what's going on there. I would urge, as Mr. Donahue mentioned , that the city and the water company make sure that this work is being done safely and with the best interest of the neighbor s in mind and at least have the common courtesy not to drop off a one-page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 sheet of paper that makes it look like this is a run of the mill project when it, in fact, is not. Finally , I would just like to take a minute and respond to a statement that Mayor Courtright put out the other day in response to the Attorney General 's limited review of of the Scranton Sewer Authority deal and the professional services . The mayor said that he and his administration were adamant from the very beginning that everything was done above board. However , critics and a lone council member, who I'm assuming they are referring to me, were adamant on making it look like things were done improperly . First of all, let me be very clear that the mayor and his administration did more than enough on their own in the past year to make it look like things were done improperly . Let's not forget, and this wasn't included in the mayor's statement , the many months of stonewalling that this council and the public experience d at the hands of the mayor and the Scranton Sewer Authority . They continuously evaded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 questions and stubbornly withheld public information . One of the mayor's biggest campaign contributors and a chairman of his campaign , who also happened to be special counsel to the deal to the tune of $200,000 via a verbal agreement , not written contract , went even as far as suing me for slander , defamation and liable when I simply requested backup documentation detailing the work that he did. And keep in mind, I had been respectfully requesting this for months. The lack of transparency , coupled with a lawsuit , with the public outcry for answers let this council , not just the lone critic, all four members up here, all five of us, along with all five of Dunmore 's councilmen and Mayor Tim Burke, to request that Mayor Courtright and the Scranton Sewer Authority board invite the Auditor General in to provide a complete and full review of the sale. The Sewer Authority board, Mayor Courtright 's appointees , voted against it not once, but twice. That's certainly not a great way to instill any confidence from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 this legislative body or Dunmore or the current mayor of Dunmore , Tim Burke, and the people of Scranton to let us know that this deal was, in fact, done above board. Also, let's keep in mind the Auditor General, his statements in May of 2017 he said, and I quote, "While the Scranton Sewer deal is done, it is possible the results of our review could serve as example for other Pennsylvania municipalities should they decide to privatize their utilities ." As recently as the January 8, 2018, the Auditor General said, and I quote, After five years the number one consistent request that I receive and am legally barred from conducting is to audit municipal authorities . He sent a letter to all state legislators encouraging their support for Senate Bill 597, which this council also sent a letter, past a motion supporting , which would allow the Department of the Auditor General to audit municipal authorities closing a major gap in accountability and transparency in municipal water, parking and sewer authorities . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 The Auditor General goes onto say that, "The lack of the state review of the authorities that manage billions of dollars and provide critical services such as water supply, does a great disservice to all Pennsylvania ns. When the Philadelphia Parking Authority and Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority responded to public pressure to allow my team in we uncovered wide ranging problems that lead to two dramatic reforms at both entities . By authorizing my department to conduct financial and performance audits of various municipal authorities , the Bill would give my qualified auditors the ability to dig deep so we can recommend changes that could possibly cut costs and potentially reduce the need for the authorities to increase fees for the residents they serve." And he finally noted that the first authority where he would send his team would be the Scranton Sewer Authority . I would like to remind Mayor Courtright that asking questions , requesting information on one of the largest and most complex deals that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 involved privatizing a utility in Pennsylvania is not being a critic, or it's not impeding progress it's called doing my job. Criticism , asking questions , debating , dissenting , these are necessary for any functioning democracy . One of city council 's many roles, which the mayor should understand since he was a council man for many years, is to be able to freely and independently exercise it's legislative oversight . After all, we work for the people to ensure that their money is being spent responsibly not for campaign donors or special interest s. I appreciate the Attorney General 's review of professional services , but it was, as noted in the letter, limited in it's scope. The office did not conduct a full audit of the authority . Why has Mayor Courtright's -- why has Mayor Courtright along with his appoint ees to the Sewer Authority board refused to invite the Auditor General in for a full complete audit of the authority ? If the mayor is so adamant that everything was done above board then why not ask the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Auditor General to come in and audit the Aauthority ? Again, I ask why not, Mr. Mayor? I would ask him again to invite the Auditor General in and let's put this thing to bed once and for all. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . I only have one comment tonight and it was already mentioned by Councilman Perry and Councilman Evans, I do want to thank our police department . I don't think they get enough credit a lot of times for risking their lives. It was a very scary situation in South Scranton the other day and luckily it was a happy resolution , the individual was apprehended without anyone being seriously hurt so I want to thank them for all of of their professional hard work to keep the residents of Scranton safe, and that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
