MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY REGULAR MEETING HELD JUNE 1, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MS. SCHUSTER : I have an announcement . The Scranton Notre Dame Club is going to be holding a park cleanup at Crowley Park on July 16th from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. The park is located at the end of North Washington Avenue in Green Ridge. And it's named after Jim Crowley , one of the four horsemen of Notre Dame from the 1924 team. Any help will be needed. That is all. MR. KING: I believe that East Mountain Neighbor Association will be doing a movie night I believe on Saturday evening , July 16th, 6 p.m., is it -- 6:30 -- 8:30, excuse me, at Robinson Park on East Mountain .

CITIZENS PARTICIPATIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Before we start with citizens participation tonight , I would just like to remind the speakers when they're addressing Council to please be respectful of everyone in the audience and also those at home. And a reminder that the Council rules state that no person including members of Council shall use their time during Citizens Participation to personally insult or attack any individual , name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs, discriminatory remarks based on race, color, religion , national origin, ancestry or place of birth, sex, gender, identity , sexual orientation , disability , marital status or age or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted . First on the list tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : John Hodowanitz , Scranton . I'll try to behave myself. I have to take objection to some of the statement s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that Mayor Cognetti made this evening with regard to her explanation of why there is a limited access to City Hall. I believe she made the comment to the effect that although we can't roam through the building anymore, we should call for an appointment or someone will come down and meet with us on the first floor. She appointed me to the firefighters ' pension board back in February . And it came to my attention as a member of that board that there is a systemic problem with pensions . And I told the board that I wanted to talk to the Mayor about it because basically she's the one who should ensure that the problem is fixed. So several weeks ago I started calling her office number because if you go downstairs on the door it says Mayor's Office, floor 101. So I've been calling . No one would pick up. I don't like to leave voice message s so I just assumed , well, you know, they're out of the office. They're on vacation . They're at lunch. They're in the lavatory , whatever . After several days of doing that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 said, well, I better leave a voice message . Maybe there is some kind of issue. Maybe they're all sick with COVID. I left voice messages for several days. Finally last week someone called me back, somebody named Pete if my memory serves. And I said I need an appointment to speak with the Mayor. And he said why. And I told him why. And he said okay. So tonight she walks in. No one's called me back for an appointment . And I said to her, you owe me an appointment . She had no idea I had been calling . So I ask you, is the system working that you could call for an appointment ? Now, maybe she'll fix it for the future. Maybe that is all water under the dam. But I'm telling you if there is going to be limited access to the building , then there needs to be a system that works that citizens can get the service s and the assistance that they need. Well, why are we paying taxes? Now next thing, what's the status of the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 they are still under negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, that's a winner. We're day 193 of the downhill side of the year, 53 percent of the year is toast. And we're going to turn around twice. You're going to be on your August vacation and then you're going to be into the budget process . It's going to be very interesting if you are trying to plan wages and salaries for 2023 when you don't have a contract . Also, you only have two more sessions before your August recess. And I have seen no legislation for the contract for the special labor Council . MR. DONAHUE : That was received today and will appear on our agenda next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, good. I've been looking forward to seeing the Controller 's report of how much more money we have to pay Mr. Ufberg's association or his business . And any word on when we're going to get clarification on the payroll preparation tax issues? MR. DONAHUE : I believe a meeting has been scheduled . That's what was passed to us with parties to the letter that was sent to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 us. MS. HODOWANITZ : We don't know when information might be forthcoming . MR. DONAHUE : I believe there will be information forward ed to us once that meeting occurs. MS. HODOWANITZ : Hopefully it will be before the end of July. And are we still on track for the month of July for something to be done about the sound system in here? MR. DONAHUE : Unfortunate ly because of supply chain issues we are not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. Let's see. Oh, and I saw a document from the Open Government on the various section s of the City. Are we going to break out the downtown area from the Hill Section or South Scranton because they didn't do it this time around. MR. DONAHUE : So I believe they are trying to do that. I think the reasoning behind that it's combined is the same inspector is assigned to both the Hill Section and Center City. That is the reasoning . But they are trying to figure out a way to break it out in the system.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . Councilman Donahue , thank you for mentioning Patrolman Wilding . I was going to do it myself. As you said, it's been seven years today. That's why I'm wearing this shirt in memory of him. I've been waiting for the Mayor -- for the government to sign the legislation . I talk to the Mayor and the Mayor said he's probably just going to let it pass through . I know the family was hoping he would sign it today because it was the anniversary . I guess it wasn't done. I wasn't really going to come here tonight . But I witnessed a pit bull attack in the City today. I have been talking about this for 17 years now when my dog got attacked two blocks from my house by two pit bulls that lived at the end of my block. And thank God the owners came running or my dog would have been killed that night. I was driving through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the City today on Capouse Avenue. And I saw this woman was holding what looked like what would be a Chihuahua in her arms. And this pit bull was jumping on her. Thank God, two people I guess were the owners came and got the dog or that dog would have been killed. God knows what would have happened to that woman. Like I said, I've been talking about this for 17 years. I talked to the Mayor before. And she says, well, we do have legislation but it's not strong enough. So we got to come up with something stronger . I talked about this for, like I said, 17 years. In Pittsburgh , you could look it up. They have a law if you have a dog that's deemed dangerous you have to have a 10 foot high fence and you have to have insurance on the dog. In Potsville , they have an aggressive dog ordinance . The owner's fined for one attack. After three attacks , the dog has to be put to sleep. In Prince George's Maryland , that's a different state so maybe they could make different laws. Pit bulls are banned. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 can't own a pit bull in that county. If your -- you could be arrested if your (inaudible ) carry six months in prison and a thousand dollars fine. So we need something in this City with more teeth in this or these attacks are going to keep happening . And it was just lucky that woman wasn't serious ly injured today. I stopped . I got out. I asked her if she was okay. She was visibly shaken, but she was okay. I said you should call the police. She said, no, I don't want to call them. There might be repercussions . So I went around the block and I saw where the people lived. They were standing on the porch with the dog. But I looked. I didn't want to stop my car there. They'd know something obvious was going on. I did not see an address on the house but I did across the street. I got the address of the house right across the street. So the Chief took a picture of it. I wrote it down. Hopefully he sent somebody over there to give them a warning . That's an apartment building . I'm not sure -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 like a couple next to each other. I'm not sure which one they live in. But hopefully the officer will go and knock on their doors because when my dog was attacked 17 years ago a police officer came and told him where the dogs came from. He said, yeah, I know the house. But nothing was done then. But the people did move out shortly after of that. And I know there were drugs being used in that house and I think maybe even being sold. Like I said, they moved shortly after that incident . That's all I have to say on that. But I do hope Council looks this over again, makes stiffer laws. Next thing, I spoke to Frank last week about my corner. And he said they do plan on coming to fix that. He said he would talk to them again. So I'm just wondering if he heard something . MR. DONAHUE : He was able to confirm that it is on the list for DPW to go out for work. I can't tell you exactly when, but it is on. That's the update we got. MR. SPINDLER : I hate to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 negative , but they said they would be there before the cold hit last winter, which didn't happen. Now we're turning the corner on summer, you know -- MR. DONAHUE : We'll see if we could get a better estimate . But that is just in the notes that Frank gave me that is what they -- MR. SPINDLER : As Joan said, you know, after a couple more weeks you're going to be off for the month of August. All right. If I don't see you the next few weeks, as the song says, I'll see you in September . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have for the residents of this City is that I recently had an opportunity to do an interview on ECTV that is on YouTube talking about the Home Rule Charter . I don't know how many more of these ECTV slots I'm going to do. But, you know, I just think it's time to really start discussing a lot of issues. You know, like we -- like I talked the other day about, you know, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 things in 3-A, B, C, you know, the minutes , whatever , there needs to be a lot more explanation on what's taking place and what these reports are, what was said, what was asked because the residents should be well-informed about what's going on in the City and they are just not. And that's a problem . You know, I sat here and I listened to about the grants and then, of course, one of the Council members brought up about a crack in a wall. When do you invest grant money into a building that might have structural problems ? I mean, just off the top of my head, you know, you know, I've been going around the City looking , you know, at project s that were previously done by the City. And there are no more. And they were done with federal money, just threw it right out the window. You know, I just think we really need to take a good look at what's going on. And I don't know how this Council feels about 78 percent of the American people thinking that this President is leading the country the wrong way. And we've named things after this man and now his own party doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 even want him to run. And I just hope that Council would look at the shame they brought on the resident s of this City by doing the things they've done. It's just terrible where we are in this City. You know, when we have a meeting here and we're talking about repurposing grants, okay, then we have a speaker get up and talk about the situation of the City's pensions funds again. Where are we going here? There needs to be a lot more discussions . You know, I'm going to ask ECTV if they'd give me the opportunity to sit down with the Mayor on their format and ask the Mayor some questions and have a real discussion with the Mayor. Maybe even you five Council members would want to come to the party and we could have a real nice conversation about where this City's at and where we are going and where all our money is going and how the decisions in government are being made and how the residents of the City are locked out at the door or just what the Council President said today about some kind of control on speech when the Court of Common Pleas just said plainly that you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 can't do that. Is this the kind of government that the American people really need? Do we need our speech controlled ? Do we need to be locked out from our government at a doorway and try to make calls to department s? I wandered this building probably for 40 years and never had a problem . I just find it really troubling that we're locking the residents of this City out in a vestibule and denying access to their government. That's the most unAmerican thing I've heard in my whole life and for the government to say it's afraid of its own citizens ? It doesn't make any sense. It's all upside down and twisted. It's just not the way the American government should function . Somebody 's got to come up with some kind of plan because we need a government that is responsive to us. And if we're just coming out of Act 47 and we have financial problems now and we're throwing grant money around and we're repurposing grant money, what did we learn? You know I just had a reassessment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 on a property I owned outside of the City. My taxes on that property went up 44 percent . And the county is doing a reassessment in Lackawanna County. The residents can't pay. We've got to figure out what role government should play in our society , focus it, and get out of things we don't belong in. The things the government doesn't belong in we shouldn 't be in because the people can't pay for it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Tim Swartz. MR. SWARTZ: How is everybody doing tonight ? Thanks for this 4 minutes and 55 seconds right now. I'm Tim Swartz, the President of the Hill Neighborhood Association . I was here a couple months ago and have talked with some of you as well. I'm speaking as the President of the Hill Neighborhood Association in support of some of our neighbors but not speaking for them. I want to raise concerns about the new zoning map and the specific designations of the zoning map on the 200 and 400 block of Colfax. I have a bunch of concerns about it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that I want to share. I'm concerned about the implication s of the new zoning is it civic or institutional or whatever it is now, I'm concerned -- I'm sure you've heard the concerns of the neighbors in around that area. But I'll share with you a couple of my concerns . The first concern is the process of proposing the map. I know that other neighborhood groups have stated their concern s about the zoning map. And they were changed like that. The Hill neighborhood , myself and others share our concern about the zoning map. And they weren't heard and they weren't changed. I think there is something there that is concerning to me. I spent numerous hours listening to grief and heartache of the neighbors on Colfax and around there on Wheeler , on Arthur, on Vine or wherever , hours listening to their heartache, their fears. People who have lived in generation al houses, they've raised their kids there. They pass their houses onto their kids -- those same houses onto their kids. Their parents passed them onto them, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 people are probably born in the front room in some of those houses. I listened to their fears. I listened to their concerns . I've watched -- watched their grief. And I don't know -- I heard the grief because many of them don't know what to do as changes are just being forced upon heir heads in the form of -- the hospital wants to expand the footprint to bring better service s to Scranton . My concern in the process is that the local resident s there told me they haven't been consulted or allowed any input into that zoning -- into that change. I'm concerned because these neighbors feel like they are just getting railroaded by the large corporation of the hospital and by their city as well. I'm concerned because I perceive -- different concerns that I perceive a lack of imagination in a zoning map. You know, whenever we're present ed an either or situation , either the hospital has the footprint to bring new services to Scranton , new service s and jobs to Scranton that must go into the 200 or 400 block of Colfax or that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 block can remain intact. We need to have imagination enough to not say either or but to say both (inaudible .) The idea that the hospital can offer these services is great for Scranton , is what we need in Scranton . The idea the hospital can offer new services solely by expanding its footprint by devastating those two blocks. The hospital will not be able to offer more services if it can't devastate those two blocks is just a false dichotomy . The hospital can offer more services in Scranton and be in Scranton and that neighborhood does not have to be destroyed . Delta Medix found a place downtown to offer their services . The Wright Center found a place close to downtown to offer their services , not destroying neighborhoods either one of them. I know you have -- can't do anything about what Geisinger does in the future but you can protect families in the City and their houses and their neighborhood . You must be imagina tive enough to find a zoning solution that is good for both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the hospital and for the families that live in that neighborhood . That is a solution that is good for the City. I encourage you, Council , to listen to the voices in the neighborhood as you look at the zoning map of the 200 and 400 block of Colfax. Listen to the grief, listen to the heartache , listen to their fears and their concerns and also listen to their ideas. They know that neighborhood . They've been living in that neighborhood since -- for the last 140 years, some of them. The ones that have been there for decades , they know the neighborhood . I encourage you to have the imagination to find a win/win solution for both the hospital and the neighbors and all the members of that community . I encourage you to find good compromise . We recognize that Scranton needs more services . I recognize as the President of HNA that Scranton needs more services . But there is a way to do it without devastating the community and the neighborhood . Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Swartz. Next on the list, Ron Ellman.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ELLMAN: Ronnie Ellman, Scranton . You people don't know what to expect tonight , do you? Well, first off, I'd like to thank Mr. Biden for giving out those Medals of Honor to some great people. I'd like to thank our Mayor for spending some time and money on this building . This building to many is Scranton . It deserves every penny you can put into it. I don't think it's wasting money. And I'd like to thank you, Jessica , you enhanced my social goings last week by four people that thanked me for standing before Council and saying what I thought . But when I sit down, I just have one question I wish you'd answer being an extreme proabortionist , how can you -- you tried so hard to acquire a newborn . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, let's try to keep it -- let's try to keep it respectful . MR. ELLMAN: This isn't out of order. I'm asking -- MR. DONAHUE : I'm just preemptively asking you to try to keep it -- MR. ELLMAN: I want to understand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 and so do people her understanding of the murder of innocence . That's what abortion is. It's an evil. What if -- MR. DONAHUE : That's your opinion . MR. ELLMAN: What if your parents followed this philosophy ? You know, there is millions upon millions of dollars spent on abortions . Think of all the cancer patient s that don't get proper care. Think of heart people -- my son is in the hospital right now with cancer. And it's just a limited time of days, probably . I'm more familiar than probably any of you up there with it. I lived with -- Roseann's had cancer for 20 years. And she's surviving very well. But she didn't get the proper care many, many times because of co-pays. And this is -- this a planned thing. She had stitches in her back a couple weeks ago. The doctor went and took part of them out and told her to come back. She had two co-pays when one should have sufficed . That's what goes on with sick people. Well, I'll change the subject because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 I do have something else. A gentleman when I was walking Chumley last week, a gentleman told me that parking lot at Weston Field -- Weston Park could easily have two tennis courts. I don't play tennis. I never played it in my life. And I don't know exact size. But he said it would be so inexpensive , and it would help so many young people in the City and adults. And it would be -- you could play tennis in this City he told me six, seven months compared to a swimming pool. And you'd have the use of a court, I don't know, even with lights let's just say, 8, 10 hours a day. I think it's time you people quit worrying about downtown and developers that are sucking us dry taxwise and do something for the people of the City like a tennis court. I think I had six or eight people say it was a good idea and ought to be investigated . I hope I don't ruin everybody 's month off. I wish you all the best. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I guess I'm both behind and ahead of the times. We now have COVID BA.5. And Friday in New York City it has been recommended that you start wearing masks inside buildings . So that's why I have my mask on. I'm a real survivor . Don't hold your breath waiting for poor old me. Okay, now, once again, we heard about all types of what an embarrassment Mr. Biden is and so forth. Well, I'm sorry to tell some people that speak up here that their presidential choice was an insult, and that's all there is to it. Today I viewed the hearing s and more or less we had Cipollone , he's a presidential attorney . And we had people from the group that actually physically invaded the capitol . The week before last we had Hutchinson, a woman. And she told of all kinds of goings on including being instructed not to search for weapons on his circle -- on Donald Trump's circle at his rally. Next week it is on in the evening on Thursday night. And please watch it because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 it's the grand finale more or less. And once again, I'm strictly pro-choice. I don't support multiple trips to the abortion clinic. But there is a point where they are calling -- these groups calling birth control abortifacients . And by the way, isn't there an amendment that says thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighborhood ? What is that the sixth -- I don't know because I haven't been in church in 50 years and don't miss it myself. I'm a moderate . I'm staring out into the universe and wondering what more exists. I'm not worried about something that happened 2000 years ago. And as far as business is concerned , has anybody been to the mall at Montage within the last month? I would -- it's a really educational experience because they basically bankrupted our mall, compliments of the Chamber of Commerce and built malls up there. There's hardly 50 percent of the buildings are unoccupied , possibly more. I was driving when I observed all the empty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 building s, all the empty business space. So I had to watch where I was going so I didn't run somebody over. But that might not have been much of a problem either because there weren't many people up there. It's really -- we have to decide whether we're going to build business space or are we going to house people. And when they elect these people, so-called prolifers, they don't want to spend money on education . They don't want to spend money on housing . They don't want to spend money on SNAP or food assistan ce. They want to take it away. They want to take away Social Security . We have people running that want to relegislate Social Security every five years. What's the youngsters going to say, somebody that's 30 years old? Oh, I'll never see it, so maybe I shouldn 't care about it. But the bottom only is, if these people don't stop, it's time that they start paying taxes like all political animals like me. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Mr. Dobrzyn . That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . I dropped off a sheet when you were out for a few seconds. And that was an informational sheet because we had talked about the reassessment of the county -- the county reassessment was going on and we talked about them using counts from the last 30 months. And I had discussed prior that it's kind of hard to make counts from houses that are no longer selling because they're no longer in the range or beyond interest . This article I gave you is published by the Mortgage News Dailey. And one of the startling things I found out in reading it is the share of sale agreements on existing homes in June just under 15 percent of all homes that went under contract were cancelled . That means people who came and put an offer on the home, contracted for it turned around and walked away from that house leaving their deposit as free money to cut from it because the interest rate had driven the costs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 beyond their scope of being able to pay for it and/or the market was so overinflated that they know that in a short period of time there is going to be reversal and houses are going to lower just because they've been greatly exaggerated in price. So I just wanted to pull this out since it was an article specifically related to that. Body cams for police officers , I understand we put forth some money in the budget for reequipping them because their old Axon body cams are basically the first generation body cams. I would like to see someone put in place that some of the Axon body cams actually be the shoulder mounted ones that have the camera on the shoulder because too often when you see a police video out there, you see them running forward to deal with a victim, the hands go up in front, the guns are up drawn and directly in front of that camera is a blockage of arms and anything else. So having a camera that in incidents where you need the camera the most, it's physically obscure d by the body because of the location of where it's worn on the chest is an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 issue. I'm not suggesting across the board, but some of them out there should be shoulder mounted . As of barring the door here in City Hall, I think it's absurd. It's a public building . This is not a prison. We pay for this building . This is not a guarded encampment. I haven't heard of any real incidents happening inside of City Hall that warrant it. And if it's fear of being seen and observed , maybe then the people who are worried about people watching them shouldn 't be in public life. Now, there are so many things wrong with the OECD issues on the table tonight , first is the handling of money, handing money to the managing company for the Scranton garages . Why is the -- why are we giving them $450,000 in that document to repair a building which they are under the obligation to maintain because 30 years down the road the City may get it back. But this is a profit venture for them. If they want to make profit from it, they need to maintain it and that's where they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 gain their investment back from. It shouldn 't be handed over for the City for a property that's being held by an independent contractor . Second, the drug overdose prevention program and the educational catchup grants, I do not understand why in that body it has listed that they must be licensed to provided services in the county or the City -- and/or the City of Scranton . This is a Scranton grant. It should not be going to Lackawanna County. It should not be marketed out to other financial districts . And if we don't have the ability to take care of that, it should be handled here as in getting people here to take care of those issues. 5-D, I have an issue with it because once again we are inflating a payroll outside of budget. 5-E, I have an issue with it because we're paying a park security for the police department liaison from a DPW fund, which is incredibly convoluted . And just because of the nature of being convoluted , they say it's paid for. No, it's not paid for. It's paid for -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I would like to start off because I did not hear what your response was that -- disappointingly with the acoustic s in this room are not -- MR. DONAHUE : Because of supply chain issues we won't be able to get the equipment we need in time for August. MS. SCHUMACHER : What are the items that you can't get? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have the list specifically in front of me. But I know there's sound mixers that need to be ordered as well as new current speakers . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I'm sure we have enough purchasers in this town that could find them. It can't be that many. So maybe you could make that an issue next week and tell us what's needed. Somebody used the word pitiful tonight . And I think what is pitiful is a lot of things downtown . I said after the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 walkability study was gone through and it was stated and the parking -- we need to change the parking because it helps the businesses . Where are the businesses ? I took a visitor and little guy out today. And we started walking downtown to buy a dress. And we only got five blocks I believe on Wyoming Avenue. And first floor businesses are almost nonexistent . There are a lot of empty ones. And I know it's going to be worse when I hit the formally known Spruce Street just because I drive down there a lot and I see what's happening . Where are the businesses -- retail? They're not there. Look at the -- look at the mall, same thing. If it wasn't for Boscov's, I mean, it's just to -- could have taken the professional building across the street or what we used to call the medical building and put it -- just pushed it down. And it was a different -- it was stretched out instead of up. And how much of our tax money went into doing that? And then we went and gave away the Electric City Garage, which was brand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 new and gave it to Mr. Basalyga for a dollar including with the older part at the Globe Store. But then, of course, we did give five million dollars to make the repair on the old part. They weren't required on the new part. So there is just so much that's wrong. Then because today is the Wilding anniversary , back when that happened it was discussed that the rules for permits would -- or codes would have to have rails if there was -- I don't know how it was suppose d to be. So if it was a drop, if you jumped over a wall, the drop couldn't be more than I think it was the height of the wall itself. And I don't know what ever happened to that. I did a -- went to the code and put in railing ; and I couldn't get anything up. So I wonder, was that ever done? If it wasn't, I think that makes a lot of sense. I mean, I don't know how many there are around. But I know there are a good number. And the thing -- if we -- this rescue money, when you look around at what's -- at this City and whether it looks inviting or not, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 just drive from on Lackawanna Avenue from Adams Avenue up to where you go across the bridge on Jefferson Avenue. That wall, something has to be done. There must be between the county and the City, there's got to be some of that rescue money that could fix that. That is the ugliest most uninviting piece of structure , I guess, if it stays up. So please do something about that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. On that point, there is a grant for the smaller wall I guess you would call it that's -- but the bigger wall also needs to be incorporated into that and it's trying to figure out the pieces there. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I have nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I have a couple comments . Frank, I'm going to send over -- I did get a call about the 100 block of Wyoming Avenue. I got a complaint about the grass, the trees, the weeds if we could send code enforce ment over there. I did take a ride on the way to the building today. And, I mean, all the corners , the curbs, the trees that are on the street are all overgrown from Lackawanna Avenue to I'd say the next two blocks. But it's specifically the 100 block of Wyoming . Also, something I've noticed over the weekend is there are people camping along the expressway right above Scranton High School and even across the street near the tracks. If we could send that over I would imagine to the Scranton Police Department to let them know that there is people camping there along the highway . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I think some of the laws we have we do need to enforce. Mr. Spindler brought up a point about pit bulls. And I will have to say that I was a pit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 bull owner. I had to put my dog to sleep a year ago. She was an American Staffordshire Terrier . And things like breeding specific dog laws, they're frowned upon by the American Kennel Club. They're frowned upon by the SPCA. The issue here is bad dog owners. Similar to our ATV laws here in the City, you know, we do have laws. We need to enforce them. If an owner is doing -- if we have a bad dog owner, we need to look into getting these dogs removed from these owners, just my own personal tidbit there. The last thing I'm going to say is, John Wilding . I don't know if everybody in this room knew John Wilding . I was a personal friend of John Wilding and his family, his wife, his children . And I hope with this law passing in the State of Pennsylvania , I hope it brings some relief to the family. I'm still in shock over the event that occurred . So I do hope it brings some relief to the family. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few comments . I want to agree with Councilman Schuster regarding aggressive dogs. I am interested in strengthening legislation on dog owners who are irresponsible with their dogs. I know my family we've been victims before of irresponsible dog owners in the City unfortunately . However , I am against dog specific or breed specific legislation because a Chihuahua could be aggressive . It's not just big dogs that are -- I have big dogs -- that are not very friendly . So, yeah, I'd be happy to take a look into the strengthen ing legislation . But I would not be in favor of something breed specific . I also wanted to address Mr. Swartz's comments regarding the zoning on Colfax. And this is something that I spoke about in the past. I have been adamantly trying to get meetings with representative s from Geisinger so that I could get more information for the resident s in the Hill Section as to what their plans are. I had sent them over my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 availability . They sent back some proposed meeting times that were all outside of what I had given as my availability when I would be working with patient s. So that did not work out. And then the next date that they had sent was for midAugust, which I expressed not being happy with and that that was unacceptable . I would like to see this zoning ordinance passed but not with the current structure for or the current zoning for Colfax Avenue. I don't feel that it benefits the residents and that it's fair. And I'm open to more conversation s with Geisinger . But it doesn't appear that they're as open to those conversations with me. So I am very disappoint ed in that. But I will continue pushing for it. If I don't receive a response , then I won't be voting on it. And that's where I stand on that. And lastly, there was a question asked of me in Citizens Comments by Mr. Ellman. I still do not think that this is the appropriate forum to discuss national 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 issues including abortion . I also don't think it's appropriate for me to discuss my personal stances here. I'm here to talk about City issues, City business as I would hope that the resident s would be. And last I checked , I don't see any legislation on the agenda tonight that is relevant to abortion . So try again next time, I guess. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, so last week I asked about what's going on with the pools in the City, which ones are open, when they're open. Last week we had one open. But I'm happy to report that Weston Field is open weekdays and weekend s 12 to 6; closed on Mondays. Weston Park is open. It opened yesterday and open Monday through Thursday and Saturdays . Connell Park -- I'm sorry, Connell Pool will open next week. So I'm happy to report these out. The splash pad is open Wednesday through Sunday. All hours are 12 through 6. So some pools are open now. So I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 glad to report that. I'm also -- just to bring you up-to-date, I have yet to receive the information I requested from the Mayor about the power washer investigation . I have yet to receive the footage at the Serrenti Center. So I'm still waiting for that. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just a couple things in terms of what Mr. Swartz brought up about the zoning. I could assure you that we're trying to work with Geisinger to have them present some sort of plan. Nothing is being jammed down anyone's throat. And we're not going to consider a plan unless they're more willing to work with and take into considerations of the neighbors . And we're sort of getting to the point now where push has come to shove where either they start engaging with the neighbors or they're not going to get anything in terms of new zoning. And they're going to have to come in front of the zoning board for a variance or whatever they want to do. But nothing is going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 to be jammed through without making sure that they're also in conversations with neighbors and listening to the neighbor s about their concerns up there. That's why we've had it tabled for -- since February now. We did hold meetings with neighborhood groups in terms of, you know, certain complaints . And if there is anything we missed, Mr. Swartz, in those meeting s, please let me know and we'll, you know -- besides the Geisinger -- but if there is anything we did miss in terms of some of your concerns , please let us know and we'll work to address those. We'll talk after. But that's all on that issue. And then, Mr. Voldenberg , I believe we all got -- Mr. McAndrew brought this up multiple times about cars blocking the sidewalk on South Main Avenue. We received an e-mail more recently . Can we check back with code enforce ment? I'll give you that address after the meeting on that issue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : And also, we all got an e-mail from a resident who DPW -- DPW had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 moved -- removed items in error for pickup that weren't suppose d to be garbage . And they're supposed to be reimbursed for that. They haven't fully received the reimbursement yet. So can we look into that issue too? I have that e-mail here. And that is all I have for this evening . MR. KING: Mr. President , I did fail to mention I did have a meeting with Geisinger , a Geisinger representative this past Friday probably for an hour and a half. And I listened to, you know, what they're hoping to do, what they're hoping to accomplish . And I gave them some advice about, you know, what they're trying to accomplish . Number one, I gave them advice that needs to be more transparent with the neighbors in terms of what the actual plans are. He indicated to me that based on what, you know, they heard when they had the meeting with you that they have gone back to talk to their architect s and engineer s to come up with a different plan, which I'm hoping that they're going to roll out pretty soon and bring it back to, you know, the neighborhood association and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 explain exactly what they're hoping to do based on input that they receive d from the neighborhoods . As Council President indicated , I told him that it's going to be very difficult for us to approve any zoning without them being more forthright and letting the neighbors -- working with them and being a little creative about the plan that they're trying to put together . So I felt like he was receptive to some of the suggestion s I gave him. And will -- the future will tell. But I felt it was important to add that. I was able to set up a meeting . I know Jessica is still trying to set up that meeting . But I was able to meet with them on Friday. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
