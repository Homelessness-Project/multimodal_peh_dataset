AGENDA FOR THE ZONING HEARING BOARD MEETING TO BE HELD SEPTEMBER 2, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcement s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. Our friends at Friends of the Poor of Scranton wanted me to let everybody know that our food pantries in West Scranton and South Side are open during the week, West Side, Jackson Terrace at 148 Meridian Avenue is open Mondays , Tuesday s, Thursday s and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 1:30. Wednesday they're closed in support of offsite food distributions . Over in South Side, Valley View 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Terrace building nine, food pantry is open. It's on 950 Pear Street, open Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m., to 12:30 p.m. All other pantry locations in the City are closed. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else have announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : I would like to extend congratulations to the graduates of this school year and also to extend condolences to the family of Judith Hadley. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Anyone else? I have three announcements . First, I just wanted to say that Scranton Police Chief Carl Graziano is retiring as everyone saw recently from the announcement and in the newspaper effective September 11th to take a position as Lackawanna College 's Director of Public Safety. As I said to the newspaper , I really think that there's big shoes to fill there. Chief Graziano has done a great job and has been an outstanding leader in the police department . So I want to thank him for his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 service . He became a patrolman in October , 1992 and then became acting Police Chief in 2012. And he's done an absolutely fantastic job. The next announcement I'd like to make is the Scranton Together Neighborhood Initiatives will continue through September . The events will run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., at the following locations : Wednesday , September 2nd, Connell Park; Friday, September 4th, City Hall; Wednesday , September 9th, Weston Field; Friday, September 11th, Fellows Park; Monday, September 14th at Tripp Park; Wednesday , September 16th at Billy Barrett Park; Friday, September 18th at Nay Aug Park; Monday, September 21st in Pine Brook; Wednesday , September 23rd in Keyser Valley. There was just recently a neighborhood initiative the other day at the park in my neighborhood . And I could tell you that the turnout was great. I think this is a fantastic initiative bringing City Hall to the neighborhoods . And I've heard nothing but good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 things from neighbors . And I think we should continue -- the administration should continue to do more things like this. It really is helpful . And last announcement from me, next Monday, September 7th, the Labor Day holiday will be observed . City Hall will be closed and DPW will be off this day. Refuse and recycling will be one day behind next week, the week of September 7th. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following citizens , Thomas Coyne and Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : I make the motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , we did receive and review Mr. Coyne's comments . I don't believe there was any questions -- any questions there from Mr. Coyne. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Miss Franus also submitted I believe six questions that we will get answered . Some of them had to do with ECTV and the Comcast franchise money that was in Third Order tonight . So there's some specific questions there. And then there are two questions about -- or two questions about Scranton Tomorrow and a question about the University of Scranton . So we will get those questions answered . And we'll get back to Miss Franus on that. Anyone else on the question ? Also, I failed to mention as well, public comment is placed into the official record and our official minutes . The minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and going to Council 's webpage. Any question s that were posed to Council that would be better served to the administration , we get that to the correct department . If anyone would like to view the comment s that have been submitted , please go to the webpage and review the minutes . They are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 there. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mayor Cognetti , thanks for sticking around. We -- one item that we did not get to in the caucus which I think is extremely important and something that I've been pushing for since 2015, is the transfer of the delinquent tax collection , real estate tax collection from NRS the private company to the Tax Claim Bureau -- County Tax Claim Bureau which is a no-brainer in my opinion . So if you just want to talk about that, maybe what the next steps are, what the transition looks like and anything else you might want to add. MAYOR COGNETTI : Sure. So last time we had a caucus about six weeks ago I know we had talked about NRS. And I was not ready to state unequivocally that we would be done with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the contract by the end of December . There was still some -- some legal study and discussion that needed to happen. But I am absolutely ready to say that we will be done with that -- that contract at the end of December this year. So I wanted to make sure that we studied every angle -- it was new to Solicitor O'Brien, new to me coming in. And there was a long history there that dates back I believe since 2011. There's a lot there that we wanted to make sure that we were making our decisions based on all the information that we could gather and the conversation s that needed to have. Now I could say we will absolutely be done by the end of December which is I think it's -- I think I agree with you. It's great news and it will really -- really move us forward . So we're pleased to put in front of you an intergovernmental agreement where we would work with the county which I do think makes the most sense for a variety of reasons . We talked earlier about technology . And we've been talking about processes and our systems . There's so much of real estate. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 have to be working with the county anyway for deeds and those types of things. There's a lot of information that needs to transfer to have the county then be collecting the property taxes actually makes -- it makes a lot of sense for a variety of technical reasons . And I think it's a win to have the City and the county working together in that way. So what you have in front of you is the property tax piece of it. The refuse piece we do -- we do plan to -- we're talking with the county. We'll probably issue an RFP for the refuse piece of it. Mary Jo Sheridan and Wayne Beck are -- thanks to both of them. Actually they're doing a thing similar to Carl Deeley and Pat Sheridan in June where they're sharing the job for a few weeks so we have a smooth transition . Mayor Jo and Wayne are working out -- really digging in what should that RFP look like, what should those delinquent fee -- what should that whole process look like both the sale of the delinquencies , which we're valuing . But those might end up being tied in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 with an RFP for delinquent fees going forward . It might be that we would package those together . So we're still looking at that, excited to have Wayne and Mary Jo working on that right now. But keep that in mind as you review this that what's right in front of you right now is the real estate piece. And then that refuse will come to you either in the form of an RFP where we've selected somebody or potentially -- potentially would also be with the county. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure that the county would have (inaudible ) with the refuse fees for a City of our size is definitely a large -- a large scale project . But we're making those assessments right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Does anybody have any questions on this agenda item for Mayor Cognetti ? MR. MCANDREW : I don't have a question . I just have a comment . I think it's wonderful that we're going to partner with the county for the collection of these fees, you know, intergovernmentally . We've been talking about intergovernmental and shared services 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 for, you know, a year now between the School Board and us and the county. So this is a very good first step with regards to, you know, teaming up and partnering in some of these situations . That's all I have. Thanks. MAYOR COGNETTI : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . I wanted to make sure that you guys know there was, you know, there was news about 10 days ago coming out of the federal courthouse that detailed that the county had offered this in -- many years ago predating I believe all of us on this. Even, Councilman Gaughan , I think it might have even been before you took office. The offer was 5 percent commission . Next week Solicitor O'Brien will come and detail the agreement more. He could give you more of the detail. But that 5 percent is -- remained . It's baked into the intergovernmental agreement the county would take 5 percent commission versus the 15 percent that NRS got through the means they did. So I just wanted you guys to know that the five -- when you see it in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 document before you. But I wanted to know -- that was my first question was I want to make sure this agreement is the same level that it would have been. So we're getting back to where the City should be in terms of paying for the service . MR. GAUGHAN : Any questions for Mayor Cognetti ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm assuming that commission fee, would that go towards perhaps , like their staffing needs in order to allocate the time to go through the taxes. Is that -- MAYOR COGNETTI : That's my understanding . I won't speak for the county. But that's -- it's for their operation is my guess. But in my mind it would be similar to OECD. We charge an administrative fee in OECD. That's to help with our staff time that we spend evaluating project s and things like that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : I believe the 5 percent is statutory right, Kevin? It's -- ATTY. HAYES: It is. MR. GAUGHAN : -- it's set by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 state law. ATTY. HAYES: So if you don't see it in the intergovernmental agreement it may not say 5 percent , but statutorily it's the cap the county could charge for administrative fees. So it's a saving for us. MAYOR COGNETTI : Absolutely . MR. GAUGHAN : Big time. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : I have one more quick point. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, sure. Go ahead, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : So if we're talking about the collecting the fees and so next year I know it was too late this year. You know, the garbage fee itself and it's August. So, you know, actually it's September . So I know it was too late last year. I'd just like to know what thought s are -- what's being at least discussed because believe it or not, people are still left with that question . They come to me all the time saying, well, Mark, I thought we were going to do this or I thought -- and so I think, you know, it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 relates to this what we're talking about. So I'm just throwing it out there to see if there is any discussion or plans. MAYOR COGNETTI : That's absolutely what we're -- that's the goal. And Mary Jo and Wayne are working on seeing what the feasibility is with that for next year. ATTY. HAYES: Mark, we -- the issue with the refuse fees is the reason they couldn't be included in this agreement is because it would have to have been printed on the tax bills. So the earliest we could do that is 2022 with the county -- not saying that that's the direction that the City -- that's going to be up to the administration and Council to decide. But we couldn't do it before 2022. So the -- as the Mayor indicated and as Solicitor O'Brien and I have been in discussions , the thought would be to have an RFP for the collection of the refuse at least for 2021. MR. MCANDREW : I don't mean the collection of delinquents . I'm talking about how are we going to collect the fee itself 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 moving forward , whether it's, you know, it's a fee or is it part -- is it rolled into the taxes like this was discussed ? ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MR. MCANDREW : My question was more regarding towards that. MAYOR COGNETTI : Okay. Yeah, we're the -- we're studying to see if that could happen. That would be ideal for a range of reasons , whether or not it can happen for next year, we'll see. With Scranton , we have two Treasurers working on it right now which is nice. It would be nice if we could have that for a while. But it's only for a few -- MR. GAUGHAN : Good. Any other questions ? All right. Mayor Cognetti , thank you for coming. We appreciate it. MAYOR COGNETTI : Yep. Thank you all very much. PUBLIC COMMENT (The following are e-mails submitted to Council for Public Comment .)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 (Thomas Coyne) Greetings members of City Council , Last week's entry seems to have been confusing due to my laptop needing a new keyboard , as it is also activating my touch mouse and moving comments all over the place. The parts that were moved improperly are added here. Correction -Fireworks . Smoke producing Item and the category of fireworks listed as Silent fireworks /noiseless fireworks . I also believe that firecrackers should be allowed with parental permission or someone over 21 supervising . Though they do produce reduced noise they are effective for small groups and use with music accompaniment . For large displays they are not practical . Cities have adopted them due to pets, PTSD, and younger kids who are trying to sleep. ** Should have the highlighted moved to the end.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Smoke producing Item and the category of fireworks listed as Silent fireworks /noiseless fireworks . Though they do produce reduced noise, they are effective for small groups and use with music accompaniment . For large displays they are not practical . Cities have adopted them due to pets, PTSD, and younger kids who are trying to sleep. I also believe that firecrackers should be allowed with parental permission or someone over 21 supervising . Onto New issues -- PEL expects a 2.3 million shortfall , the city expects a 6-8 million shortfall , if the act 511 appeal fails, the City would be looking at a shortfall estimate of - 12.3 for PEL and 16-18 mil based on random un-backed City guesses . I am of the ideal that one should always plan for the worst and hope for the better. I understand the Act 47 financially distressed status is important for getting banks who avoid taxes to pay up, by changing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 from business privilege mercantile tax to a payroll tax. Part of that is a tax increase from a flat 0.1% to 0.286%. One of the things it corrects is banking and certain manufacturing businesses from avoiding taxes, but secondary it promotes Scranton job loss, by incentivizing remote work as work outside the city is not subject to payroll tax. In relation to taxes and public utilities , has anyone acquired a list of utility Contract carriers ?? A legal entity providing for-hire transportation or goods to its customers on a contract basis. Confirmed In Commonwealth v. Lafferty 426 Pa. 541 (1967) Commonwealth v. Lafferty , Appellant . Supreme Court of Pennsylvania . Argued May 25, 1967. September 26, 1967. Contract Carriers are subject to taxation and are not excluded under the Public Utility . “Public utilities shall not exclude from their tax base receipts derived from sales of appliances , equipment , advertising , etc. A contract carrier is not a public utility .”.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 So any contract workers for the utilities should be taxed, are we sure we are capturing this revenue ? Taxation -- University of Scranton . Though excluded from the tax base and giving funds in lieu of taxes, (though well under what it should) has anyone asked or reviewed improvements to University of Scranton Property ? Though the U of S is under the shield of non taxation , all contract work on the buildings is taxable . So Unless the U of S uses ONLY internal staff for cleaning , repair, maintenance , furniture moving, and apartment management . The City may be owed taxes that may have been excluded as purchased under a tax free entity. -24. CONTRACTORS WHO REPAIR, ALTER, AND IMPROVE TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY a. Persons engaged in business in the Taxing District as contractors who repair, alter, and improve tangible personal property for the account of others are subject to tax under the provisions of this ordinance . When contractors perform labor or services on articles of tangible personal property furnished by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 other party to the contract , such contractors are required to report only the amount due them for labor or services rendered . There is a lot that can be improved ... Improved tax collection . I am also in favor of when and if you get any information from Northeast Revenue Service , it would be reasonable in this time of economic struggle and COVID-19 to institute total tax amnesty for a period of time. A council member stated publicly in session , that you are not even sure what may be beyond the statute of limitations to collect at this point. I would not address this issue as it opens up more problems , unless challenged in a case by case basis. The most reasonable for the City is to offer amnesty without evaluation of this question . It would be the responsibility of the homeowner if they are delinquent for 4 years, and of those 3 of the 4 are expected to be beyond collectable , to pay and direct payment to a specific tax year on the check/payment form and challenge the other years. So if 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 years were owed in 2013 a 2014 and there is a 7 year limit.. if they fail to mark a payment to the 2014 tax year, you are free to apply it on any outstanding debt from oldest to newest, as long as no statement is made on liability vs outstanding balance . The Amnesty is a great way to increase recovery of debt and can include all debt owed when not challenged . People can always pay bills that are no longer collectable and by doing so, extend the validity on those owed numbers . You save people fines and penalties , and recover funds to use now... and may capture funds that may have been lost in total. This is a minor computer scanning irritation for me. The PDF submissions to council should be scanned as searchable not as an image. Options below. This includes things like the controllers report/financials and budget. - Searchable Image (Exact) to make the text in the PDF document searchable but not editable (this is the default setting ). Use this setting if you're processing a document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 that needs to be searchable but should never be edited in any way, such as an executed contract . -Searchable Image (Compact ) to make the text in the PDF document searchable but not editable and to compress its graphics . Select this setting if you're processing a document whose text requires searching without editing and that also contains a fair number of graphic images that need compressing . When you select this setting , Paper Capture applies JPEG compression to color images and ZIP compression to black-and-white images. -The yelling “Get off my lawn”... when we as kids enjoyed no such restrictions , and now expect kids to act differently , is not exactly reasonable . Last, for my starting comment last week, I hope it did not offend. It was put in to show aggravation at something of a moral imperative that I held as a kid in Scranton . As an adult I can't ignore my opinion I had as that kid, as it is valid and even now. I do not forget what being a kid is like and in understanding that, have to temper my adult 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 view to respect what kids now may think as well. As for th comment , it's a common statement on a TV comedy, as an Irish man who tends to always be aggravated , refers to everyone in those terms. For laughs and understanding , and if you like British humor and computer geek/office humor, even if off colored (as brit sit-coms can be) take a watch of the show “The IT Crowd.” Because in these times we all need to find a few laughs wherever we can. Happy Vacation ! Respectfully . Thomas Coyne Additional note. Just reviewed the 2021 budget and I see IT has a major overhaul planned . The budget states that a replacement of the City operating system is required due to Technical Support ending in 2021. The only Operating System that ended support I can think of was Windows 7 in 2020. Internet Explorer ends at 12/31/2021, but that is not hardware , just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 installing another browser . Windows 7 ended its security patching as of January 14, 2020, but.. Extended Security Updates (ESU) are available for a fee for continued operation and patches thru 2023. I support upgrades and security , but it has to be done in a reasonable long term manor. A Unified master data (what people have been making as an access database since 1992.) May sound good but Having a database for all departments and service partners , gives external access to privileged information to outside sources . Service partners should not have the access to a full database . The need is ever present to have an access controlled intranet (internal ) that can be protected and secured by VPN and credentials to specific remote machines running software to connect to city resources . Intranet and internet need to be separated and non linked. If I was running IT, I would back up financial and any critical data using a ZFS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 system. Tom Coyne (Fay Franus) Council here are my questions and comments for September 1 2020: 1. I want to know how much money the city gave ECTV from the Comcast franchise money that the city gets? 2. When is the last time EVTC received money from Comcast franchise money if ever? 3. I want to know exactly how Scranton Tomorrow has spent or will spend the money they received from the city and the University of Scranton . Grant money given to them as well as any other money they may have received from the city? 4. Did money from the Comcast franchise go to Scranton Tomorrow ? If so how much and why? 5. When the University of Scranton gives the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 city money in lieu of taxes next time I want to know if you as council and the Mayor will allow the University of Scranton to dictate tho the city as to how this money will be spent? Example they wanted their last contribution of money in lieu of taxes to go to the fire department and Scranton Tomorrow . Comment on question 5: I do NOT believe at all that the University of Scranton has a right to tell the city how to spend money they give in lieu of taxes. That money should go into the operating budget not special interest of theirs. 6. I want to know why each council person feels the questions and comments that people send it for the meetings are NOT read aloud and the replies read aloud during the meeting ? Comment about question 6: I already know what Bill Gaughn feels he told me on the phone but I have not heard from Kyle Donahur , Jessica Rothchild , Mark McAndrew and Mr. Schuster . I want to hear from each one of them directly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 also another comment regarding question 6: The Scranton school board allows people to cvall in while their meeting is going on liuve. The County commissioners read questions sent in during their meeting and their answers . So I see NO reason whatsoever why Scranton city Council does not allow transparency . What you are doing needs to stop. 7. When will council start having council meetings in council chambers ? 8 Since the treasury sales allowed people to attend their sale on September 1st in council chambers why are people not being allowed to attend meetings in council chambers ? Fay Franus (End of Public Comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : None at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : I do have a comment . And it's an -- inquiring for a couple resident s and myself included . So it's been brought to my attention -- I know this happens . It's happened to me recently where say the night before a garbage collection -- over here in West Side it's Friday -- that some people come from, you know, other parts of the area that don't live here and bring bags of garbage and drop it and run or an instance where I have a tire laying against the back of my garage in the alley, you know, someone that doesn't want to dispose of it by themselves . I don't know if that is from out of the area but -- or someone dumped behind my garage a big branch, you know, part of a tree that was taken down. But with regards to that, what is the ordinance with regards to that? And my understanding is, I mean, there is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 fine out there. I just want some clarity . Maybe we can reach out to the City and have an understanding . This was also brought to my attention by Marty Flynn also that he's seen this and has heard about it, our State Rep. But I guess it occurs more than we realize because now it's being brought to my attention . And, you know, places like say on Main Avenue, like, you know, what is maybe 11:00 at night people are putting bags of garbage that don't live here just because they don't want to pay the per bag or wherever they live. So I guess -- and my understanding is the police know about it. I don't know if there's a fine. I don't know if we can stiffen that fine or at least take a look into it and see where we're at with that so it doesn't get any -- you know, so we can prevent -- have some type of deterrent from this continue to happen. If Mrs. Reed -- if anyone could speak to that who already knows, that would be fine too. ATTY. HAYES: Councilman , I know that there is a -- there is an ordinance on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 books for dumping -- in other words, you can't dump without , you know, in public or in private receptacles without the owner's permission by any -- you know, so in other words, it's considered -- it's declared a nuisance and it's prohibited . I could get additional information . But I know that there is at least one ordinance on the book that would prohibit that. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. Maybe we could just get a copy of that -- ATTY. HAYES: Sure. MR. MCANDREW : -- in the mail. ATTY. HAYES: You got it. MR. MCANDREW : People that are inquiring , I could provide them with this information . Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have one comment . For the past month since we were off, I've continue d to receive complaints like we usually would and e-mails from people living in Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 A lot of the complaints , a majority of them are about like overgrown weed and grass this time of year at various properties throughout the City. So I just want to let people know that I have forwarded those along to, you know, whatever appropriate department that it should go to. I don't always get a response as to whether or not something is completed . And I'm working with the administration right now to be able to have better communication and to close those communication loops so that I do have an understanding if something was completed or not. But I usually haven't updated people unless I've received a response from that department . So if there's something you're still having an issue with, feel free to reach back out to me. But I do have a -- I keep a list of all those and I have been checking in on all those different requests and complaints from people. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? Sorry, I couldn't hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 you. Any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I have a few comments that I want to go over briefly . So I hope everybody is doing well. You know, pandemic still rages in Lackawanna County and throughout the country and the world. So I just want to take a moment to say how sorry I am to all those people in our community and throughout the country and throughout the world who are suffering from this. This is such an unbelievable time to live through . And as I mentioned I think in June and July, if anyone is suffering in our City from the effects of dealing with this pandemic , you can call 211. That's a line where you could get social services or help with food, anything like that. And if you do have access to a computer just go to scrantonpa .gov and there are a ton of resources on there to help people out. There's a few things that I just wanted to check through since we're just coming back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 from the August recess that I would like to have an update on. And this is something that I've asked about in the past. And I'm just curious to see if, first of all, if it's complete and second of all, if it is complete if we did identify any savings and that was a utility bill audit. The City hired a company I think last year to conduct an audit of our utilities to see if we could find any savings. And I remember looking through that legislation . And they provided some examples of other cities. And there was a significant amount of savings that they were able to find. So I am very interest ed to see what the status of that is. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could just send that to the administration and ask them to provide Council an update. The other thing, Mrs. Reed -- and I know that she's been in contact with the Law Department . I'm just curious as to when we'll be receiving legislation approving -- I think we have to approve the appointment of John Judge as the acting Fire Chief and at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 point I think Mary Jo Sheridan . So if you could just double-check on that. Also, the Act 47 recommendations I think I asked last month and we did send a friendly reminder to the administration . And I think it is important particularly before the end of the year to find out where we are as a City in meeting some of those recommendations that were given by the Pennsylvania Economy League in our Act 47 Exit Plan. We were extended for a period of time in Act 47. There are several recommendation s that have just kind of languished out there since I've been on Council under the previous administrations . So I am interested to see what the status of those are. Also, the Mayor touched on it briefly with the sale of receivable s. I would like to get clarification from the administration on when the RFP will go out. I know they're talking about some time hopefully in the next few weeks. I just want to state for the record my concern again. And I stated this to the Mayor and to the Business Administrator about cutting it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 close with this thing. The sale of receivables is a line item in the budget under sale of assets. And it was pegged for a million and a half, about roughly a million half dollars . So if that somehow falls through and we're in September now, these things as everybody knows takes time. My concern would be that that obviously we would have a significant hole in the budget. So I would like to just ask, you know, first of all, when is this RFP going to go out and what is the alternative plan if this ends up falling through ? In other words, where are we going to get a million and a half dollars ? The next thing was the Street Sign Program . A few years ago the City entered into a contract with a company that basically modernized technology in the DPW in order for us to better track street signs throughout the City. It's a complaint that I get often about street signs. I think we've made -- faded street signs and street signs that just don't exist. The City has made I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 significant progress in moving through some neighborhoods . I still think that there's a lot of work to be done. So I would like an update, Mrs. Reed, if we could from the DPW on -- since this program has been in place and we've been able to really track it, how many street signs have been replaced, where have they been replaced, and what is kind of the plan on moving forward on what neighborhoods they're going to attack to replace street signs? Also, Mary Jo Sheridan who was the Chairwoman of the Ethics Board resigned and will become City Treasurer , which I think is great news. Mary Jo did a great job on the Ethics Board. And I think she'll do a great job as City Treasurer . That does mean that there will be an opening for -- on the Ethics Board that Council will have to appoint . So I have been talking with Mrs. Reed. And we are going to put out an advertisement in the newspaper to solicit resumes and letters of interest from people who would be interested in serving on that Board. There still remains work to be done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 in getting that Board up and running . It has not gone as smoothly as I think everyone would have liked. But the members of the Ethics Board have really done a good job in trying their best. I know that they are currently working hard with the administration and the Ethics Board Solicitor to get -- I think a website up and running on the City's website and doing some different things. So we'll see if we can get a very good qualified person for that Board. I did want to report on a meeting that I had with several neighbors up on Whitetail Drive this past week or last week rather. They just had pointed out to me some flooding issues, water runoff issues. So I did send something over to the DPW Director and hopefully can get a meeting with him on that this week to see if there is anything we can do to mitigate those issues. I also wanted to get an update, Mrs. Reed, on the 2019 audit. I believe that we received an update at the end of June or July. So if you can get in touch with Kohanski 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Company to get an update on that, that would be great. Also, in terms of financial projections moving forward because of the pandemic as everyone knows, there was concern about -- major concern about the effect that it would have on our budget. We did receive an update from the former Business Administrator Pat Sheridan on June 10th, 2020. And he put together a pretty comprehensive report on the way things were looking . And then we were told that at the end of July and September , beginning of September we would have a better idea where we stood financially and what people could expect towards the end of the year. So, Mrs. Reed, if we could just send something to the administration and asking them to come to Council and give us an update on where those projections stand and certainly I know they probably changed so where they -- and how they have changed . And the last thing that I just wanted to mention was something that I have been working with the Director of Parks and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Recreation , Brian Fallon on and the Mayor. And that is a new program that I would like the City to unveil. And I think in speaking with Director Fallon and the Mayor that this is going to become a reality hopefully for next year. It is a Park Ambassador Program . I was looking at what other cities do in terms of the engagement between their community and our park system. As everyone knows, we have beautiful parks throughout the City; McClain Park near my house, Crowley Park, Fellows Park. We have a beautiful park in every neighborhood . One of the issues that I see -- and I talked to Director Fallon and the Mayor about is the fact that we don't have enough employees in the Park and Recs Department to cover every single park. And they do an outstand ing job with the resources that they have and really the lack of manpower that they have. So this Park Ambassador Program would be engaging the community to have people in those neighborhoods near those parks be another set of eyes. And there's people throughout our neighborhoods that do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 already . This would formalize the process and would actually make it a program . So I won't go through every single objective here and all that the volunteer s would be expected to do. And I will send that out to the rest of Council . But the objective , the overall objective here would basically be to bridge the line of communication between our Parks and Recreation Department and our neighborhoods and to have these volunteer s assist the City with the general maintenance , upkeep of the parks and close observation of the parks which will enhance not only safety for park visitors but provide an additional presence to deter crime and vandalism . And I think the most beneficial thing here is that it would encourage the community to take a really proactive approach and maintain ing the integrity and intended use of parks and green space throughout the City. The other thing on top of this program that I would like to see the administration engage in in the spring and the summer of next year is the potential program where there would be actual activities in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 parks. I know years ago with I think CETA workers, there was a CETA Program where they would have activities , baseball games, football games. I don't know exactly what that would look like yet. But it's something that I've spoken to the Mayor about. I think it's just another way to get our kids in our neighborhoods and our adults engaged in our park system. As I go through the City on a -- I think I mentioned here before all of you were on Council , because of the pandemic I've had an opportunity now to just to drive around the City because there was really nothing else to do and to take my children to the different parks throughout the City. And our park system is second to none. And we have to do everything that we can to keep it up, to keep it safe, to keep it clean and to work with our Parks and Recreation Department . And I've been very impressed over the last few weeks with Director Fallon and all the things that he's been able to do and with our employees in our Parks and Recs Department .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 So I think this Park Ambassador Program will serve to help them, to help our City to engage our neighbor s in our community . And I'm hopeful that by next spring that will become a reality . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROVING AND ACCEPTING THE CITY OF SCRANTON CAPITAL BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2021 PURSUANT TO SECTION 904 OF THE CITY’S HOME RULE CHARTER . MR.

Some of the questions that came up I think were really valid from my colleague s on Council . And there was two or three questions that I raised that I'd like answers to prior to final passage of the budget. So I'll get those to you, Mrs. Reed, if we can send those out. And that's all I have.

We do like to hear from the public on these matters. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF LACKAWANNA AND THE COUNTY OF LACKAWANNA TAX CLAIM BUREAU, WHEREBY THE RESPONSIBILITY AND RIGHT TO COLLECT DELINQUENT REAL ESTATE TAXES FROM THE CITY OF SCRANTON SHALL BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE LACKAWANNA COUNTY TAX CLAIM BUREAU. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , the first thing I'd like to say about this is finally . This is a long, long time coming. It's a long time in the making. I've been pushing for this since 2015. I was dumbfounded back then when the previous administration just would not entertain this. And recent reports about the corruption in that administration proved to me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 or would give us a good idea on why that the previous administration , the previous Mayor would not want to go through with something that literal ly would save the taxpayer s a significant amount of money now that the Tax Claim Bureau would finally be collect ing these delinquencies and not a private company . For example , every dollar that the county collect s, the City gets roughly 95 cents. Under the agreement with NRS, it was every dollar that they collected the City got 85 cents. You could do the math and find out that if you have the two of them, it's a no-brainer to go with the county to collect the delinquent taxes. The one thing that I want to point out here that I think is really important is when we enter into this agreement , we fall under the umbrella of a program that the county has that I think is really great and that's the Elderly Extension and Deferral Program . The Elderly Extension and Deferral Program basically helps our elderly resident s in the City of Scranton and throughout Lackawanna County, anyone over 65 years of age 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 or older has an opportunity to extend or defer the period of time to pay their taxes. So the goal of this program was to prevent our hardworking elderly people, those who have worked their whole entire lives from losing their residences and/or the equity in their homes as a result of unpaid real estate taxes. In fact, it was just coincidental that I was on the phone with a woman the other day who was very concerned about not being able to pay her property taxes for 2020 -- or 2021 as we continue to move forward . So I think this will give people, our senior citizens piece of mind to know that, you know, a private company is not going to come after them and try to kick them out of their homes now. It's going to be the county that has this program that's willing to work with them under certain circumstances . And I think that is very important . In reviewing this legislation , there was a few things that I noticed that will probably have to be changed and amended . And I sent that off to Solicitor Hayes to review. We do have two weeks now before, you know, we'll present any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 amendments . But I want to point out two things. Number one, in Section 3.1 under Certification and Transmission of Existing Delinquent Real Estate Taxes, I believe -- I know that it should say which are currently due and owing to the City for tax years 2020 and prior no later than January 31st, 2021. So the years were just wrong there. They need to be changed . Same thing in Section 3.2, annual returns of delinquent real estate taxes. The year listed should be 2020. There is some other minor things that I noticed that I pointed out to Solicitor Hayes to get his opinion on. The other thing that I mentioned and that we might want to consider is to extend the termination notice if, in fact, at some point in the future this ends up passing , the City or the county want to back out of it that we extend it from 30 days to 60 days advanced written notice. Thirty days I don't think is enough time, especially if there is a judicial sale or an upset sale occurring or about to occur. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 we also discussed whether or not we would consider maybe adding a clause that allows the City to reserve the right to engage the county to collect delinquent garbage fees in the future. So we're talking about whether or not that would make sense and what that language would look like. So overall , this makes total sense. It made sense a few years ago. But there was roadblocks in place that did not allow the City to move forward . I think the county will be a good partner here. And it's an overall benefit for the taxpayer s. And it's an overall benefit for the senior citizens . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF MARY BETH1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MIKOLAYCZAK , 413 ARTHUR AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18510 AS A MEMBER OF THE SCRANTON MUNICIPAL RECREATION AUTHORITY . MS. MIKOLAYCZAK WILL BE REPLACING KATHLEEN GALLAGHER WHO RESIGNED JUNE 18, 2020. MS. MIKOLAYCZAK WILL BE APPOINTED TO A FIVE (5) YEAR TERM EFFECTIVE JULY 9, 2020 AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE 18, 2025. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? I just want to take a minute and I'll just do this for this legislation so I'm not commenting on every single one. I want to thank all the people that are being appoint ed for giving their time, taking time out of their schedules to be a part of a City Board or a City Commission . I also want to thank those people like Mrs. Gallagher or Miss Gallagher who took the time out of their schedule and who helped the City immensely over the past few years with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 their service on these boards. The board that we're speaking about now, the Municipal Recreation Authority is an extreme ly important board in the City. And they're a very active board.

I asked Mrs. Reed for the bids of each company . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could just send that out to everybody so they could take a look, I think if you tallied it up as I did, Joyce's bid -- Joyce Electric 's bid was about $25.75 less an hour. I don't know if I added that up right. So I think we should request some more information there before final vote. I agree. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ?
