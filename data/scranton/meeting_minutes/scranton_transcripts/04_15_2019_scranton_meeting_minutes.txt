Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, just a couple of quick items. Mrs. Reed, we did talk about this a little bit in caucus, there is a street, Birch and Beech, there is a Boyland court, in-between those two streets on Boyland there is a city streetlight that is partially obstruct ed if can have -- by a pine tree. Well, it was last week. Whether the storms did anything to help us or not I don't know, but if we can have DPW take a look at that and see if there is something we can do to free that up I would appreciate it. Also, if we can send something out to Mr. Reed at DPW, there is a stop sign that's illegible at Jones Street and Davis Street if he can put that on or mark that for replacement to change at his convenience 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 that would be appropriated . And the only other comment I have is I just want to thank you to the DPW, fire and police. I know they worked some long hours overnight into today and they had some nice fast response times for a fast moving storm that encompassed the whole city. The city was -- I know my yard I was two hours late for work today just trying to clean up and organize so I can only imagine what that's like on a city scale. So just a quick thank you to them and I hope everybody is safe and getting back to normality. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I would also like to thank the police, firefighters , DPW and all other private entities who worked through the early morning hours and throughout the day responding to the severe storm that wrecked havoc throughout the city. After the storms last August that resulted in flooding throughout the city I requested a breakdown of the city's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 emergency management plan. I never received a response from the administration so, Mrs. Reed, would you able to send a request to the mayor for the break down of the city's emergency response -- or emergency management plan? Like I've said before, these extreme whether events are become the norm as a result of climate change. Therefore , it's imperative to have a plan in place that establishes a process to effectively respond to emergency situations such as the one we faced earlier this morning , not only for the safety of the residents of this city but also for the safety of our police ad firefighters, who are our first line of defense , when these severe weather events occur. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Mr. Rogan, and I forgot one. I know, Lori, we talked about this during the caucus about Mr. Srebro's issue and, Mr. Pocius, if you haven't sent anything out already would you please just send a reminder out to see when this is going to be done because I know he is aware 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 of it but just so we can get a timetable of it so we can report back that would be appreciated . Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. A speaker last week wanted to know what accounts the refuse are put in as they come in. It's fairly simple, as refuse fees are received money is deposited into an account designated as refuse account . This allows for the tracking of the fees. Each day there is an automatic transfer of those funds from that account to the general fund. That's how it's set up. As promised , I would like to expand on my comments from last week on the restoration of city hall. First, some additional observations that I didn't talk about last week. Based on my quick review there are over 9,000 square feet of space within city hall that is currently being used for storage , non-city use or space that should be clearly repurposed to another more appropriate use. There is also $15,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 square feet that is currently used for appropriate space like offices , etcetera , so clearly there is an issue as to how valuable space is being used within this building . I have had some discussions with the BA about issuing what would be called an RFI, request for ideas from interested parties to see if there is actually any real interest in purchasing and restoring city hall. I suspect that will not be ideas that would be reviewed as realistic and workable . Like most things in government , there are rumors and conjecture as to what could be done with the building , but at the end of the day I still have serious doubts that someone would come forward with a real and tangible proposal that would properly restore this building and make some enough sense in that restoration and we would actually entertain it, but as I said all along let's see what's out there, let's flesh out the ideas and move on from there. But along with that RFI I would press the administration for a second request . There should also be an RFP for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 professional space planner to do a top down review designed efficiency study on the use of every square foot of city hall. We need to develop a plan for an efficient footprint of a user-friendly , employee -friendly and citizen -friendly space for this building . This will be helpful in reviewing all of our options on an ongoing basis. But quite honestly , the current layout and design and use of space within city hall may be the worst I've ever seen in an office work environment . So at this point I would like to offer my recommendations if we do move forward on the much needed restoration of city hall. Number one, all of the exterior repairs as described in priority one should be complete d. Two. All of the interior repairs as described in priority one should be completed . Three. Some basic improvements from priority two, lists like the interior painting , etcetera , should also be complete d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Four. The city should hire a full-time archivist to deal with the issue of records retention and records storage . Records that are no longer required should be destroyed . Those required by law should be digitized and stored within the building if necessary , and outside the building if appropriate . Five. The city should hire a professional office planner , as I mentioned before, who would redesign every office and every floor in this building into something that only -- not only makes sense but works effectively and efficiently for the employees and the citizens that visit this building on a daily basis. Six. You actually have to implement the plan. So once the plan is implemented the city should develop a long-term capital improvement and maintenance plan using the Highland report as their template for further improvements down the road. Many improvements , particularly in areas like energy efficiency through hearing and air conditioning enhancement s and energy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 efficient lighting , can and should be accomplished aggressive grant writing because there is a ton of money in those fields out in the world today, and what would that cost? Well, initially priority one items call for an investment of $4.75 million . Even adding a recommendation of an archivist , the hiring of a professional space planner , the implementation of the recommendation of those experts and a built in contingency fund, maybe an additional one million in contingency money might be needed so that leaves us with a worst case scenario of $5.75 million . That's a far cry from the $10.7 million estimate for the full restoration which includes priorities one through priority four as well as within an aggressive contingency fund that's off cost included in that amount. So when this plan is implement ed you have a building with the exterior fully sealed and restored . A fully sealed and leak proof interior , all damage repaired and replaced and a redesign leading to a far more functional space, a far more efficient 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 municipal building than we have had in generations . So let's be clear, we don't have a people problem here, we have a building repair and restoration problem and we can addressed that with these recommendations . And we have a storage and records retention problem and we can address that with these recommendations and we have an office design and layout problem that we can address with these recommendations . Of course, all of this, of course, is my personal opinion but I'm sure there will be other opinions that we'll hear from and that's a good thing. The more ideas, the more opinions the better. The future of city hall is far too important not to have a full and comprehensive discussion on what we do from this point on. So that's all I have on in particular issue. And, of course, as I have done lately my final comment is every day is your chance to make this city a little better and that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. First, we received a letter from PennDOT that the city is going to be receiving their liquid fuels tax fund this year. We are going to receive $2,396,177.81 in the liquid fuels account so that could go towards paving. I asked last -- or two weeks ago about the city's plan for our paving program for 2019. I did receive something back from Mr. Bulzoni and he stated that they are looking at using approximately $1 million and maybe some other monies for a paving project and I did relay to Mr. Bulzoni that I would appreciate if they would consider council requests for what streets to put on the list because we do receive an awful lot of requests from different residents throughout the neighbor hoods. Secondly , someone asked me two or three weeks ago about the street sweeping program . We did receive a response from Mr. Gallagher . The street sweeping program will start April 29 in North Scranton from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Greenbush Street to West Market Street. This program street sweeping program will eventually be posted on the city's website so you can go and see where -- when your neighbor hood is going to be sweeped by the DPW. We did discuss in the caucus at this point we have three street sweepers and I have been saying this now for the last five years and it's fallen on deaf ears with the administration , but it does not make any sense to me whatsoever that we are have a street sweeping program and we are going to invest in that equipment but we are not going to have alternate side of the street parking . I know in my neighborhood , you know, the gentleman from the DPW do a great job, they come down the street, my whole block is parked on the right-hand side of the road or the left-hand side, so they don't get to the end of the street so they actually are not properly sweeping the streets, and it's not their fault, I think the city needs to design a plan for alternate side of the street parking not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 only for the street sweeping program, but as I have said in the past, with the snow plowing . And I have been told by members of the administration that it can't be done and I have told them are multiple cities on the east coast, all over the country , that have alternate side of the street parking for things like street sweeping . So it can be done. And, Mrs. Reed, I would like to send another plea to the administration that they put together a plan for this. As I said, if we are going to continue , and I hope that we would invest in the street sweeping program even as part of the storm water management program in the city we are going to need to take this more seriously and not just waste resources by sending a street sweeper off the street and not actually getting much done. So if you could take care of that request I would appreciate it. The third thing I have tonight we received a letter from the mayor that he is planning on appointing Dennis D'Augostine to the Ethics Board. Dennis D'Augostine is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 chaplain for the fire department . Now, we discussed in the caucus it clearly states in the Ethics legislation that no member that is going to be on the board may hold a position of employment or appointment with any municipal government or any board or commission formed by the City of Scranton . Now, I asked our Solicitor Minora to look at that further , I think it's pretty clear, but I would just ask the mayor to rethink that pick. I don't think it's smart to start off the Ethics Board by putting someone on who has anything to do with the city government , even though I'm sure Mr. D'Augostine does a great job as the chaplain for the Fire Department but that is a position that city council created by the request of the administration so I don't think that would be appropriate and think we will wait for the opinion of Mr. Minora but I think it would actually violate the legislation . Mr. Evans brought up the city hall condition and assessment report. Mr. Donahue made a motion a few weeks ago to ask the administration to come in to discuss 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 not only the assessment but to discuss what the current building maintenance plan is and what it will be. If we are going to sink all of this money, it that is the plan, to put money, grant money and city money into the building then what is going to be the plan moving forward ? So we still have not heard anything from the administration so in the caucus I asked Mrs. Reed if she would send another letter on that. There was a letter sent by my request February 27 to the city control ler and copied members of the administration about a $130,609.86 variance in the 2017 independent audit. We still cannot get an answer on this. We were told that they were looking into it. Mrs. Reed, I would like to send another letter. I don't know what is taking so long and I find it very concerning that you would have a $130,000 variance so where is that money and we should be able to get an answer to that. Also, one of the things that has been discussed in the newspaper , and I have heard a lot about it from phone calls and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 e-mails is the recycling issue with the recycling center not taking certain materials . So Councilmen Evans had sent an e-mail out asking for a public caucus with the recycling coordinator and I believe the DPW director so I believe that's going to being within the next two or three weeks. One of the items that I brought up in the caucus, I think it would be beneficial , is something that the Borough of Taylor did, if I can pull it out here for a minute, Lackawanna County has some sort of agreement with an application that you could get on your phone, it's called the Recycle Coach. So there was a news story on WNEP, I just happened to see it, I printed out the article , the Borough of Taylor is the first municipality in Lackawanna County to join this application that you could download on your phone and basically what it is if you download it you will have your schedule for waste and recycle pick up right at your fingertips so you can download it on your phone. It will send out alerts for when your recycling pick up is coming and when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 your trash pic up. Setting it up is really easy, all you have to do is put in your street address and you are done. In addition to the schedule , you can get a list of what you can and cannot recycle, which I think at this point would be very beneficial . If you don't have a smart phone and you can't use the app there is online version of what's called Recycle Coach that you can use through it would be the city's website , Taylor has put it on their website . So it is free so I would ask Mrs. Reed if we could send a letter to the administration asking them on our recycling department to look into that and to join that program . The other thing we brought up in the caucus, you know, the last five years as I sit up here on council , there is many people who come up with very good questions and many times council does not have the answer to those questions so we have to go through this process that to me is it frustrating where we have to go and ask the administration , wait for an answer, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 sometimes never get an answer, I have had actually had to do Right-to-Know requests because I could not get a response from the administration and it just is very frustrating back and forth that I don't think has to happen so I'd like to make a motion at this point that we send a letter to the mayor and the administration asking that the mayor and all department heads come to city council meetings quarterly for the year to discuss programs , initiatives and answer questions from city council . MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I have seen this done in cities throughout the United States. I'm not asking the mayor and his department heads to come every week because I don't think that's feasible but at least once a quarter . There are some goods things that go on in the city but for some reason in this administration it is like pulling teeth to get information . So if the administration and the mayor want city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 council to a partner with them and they ask us to vote on legislation I cannot see any reason why they would not want to come to a public caucus and tell us what they are doing at least once a quarter . And I think my colleagues , at least in the caucus, they agreed with that. So, again, it's not like they would be coming in front of the firing squad, we just want to know what is going on and we want to be able to relay that to the citizens of Scranton so I would hope that the mayor and the administration would take us up on that request so that we can start that program ash I think it would be very beneficial . MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : The last thing, I read 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 in the newspaper as other people did about a city employee who was involved in an accident on Birney Avenue and I was outraged by the response from the administration . They were asked by the newspaper whether or not this employee was on leave or if he was actively drawing a city paycheck, and the fire chief who responded refused to say. Now, I think that is totally ridiculous . I can understand a personnel issue, but there is no reason that someone who is getting paid with taxpayer funds cannot answer a simple question of whether or not a city employee is actively drawing a salary or if they are on some sort of leave. So I would like to ask as a city councilman for that information . I think it's very simple. I would also like to ask, because it came up in the newspaper, where this city employee lives. The newspaper has his address listed in Throop and the fire chief said he lives in Scranton so what is the actual address . Again, I know this is a personnel issue and you have to be careful , but I don't think that that's information 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that can't be shared publically . And, again, it frustrates me greatly that simple questions like this go unanswered . And this administration since I have been here has abused the Right-to Know Law. I have experience d it myself. I have asked for simple information that should be readily available that someone could hit a button and their computer and print it out and I have been told, well, I haven't been told I have just assumed because I was never getting an answer do Right-to-Know law -- or do a Right-to-Know request . Did a Right-to-Know request didn't take five days now it takes 30 days. So this administration in my experience is abusing this Right-to-Know Law, and again, this is a city employee , this should be information that's readily available . Is he collecting a paycheck or is he on leave. That's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple of comments . I'd like to echo what my colleagues mention ed to thank our police, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 fire and DPW for their work with what happened with the storms last night. I know East Mountain and the Hill Section really got hit pretty hard. Some other areas of the city fortunately not as bad, but I want to thank them for all of their hard work. Just a comment and a suggestion that was brought up once again this week regarding not collecting the garbage of those who don't pay their fee. Again, can the city do it? Sure. But is it the most practical way to find a solution to this answer I don't think it is. I do think the suggestion that another speaker brought up at the beginning of the meeting does make more sense of pursuing action at the magistrate 's office while collecting -- continuing to collect the garbage . I know it sounds nice to say, "Well, if they don't pay they shouldn 't get picked up," and I agree with the sentiment , I really do, but the practical reality is in the middle of summer when it's 90 degrees out do you really want a pile of the trash on both sides of you because your neighbor didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 pay their garbage fee. Again, we will be discussing this much more next week at our caucus and obviously it's been a very hot issue of late. Another issue that has come up over the last week similar to the garbage issue is recycling . We did get flyers distributed to us and I know I had a lot of residents asking me questions about what can be recycled what can't be recycled . I'm going to go through some of those now, but I also want to read off this is a phone number for Scranton 's recycling coordinator . If you have any questions , please call this number. 570-348-4165 and the e-mail is Recylcing @scrantonpa .gov. So if you do have any questions on what can or cannot be recycled feel free to reach out. I am going to go through some of the information on these flyers that we were given. First I'm going to go through the items that are a "yes" with a thumbs up for recycling . Glasses and plastic . Jars. Bottles and jars. Rinse out bottles and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 jars. Throw away lids. Cans, aluminum and steel, tin cans. Rinse out beverage cans. Throw away lids unless attached . Newspaper s, phone books, magazines , catalogues and brown bags. It says to stack them in a brown bag or tie them, obviously you can put them in your red can as well, and office paper. It says if it's paper that you would write on you could recycle it. The list of "no" items, and I will say I was surprise d at a couple of the these that I had myself had myself been previously putting my recycling bin that are not recyclable . Number one, margarine tubs. Deli and yogurt cups. Plastic and foam dishes. Plastic bags. Bakery boxes. Light bulbs. Plate and window glass. Drinking glasses . Ceramic cups, plates and cookware. Flower pots. Paint cans. Motor oil or chemical containers . Cereal boxes. Food wrappers . Bubble wrap. Tyvek envelope , that's the plastic -type envelopes and books. So some of these that are on this no list to me were very surprising . I know I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 have been putting some of these items in my recycling as well so there are these fliers available . There is also another flier available as well that lists the same information just in a more colorful format. And I do want to reiterate that, unfortunately , this issue was not unique in Scranton . The global recycling market has changed as it's been reported in the newspaper quite a bit as to what happened but the city does not set these standards . These standards are set by the county recycling center and it is important that residents go by the standards because if loads are rejected at the recycling center they would then go to landfill , so as I mention ed if anyone has any questions I'll say the number one more time. You can contact our recycling coordinator and that's 570-348-4165. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the on the question ? Two weeks ago I had asked Mrs. Reed to talk with Mr. Bulzoni about a contract that the city passed -- or city council passed, Resolution 176-2017 that was intended to assist the Licensing and Inspections Department with rental registration database compilation and management . This was for a three-year period. I wanted to know if that process was halted during the rental registration lawsuit period. I also wanted to know if Mr. Moran, who was in charge of the company to do this work sold his business and/or partnered with Community Champions who apparently is now performing this work. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Mr. Bulzoni responded , "He complete d his data compilation which was used by the rental registration clerks. Some information was, unfortunately , a duplicate but the clerks were behind at that time so we accepted all of the data. It was useful. We decided not to use his payment system since I don't think it offered enough technologically and the lawsuit wasn't resolved anyway. I also didn't like his insistence is distributing funds monthly . He is in not in way affiliated with Community Champions . I confirmed that with Community after I had the rumor as well. That may have been approximately a year ago. Hope this helps." You know, I want to do a follow-up with Mr. Bulzoni . I'm still confused on the whole arrangement . I did vote against this contract three years ago because I didn't think it was appropriate and it wasn't going to be helpful at that time based on the people we had in the department already doing the job for the most part so I am going to follow up on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Also, we did not receive a response to my question about section ten in this legislation which was about the rental escrow program . Section ten says, "in addition to all other penalty and enforcement remedy established by this chapter or by any other Scranton ordinance including , but not limited to, the property maintenance code owners and landlords of residential rental units within the municipality of Scranton shall be subject to the municipality of Scranton rental escrow program which is hereby established by this chapter ." So I just had a basic questions on what the plan is to enforce section ten because often times what I found is that we pass legislation with no thought as to how we are going to enforce certain sections , and then as Mrs. Schumacher pointed out quite a few times years later we find out that, you know, part of the legislation was never enforced or was never followed so I did not receive a response to that question . I'm still going to vote for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 legislation because basically all it is is taking into account the judgment regarding the lawsuit , but I would like Mrs. Reed to please follow-up again so that we can understand how the city is going to enforce section ten if somebody who is going to pay the rental registration fee does not end up paying it in and the city is going to escrow the rent how is that going to work. So that's my question . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Evans. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 111, 2019 – AUTHORIZING SUPPORT OF RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA , AN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PLAN WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL $4.5 BILLION TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA COMBAT BLIGHT; DEVELOP STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND FLOOD PLANS; PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS; AND INVEST IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ; WHICH WILL BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON IN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend the final vote on Item 7-D. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , this infrastructure improvement initiative from Governor Wolf will be funded by a common sense severance tax. We are the only natural gas producing state in the nation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that does not have a severance tax on natural gas extraction . Whether you live in a county that actually produced natural gas or not the negative effects of that industry effect us all, whether it's mor frequent heavy truck traffic on our roads, the disposal of fracking sludge into our local landfills , gas pipelines through community or cutting down thousands of trees on the side of West Mountain for an electrical transmission line. If we are going to deal with these negative effects to this industry we must demand something in return. This initiative will allow the revenue from a severance tax to be reinvested in communities through out Pennsylvania to position those communities to be prepared fro 21st century problems such as the lack of high speed internet access, critical flood control infrastructure , helping families who experience flooding rebuild , effective storm water initiatives and blight demolition redevelopment and green infrastructure to just name a few. The time to address these critical issues is now and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 I fully support this initiative . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: On the question . I do agree that this proposal is significantly better than previous proposals for a severance tax but on the face of it I do not support a severance tax. I think the natural gas industry has been good for Pennsylvania so for that reason I will vote no, but I do think this proposal is significantly better than previous proposals. Anyone else?
