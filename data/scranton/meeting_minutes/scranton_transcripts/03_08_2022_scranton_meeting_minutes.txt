DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So Saint Francis of Assisi Kitchen would like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 me to read a Public Service Announcement and this is through April 27th.

DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just want to recognize that today is International Women's Day which is a global day that commemorates the social, political and economic achievement s of women. Women in different parts of the world use this day to come together to celebrate one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 another and rally equal treatment and representation . It's also my daughter 's first birthday . So happy birthday to Dillon. That's everything that I have tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements at this time? Okay. I have one. This Saturday is parade day in Scranton . The police department asked me to announce the following : So the parade begins at 11:45 on Wyoming Avenue in front of the Cathedral . The Scranton Police Department will be closing several streets in downtown Scranton at 9:30 a.m. for the parade. There will be no on-street parking in the area between Penn Avenue and Jefferson Avenue and Lackawanna Avenue and Vine Street. The Scranton Police Department and its law enforcement partners will be conducting a full spectrum of operation s to ensure the safety of all persons at the event. The officers will have a zero tolerance policy for any public intoxication , open containers , mischief , disorderly conduct , or any other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 criminal conduct . We're asking that if any persons do see any suspicious activity to contact 911 so our officers can investigate . Drones will not be permitted to be flown over the parade or in the staging areas. SPD also asked that if you're going to be drinking alcohol , please drink responsibly and have a designated driver or use public transportation , taxi, Uber or Lyft to travel home safely. And also to gain access to the Marketplace at Steamtown , you will have to enter through the westerly side of the Marketplace near the bus terminal . This weekend is probably one of the biggest events of the year for downtown Scranton . So I'm hoping that we could kick off a new sense of normalcy this weekend . And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I want to thank Mr. Voldenberg for kindly e-mailing me the 2020 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 audit. Thank you. Better late than never. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, just on that note, that will be in Third Order next week too. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. I don't know if any of you had any time to go through it. A lot of people find audits dull and mind-boggling . But there were some interesting things in there. First, I want to remind Council that according to the Home Rule Charter Section 313, you are required to publish a fiscal summary of that audit in the local newspaper . So I'll be watching for that. I didn't see it in the last year or two. Maybe because you all were on Zoom. There was a -- obviously it covers the year 2020. And so it's like 14, 15 months out of date already . But there are a lot of items of interest . One is we have the eternal adverse finding which you will always have because the Scranton Parking Authority does not provide financial statements . And I don't know how that could ever be resolve d because they're just not going to do it. And that's an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 automatic adverse finding . MR. DONAHUE : I think that's -- yeah, I think that's an issue because they don't have financial statements . MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand because of the way we sold them off and everything else. MR. DONAHUE : Well, it's not sold. It's leased. But I get your point. MS. HODOWANITZ : You can't tell them what to do bottom line. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : The Sewer Authority , of course, they noted that they have a different fiscal year than the City where they end on March 31st. And, of course, nobody could tell them to get off their duff and hire an auditor and get their audit done, so they don't. But you didn't get an adverse opinion for that. There was some good news if you look at page 48, the net pension liability as of the end of 2020 was 51.6 million dollars which is not all that bad. And there was a net pension gain in the fund of 7.2 million dollars . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that reflects a good stock market return. I don't know what's going to happen in 2022 because right now the stock market is totally out of control . But there was another number that you should be tracking and always sensitive to. And that's called the net other post employment benefit liability otherwise known as healthcare for retirees and their responses . And at the end of 2020, that figure was 236.5 million dollars . And, you know, healthcare is like the stock market, out of control . You have to be -- people worry about pensions . But that's the other number you should worry about. What is the status of the union contracts , still in negotiation ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still in there, yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : My nephew pointed out something to me a few nights ago. Where he works, his union is negotiating their contract . And they normally look at the standard inflation rate of 3 percent . But as you all know, inflation is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 also out of control 7.5 percent and climbing . And I just wonder if the firefighter , police, clerical unions, DPW if, you know, if I was a union rep fighting for their contract , I'd say don't give me 2.5 percent or 3 percent . I want enough of an increase to counter that spike in inflation because that inflation 's not going down next week. It's going to go up. So, you know, I could see the union contracts going into arbitration . I looked at the police and fire. And if you play around with the numbers , you're looking at something like a 2.5 or more increase . But I think they're going to demand arbitration which is going to impact that budget. There's some other interesting things in there. If you look at subsequent events, I think it's page 56. Of the 1 million dollars budgeted this year for court awards, you've already lost $775,000 in lawsuit settlements in 2021. So it's interesting reading . But last but not least, what I'd like to know is, two weeks from today when Mr. Patel's 35 day contract as acting treasurer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 runs out, who will be the treasurer of Scranton ? Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. I'm -- Council President , I'm glad that you brought up Ukraine in your remarks today because in my opinion , the leader of the free world is there. And I wish him the best as he confronts the Russian military . And I hope that everybody is paying attention on TV to the innocent victims being killed by the Russians there. But I have a question for the Council President . And that question is, do you feel you have an obligation to inform the resident s of this City of any kind of City business that was conducted in the City prior to you becoming Council President ? MR. DONAHUE : Such as? MR. MORGAN: Well, the cost of the street signs in the City of Scranton and where the funding came from. Do you feel obligated to inform the resident s where that money came from? MR. DONAHUE : As it relates to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 street signs? MR. MORGAN: No, as to where the funding for the new street signs that we had placed before you were Council President where that funding came from. MR. DONAHUE : That came from the Street Sign Department that prints out the street signs. MR. MORGAN: So you think that the City of Scranton made its own street signs in the beginning and they weren't purchased from anyone at all? MR. DONAHUE : That's my understanding . MR. MORGAN: Okay. Do you think that the -- you owe to the resident s of the City of Scranton how much the -- PEL was paid over the course of the 30 years that the City was in distress ? MR. DONAHUE : I could find that information for you. We get -- there was grants paid for by the State Department of Community and Economic Development that covered PEL's cost while we were under the Act 47. MR. MORGAN: Well, that would be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 nice thing to tell resident s. And I'd check on the street signs too. The other thing I think the -- that maybe the residents would like to understand is, was the City budget ever reduced? Were there any real cuts in the City budget during the 30 years that the City was in distress ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. You'll have to go back and look. MR. MORGAN: Well, I mean, as Council President , don't you think that maybe you should inform the residents during the course of 30 years in distress how much the City government itself reduced cost over that timeframe ? MR. DONAHUE : I'll ask for that information , yes. MR. MORGAN: Okay, because my personal opinion is -- and like I stated here before, there's time for a rewrite of the Home Rule Charter . And that's only the tip of the spear. Okay, there's just so many unanswered questions . And I think that the City residents need a lot more control over their government . I just don't know where the City is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 going, going forward . And this isn't a shot at any particular Council member. But if you've lived in this City your whole life and you look at this City and you see the blight and you see the amount of taxes -- and you have people screaming for reassessment. And the vast majority of seniors are selling their homes because they can't pay their taxes. And you have State Senators and State Representatives not finding an alternate way to create revenue and take, in my opinion , the hellacious burden of property taxes off the backs of ordinary working people. And there needs to be some answers found. And, you know, the other thing that needs to be found is that we need to start knowing where all of the community development money is going and where it's been spent in the past and how it was invested in the City to benefit residents . You know, I mean we just have so many questions . And I think if the Home Rule Charter was rewritten , we could restructure this government so that the residents themselves could determine where community 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 development money was going. And because I think the people in the neighborhood s know where money needs to go, just for some reason it never gets there. So I'll wait to see your responses . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Have a good night. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , well, tonight my words of hate are directed towards this crazed Russian . He has to be the Hitler of the 21st century . In just two weeks he's destroyed a beautiful advanced country , murdered. When you see it on television it looks like America . You know, Putin destroyed and bombed illegally and killed citizens that just two weeks earlier had everything in the world. It's very -- it's great sadness for me to see this man. I honestly believe that if we had a man in the White House which we don't, this wouldn't have happened . Biden won't have been -- if he just took some actions against everything immediately . But according to the news, he's worried about Iran right now or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 what's going on. Iran would probably attack people just like this in the future. You know, I watch on television people that got relatives over there right here in town. It must be so sad because I saw on television a man was standing there and a bomb came and exploded behind him and killed three people in a family. A lot of us have never seen death. Of course, I have in the hospital . But death is the price we pay for the privilege of living. But it's not suppose d to come with bombs from this Russian butcher . This country is in dire need of some leadership . A couple weeks ago the paper had a little note where the Mayor wants a half million dollars for interpreters . This is ridiculous . People aren't going to assimilate ever be Americans when you just don't force them to want to be Americans . Like I said -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, I just want to -- that's for the police department . So if they encounter somebody that, you know, speaks a different language , they have the ability to communicate in a public safety 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 situation . But that's -- but I just want to clarify that that's what that's mostly used for. MR. ELLMAN: All four of my grandparents learned . They were citizens and they had to learn English and everything . Now no one wants to. I've been to Texas. People born in this country , you can't understand them. That's not right. Let me tell you something real quick. When I was in the Air Force we had to fly B17s from World War II. And I flown probably to half the cities in the country at night. There comes a point of no return where you have to go forward even if you have engine failure , if somebody got a death in the family, whatever . This country isn't going forward like it's supposed to under the Democratic leadership . I often differ with some of the Republican statements . Just the future -- just two weeks ago, the future of this country stinks compared to two weeks ago what people thought of and had dreams of because who knows what's going to happen with the -- they say gas 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 and prices are going to be high for quite a while, not just -- I just don't see a good future right now with the way things are going. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , in taking a look at the Mayor's memorandum for wearing masks, I've always come to the Council and talked about the legal wording and the (inaudible ) are in the details. In section two, there is a section for unvaccinated individuals that if they are guaranteed for the period of guarantee , they will need to utilize paid time off unless otherwise by law. What strikes me about this is not putting a policy forward , but it looks just by the writing to be punitive to people specifically who are unvaccinated people. The paid time off is not for vaccinate d or anything else, it specifically references only directly under the unvaccinated individuals . Now, I don't agree with being unvaccinated . We'll argue about that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 But I do have a question when there is a punitive punishment written specifically into a section of a policy that's not uniform across the board. It smells like targeting people who may not be appreciated and might cause conflict . The second other point section three, isolation , though it may come from CDC or other guidelines, it informs the employee to stay at home and to wear a well-fitted mask if you must be around others in your home. As much as I understand the policy and with my own mother I am secure to wear masks whenever I'm around her if I might be near someone who was exposed. Putting in a City plan a requirement that when someone is home they must mask up and follow procedures is a completely different statement from what they must do in the office. When you step in the home lives of employees who are off the clock and tell them they must follow policy of mask wearing at home, that line starts to cross over the border of what is a reasonable power. Leaving from that, a couple -- two years ago -- and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 respond ed to the Parking Authority 's message last week about not wanting to put out a press parking space about their concerns . I do understand concerns about people throwing pieces of paper that say press on the windshield . Philadelphia had that same experience because on Sunday they do have parking hours in Center City and for the churches in Center City they actually -- churches hand out pieces of paper that say they are going to church services . And they got printed on the internet and sold on eBay so the population could park anywhere they wanted to in the area of that church free of parking on those Sundays . It's a legitimate concern . But as I stated beforehand, with the City of Philadelphia as an example , they created a placard. It has city logos. It has date stamps on it. It has a registered number for it. They control the parking by going into the city and you apply for this permit from them and they hand it out. It is not something that just gets thrown on the dashboard and the City of Scranton has the latitude of making 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 something just as similar for the City. I'm not asking for a lot. I'm asking for it to at least be brought up for a discussion on whether it will go forward or not. I understand the difficulties because in doing this, there is some impact of one space to the City of Scranton . But that impact is not much. And I ask for just like with the sound ordinance , give it a year, give it two years, give it a trial period. See if there is actually a detriment to the City by the loss or use of one space. And as for the argument that there are loading zones and/or parking spaces in front of City Hall that are accessible for 30 minutes only, that's not a comparable situation . You cannot do research on anything in 30 minutes. That's meant to walk in, get something and walk out. I hope you'll consider it and move it forward or at least give me a response on whether or not this issue is dead. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . My first question is, the shooting at Weston Field this past weekend , was that in the building or outside ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it was outside on the basketball court side. I believe that. I'm not positive about that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. Now I'll move onto 8-B even though it's been moved again. Why this property ? The county assessor 's office records do not include a 524 Penn Avenue. So who owns the property ? Well, it stated -- and I did reach out to the City administration and asked for the property identification number for 8-B. And they were unable to provide it as well. So that's an issue with me. Now, while it's stated as a gateway property to Pine Brook, it is not in the boundary of revitalization orders. And driving through to the opposite end of this project there appears to be a lot of blight that should be addressed , you know. Actually the first several blocks into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 revitalization area just is all commercial . I think there is one house in about six or seven blocks. And I know when I was growing up and going to school, to me Pine Brook started where -- at Capouse Avenue where Penn turned into Capouse . But now the photo of the higher numbered portion of the 500 block of Penn Avenue that's in the backup does not appear to be unkempt . The stated purpose of this project is allowing operations to return to normal. Normal for this lot was Al's Mobile Mart. Does this mean that it will become a gasoline station again? The stated specific goals go to the -- to be accomplished with this grant are to make ground water safe for community members and to minimize the negative impact that the containments have on the environment . So the next question is, how long has this property been contaminated and by what government department ? Anybody know? MR. DONAHUE : I do not. I could get that information for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Does the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 City have an inventory of nonfunctional gas station s? And does the City have a plan to cleaning them up as they do this mystery property ? If so, I nominate the former gas station on Moosic Street. That is a gateway to both just not downtown but to the heads of -- headquarters of both the county government and the city government . And it's terrible . So I do ask for if they're going to continue doing this -- these kinds of project s that I nominate the property at Moosic and Meadow Avenue to be cleaned up. But the bottom line with respect to 8-B, there's just too many question s to move forward with this. And I would hope there will be answers to the questions tonight for next week. And I also think that on a different subject , the Governor told us we could become a third class city because of our falling population . Now, I know we don't have to but I think in -- this City should put together a committee and see what the differences are between a 2A and a 3 and how they help -- each 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 of them help the taxpayers and allow the taxpayers -- maybe even put it on the ballot. I don't know. It depends on what the outcome of the committee would be. But I think that needs to be done in fairness because our population does continue to go down. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn . Everybody hear me? I'll keep my mask on. You don't want to see my ugly mug anyway. All right. I do read the paper every day. I was very pleased with the article that -- excuse me -- that all or most of the disagreement s between the Mayor's office and Council have been worked on. Hopefully we could put them aside because we have an awful lot of other problems confronting us. And once again, I'd like to call attention to this. I'll have to drop it after this week. Fiscal watchdog budget report because political blast point in school funding fight. Now, apparently years back they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 always felt that -- certain parties felt that they should see improvements in test scores. And that's just grand. But furthermore , lack of funding for a school from state entities means that we'll have to fund it. It will mean that property taxes will go up whether you have kids in school or not. I don't argue about that. Everybody should pay property taxes. You get $15,000 year alone to send your kids to school. And anybody that just attended school, well, just think of the opportunity you were given. We didn't have those opportunities in the 60s. It was just into the space program and more important that we're in church every morning or something . Anyway, I'd also like to address externalization of liability with business . And the reason I'm doing it is because on several occasions I have seen wind of the (inaudible ) at DeNaples Landfill dumping over -- either they're looking into dumping it into the stream that is very near there which flows in the Nay Aug gorge or run pipelines to the Nay Aug gorge.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 We don't need their pollution . Years back you threw everything in the trash in an automotive garage, whatever -- whatever wasn't -- had no value anymore like an old oil filter, anything , contaminated containers . You name it. I worked in a plant and I had to bring in OSHA as a representative . I was the chief union rep. And they were dumping trichloroethane waste and old grease from a scrubbing machine . And the representative from OSHA was told about it where you were dumping it out into the middle of a field. And he said that's okay. That's not illegal . That was 1976. So things were improperly done for years. We don't need their leachate in Nay Aug gorge. It's nice to just at least have one clean stream going through town before it gets all the mine water from the (inaudible ) hole in Old Forge. And we got to watch out with the stock market here because we took an awful hit back in 2007 with police and firemen . I hope that don't happen. I fully support Ukraine . And as -- somebody is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 little confused here. A couple years ago we were all busy giving Putski a pat in the back there, you know, he's such a great guy and he's so talented -- the last -- two weeks ago too. And, well, as far as the antivax crowd, please go out and get vaccinated because it's just a matter of time matter of time until we get another variant and we're all back in masks again whether we like it or not. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUMACHER : The only comment I'm going to make is there were a few small outstanding request s I had with Frank. So I'll just follow up with you. Nothing major. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. So back in June of '21, DPW had a hydraulic fuel incident on Clearview Street. I was there. I took a look. It was terrible . Fluid was everywhere . It was coming out of the ground. It was deteriorating a roof. So after seeing it like I said firsthand , I was told along with the resident s that an adjuster would be out. I just heard recently that this has never happened . And the fluid now that it's warming up a little bit is still present on property sidewalks now oozing from the ground and still deteriorating that roof. So we were told everything was rectified . So, Mr. Voldenberg , could you please give me an update of all correspond ence of this issue that we thought was rectified ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with all parties, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Also another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 concerned resident brought to my attention they're looking for dates on the debris removal associated with the garage on Wyoming Avenue so if you could please look into that. And this is another concern ed resident brought this to me again that for a third week in a row -- and I brought this -- we sent this over or you did, Mr. Voldenberg , maybe a week or two weeks ago. But it's the third week in a row garbage is being put out three days early at 1717 Wyoming Avenue. It's for sale. And supposedly the owners don't even live there anymore. They live in Dunmore . So the neighbors aren't sure what's going on here and whose garbage it really is. But it's violating the ordinance and being put out three days in advance for three weeks in a row. So if you can please follow up with that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And then I want an update. I know we received some correspondence because I brought this up, well, the past two weeks about exonerations and fees that shouldn 't be charged and should have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 worked out last year. So could you please provide me an update from the Treasurer 's Office about exonerations , all right, the process that isn't being communicate well to the public and what's going to happen with that because I'm still getting contact ed about these fees, fees that are not owed and still being charged , complaints about exonerations from last year let alone this year. Resident s are being told that they will get back to them but it doesn't seem to be happening. So if you could please inquire about that the status of the exonerations and where we're at with acting treasurer who claim he'll be taking care of them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then also -- another -- I got another complaint over in West Side in front of Vitali's Market at 1711 Jackson Street that somewhat of a sinkhole opened up towards the gutter. It's not huge where a car is going to fall, but it's a hole in the ground. And I was sent a picture that all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that's been done is a wooden horse put over it and two cones. So can you see -- find out if that's been taken care of or when it's going to be taken care of, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just in terms of -- and I'm sorry for failing to mention this in caucus, but in terms of the garage issue on Wyoming Avenue, I was in touch with Mr. Young yesterday and I also spoke to Eileen Cipriani with OECD. So what's happening there is they have to -- they have to adjust the emergency declaration based off new information in terms of what is in the hole. And the reason they have to adjust the emergency declarations because that then requires them to go and readjust the DEP permit. So I was told that they, you know, that should be signed -- that an updated emergency declaration should be signed by the Mayor and then go down to Controller Murray. I was told today. I don't think it did go down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 today but I will follow up and see where that is tomorrow . And then the process after that is they have to send it down to DEP to get the updated permit. But once that's done, they already have the funds available to do -- to do that clearout. They've already rented the back truck that's going to be used to help in that. That's one of the pieces of equipment that we don't have in DPW. But -- so hopefully that could start being cleaned out within the next couple weeks, you know, weather permitting . I'm sorry for not mentioning that in caucus. In terms of -- I will look into Miss Schumacher 's request regarding inventory of former gas stations . And I would like to see Moosic -- the gas station on Moosic Street be in that. But this is something where the property owner has to apply for the grant. You know, for the Al's Mart, the property owner applied for the grant. There's no City money. They applied for the grant. But they have to use the City as the conduit and/or passthrough . And they are providing the matching funds for the grant. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 The City is not providing any matching funds or any funds at all for that particular grant. And those grants are open to all City businesses . They could apply for them. And then, you know, they have to provide some sort of match. Also, in terms of I believe it was brought up last week about LIPS Department overtime . We did get a response from Miss Cipriani on Friday that the City's housing inspectors respond to emergencies in the City such as structure fires, burst pipes affecting electrical systems , vehicle crashes , infrastructures , hoarding situations , police request s for assistance at properties unfit for habitation , after normal work hours and on weekend s. The housing inspect ors are collectively bargain staff and are paid overtime for work outside of normal work hours. The housing inspect ors have respond ed to 19 requests for assistance from the 911 Center since January 1. So that's the response we got on that. And also we did get a correspondence from Representative Welby regarding something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that was brought when they were in in terms of tax exempt properties . So he did write to us that this is a topic that has disturbed him for years and that aggravation is growing as we're adding more and more properties to the exempt list. But there was two things that he brought up is, one, he signed on as a cosponsor to House Bill 1702 that if approved will provide funding to communities that have an excess of tax exempt property in their taxing footprint . That legislation is expected to be introduced shortly . That would provide a dedicated state funding source to municipal ities that have 15 percent or more of its overall assessed property value as tax exempt properties within their municipal borders . This legislation would establish Tax Exempt Property Municipal Assistance Fund using revenue generated from the 18 percent liquor tax levied on all wine and spirits in Pennsylvania to provide funding to municipal ities with high levels of tax exempt properties . Municipalities with high levels of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 tax exempt properties are facing difficult fiscal decisions . A shrinking tax base makes it difficult for some to provide the basic services expected from local government . By providing annual funding to these municipal ities, they could stable their fiscal situation and enable them to maintain essential basic services to ensure the health and safety of their citizens . And it goes onto say that this particular would be particularly beneficial to Act 47 communities , county seats, cities and any community with a major institution of higher learning , a large nonprofit healthcare facility or consider able state forest or game land. He also wanted me to mention that he has begun working with Lackawanna County to review some of the properties in Lackawanna County that are categorize d as exempt. It's his opinion that some of these properties do not meet all five criteria necessary to meet the purely public charity standard . Also, as we are all aware, some of the taxes that property owners lease some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 their space out to commercial entities . I hope that we can -- he hopes that we could finally get an agreement from some of them to agree to pay property tax for a portion of their property tax is being leased or rented out. And he also provided some more information just on PA's tax exemption and also pilot issues. Those are two issues I definitely agree with because we've all seen that especially where you have for profit companies that operate under the umbrella of a nonprofit institution and, therefore , don't pay any taxes at all but they are for profit companies . And that's all for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ACCEPT $50,000.00 FROM LACKAWANNA COLLEGE TO HIRE A FINANCE DIRECTOR IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON IN THE 2022 BUDGET YEAR. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. DONAHUE : Second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so I disagree d with this position during the budget process . And my position has not changed . Grants -- they require a lot of work and they are hard to come by. But they seem to fall out of the sky for unbudgeted position s that aren't sustainable or going to be sustained . The past two proposed budgets remind me of the old Oprah Winfrey show where she used to say, now you get a car, you get a car, you get a car. Now, City Hall is saying with the past two budgets , now, you get an assistant, you get an assistant , you get an assistant . We have exited Act 47. Our business office needs to stand on its own feet like I said last week. Our business office needs -- our administration , I'm sorry, needs to hire individuals with appropriate skill sets and expertise for these positions and not try to shore up assists for everyone using private funding . The money these grants are coming to the City would be better spent in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 neighborhoods . So I'll be voting no. And that's my reason why. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I've been present ed with some of the needs that the administration is saying that this position is required for. This discussion was had at budget time. Also at that time I was against adding legacy costs to our budget. That is the main concern of mine. I think before we get into a position like this we need to look at maybe a consolidation of job duties, providing job description s. And I also don't like the fact that we're working around the official budget process . So I wouldn't be opposed to having this discussion going into next year's budget process . I came from the school district where we had to scale back some of the positions that we had at that point in time. I'd like to take a look at this office and how it operates currently this year before we add to our budget. So with that, I will be also voting no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 to 5-B as well as 5-C. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'll be vote for favor -- in favor of this being introduced tonight . At the time of the budget last year I was in favor of including this position in the budget. I still voted for the budget despite it not being included . But seeing as we've receive d a grant, I would like to see how it goes over the course of the next year with this position . I feel that it would be helpful for that department not having PEL there. I don't think it's fair to say that PEL didn't provide us any assistance over the years and the course of the three years that we were under Act 47. And I think that there are certainly plenty of duties that are laid out under this position that might not be being fulfilled now and something that we would need -- that would justify this position for. So for those reasons I'll be voting in favor. MR. DONAHUE : I will also be -- on the question , I will also be voting in favor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I was in favor of the position with the budget. But at the same time, you know, that was a compromise budget. I think we have to do more -- we have do a better job of long-term financial planning in terms of cash flow and such and especially as we leave Act 47 and the fact that this money is coming in the form of two separate grants. I think that's also beneficial . And I think it also provides a system where you get a, you know, you get a work product out of that. And we get to assess that, you know, going into the next budget year. If we're not satisfied with the financial , you know, the finance director that's paid for through these donations , if we're not satisfied for that, we won't have to approve that in the budget. But at the same time, we've seen time and time again for years that we overspend on police and fire and we underspend on everything else. And I think that is a detriment to our -- and that's not to say that the police and fire don't deserve to be paid what they're paid. But when you are not funding the finance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 department and the business department the right way, when you're not funding LIPS the right way, when you're not funding DPW as much as you should, those have bigger long-term implications . So I will be voting yes on this. All those in favor signify by saying aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed? MR. MCANDREW : Nay. MS. SCHUSTER : Nay. MR. DONAHUE : So tie vote, so I don't know how we're going to deal with that but I'm guessing this will be in Fifth Order again next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.
