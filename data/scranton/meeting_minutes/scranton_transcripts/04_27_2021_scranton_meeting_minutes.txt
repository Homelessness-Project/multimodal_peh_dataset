AGENDA FOR THE NON-UNIFORM MUNICIPAL PENSION BOARD MEETING HELD APRIL 21, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So tomorrow once again our friends at Friends of the Poor will be having an emergency drivethrough food giveaway , 2:30 to 5:30 at Scranton High. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : I have one too. Effective today, April 27th changes were made -- or changes take effect for the Pennsylvania Move Over Law. It requires approaching drivers who are unable to merge into a further lane to reduce their speed by 20 miles per hour less than the posted speed limit. It imposes two points for failure to merge into the lane not next to the emergency response area. Sets fines at 500 for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 first time offenses -- for first time offenders , excuse me, 1,000 for second offense and 2,000 for a third subsequent offense . Just a reminder too when you're on the highway , if there's an emergency vehicle or any vehicle on the side of the road to move over into the other lane. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple of quick announcements . Tomorrow there will be a Pridework community popup event, the revitalization program that is hosting over at National Bakery on Capouse Avenue. That's going to be at 11 a.m. And it's a press conference but it's also an opportunity to learn about their revitalization plans, sign up for committees , find out some more about it. And then I know Mark had mention ed the Friends of the Poor. That was on my list too. But also, I don't believe we've mentioned here that coming up is going to be Observe Scranton Week, which I believe is the first time that they are doing this which will be a celebration of Jane Jacobs who was a famous author who had written the Death and Life of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Great American Cities. And she was born in Scranton . And there's going to be several events going on throughout that week May 4th through the 8th. And more can be found out about the events on the Observe Scranton Facebook page or at Observe scranton .org. I know that the Fringe Festival is hosting a StorySlam that week and then the University of Scranton is also hosting a community event. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I just have one. As I mentioned earlier , a public hearing will be held next Tuesday , May 4th at 5:45 p.m., for Item 5-B on tonight 's agenda. The Historical Architectural Review Board's denial of the Certificate of Appropriateness by Joyce Outdoor Advertising for signage at 539 Linden Street. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor, Bev deBarros, Jeanie Davidson , John White and Marie Schumacher .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows : I keep hearing about drug use on the increase caused by the isolation from Covid. I was wondering if some money from CARES Act could be used to purchase , distribute , and train people to use Narcan? The one dose I purchased with insurance cost me $50. Not everyone has insurance or extra money to keep Narcan on hand. It should be in everyone 's first aid kit. If the mayor does her pop up tents around the city again this summer, she should distribute Narcan along with the recycling bins. It should also be made available at these vaccine clinics . MS. REED: The second submission is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 from Bev deBarros as follows : Dear Friends . ~ About the position of Parks and Recreation Director ~ Brooke Newhart sounds ideal for the Recreation part, but, is maintaining the parks also her responsibility ? Could you elaborate on that part of the job description ? MS. REED: The third submission is from Jeanie Davidson as follows : Council , On Monday, April 26, 2021, City Hall employees experienced IT issues that were preventing us from using our emails, scanners , and faxes. In and of itself, this does not seem like a big deal, but to a worker that relies on these functions to perform their jobs, it is a big deal. My question , is, How can the City operate an IT Department with “ONE PART TIME” employee ? We are paying an astronomical amount of money for this BEDROCK company to assist in the IT department , why don't they have someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 set up in house? Today with the issue, the help desk was called, the response was from the part time employee stating that he was in class, and would try to resolve the issue when he was done. Needless to say, and not by any fault of this young mans, but it was hours before the issue was fixed. I would like to know what the true function of this company is, and why there isn't at least one of them stationed in house to help with everyday issues. I don't understand how it is ok to operate this way. We have endured many changes , many protocols and rules not being followed , we are trying to abide and do our jobs to the best of our ability , but more so than not, there always appears to be a technical issue somewhere . If this company is hired to handle only the “Big Stuff”, for that amount of money, then I think we have all had the wool pulled over our eyes. MS. REED: The fourth submission is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 from Mr. Jack White as follows : I live in the hill. Near nay aug. The best. Some issues, however . The neighborhoods here are beautiful , and for the most part, we citizens take care of our properties . But we need the city To lend a hand. While the gas company is currently making cuts in our streets and avenues , they leave a lot of debris behind, dust, dirt, tar gravel, etc. Don't you think it would be a good idea to, shortly after the cutting and before the dust settles on our windows , porches , cars and LUNGS. Clean as you go? Let's work together Scranton council to help us to keep our neighborhoods clean, healthy and safe. Thanks Ps. Send the neighborhood folks an e-mail or text message over a few days before the cleaning crew is coming. Maybe odd-even for parking ? Thank you for your time and attention . MS. REED: And the fifth and last submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 O Would you please provide a list of the can and cannot uses for the $69.9 million we are borrowing from future generations and the status of when it will be available for spending . O I am opposed to the 5C Resolution primarily because the backup is not very helpful in providing just what impact this will have on Scranton residents and visitors to Scranton . Before this is voted upon I would like to know how this may impact Pennsylvania 's existing statutes . Please advise us of the position this Group takes, if any on the PA Stand Your Ground Statute . Also, should other municipalities take positions not 100% in sync it could cause confusion and avoidance of Scranton . O Will the 2020 Audit be received on time this year. (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I had a couple of things. First to Miss Nestor, regarding her comments on Narcan. I do feel that we should have it more readily available . I've previously attended events where it's been given away. So I was surprise d that she had to purchase one for $50. And I know that awhile ago the Pennsylvania Department of Health was really pushing for the distribution of Narcan so that it was really available to the public. So I would be interested in finding out more on how we can help with the distribution of that as a city. And the second thing I know some other Council members were making comments on the submission we received from Miss Davidson. But I believe that the purpose of the emergency declaration from last week was so that we would have a function ing Help Desk with IT. So I was disappointed to hear that, you know, she had difficult y getting a response and help from them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And I know that we've had, you know, our problems with Council with being able to access e-mail as Councilman Donahue mentioned earlier . So I would like some more answers from them. I did have a chance to just briefly review what Mr. Deeley had sent over to us earlier in the day which detailed some of the reasons for the emergency declaration and included like specifications on the position s in that department and what tier some of the employees are and what we're missing there. But it didn't -- I don't believe that it explained , you know, how Bedrock is currently operating and why we might not have the Help Desk there full time. So, yeah, I would be interested in getting more answers from them on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, on that point, I mean, we've -- we added jobs into that IT Department . I understand that there's two jobs that are yet to be filled. But there still should be three people that are budgeted for and are apparently on the payroll . But we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 can't seem to get IT support anywhere . I know we've all had issues with our e-mails. We've had issues with our Granicus accounts . I had an issue with my Granicus account since last year that still hasn't been resolved . So I read my agendas just like everybody else does where normally we get them in our system a couple of days before they're posted to review, to give us more time to review before we vote on them the next week. But so I think we, you know, we need to send correspondence to the administration to see who exactly is our IT support person that Council can reach out to directly on those two issues. I mean, in terms of, you know, what we do, not what office workers do; but what we do, you know, really is just Granicus and e-mail that we have to deal with. And I think those should be simple fixes but apparently they're not. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , so I'd like to address Mrs. Davidson's IT issues. You know, we're not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 a modern stone age family from the town of Bedrock; but we're at Bedrock 's mercy right now. We're paying $12,700-and some dollars a month. They've been here a while. I feel bad for these employee s. That can't do the basic function of work every day. So I agree let's send some correspondence . Let's see where we're at. I received a thing from Mr. Deeley today. I haven't really had time to go through all that. But we can't have these problems day to day. These should be rectified . And I know we're looking for an IT director since January . How many people applied ? Were any people interviewed ? And the two other positions , where are we at with that? So I look forward to an answer to some of these questions . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, so as well, I would like to echo the other Council men and women with the issues of the IT Department . I know three or four weeks ago I had an issue with my Granicus . And I was scrambling at the last minute to try to get an agenda. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So I know the frustration there and that was only one day out of the week. So I can't even imagine how that would be having to go to work with those issues. So I hope that gets cleared up and we get to the bottom of that. In regard to Mrs. Schumacher 's comments , looking into that -- the alliance , I'm not really sure where they stand on a few different issues. But I think stand your ground one was the one thing that they were opposed to. So I think her concerns are legitimate there and for that I'll be making a motion to table that tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. GAUGHAN : I will now entertain nomination for the position of City Clerk. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to nominate Frank Voldenberg for appointment to the position of City Clerk effective May 3, 2021. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'll be voting no for Mr. Voldenberg . It's nothing personal . But he wasn't my choice. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? On the question , I'm going to be voting for Mr. Voldenberg . I want to thank everyone who applied and showed interest in this position . I personally was very impressed with Mr. Voldenberg 's resume and background . I think he brings a unique skill set that I belive will serve this Council and the public very well. Mr. Voldenberg has already performed a lot of the duties and exhibit ed many of the skills throughout his career that I believe are necessary to be a successful City Clerk and maintain the integrity and efficiency in our office. So I'm pleased to vote for him 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and I look forward to working with him. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Roll call, please. MS. REED: Mr. Schuster . MR SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. REED: Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. The motion is adopted . Frank Voldenberg is hereby appoint ed City Clerk pursuant to Section 406 of the Home Rule Charter effective May 3rd, 2021. So he will officially start this coming Monday. And as Kevin mentioned in the caucus, we are working on an arrangement to keep Mrs. Reed on for at least two additional weeks to help with the transition. So there would be more details to come on that as we firm things up there. And since this is Lori's last meeting, I would like to give her an opportunity now to say a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 words. Lori? MS. REED: Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . First, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Voldenberg on his appointment as City Clerk. I wish him all the best. And I offer him any assistance that I could provide for a smooth transition . I also wanted to again state that it has been an honor to serve the City and especially you, the Honorable Council members , and for placing your faith and trust in me and for your friendship and support . Former Councilman Bob McGoff was the first Council President that I served under. And I had the utmost respect and deepest sense of appreciation and gratitude for him. I also have to mention former City Clerk Jay Saunders who actually hired me 18 years ago. And I think of both of them often. And I'd like to thank Maryann Kitlas who I've work with in Council 's office at that time. Another former City Clerk who provided his time and guidance to me which was just invaluable when I became City Clerk was Mr. Frank Naughton . And I'd like to thank your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Solicitor Kevin Hayes for all of his support . It has been a pleasure working with you. And finally , I have to thank Sally Locher from the City's Law Department for her friendship and support over the years and also to Kathy Carrera from Council 's office for always going above and beyond for the betterment of the Council and for all of her assistance as we navigated this past year despite all of its challenges . Thank you again, Council , for allowing me this time. And it has been truly my pleasure to have served as City Clerk. Thank you to all of you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Lori. And I know I said a few words about you last week. But I just want to say again that, you know, your dedication and your hard work is sometimes under extreme ly difficult conditions was unbelievable . You really did a very good job for the City of Scranton keeping these meeting s running really without a hitch. And I'm actually disappointed that we're not able to do this in person and this past year has been very, very difficult with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 the pandemic trying to put these meeting s together and Lori, you know, has just been an unbelievable asset to us to make sure that these meeting s were able to go on relatively quickly as soon as the pandemic -- as soon as things shut down we really got things up and running rather quickly . Lori, your reputation and your commitment to the City of Scranton as the City Clerk in my opinion is unmatched . Now, I'm biassed because I had the opportunity to work with you even before you were the City Clerk. But I really feel that you have done an amazing job. And I personally have learned an awful lot from the way that you were able to handle all kinds of different personalitie s in City Hall and in the public and on Council and all the different situations with grace and professionalism . And, you know, people can really learn from that. I've learned from that because it's easy to get bogged down and caught up in the minutia . But Lori was always able to look past that, see the good in people. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 bottom line was to get things done to make sure that Council meetings ran professional ly and she just did a really good job. So, Lori, enjoy retirement . I don't live that far from Lori. So I'm sure I'll see her and we'll all be calling her, you know, for advice and whatnot. So enjoy your retirement . You deserve it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Lori. MS. REED: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Lori. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'd also like to thank Lori. You know, I think Councilman Gaughan mentioned having, you know, worked with her for a period of time. But it doesn't take long to work with you to know the type of work ethic that you have and what you bring to Council and to City Hall. And not only that but even like our neighborhood Facebook group recently someone had asked a question about how to contact Council and I mentioned , you know, contacting you and that that would just be for another week or two before you retire. But even the kind things that people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 have said on there about you, I mean, the people in the City know just how hard you work and how helpful you could be or have been in that position . And we'll really miss you going forward . I wish you the best of luck in your retirement . I truly hope you enjoy it. And I also look forward to working with Mr. Voldenber g. MR. SCHUSTER : Also thank you, Lori. Thank you for your service to the City. And I wish you the best of luck. MR. MCANDREW : Lori, thanks for everything and I mean everything . I don't know how we're going to do it without you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Voldenberg has big shoes to fill. MS. REED: Thank you everybody for your kind words. It was my pleasure . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay. Mrs. Reed -- oh, I'm sorry. I say that in my sleep; Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I feel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 like I'm at a wake. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I just have a comment . So as Chairman on the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to say that I was thrilled to see that the police last week went through bias training . And I was even more thrilled and I think the public needs to know that this wasn't a reactive training or proactive , this training has been going on for several years. And I'm very glad to see it and proud of it. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I just have one thing or two things really. I think we all received an e-mail from a gentleman that was just trying to find some information regarding liens that the Law Department couldn't provide any backup for. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 His father had passed away. And he's just trying to settle the estate. So I did forward -- I just saw that today. So I did forward that along to Mary Jo Sheridan just to see if the Treasurer 's office has anything there. And also since we've had just -- and then on a DPW issue, since the fleet manager has been in a position for a while, Mrs. Reed, before you go, one more request for you. Would you be able to just request a list of all DPW vehicle s and equipment , how old each is and then where each piece of equipment is currently being stored? And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Just a couple issues, the first one we received an e-mail. I received a personal e-mail. And I'm going to call this gentleman tomorrow . I just receive d it late this evening . We received something from State Representative Marty Flynn's office regarding a gentleman that lives at 1031 South Webster Avenue. And he's having continuing deteriorating issue with a stream that curls around his property at the corner of South 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Webster and Elm. Apparently this has been going on now for a number of years. The property has been reviewed by City officials in the past. And apparently they were under the impression that this area was being included in a previous recent grant application . But the project was not included in the final application . So this gentleman is looking for help. He e-mailed me. Like I said, I'm going to give him a call tomorrow . But, Mrs. Reed, if we could send something to the administration making him aware of this again to see if we can get this gentleman some help. And I will make a few phone calls tomorrow to see what I could do and be up to speed on what's going on there. I mentioned this in the caucus. I'll just mention it again for the record, there was an article in the newspaper about the Nay Aug Park Pool. And there was some confusion I think between Council and the administration . I was under the impression after reading the grant application that the City, in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 fact, chose a specific option for the pool, the option that cost 6.2 million dollars . And I was surprised by that as was stated in the newspaper because I did not know that that was the option that the City was going to choose. I did have a conversation this morning with the Mayor and Eileen Cipriani , the Director of OECD. And they stated that no final decision has actually been made on the design or scope of the project at Nay Aug Park, the pool complex . So that will occur during the design phase of the project . And Council and the Recreation Authority will be involved in that decision making process . So obviously over the last month and a half, two months we had provided our input. The firm that did the analysis came in twice along with members of the administration . And that is going to continue now at the later part of this process . One of the things that was pointed out in my conversation today and in the followup e-mail with Miss Cipriani was that the RFP for the -- to select the engineer ing or architectural firm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that actually does the design and permitting work that -- the process is anticipate d to take about nine months. So this isn't anything that is going to happen overnight unfortunately just by the nature of the process . The other thing that I know I've gotten question s on from the members of the public is can the City use -- and I think Miss Schumacher asked a question about how are we going to use the -- or is the City going to use the ARP funding , the American Rescue Package funding . As everyone knows, it's been well-documented . We received 69.9 million dollars . We have not officially receive d that money. It's designated to the City. And according to the Mayor and Eileen Cipriani this morning , they are awaiting regulations on how that money can be spent, the regulation as to the manner that the funding could be spent. So as soon as we have that, I think then the process and the conversations will kick in about how exactly we're going to fund this project . As we know on the agenda tonight we have a grant requesting 6.2 million dollars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 in funding with a little over 3 million dollars as a match to DCNR. That determination on whether or not we're awarded that grant will take place in -- sometime in 2022. It's not guaranteed that we're going to get that full amount. So those conversations will take place over the next few months. And as everyone knows, I've made this clear in my comment s. I do think that we should go for the -- it is the more expensive option. But I think it's important that we do this the right way. We don't cut any corners. And I know that the Mayor and Eileen feel that way as well in talking to them this morning . We want to make sure that we, you know, have an impact up there. And if we're going to replace it we do it the right way and make sure that we get the best bang for our buck. And I think -- oh, we did receive a response from Mr. Deeley on the IT piece. Again, we've received this kind of late this afternoon . So I didn't get a chance to go through the whole thing. But I did just take a look as the Council meeting was going on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 to answer Mr. McAndrew 's question and this was identified in a letter that as we know the Director of IT has been a vacant position since January of 2021 according to Mr. Deeley. They've received five resumes that met the minimum requirements for that position . Two candidates progressed to second interview s. One candidate was offered the position but declined due to a counter offer from another employer . One candidate does have a second interview that was I think scheduled this week. So according to him they may be getting close to hiring someone . And there is other things in here that I haven't -- a couple pages long. I haven't had a chance look through it. Okay? All right. That's all I have. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GUN SAFETY ALLIANCE . MR. SCHUSTER : At this point in time I'd like to make a motion to table Item 5-C. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion on the floor to table agenda Item 5-C and Councilman McAndrew seconded that motion. On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question I just feel we're starting -- Council is starting to get into things that are out of the jurisdiction of a municipality . MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'm a huge advocate of increasing gun safety laws. But at the same time, you know, we don't -- given the backup we were given there is nothing in terms of what this alliance is advocating for specifically and who is involved . So I think once we get, you know, some more information on that from the administration I would be willing to entertain this. But I'll vote to table until we receive more information . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I agree. I'm going to vote to table it just because I do think it's important to know, you know, who's actually involved in this group, what does our membership actually entail? Is it just to support the group's goals which we don't know; and it's not clear in the -- there is nothing in the backup legislation that really states all the information that we would need to give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 our okay on this. And then there is a sentence in here that says that the City wishes to support the group's activity by becoming a charter member of the Gun Safety Alliance . So I think we need more on what actually that activity is on things of that nature. And like Council man Donahue said, I support gun safety 100 percent . I don't have a problem with that at all, universal background checks. But I do think we need to know a little bit more about the group before we give our stamp of approval . Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'll also vote to table the motion. As I mentioned earlier in caucus, I am also in favor of gun safety laws. But I would never want us to sign onto something when we don't know what we're supporting , what legislation this organization is pushing or what our support would mean or entail. I mean, we really need to find out that before -- before we can make an appropriate vote on it. So that's it. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'll be voting to table also. I do believe in gun safety. But I also respect , you know, the rights of the legal gun owners. So like I said in caucus, I mean, this is to join a membership with very little information . I said it earlier like, you know, AAA membership you know what you're getting . But with this membership I have no idea what it entails. I have no idea what the reaction or, you know, have we looked for input from, you know, our local Fraternal Order of Police or like Solicitor Hayes said, you know, the DA. You know, is this accepted by other cities, which ones? Is this, you know, accepted ? Are there members from, you know, the DA Association across the state or the FOP memberships across the state? So without that information , of course, I'll never vote on something I don't totally understand . So that's where I'm at with this. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the question ? Okay. There's been a motion and a second and on the question to table agenda Item 5-C. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and 5-C has been tabled. MS. REED: 5-D.

MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this is an outstanding project . This is going to be a huge investment that the University of Scranton is making. I fully support this project for one major reason it's going to help not only the University retain students but I think and I hope that it helps the City of Scranton retain that talent. According to the grant application , the closest university or college that has this type of program is Wilkes. There is only seven other Jesuit universities out of 27 across the country that have this type of major. And it's going to help retain that talent to work in industries like automotive , H-vac, aerospace , biotechnology , computers , electronic s, manufacturing . So it's going to improve -- hopefully improve our regional workforce. So this is a great project and I thank the University of Scranton to make an investment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 not only in their campus and their student body and in their program but in the City of Scranton as well.

ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , another exciting project that I hope gets funding from the state. It's going to have a huge impact on our downtown, these buildings . These three building s are currently vacant. And there's -- they have a very historical nature going back decades in the City of Scranton . So again, this is good for our downtown and good for the City of Scranton . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , again, another great project . And I'm a product of the Scranton School District from preschool all the way up to 12th grade. And I had great experience in the Scranton School District . So did all of my friends growing up. And I am always concerned that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 school district is getting knocked around terribly all over the place lately. We need the school district to be strong in order for the City to be strong. I know it's been stated here since I've been on Council and it just goes without saying but as the school district goes, so goes the city, really so goes the county. So this is the least that the State of Pennsylvania can do is to fund this project and give us help with our schools . And going -- looking through this -- the backup information in the grant, and obviously we have former school directors in the meeting today, everyone is fully aware that there's so many issues in our schools with maintenance needs. I used to work at South Intermediate when I was a substitute teacher , the boiler down there, all of these things that are going to benefit our students and ultimately benefit the City of Scranton . So I fully support this project . And I truly hope that our state legislators and the Governor is going to approve this and make sure they get the full amount. Anyone else? All those in favor of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH SMART RECYCLING COMPANY , INC., TO PERFORM DEMOLITION WORK WITHIN THE CITY. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I was thrilled to see this legislation in this contract with this company to demolish these properties . Several of these properties have actually gotten phone calls on and e-mails over the last few years. And finally the City is taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 action to demolish these properties . As everybody knows, there's always one home or one property in each neighborhood throughout the City, sometimes more than that that needs to come down, is blighted . And people -- it just takes down people's property values; and it's a hindrance on the neighborhood . So I'm thrilled to see this. And I was also thrilled this morning in talking with Director Cipriani that there is more of this to come. I do think -- and I know that the City is going to work with the land bank to make sure that when these properties are taken down when they can be adjoined with other properties , the neighbors sometimes will want to take care of them to expand their yard and potentially put some of these properties together with other properties so that they are buildable through the land bank. So I'm hopeful and this is going to be -- that this is going to be done rather quickly because of the nice weather and we start to see our neighborhood s improve. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, on the question , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 I agree, you know, looking through this list of these properties a lot of them, you know, have been problem properties over the past three years. So I'm glad they are being taken down because they are eyesore s in their neighborhood . But I will, you know, restate my -- what I said in caucus that, you know, we still need to have an overall plan to avoid getting to this point with properties because most of time, like you said, going into the land bank but most of the time we tear down properties in the City, nothing will ever be put up there so the land bank is the only option. So we need a better overall plan and strategy to avoid, you know, getting to this point as much as we are right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I'm excited too because , you know, the majority -- not the majority of complaint s, but we get a constant flow of complaints concerning building s that need to come down. So I'm glad to see it's finally going to happen. And I'm sure the public is going to be thrilled to hear this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 too. MR.
