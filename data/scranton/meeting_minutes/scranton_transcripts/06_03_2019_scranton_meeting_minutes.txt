Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern . MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: I just have -- I have a couple quick ones. I was looking at -- I mean, we had the one issue about safety at Maple and Pittston . Pittston 's just when it's high traffic time, Pittston is just very difficult , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 especially with parking on both sides of the streets . It gets very blind. I know we talked about Orchard Street. I know Hickory even and we talked about Maple. I did take a quick peek at the street view. There is some marked crossing lanes. But they are pretty faded, especially the ones where the high traffic is on the Pittston side as opposed to the Maple side. It's not an end-all be-all fix. But if we can have something sent to PennDOT to have that area repainted and maybe even highlighted a little bit better, make sure there's a school sign there with South Intermediate four blocks away. That's a busy road. The parallel street down from that is Cedar. There is a light at that intersection which is inducive of safety. But the one there on Pittston Avenue and Maple, that does not -- that just features a faded crosswalk right now. So we could definitely use some extra signage and have that paint freshen ed up. That could be done quite easily I think. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Secondly , there's -- I've been dealing and talking with an owner of an establishment about possibly having an issue with their occupancy permit. And they have been going back and forth with the Licensing and Inspection Department . And they haven't really gotten too many answers that have eased their minds yet. So I told them I would help them be a liaison . So if we could send a letter to the LIPS Department . The occupancy permit in question is the business at 3025 Pittston Avenue. It's called Vape Shop. They had an inspector in there. And they said there was an issue with their occupancy license , which I was there. It's hanging on the wall. It's within date. I didn't see any issue with it. But they were confused on what the issue could possibly be. So I told them to ease their mind we can get an answer sent to us so we can kind of explain that back to them. But they were very concerned because as far as they're concerned they have done everything right and correct ly. And they have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 been operating there without issue for quite some time now. And we don't want to see that relationship sour or end with the community or the city. So if we can do that, send that out to Mr. Hinton and get the answers back for them. The only other think I have is, I got an e-mail with some pictures of a broken street light. The street light is at the intersection of Kirst Court and Kane if we can send something out to the Department of Public Works. I will send you -- also forward on the picture s, Lori, to kind of describe it. It looks like the housing where the wire is, the box fell. It detached . And maybe the elements got to it. And that's why the bulb is out. But as of today, the street light is still out. I did do a followup to see if maybe it triggered some kind of alert to have them fix it. But it is not fixed. So if we can get someone on site there. It looks like to me it's going to be just more of a bulb replacement . There might have to be some wiring that needs to be taken care of as well and the housing reestablish ed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 That's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: A couple of things. I was approached by several residents over the last few weeks to specifically tell me what an excellent job the DPW did during the recent storms, many times working late into the night helping residents throughout the city. So that's always very encouraging to hear that they are out there doing a great job. A speaker made a comment about one of the Council candidates . I'm sort of still shaking my head about that. But I happen to think that change is good. And different viewpoint s should be encouraged and fostered and listened to, especially in the government sector. So that's all I'll say about that. Stormwater was brought up. The County Commissioners passed a resolution last week that they are against any and all stormwater fees that they will not support what some politicians now like to call the Rain Tax. Of course, the term Rain Tax is now the fashionable political sound bite for stormwater fees. So as I stated before many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 times addressing stormwater management for the municipalities that have been identified as being mandate d to address this issue is something that will have to be done. For many cities and towns up and down the valley, letters and resolution s saying you don't want to do it does not allow you to opt out. It doesn't allow you to ignore the reality of your situation . That is why I continue to favor a regional approach to this issue to reduce the cost, not only for municipalities themselves , but ultimately to the individual property owners as well. But if elected officials want to continue to feel good about themselves by railing against this unfounded mandate , then that's on them. But dealing with this problem is the law of the land. And just because some want to walk away from an opportunity to lead, should not mean that we should have to buy into what they are selling . We will never have the local government . We will never have the state government . We will never have the federal government that we want or deserve until 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 elected officials stop making decisions based on the political ramifications of those decisions . This latest example continues to point to the fact that so many of our elected officials continue to view their decision making process es through a political prism and somehow and some way that has to stop. As my custom weekly and finally , every day is your chance to make this city a little better. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. The first comment I would like to make is regarding 913-915 Eynon Street. I had the opportunity last week to meet with multiple neighbors of this area, of this block. And this property at 913-915 Eynon Street is in my opinion one of the worst that I've seen in person anyways in my five years now on Council . The interesting thing about the 900 block of Eynon Street that I did not realize is that this house at 913-915 is condemned . There is I think in total four or five condemned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 homes on this one block. So, you know, the neighbor s and I -- one neighbor joked that it's literally nightmare on Eynon Street, similar to the movie Nightmare on Elm. The neighbors are literally being held hostage by this one home. The doors have fallen off. One of the doors was boarded up. That has fallen off. I had just been able to peek inside of the home. And it is in total disrepair. I'm not an engineer . But it looks to me like it's beyond rehab and beyond any repair. According to one of the neighbor s, there was an oil spill at one point in the basement . The city condemned it because of that and told the homeowners they had to have it professionally cleaned up. DEP at some point I think was called in. So we're still not sure what happened there. There are holes in the roof. There are rodents , garbage , extensive damage on the outside and the inside. So I had inquired with Mr. Hinton. I would like to note that this property in question has been a problem since at least 2007. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 So it predates even this administration . Mr. Hinton did reply quickly, which I really appreciate . He said and I quote, "This property has been tied up in litigation with the courts for years. The property is current ly condemned and the city will be going back to the court to ask for relief from the last order so we may proceed with enforcement action. The property was never slated for demolition at least yet." So I had asked Mrs. Reed which she did and I appreciate to send a followup to the Law Department of when exactly the City will be going back to court, what this process looks like, what the timeline is. One neighbor when I was out there last week was told that Judge Munley at one point gave the owners three months to rehab the property . That never happened . We would also like to know have the owners ever been in front of the Housing Appeals Board? There is a rumor that they put a bond, a $10,000 bond up to stave off the condemnation . If so, I would like to request a copy of those minutes from the Housing Appeals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Board. So at this time I would like to make a motion to send a letter to Mayor Courtright , Licensing and Inspection 's Director , Pat Hinton, and the Law Department , Solicitor Eskra asking that the property at 913-915 Eynon Street be put on the demolition list as soon as possible . MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . This in my opinion after, you know, going out and touring the property and the area. This is now a public safety emergency . God forbid this house ever goes up in flames. The proximity to other homes on this block is very close. As I mentioned , apparently there's an oil leak in the basement . It's a fire hazard. There have been rodents . And the people that own the home are from Flushing , New York. And apparently they're seen sporadically , you know, to cut the grass once in a blue moon. In fact, some of the neighbors were actually taking care of the property in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 back and cutting the grass, which is sad in it of itself. So this motion basically is to ask the City Administration when they can when we find out what has to happen through the courts, to put this on a demolition list as soon as possible because the neighbors should not be held hostage any longer. MR. EVANS: On the question . I'm just going to touch on something I talked about in caucus. I've been asking for the Administration to do top down review of LIPS for probably years. And my recent conversation with the BA is that we're going to get this done. The RP should be going out shortly to hire a consultant to look at License and Inspection for policy issues, fees, fines, the operation itself. And I think what Council man Gaughan just described is symptomatic of a bigger issue. And a bigger issue is, you know, let's get this right. Let's get a department that is function ing at high level. I'm not blaming anyone that is there now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 I just think there is a lot of procedure s and policies that need to be addressed and need to be taken care of. And we need to have professional s come in here and look at it from the top down and then move on. So that's my only comment . MR. GAUGHAN : And the neighbors when I was speaking with them last week would like to invite -- and I said in the caucus I would provide the contact information -- invite any Council members and any public officials in the city to come out and view this block and tour this block because it is really unbelievable . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and so ordered . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I receive d a request from resident s in the 200 block of South Hyde Park Avenue. There is a storm drain completely filled with dirt. It is the only one that works on that side of the street. Every time it rains, the water comes all the way up to the sidewalk s. So we contact DPW and they quickly responded that Pennsylvania American Water Company will send someone out to take care of that issue. Two requests , Mrs. Reed, to put the 1300 block of Smith Place, if possible , in West Scranton on the paving list. And also Mrs. Jefferies request ed that East Mountain Road, if that's possible as well. We actually received good news. We received an e-mail from the Business Administrator that the city received a significant savings from the Commonwealth Discount Card that was used for the city's health insurance . By utilizing the Performance Health Discount Card, the city saved nearly half a million dollars in healthcare costs from May 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 1st, 2018 to March 30th, 2019. So kudos to the Mayor and the Administration for going through with that program . Obviously , we've seen a huge benefit from that. Mr. Evans had brought up the meeting that we're going to have with PEL which we've been having now for the last few years. I think that's really important just to get an update on our progress toward exiting Act 47 which is coming relatively soon. We did receive as I mentioned earlier proposals for engineering service s for the paving project that were open Friday, May 17th. There were several companies that bid. And we are waiting on a decision from the administration . I wasn't here last week because I was ill. But I do want to take an opportunity to thank our District Attorney , Mark Powell and our Chief of Police, Carl Graziano for taking the necessary steps and working together to temporarily shut down the Castle Club on North Main Avenue in North Scranton . Council sent a letter to that effect May 14th. And the District Attorney and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Chief of Police quickly acted on that and I really appreciate it. We also followed up with our solicitor on possible legislation to have clubs that are BYOB, bring your own beer to close down at 2 a.m., even if, you know, they don't have a license through the LCB. So we are working on that. Solicitor Minora is continuing to take a look at it. And there will be hopefully a meeting held soon between Solicitor Minora and the City Solicitor , Jessica Eskra. I would like to thank them for the quick action on that. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just two brief items. And I have to double-check. I know East Mount Road was brought up a couple times. I'm almost positive I saw that road on a list -- one of the lists regarding paving. And I do know a lot of the roads up there are going to be paved by the water company , Moltke. There's a few others that there's work going on that will be paved this year as well. I know we inquired on that a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 times. Just one item that I wanted to bring up. We did receive a letter from Northeast Revenue Service . This was on May 29th. It was address ed to the Mayor and Council was copied on it. I'm not going to read the whole letter. But this is just regarding the delinquent garbage bills that have been a hot topic for quite some time now. I'm very encourage d with one of the items that was mentioned in this letter. And I'll read this part. It says, "While we will continue to aggressive pursue delinquent accounts through filing liens and our collection procedure s, we recommend the Lackawanna County Sheriff 's Office conduct Sheriff Sales of habitual delinquent properties ." And then there's an attachment that goes through and gives the breakdown on how this will be handled. They're proposing moving the top 10 delinquent properties to the Sheriff Sale. And they're saying that they will pay all the costs associated with moving those properties to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Sheriff Sale. I did have a discussion -- this was following the caucus that I wasn't able to attend with a representative from Northeast Revenue . And we did discuss this a little bit. I mention ed at the time and I still believe this is a very good idea. If we start with the largest offenders with the Sheriff Sales, keep working our way through , I think it will finally be able to put, you know, put this issue to rest and get people to pay their bills. Unfortunately , this is property specific . So I know some out-of-town landlord s that owe very large sums on multiple properties have come through . My understanding is that this will be property by property . So if somebody owes $20,000 on 10 properties , they probably wouldn't be on the top 10 list yet. But somebody who ones, maybe a four-unit multi that hasn't paid their garbage bill ever would probably be one of the top offenders . So I think getting this over to, you know, to the Sheriff Sale and look at some other ideas is a good step. And I hope that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the Mayor will take this recommendation and run with it. I know I fully support it. And there is a number of other items that we discuss ed in our caucus. We don't agree on all of them, but I think we're having a good conversation on a lot of different items that we can do to receive the money that's owed to us and come up with a better system in the long-term because this current system just doesn't work. You see the people that just don't want to pay aren't paying. And it's not acceptable . And I think this is a good step. But there's much more that we can be doing. MR. GAUGHAN : Can I just add one thing? I'm sorry. Because this subject is of great public interest , would we be able to -- and I'll make a motion if I have to to put these -- we have two letters from Northeast Revenue Services with a great deal of information in them. So I would like to make a motion to put the two letters -- letter from Northeast Revenue Services to the Mayor, May 22nd and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 letter from Elliott Greenleaf regarding Northeast Revenue Service to our solicitor in Third Order for next week. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. EVANS: I'll second it. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and so ordered . MR. GAUGHAN : And I would also like to ask -- I'd like to make a motion that we put -- the Mayor sent a letter -- somehow I missed it and I apologize , May 6th to Council in response to a letter that I had sent. I would like to make a motion that we also put that in Third Order for next week. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. EVANS: Can we talk on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 question or do I have to second it? I'll second it. MR. ROGAN: On the question . MR. EVANS: The only thing on the question , I'm not sure if a letter directed to a Council man should be on. I don't know. That's up for discussion . MR. GAUGHAN : No, I -- MR. EVANS: The others were directed to Council . So I didn't know if that was a personal letter to you or not. MR. GAUGHAN : No. This was to the Council . The only reason I bring that up is because in Third Order it does say reports and communication s from Mayor and heads of department and interested parties and city clerks. MR. EVANS: Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : And just to reference the letter as well, we had asked about the delinquent refuse collection . And I had asked that the Mayor would be interested in reevaluating the contract with NRS taking a look at different options and different solutions whether we take out the middleman and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 bring in inhouse if that was an option that they would be willing to look at. And we did receive a response . It says, "With regard to your inquiry on reevaluating and rebidding the city's contract with NRS, the Business Administrator and Treasurer are contemplating this issue further . And the City Solicitor is reviewing the contract . With regard to your question on taking a more aggressive approach to collecting delinquent refuse bills, the Business Administrator and Solicitor are evaluating all available options. I understand what you're saying if it's like a simple e-mail we don't have to put it in Third Order. MR. EVANS: Not only that, I was more concerned it was a personal letter back to you. It's not. It's to Council . MR. GAUGHAN : It's to the Council , right. And I think maybe we could discuss just making this a matter of practice if we receive a letter from a department head or from the Mayor to the Council that we can put it -- automatically put it in Third Order. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. ROGAN: I don't see a need for that. They're all public records anyway. So Third Order would be 100 items if we put every letter that we receive . MR. GAUGHAN : No, what I'm saying is just from the Mayor. We usually , you know, rarely do we receive correspondence directly from the Mayor's Office. And if we do, I think it's usually important . So just as a matter of practice just my own personal preference just to put it in Third Order. But we can have that discussion . MR. ROGAN: And I'm for the motion. They are public documents anyways . Putting them in Third Order really serves no purpose . But putting them on there isn't a problem . MR. GAUGHAN : The only purpose that I see in it is then it becomes a part of the agenda and then people can view it on line. That would be the only thing. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR.

MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that item 5-B be introduced into it's proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. As was mentioned , this legislation simply rectifies and correct s the dissolution of the Authority or when they tried to dissolve the Authority on the city's books. As Mr. Thomas had mentioned , the Authority continue s to operate . It holds the deeds to the properties reference d in the ordinance . And they seek it and obtain grants. The Authority was never terminated with the state, still registered as an authority . So this is mostly to clean the legislation up. And I do want to take this opportunity to thank you for coming to Council , you know, and giving us an update on what this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 legislation actually entailed.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH URBAN DESIGN VENTURES , LLC. 212 EAST SEVENTH AVENUE, HOMESTEAD , PENNSYLVANIA 15120 TO PERFORM A FIVE YEAR CONSOLIDATED PLAN FOR YEARS 2020-2024, ANNUAL ACTION PLAN FOR 2020 AND AN ANALYSIS OF IMPEDIMENTS TO FAIR HOUSING CHOICE FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA . MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 entertain a motion that item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question . MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . I had requested additional document ation from the second bidder or from OECD on the second bidder for this legislation . I did receive it from the Director of OECD. So I talked about this in the caucus. What I would like to see from the Director of OECD is more of an explanation on why they chose this company only because Urban Design Ventures in their proposal , they're charging -- or they're willing to negotiate a lump sum not to exceed an amount for three tasks. These are suggested costs that are subject to the final scope of work. But for the 2022 to 2024 Five Year Consolidated Plan, they're going to charge $23,750 or that's their suggested cost. For the Annual Action Plan, they're charging $8,500. And for the 2020 Analysis of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Impediments , they are charging $18,000. Technical Assistance they have several people here listed with hourly rates. The second bid which was not in the backup document ation but which I had requested , the other company that bid is only charging $19,000 total. Nine thousand for the completion of the Five Year Consolidated Plan, 3,500 for the action plan, and 6,500 for the analysis of Fair Housing Impediment . So I understand that you don't always choose the lowest bidder. But since the amount is so great in this case in my opinion , I would like to see more of an explanation on why they chose the higher bidder. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR.

MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Two weeks ago I had asked about -- for more information and kind of a background on this piece of legislation . So I just want to read from what the City Solicitor had sent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 The city -- so this project is to fix where the Keyser Valley Community Center is, they're going to pave, grade, and correct the pitch of the parking area to correct poor drainage and remediate current -- the current situation during rainfall of water pooling and running into the entrance area and kitchen area of the building . They received some sort of grant money. And I know everyone on Council and for the past five years this has been a sore spot with the residents in that area. The city is not involved in the actual grant. It was obtained by the county. The city has no involvement and is not providing any funds. The purpose of this legislation , the land where the community center is located is actually owned by the city. In review of the plans it was discovered that a small portion of the land was owned by another person. This piece was on the repository through the Tax Claim Bureau Judicial Tax Sale. The county has tax title. The property was removed from their repository and actually was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 transfer red to the land bank where the city then acquired the land. There was no cost. The city taking this parcel of land is its only involvement . And obviously the project and the grant will address the stormwater issues and will provide a fix of some of the problem s there as well. So thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR.
