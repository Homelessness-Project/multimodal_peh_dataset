MCANDREW : This Saturday , January 25th from 9 to 3 p.m., at Montage Mountain is the Polar Plunge Splashin ' with Compassion . All proceeds from this event go directly into the hands of young individuals battling cancer in Northeastern Pennsylvania . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? I have three announcements . First, I would like to congratulate Lieutenant Marty Crofton , one of Scranton 's finest in our police department who retired last week. Lieutenant Crofton has served the City since 1980, the last 17 years of those as Patrol Lieutenant . He is one of the most respected and trusted officers . And we wish him a long healthy and well-deserved retirement. Congratulations , Lieutenant Crofton . We thank you for your dedicated service to your fellow officers and to the residents of this city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Second announcement , Kohanski and Company will conduct an audit exit conference regarding the 2018 independent auditor 's report on Tuesday , February 4th at 5:45 p.m., in Council Chambers and that will be televised on ECTV. The 2018 audit report has been posted to the City's website on the Department of Business Administrator 's page and is also listed as Item 3-D on tonight 's agenda. The 2020 budget is also posted on the City's website as well. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items and matters of general concern : Anna Tunny Joan Hodowanitz Fay Franus Marie Schumacher Ron Ellman Les Spindler Norma Jeffries1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Lee Morgan Thomas Coyne.) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Rogan, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, just one brief comment on one item. I know for the last couple of weeks -- been contacted by a number of people with issues with the recycling now that the recycling center requires cardboard and paper to be separated . Today I did get a couple calls from residents -- and I did see on social media and I hope it's not true. But what I was told was people had done what they were told to do, separated their paper and their cardboard and that the paper was picked up as it should have been by our recycling crews. But the cardboard was just thrown in the trash. So I would like to inquire with DPW to see if that's, in fact, happening or if it was just an isolated incident . Obviously recycling has been a tough issue lately for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 City. And it's no fault of our DPW that the County Recycling Center has changed their protocols . But simply throwing away cardboard that people took the time to separate out to recycle certainly isn't acceptable . There's an environmental issue and more importantly because the garbage fee comes up every week at these meeting s, the City pays for every ton of garbage that goes into that landfill . It costs us money. Every ton of recycling is money that we don't have to spend. So it's keeping your cost down. That's why I've always been such a strong proponent of recycling . So if everyone agrees, I would like to send a correspondence to the DPW just asking if that's, in fact, happening as a policy. And also, I know we've inquired already what the plan for the future is. I know there was talk about -- I know one of my colleagues mentioned about maybe doing alternating weeks, paper one week and then cardboard the next, which some people would be upset about. But it certainly beats 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the alternative of just throwing the cardboard away. So like I said, I hope that that's not true. But I did hear it from multiple people in West Scranton that have -- typically they have their garbage picked up on Monday but because of the holiday they were picked up today. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Rogan. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. As Chairman of the Public Safety Committee , I would like to thank Detective Monahan and the Scranton Police Department SWAT Team for the active shooting training and simulation yesterday provided to me and my colleague s at the Career Technology Center. I know that we often -- we were often criticize d for high taxes. But this is a prime example where our tax dollars are at work providing valuable training to keep our kids safe. And secondly , I would also like to thank and congratulate Lieutenant Marty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Crofton , the former Commander of the Special Operations Group, which is the City's SWAT team for retiring after 40 years of exemplary service . That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have a few comments . First off, as Chair of the Committee on Community Development , I do plan on meeting with OECD on Friday to go through the department , meet everyone there and to discuss what their plans are and how I could help. I also know that there were some questions regarding my platform while I was campaigning . And a couple of the things that I did talk about as I was campaigning prior to being here on Council I am already making some movement on. One of those things was to build our relationships with the colleges and universities that are here in Scranton and to help retain students in Scranton after they are graduating . So I have met with the University of Scranton . And I plan on setting up meetings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 with all the other local colleges and universities touring the ones that I have not been to and discuss ing how we can have more internships here in the City of Scranton and also what changes we can help make in order to keep students here. And something else that was also very important to me as a citizen was to have more communication with the City. And I feel like there should be other opportunities for the public to talk to us City Council members aside from just having our weekly meetings . So I would like to make myself available on a monthly basis as well as any other Council members that would like to join me in more of an informal meeting just around in the community that is open to the public and anyone who would like to come and discuss whatever topics are on their mind. In addition to that, something that I would like to propose and discuss with my fellow Council members would be to hold quarterly town halls throughout the City in different neighborhoods . And that would be a more formalized event but to perhaps get some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 others in the public to come and talk about issues with the City who wouldn't normally be able to come here during our weekly meetings . And I believe that is all that I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . Mrs. Reed, I believe after we met with Kohanski in December we requested a meeting with Rainey and Rainey. Did we ever receive a response because I know it went to Dave. So the request went to Dave initially , so probably -- okay. So would you be able to schedule that then as soon as possible ? That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Thank you for coming tonight everyone . I just have a few comments . First, I had an opportunity last night to attend a service as Mrs. Jeffries mention ed at the Shiloh Baptist Church in North Scranton to honor and commemorate and remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And I have to say that, you know, I'm so used to going to church at Holy Rosary and at St. Joe's in Minooka when I lived there. It was really one of the greatest things that I've ever been a part of. It really highlighted for me the diversity and the great culture that we have in the City. So I want to thank everyone who was a part of the Martin Luther King Commission , all the service that they gave to the City and to the community . And I want to thank Charlotte Ledbetter for all of her work on that. I was really pleased and honored to be there on behalf of the City. Secondly , one of the items that Council historically had always talked about was working with the University of Scranton and the local college s and universities . And one of the things that Council did last year was we worked with the University of Scranton to start an internship program . And we did have an intern in Council 's Office for a few months. And I thought it worked out very well. The student that was here did a great job. And I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 talking the other day with Julie Schumacher Cohen from the University , and she is advertising again to their student body to have another intern come in hopefully within the next few months. So I think, you know, working with our local universities and colleges has really been a benefit to the City. And I'm hoping to do more of that as Dr. Rothchild had mentioned tonight . One of the other issues that I brought up last week was an issue that resident s were having in the 600 block of Main Avenue. Behind the homes in the 600 block of Main Avenue is Powderly Court. And apparently there was some issues there with the land actually kind of caving in. I did speak to Director Gallagher from the DPW. And he informed me that, you know, this has been an issue that has occurred before. The land is privately owned. So I did contact Mrs. Reed today and at Mr. Gallagher 's suggestion to forward that request over to the Licensing and Inspections Department to see if they can assess the situation because in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 speaking to two of the neighbors , it is very dangerous . And the third thing I want to mention tonight and this is an agenda item where we're ratifying of the fee agreement with Stevens and Lee in regards to appealing Judge Gibbons Act 511 decision . I think it's really important that we don't hand any law firm a blank check. As I sat here on Council for the past six years and has been documented very well in the newspaper and in other sources , you know, we enter into agreement s with law firms. Everybody knows the deal that went down with the Sewer Authority and all the legal fees and then months and months later everyone is shocked to learn of the exorbitant at times legal fees. So what Council discuss ed in our caucus tonight and what we will make an amendment on next week is that we are going to ask Stevens and Lee or request Stevens and Lee to live within a litigation budget. So we would like them to anticipate costs as accurately as they can as the circumstances will allow.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And as I said, it is very important to control costs and to have this firm provide a detailed budget based on their expectations concerning the scope of the litigation . So before next week, Solicitor Hayes has been working diligently on this. And I appreciate that and hopefully we have it before the final vote next week so we can make an amendment on that. And finally as I mention ed at the top of the meeting , you know, one of the things that as far as I know has never been done in Council Chambers or with City Council is we have requested an exit conference to be held with Kohanski and Company , the firm that prepares our audit. So next week at 5:45, Kohanski and Company will provide the Council with the exit conference information and the results of the audit. As I mentioned in the caucus tonight , I think this is just best practice . And I'm hoping moving forward that this occurs on a regular basis. In speaking with Mayor Cognetti a week ago, I know that she is eager as well to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 make sure that the audit is done on time and that we have that in hand as it says in the Home Rule Charter . Obviously you're always going to run into issues and things pop up that you weren't aware of. But when Kohanski and Company were in, they highlighted some serious issues with the 2018 audit and with the preparation . So the purpose of that next week is to communicate the results to this Council . And finally -- I said finally before but I do have one more thing. The Keyser Valley Flooding situation is something that in six years on Council we have had people, Mr. Srebro amongst others who have communicated to us obviously the major issues in the Keyser Valley area. Also there are issues across the City. Mr. Young comes to mind on Wyoming Avenue, flooding issues there. One of the things that I actually spoke with Mr. Gallagher today about and we're going to reach out to our grant writer in the police department , Maggie Perry is a grant opportunity that I think the City is interested in pursuing which is an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 overall analysis of the Keyser Valley area, particularly in where the pumping station is to see if we can address that whole issue, whether it's do we need a bigger pumping station , does the City need to pursue possibly buying out those properties ? Every year it is an issue. Every year there are people that come to Council that call us and that call the administration . So I'm hopeful we're going to get an update on that. I asked Mrs. Reed to contact Mrs. Perry. We're going to get an update on that, and I will provide that to the public. That's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
