Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple. First, I had just wanted to start off by wishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day come Sunday. And, you know, I'll be enjoying time with my family and my little one. I'm proud to be a mother. Also there's for Mother's Day, there's going to be a plant sale over at the Greenhouse this weekend . So it's Friday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. So if you want to pick up some flowers for the mother in your life then you could head out to the Greenhouse . And lastly, I want to announce that there's going to be a female hygiene product drive. So if you have menstrual product s that you could bring over to Courthouse Square, it's going to be from May 12th through May 13th, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 5 p.m. -- I think it will be 5 to 8 p.m., at the Courthouse Square across from where the new Chase Bank is going to be. And that's going to be for Scranton High so if you could bring the pads, tampons there, that would be helpful . That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Anyone else? MR.

I too would like to wish everyone a Happy Mother's Day out there in the audience and also to my wife and my mother in law, my mother up in heaven. So we should be thankful for all of our mothers because I get to see every day what mothers do for their children . And we're very fortunate and blessed by the women in our lives. So let's all celebrate them and be thankful for the mothers out there. Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . One more time, do we have a date for a 2021 audit caucus? MR. KING: Not at this time we do not. MS. HODOWANITZ : And has the Mayor made a decision on the 10 percent penalty ? MR. KING: I'll address that in Fifth Order. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 remind you that you still need to publish a summary of expenditure and revenues from the audit in paper. That's done in legals every year. Speaking of audits, whatever happened to the legislation that was supposed to be ready at the end of April for CliftonLarsonAllen our new auditors . MR. KING: I'll address that in Fifth Order as well. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. The DPW's contract 's still not on the City's website . We're pushing eight months. Any idea what the holdup is? MR. KING: I still believe that -- I had asked the Mayor for that and she was going to check with legal. So, Frank, can you check with the administration to see what the holdup is with getting that DPW contract and getting it posted on our website , if you would? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : And now that we have an arbitration settlement for the firefighter 's contract , that needs to be posted too that new contract . And where do we stand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on the arbitration for the police? MR. KING: That's going to be happening at the end of this month. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. I see that Miss Cipriani is going to be the new BA. Does legislation have to come down to you appointing her to that position ? MR. KING: I will address that in Fifth Order as well. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. And have we found a replacement for her in OECD yet or are they still working on that? MR. KING: I believe that they are still working on that. They're interviewing some other positions so they're hopeful that there may be some potential candidates out of that group that they've interviewed . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. On the general topic of appointments , with regard to the Ethics Board, Council has two nominations . David Falcheck is the Council Chair -- I mean, the Board Chairman . His term ends on August 31, 2024. The other person that Council appointed in the past was Andrew Lazella . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 his term ended August 31st of 2022. So I assume that the ball is in your court to either renew his appointment or appoint a new member. Were you aware that his term had run out? MR. KING: I was not aware of that, no. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. One recommendation that I would make, like, you know, the Environmental Advisory Council , the Ethics Board, any other board or commission or authority that you have responsibility for making appointments , just create a small spreadsheet , name, when the term expires . Three months ahead of the expiration date you start looking for a new person or a new appoint ment so you don't have someone that's, you know, almost a year out. MR. KING: That's a great suggestion . I'll talk to Mr. Voldenberg about setting something like that up. MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll take care of that, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, and when you choose a person, you know, I attend a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 various boards and commission meeting s having nothing to do with my time anyway. And I got to tell you it's disappoint ing when I see people sitting on these boards and commission s that I think the only reason they're sitting there is for bragging rights. They don't want to do anything . I attended the last Ethics Board meeting . I believe it was March 15. It was in the middle of March. I got to tell you I asked a couple questions . Well, here's the code why haven't you done this, what the status of that? Do you know what one of the board members said to me? Well, we don't have a staff. It's like come on, guys, you know? What are you window dressing ? When you start looking for people that you appoint to these boards or reappoint , make sure they're not there for only bragging rights or a resume building . If they don't want to get their hands dirty, if they don't want to break a sweat, they don't belong there. Keep in mind once you appoint those people, you have no control over them.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 And finally , out of 169 statements of financial interest that were due on May 1st, you only have 96. That is a 57 percent return rate. I want to see a wall of shame posted on the City's website , all of the names who submitted and their form and who didn't. So let's get the pressure on these slackers. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Tonight I want to talk about something that I have been speaking about for months. I want to talk about the overtime in the DPW. Today I received my right to know reply for the overtime for March. Actually it was for six weeks, but still told the story. What it had is the person's name, the hours they worked that day but they didn't list the day and how much money they made. There was no reason. There was no date. But there was, like, six pages of all the employees and how much money they made. Steve Taven{phonetic } who is a supervisor , one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 day he made -- he had 42 hours overtime . He made $1,592 in a two week period, two week period. Each sheet that I got was a two week period, and another day he made 1,300 in a two week period. And this other guy (inaudible ) I think his name is, he made $1,600. He had 44 hours of overtime in a two week period. That was 22 hours for one week overtime . That's just a couple. What I'm trying to say is there is no dates. There is no accountability and there is no reasons . And this has been going on since Mr. Preambo left. The union has just taken over and nobody is running the ship down there. Like I said, Mr. Pietreface, the Director , he's the one that made the most overtime last year, $29,800. But now he's the Director . He went from 47,000 to 75,000 in his pay raise. He doesn't get overtime now. He doesn't need to. But here's my point. Mr. King, may I ask Council members a question ? MR. KING: Sure. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Thank you. My 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 question is this to each one of you, don't you feel that the people who pay this overtime , the taxpayers , have a right to know what the reason was and the date that it happened , accountability . The Mayor ran on transparency and account ability . Miss Rothchild , do you believe that the people that pay these huge bills, it was 65,000 just for six weeks. It was 191,000 for three months and there is no date. There is no reason. Do you believe that the people who pay this bill have a right to know the reasons, the date, and everything that detail why they would make this money? DR. ROTHCHILD : I believe that there should be reasons recorded for overtime . MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? DR. ROTHCHILD : I believe there should be reasons recorded for overtime . MS. FRANUS: And the date? DR. ROTHCHILD : And the date, yes. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Of course, I agree with that. And we've been asking for that for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 a couple years. So -- MS. FRANUS: I know that. MR. MCANDREW : You asked me a question . Please allow me to finish. MR. KING: Mr. King? MR. MCANDREW : Never mind. MR. KING: Yeah, I would think that, once again, let's go back to Joan's spreadsheet , list the date, list the time, list the reason. Yeah, sure. MS. FRANUS: You're saying it should, right? I can't hear you. You're too low. MR. KING: Yes. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. So it's something I spoke about for quite some time because we have been overshooting our budgetary -- I mean, some of the department s last year I think the DPW administration was 729 percent over budget so I would be in agreement with this. MS. FRANUS: Mr. Smurl? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MS. FRANUS: Okay. But this is what I want to ask Council . I'm proposing that you make legislation that all city department directors explain the reason for the overtime , the date that they used it, the money -- the hours they worked and how much they made and their names -- the names, the reason, the hours they worked and the date. That's what I would like legislation passed. If you don't do this, I can't imagine you have no reason -- you would have no reason not to because I would think that all the taxpayers in the city would like to know how their money is being spent. The fire department and the police department , they record every penny of their overtime , their days, their reasons , everything . So if the Scranton Fire Department who the taxpayers pay for and the police, they give reasons . They give dates. They are very accountable . They are very transparent. But the union, the DPW is not. So I would like to see if would you consider passing legislation to make this mandatory for all City Hall department 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 directors . Mr. King, would you consider that? MR. KING: Yeah, I'd consider it. I just want to make sure that we talk to our solicitor and make sure that any legislation that we would put before this body is, you know, legally binding and make sure that it's enforceable , yes. MS. FRANUS: Thank you very much and I appreciate it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . What I have given you just now is back in '21 when Gaughan was here we had moved to remove him from Council because of statements and comments he made calling me an ignorant fool, an insane -- name calling was not allowed by the rules of decorum . And he went ahead with that and he called me a weak-minded bully. And it went on. So we filed back then to remove him from Council because of his negative comment s. And then we had filed a federal lawsuit which he came in and told Council a few weeks ago that it was dismissed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Well, before you, you see the federal lawsuit is very alive and active. And it's for civil rights violation s of the Rules of Council created by Bill Gaughan . And I'm not going to try and read everything to you. But you could go through it yourselves and see the allegations of fact, the parties and everything else that Gaughan pulled when he was Council President here. He claimed -- he said it was not name calling , a tongue in cheek manner. However , his insults were calling me an ignorant fool and going on with his comment s and his insults . Well, I filed to get rid of him because that's not what we need in the City of Scranton . And his mother made a comment that you get into a contest with a skunk, you're going to come out smelling like one which was directed to me. And I brought a guy dressed in a skunk costume to protect me from him here. So, you know, I'm a weak-minded bully, uneducated venom, and these were comment s by Gaughan . Well, we're going to do everything we can to see that this guy does not get anywhere in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 position to do what he did. I've been in this city my whole life, throughout the family we've been employers for almost 100 years. Between 81 and 92, I employed over 1,200 people. That's 600 trucks running around the country . I'm involved in interest s overseas and everywhere else. What's Bill Gaughan 's claim to fame that he could question me when's not even in my category . He wouldn't know how to get into our category . And the reason I brought this before Council , I'm not here to fight with people. I'm here to see our city move forward . We've got people growing up here. We have the issues at school. We have drag queens running around. We're taking away our moral structures . And issues like that have to be addressed . We can't just sit tongue in cheek. I don't care what anyone's sexual orientation is. I could care less. I have people that work for us. And I have no qualms with their sexual orientation . They do their job. That's what they're there to do. And I respect people that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 will stand up for what they believe and their rights. But when we come to a Council , we have issues that we need to discuss because not everybody out there or sitting out here knows everything . And to make the comment s that Gaughan did to me, now he wants to be a county commissioner . Well, he skunked us with his attitude . Look what he did on Biden Street. I want to vomit every time I hear the word or go to say it. But yet he cared less what the people on Spruce Street had to say and the businesses and the people who lived there and all of us who live in the city, we have to come down the expressway or drive on the interstate where thousands of people travel through here think we all support Joe Biden. We don't. As far as I'm concerned he is not my president . And what he's done to this country and to the kids and to the people and the moral structure , I can't even put it in words. And we're going to see more of that happen as it goes on. But this is what he did. He skunked us. Now he wants to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 become a county commissioner . He's a bought and paid for guy. Look at the money he's received . He's not going to be able to say no to anybody that dumped all this money into him, if, in fact, he's successful getting into the commissioner 's seat. And then what's he going to do skunk Lackawanna County like he skunked all of us in the City of Scranton ? These are the people that should not be allowed to move forward . And believe me, I'm saying here publicly , I'll do everything in my power political ly to keep Bill Gaughan from taking that seat. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Krysten Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Hello, Krysten . I'm here in reference to Quandel who is building a building on Dickson Avenue to the right of me. From day one there's been trouble here and there, a broken window that I repaired, grass that they destroyed that I already said before. MR. KING: Krysten , excuse me, who is building there, I'm sorry. MS. XANTHIS : They are building a senior building , Quandel is building it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. KING: Quandel is doing the work. Okay. Thank you. MS. XANTHIS : The noise, the shaking of the house. When you sit on the couch in the living room that's against the wall, you basically feel like you're on a ship that's ready to go over. The dirt is terrible . So, like, you can't sit on the front porch which that is the least of the problems right now. They've been, you know, you go over there. You tell them. But, unfortunately , you know, they don't understand what I'm saying. Nothing wrong with that but they don't speak English , the people that are working there. So they have no clue what I said to them. I asked them, like, a bunch of times, like, you know, about what's going on. They say something . I can't understand them. They can't understand me. I left. I was out of town on Friday, went to Philly, got back later in the evening. There was a terrible smell in the house. So I thought , well, because I had the windows open, I opened the windows when I got back, I thought I was picking it up from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 road. So I let it go. The next day it was still there. By Sunday it was getting worse. There was, you know, no explanation for it. You know, Monday comes it's pretty bad. Call UGI. They come. They went around with their thing to make sure. Then they found out there's a gas leak in three spots down the basement. With the shaking of the house and the pipe going into the hot water heater is extremely loose and it's leaking , two other spots going into the furnace . Now UGI shut it off, shut the gas off. I have no hot water right now. My house takes in accustom to get to the temperature of the outside . It doesn't get warm right away. Well, this afternoon , you know, it's freezing in my house right now. Tonight 's going to be 40 degrees . It's going to be below 30 in my house tonight . You know, according to my estimation , the house was shaking nonstop every single day since they started building . They didn't want to do anything . They said that, like, you know, it's fine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 They said we're going to stop. They said, you know, we're done with it. Two days go by, they bring in a new machine to start digging that shakes the house even worse. I had a broken window that I fixed that, I mean, I'm not responsible for because they did it. There was no other explanation for it to break. It wasn't freezing cold outside . It was from the shaking of the house. There's a mine underneath the house. And right now in the back of my yard there's a big sinkhole . If the house goes in, just remember there's people down there. But right now I have no heat, no hot water. I spoke to them today on the phone -- my mother did. The guy was as nasty as can be from Quandel . You know, you shouldn 't speak to somebody like that. I don't know if he's trying to raise somebody 's blood pressure to give them a heart attack, but that's what was about to happen. They say they take no responsibility . They say they're in the city. They say they could do what they want. Now, apparently , nobody is going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 do anything because Quandel says they're not responsible . The guy over there that is working for the construction company right now, the head of it over there that's staying over there, he doesn't understand why you would build a building right there between two houses. My house is shaking still every day. They say they're not doing any more digging . Every day it's shaking . I had a mail carrier there standing on the porch saying to me, send me a message and then telling one day when he's standing there, why is the front porch shaking ? Now, is anybody -- have any way for me to get in touch with anybody that can help? I mean, this is not my responsibility to pay for. You know, Quandel should take some kind of responsibility here. MR. KING: Have you reached out to the administration of Quandel ? MS. XANTHIS : Yeah, she just switches you to a different line and you get a voicemail and nobody calls you back. I mean, I have no running hot water. That bill is going to be astronomical right now to fix because of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the damage. They won't turn it back on because if it blows up. MR. KING: Okay. Mr. Voldenberg , do we have someone from (inaudible ) enforcement or someone to go there, one of our inspectors or even the City Planner , Don King or somebody to go over and take a look at the property to assess what the situation is there? MS. XANTHIS : I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : You're probably going to have to talk to an attorney . MS. XANTHIS : And I'm suppose d to sit with no hot water in the house? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I'm just advising you that you should if you have those issues, you should probably talk to an attorney . MS. XANTHIS : Is there anybody that knows Quandel , like, I mean, that was the mayor started that. That was Mayor Doherty 's big project . But is there anybody around here that can help for now? Like, is there any, like, I mean, I don't understand a big construction company like Quandel not responsible for anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. KING: I mean, what we could do as the City if they are violating a noise ordinance we can get involved at that level, things like that. But I think that Attorney Gallagher is probably correct because it sounds like you have some damage as a result of -- so it sounds like you have a claim, a legal claim. MS. XANTHIS : I have a crack in my window. And the only way to fix it right now is to put something over it because I mean -- MR. KING: What I'm telling you is this, it sounds like you have a legal case there that I would recommend maybe you get an attorney to go after these individual s that caused this damage. What we could do as a city, go over, you know, check on violation s of noise. And you had indicated before with parking with these big trucks, those are things that we can absolutely address . But the other issues, I believe , that you actually have -- MS. XANTHIS : I have no way of turning it back on right now because the gas company won't turn it on. So, I mean, I don't know if there's another number of somebody else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 in charge of Quandel , maybe some different person I could talk to aside from the person that responded to the call? MR. KING: I don't think any of us know anybody that works for Quandel here at City Council other than as you mentioned Mr. Doherty . And I don't know -- I believe that he's in development or sales. I don't know that he's involved with the actual construction piece. But I could certainly ask him on your behalf. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me. Excuse me. Now, the gas company was there and they, what, just red flagged your furnace ? Is that my understanding or they shut it off? MS. XANTHIS : They shut it off. MR. MCANDREW : So as their customer , did they give you an opportunity maybe they could fix it and tack it onto your bill until you find recourse later so it's safe for you to operate the furnace and/or the water heater? I would start with them. I mean, of course, the city should investigate it. MS. XANTHIS : Quandel should take some responsibility --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. MCANDREW : I agree with you. But, you know, you have to start somewhere . But, of course, the city will investigate it for you or should. But I would talk to the gas company too. MR. KING: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . For years now each week I speak to two, three, four people who approach me favorably , you know, at the stores I go to. And in just short conversations , many times about other things besides politics these people are the heart of this city, not Paige and not Bulzoni and not Oleski but these hard working residents . These are people that love this city and respect the administration a lot more than I have for it. They want a future here. They want the American dream. It seems like Geisinger is just stolen part of the city's American dream under the pretense of progress . Well, yesterday I received a postcard from Mrs. Hayes, you know, to support her. This is rubbish as far as I'm concerned like they told me my yard and house is full of -- you -- Mr. Schuster , you gave me this a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 couple months ago. I told you last week nothing 's hardly been touched . But the house across from me, the house with seven cars, he wrote on here cars have been removed . Nothing 's been removed . This is when I say Mr. Sunday is just a despicable liar like he lied in court to win the case. Mrs. Hayes is the attorney and she has refused to address my allegations against the licensing bureau. I don't believe she's the caliber person we need in office at this time. I read the other day a short article that they were going to take a liner out of the swimming pools and plaster it. Well, I don't know much about good whiskey and horses and horse races and women. But I know about swimming pools. Liner pools are not concrete . They are made of a product called pool crete. It never gets hard. You cannot not plaster over it. Concrete lasts thousands of years. Pool crete has a short -- a short span actually compared to concrete plaster pool. And I think somebody before the city throws away some more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 money like they do left and right on ridiculous projects , somebody needs to get a knowledgeable person involved to see what to do with that pool, probably put a liner back in, it would be cheaper than anything they're thinking of. What you're talking about is comparable to those houses built on a slag pile in Dunmore if you try to plaster that pool. I've been over them, under them, inside of them. I've seen hundred -year-old swimming pools in California . And I know what I'm talking about. You cannot plaster over pool crete. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Ellman, I will remind you that under Council rules, no person including members of Council shall use their time during citizens participation to personally insult or attack any individual . Thank you. That exhaust s the sign-in list. Is there anyone else that would to be heard by Council ? MR. RINALDI : Good evening , Council , Dave Rinaldi , 212 Colfax. I wanted to make a couple comments on the zoning ordinance tonight . Number one, just in the last two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 weeks it appears that maybe there will be ten municipalities as Waverly is debating now to get back in and to pass their SAPA ordinance . But they need to amend it in the meantime . So consequently , because of the way SAPA is set up, municipalities on the edges as long as they don't have a use that is necessary for the other partici pants can either decide to stay or go and it will not affect the rest. So I think you're well on your way to SAPA now. And I would urge everyone to vote in favor of the amended zoning ordinance tonight . I also wanted to say that I did watch the Council debate. I'm not sure why they didn't allow Mr. Smurl to participate . I thought everyone did a tremendous job. I thought you quitted yourselves very well. I think that the city has some good candidates here to choose from. And again, I hope that you're successful . The last comment I want to make is, I want you to remember that even though you pass the zoning ordinance tonight or the amended ordinance , you will have another opportunity in the development plan to approve or disprov e development plan from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Planning Commission . That really will give you more leverage than you have now in regard to exactly how that development goes up there with the hospital . And I'd also ask Council to if they can, pay attention to the trade publications for the healthcare industry . There have been quite a few articles lately on Kaiser. So and I'll finish with I want to wish everyone certainly all the mothers and the grandmothers , a Happy Mother's Day. And I'm sure that everyone will enjoy themself and Council will move forward with this project in the best way possible for all of the citizens . So thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Rinaldi . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? Mrs. Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I would like to ask that you keep the zoning on the table until somebody comes and explains the difference between R6 and R1. I really got to admit I had not read it. But I live on a corner and a lot of people stop and they say what do you think about that R6? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Well, I don't know. I haven't read it. And I was told by somebody in the administration that R6 is much better than R1 was. I read it. And there's so many things that are different and I think Mr. King should come in and explain the difference between -- or anybody else up there really looked at it? If you did, you could do it in Fifth Order. And then following up, months ago now it's probably at least six weeks. I mentioned there was a pile of trash out in front of 843 Moosic Street. And you suggested that DPW take it away. And for some reason though it's not on that code thing that was in Third Order today. But it's still sitting there. It still looks awful and it needs to go. Another -- MR. KING: What was that address again, Mrs. Schumacher ? MR. SCHUSTER : 843. MR. KING: Frank, can you -- thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MS. SCHUMACHER : The house itself is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 vacant. And then the abatement on the Spruce Street bridge going from downtown to over South Side. That was suppose d to go to the state. And they were going to do something but nothing has been done. It's painted yellow. And it's got tape coming into the city. But there is absolutely nothing on the side going out of the downtown . MR. KING: Did you check? I believe the state was suppose d to address that. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was reported , sir, to both PennDOT and the DPW. I'll follow up. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : I remind everybody that this is lime disease month. And if anybody gets a tick you could send it up to East Stroudsburg . They have a lab up there that will tell you whether or not it has lime disease and you're -- or whether , you know, whether you do or don't. And then do we have anything new on the pilot contributions ? MR. KING: I'll address that in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Great. Okay. Now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 a few things that make you go hmmm. One of them was Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine had their commencement Sunday at the FM Kirby Center in Wilkes-Barre. I find that a slap in the face to the City of Scranton . I don't know why they do it. But we don't charge them any tax and then they go out and rent a place not in the city. I don't think that's nice. The 2023 paving program , when are we going to see that, anybody know? MR. KING: I don't know if we got the list. Did we, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did, sir. It's a fall paving program this year. MR. KING: Okay. Would we be able to get that posted on the city website or ask administration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. And I'll share it with Miss Schumacher also. MR. KING: Thank you very much. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then last year you voted to replace the Business and Mercantile Tax with a payroll prep. But everything I see including the monthly revenue still says Mercantile and Business tax. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 doesn't say -- are we doing -- are we really doing -- what did I say it was -- the payroll prep? MR. KING: I believe that was just part of last year as the transition . But 2023 we should be fully over to. MS. SCHUMACHER : But it's not. I mean, if you looked at whatever that thing was that the Treasurer sends out, it still does all of the city's stuff too. MR. KING: I'll check that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. And then on 5-B if that is funded, what is the Linden storm issue and on 5 -- that's 5-B -- the other one on the -- would there be a demolition if we get funding at Nay Aug? I would like to know what would be demolish ed. Thank you. And I'm sorry to -- MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . I believe that Mr. Smurl is going to address the Nay Aug issue. Whenever you apply for RACP it's usually matching funds. So it looks like there's going to be some streetscape and stormwater done on Linden Street as well. Are you talking 5-C or 5-B? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MS. SCHUMACHER : B. MR. KING: 5-B is -- that's Nay Aug. That's -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, okay, so then the other one is -- MR. KING: $500,000. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening , Joann Williams , city resident . I just wanted to take the time to thank Mr. Schuster , Mr. King, Mr. McAndrew , and Dr. Rothchild for standing up and standing and voting for us neighbors up in the Hill. My next thing is, how many swimming pools will be open in the City of Scranton this summer? Does anybody have an idea? I know -- MR. KING: I believe it's four. MS. WILLIAMS : Is Weston Field one of them? MR. KING: Weston Field -- well, there's -- there's the indoor and the outdoor pool. And then there's Weston Park and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 there's Connell Park. MS. WILLIAMS : Okay. Also, I know the other speaker was talking about when -- when will we ever get to starting with Nay Aug? I mean, that's another good question , I guess, right? MR. KING: We're doing our best to push the administration . MS. WILLIAMS : I know yous are. MR. KING: Believe me, we're pushing it with the Mayor and the administration to really put a plan into action and actually look at funding to get a pool up there. MS. WILLIAMS : And I appreciate that. And also about the playgrounds I heard that you were also looking into, you know, restoring the playgrounds again. And I do appreciate that too for the children of the city. Now, lastly, this is the month of May and the month of May is mental health month. And I just think publicly that our schools need to be more educated in mental health, our workplaces need to be more educated in mental health, our family and friends . We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 all need to be more educated in mental health because somewhere it's lost. And we have to remember how important it is. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Williams . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I would like to point out some things with the pool at Nay Aug to start, back around 2002 I lived up on the 1600 of Pine Street. And I was there for about a year. And during the summer I would see people returning from swimming just about the time I was pulling in from work. And from what I understood it was about a dollar to swim that day. Then the sliding board appeared . It went up to 3 dollars . Then it went up to 5 dollars . And with the taxpayers that were limited to paying for swimming only on weekdays and so forth, some of the parents couldn't bring their kids up and swim. And they were kind of blocked out. They had to pay if they wanted to go inside and watch over the kids to make sure they're not in some kind of trouble , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 which anyway, the price just kept increasing and the availability of the pool kept decreasing with that sliding board. And it was popular but whatever we do with the amount of -- and I'll get to that a little bit later, tax exempt properties in this town. I don't think the average (inaudible ) needs any increases in their taxes to a frivolous extent. I'm all for a pool, but we have to start -- here's something I read last week in the paper. Geisinger strikes deal with Kaiser. Now, we've negotiated and went back and forth with Geisinger constantly a couple years. I had a few doctors that didn't like working there anymore after Geisinger . And I lost them as personal MDs. And, well, they've been kind of neglectful of me lately, but I'm only one person. But this organization from the west coast apparently has their own insurance . And they do not admit people from -- maybe I'm wrong. If you don't have Kaiser insurance , you won't be taken into a Kaiser Hospital . I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 at my doctor's yesterday and he had some student s from the Yeshiva because he's Orthodox Jewish. And they were from the west coast covered by Kaiser insurance , small office. Kaiser refused to pay. So this is the type of people we're starting to get involved with here. We need to be very careful because we might find out that we thought we bought a Chihuahua and had a wolf delivered . So and on these audits, every year I've been coming here since early 2007. And every year they got a little later. And after Mr. Doherty they were hardly useable by then. But after Mr. Courtright got in, it just kept getting later and later and later. And two years is too much. The people including anybody at fault within the city administration if they can't come up with their figures , we don't need them. We don't need this anymore. It needs to stop. And once again, I'm short on time. But these tax exempt institutions are killing us. There's our swimming pools. There's our streets paved. There's everything. And we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 to go after the state. It's the state constitution that disallows us to tax anybody and pilots are voluntary . Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , Rick Little. I went to my landlord today, Scranton Housing Authority . And they're all referring me to lawyers all over the place, not accepting service , not even talking to me. But the one thing I found curious speaking to the controller over there today she said that 400 Adams Avenue, which is Scranton Housing Authority is owned by HUD. Now, I've done a lot of research . I've gone to the Globe building to find out. I believe that building is owned by the City of Scranton . I'm wondering how I could find out the connection between 400 Adams Avenue -- does the City of Scranton own that building ? Who owns the building ? I mean, they just send me on wild goose chases. But I'm sure that HUD which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the federal government does not own that building . And I've been to the Globe building , you know, looking up the address . And it's all of these intricate LLCs and everything . Who owns the building , you know, because when I talk to a police officer , no, no, that's not a federal facility . But if they are telling me that SHA is owned by HUD, that doesn't sound right to me. And -- MR. KING: We'll see if we can get an answer for you on that, Mr. Little. Frank, if we can check on that? Our solicitor could check to see. MR. LITTLE: I didn't hear you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Scranton Housing Authority owns that building . They administer federal funds. MR. LITTLE: That's what my research said Scranton Housing Authority . And that -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : The city doesn't. MR. LITTLE: The city doesn't. So the entity of Scranton Housing Authority which is run by the Commissioners -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : No, it's not. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 commissioners have -- Lackawanna County Commissioners have nothing to do with the Scranton Housing Authority . MR. LITTLE: No, not Scranton commissioners -- the Board of Commissioners of Scranton Housing Authority . ATTY. GALLAGHER : The board runs the housing authority , yes. MR. LITTLE: Yes. And they're not owned by HUD? ATTY. GALLAGHER : What is not owned by HUD? MR. LITTLE: The building itself. She said to me the building 's owned by HUD. ATTY. GALLAGHER : To the best of my knowledge , the Scranton Housing Authority owns that building . HUD does not. MR. LITTLE: I can't hear you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : To the best of my ability , the Scranton Housing Authority owns that building . HUD does not. MR. LITTLE: Scranton Housing Authority . ATTY. GALLAGHER : They're a federally funded program . The Housing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Authority is a federally funded program . MR. LITTLE: Oh, yeah, I understand that. But they don't own the -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : We'll check on it but I'm pretty sure is that the Housing Authority in it of itself owns that building , okay? MR. LITTLE: Yeah, the Scranton Housing Authority is under the City of Scranton , right? ATTY. GALLAGHER : They appoint the board members but they have no actual power over -- MR. LITTLE: -- real estate -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : Correct . MR. LITTLE: Okay. Yeah, how would I receive any guidance on that? Do you want my e-mail or -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : We'll report back to you. You could leave your e-mail with Alison, okay? MR. LITTLE: Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? Fifth Order. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I have two. First one is, I spoke with the administration about Kohanski . It seems they were are paid in full on May 3rd. The final payment was made in full on -- that was the end of their contract . Now I see the contract is about -- and I believe this last contract was $42,500 which means the 10 percent would be for $4,250 which was not held back. I don't know the administration 's reason for not holding that back. MR. KING: I can explain -- I'll tell you what the Mayor told me. The Mayor indicated that they felt as though they are not going to pursue it because they felt like it was going to end up going into litigation and they didn't -- they felt like $4,250, the litigation would far exceed what they would get back in 10 percent . MR. SMURL: That is exactly what I thought . But it's not my $4,200. But I think it would far exceed that amount of money. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 second thing was, we had someone come here from 1119 Jackson Street and say the city removed their electric meter. So I researched Jackson Street. It seems it was purchased in 2007. And the reason code enforcement was sent there was the request of the Scranton Police Department . So code enforcement had gotten there, found some violations . And they had called the fire department because the fire inspector is the one that must inspect the panel boxes to see if it is unsafe. He determined it was unsafe and had the electric company pull the meter. Also, the building is a commercial property , which means you need to be licensed to do any work at all in there. Now, there's been work going on in there for a while and there were no permits pulled at all. It also has multiple code violation s and it also has multiple unpaid quality of life tickets . I don't even know how many are there. But there's a lot of them. And that's why the meter was pulled, not for the reason that we were told. That's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : My only comment , me and Frank have been back and forth over the last couple of days. We had a residence on Putnam Street that we were in correspondence with Code Enforcement and I think the Law Department . And then there was a house on Tenth Avenue as well. I'll just followup on those as we move forward . That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a number of updates and requests . But first I just wanted to provide an update that there was a complaint I received about the railroad crossing at Capouse and Larch Street. And so I received notice that it has been repaired by the Railroad Authority . If there's -- I know that there might be a number of them throughout the city that are also in need of repair so I think we have asked if there were any additional ones 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 but I didn't hear about others. So the other repair Birch Street from American Water. And someone that lives near there had complained again because it seems like they paved it and it rectified the bottom of the hill in the second portion of it where there was a bump, but it didn't for the first. And so this is -- this has been going on for several years. And the project was several years and now just to get the repairs done and to have the road in an acceptable form has also taken a very long time. And I know I've been out there myself along with American Water to see why we can't get this solved. So I don't know if there was plans for anything additional . But, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please check with them as to why that issue is still present on the first section of their repair on Birch Street. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And this is more than about this street, right, because we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 need to hold them accountable throughout the whole city. And so that's important to make sure the utility companies are repairing the roads in an acceptable manner. I also received complaints about the food truck that's parked -- that's normally parked on Mulberry Street up near the hospital . And the place that they park, I'm not sure if it's legal where they are parking . But it is making it difficult for the Colts bus to turn around the corner there. And there might be other violations there too. So I had I think previous ly asked for maybe like a parking enforcement to get out there to inspect . But I'm not sure that that's happened . I haven't receive d an update so if we could check on that as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And Paul from Reilly Associates will be completing a traffic study at Mulberry and Harrison . I thought originally we might need to put that through PennDOT but because the city usually takes care of the traffic lights, that's why our engineer is going to take a look at that to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 see if it's warranted for a left-hand signal to turn onto Harrison . And I know I sound like a broken record, but we still don't have updated handicap parking signs and lines that are painted downtown . And I'm not understanding what the holdup is at this point. I know that we were waiting for the sign machine to get fixed for DPW. But that has been -- there's a new sign machine that we've had for several weeks, if not, a couple months now. So I want to make sure that that gets accomplished if we could please contact DPW to make sure that that happens . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with all parties . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. And then, yeah, and with SPD as well because there's quite a few times I've been down there now and especially the one spot on Penn Avenue that I notice that any time I'm down there there's a car are parked -- a different car each time or truck or whatever parked there that doesn't have a handicap placard . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And it's very frustrating for me to see but I could only imagine for someone who needs that spot who's downtown to have their vehicles parked there and not have the parking available when they need it. So and someone mentioned the playgrounds at Nay Aug which we had also sent that in. But I haven't heard an update on whether or not an inspector got out there and what the results were and when it will be repaired. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one last thing, one of the speakers had reminded me. I did want to mention tonight that it is mental health awareness month. And I wanted to provide a couple of phone numbers . I'm not going to include all of them. But the national crisis line if someone is in a state of crisis or struggling or has thoughts of suicide , please call 988. You could also text that number or you could chat on line at 988 lifeline .org. You don't need to call any -- add any other numbers to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 it, just 988 is the national line for suicide . And then if you're part of the LGBTQ community , the Trevor Project has their line as well, which 1-866-488-7386. So if anyone is watching and you are struggling with your mental health, there is help out there. And I would encourage anyone to seek out that help if needed. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have three issues that were brought to me by concerned resident s. The first one being a sewer drain on 705 and 711 West Elm Street. It's an issue. The resident s there were told to contact the sewer company and the sewer company told them to contact the water company . So the problem they're having is on their side of the street between the two neighbor 's house, the road starts to level out and it puddles or freezes. And they end up parking on ice or having issues. So they said that the water company is there now doing some work -- MR. KING: Please, can you take your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 conversation to the hallway so we can hear Mr. McAndrew speak? Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So they said that now's a great time to have either code enforce ment, DPW, city engineers get out there while the water company is working on this issue. But they're not specifical ly working on their issue. But their issue is a byproduct of it. So if you could have them take a look at that drain, you know, between 705 and 711 West Elm Street. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then Eynon Street, 1143 and 1145, the house is condemned . But already this early in the spring, the grass is very high. So I'm not sure what happens when a house is condemned . I know the owner is still responsible . They may be hard to get ahold of. That's probably one of the reasons why it's condemn ed. But I'm not sure what the process is so if code enforce ment could go over and see what they could do with that. And then this other issue was brought to me on Keyser Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 where you're going towards Keyser and to your left would be North South Road. This isn't in Taylor. This is in the West Scranton , part of Keyser Avenue that it was told to me that there is an island or V piece of land that the city used to own or still owns or does it own that there's a huge car lot there now. And this island has become part of that so when you pull out of North South Road onto Keyser, it creates a very dangerous situation with a line-of-sight issue. So this resident seems to be in the know somewhat . And I said I'll confirm , if I can, that did the city own that piece of land that is now part of this car lot? If they did, when did they sell it or how did they acquire it? And for reference it's called Black Tie Auto. But I actually took a ride by it myself today. It doesn't look right. So if it doesn't look right, it might not be right. It's definitely a safety issue if we could have all department s that would handle that take a good look at it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Check on, you know, the property itself if we did own it at some point. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . In reference to the HUP test for pilots, the administration plans to put out an RFP by the end of the month to have someone go out and look at these pilots that may have been approved 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago. And there's a test that is actually performed to see if they actually still qualify for what they originally applied for to be tax exempt. So that's coming very soon to put an RFP out to have a company perform that HUP test on behalf of the city. I just want to mention about University of Scranton rental registration fees for University owned apartment s. The administration has been in discussion s with the University of Scranton and is looking into it. Important to know that the vast majority of those student apartment s are privately owned. But I believe there are a certain number that are owned by the University and we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 believe may be subject to registration fees. So I talked to the Mayor and they are research ing it, looking into it. She also indicated to me that they are very close to hiring a new Parks and Rec Director . I think they are down to two or three finalist. And they hope to send a name up to us in fairly short order. Joan Hodowanitz , the 2022 statement of financial interest are on the city website now. Legislation for introduction at next week's Council meeting will include the independent contract agreement for extension of Matt Domines ' to provide financial director services to the city. He was actually a 1099 consultant for the city. Master services agreement with Clifton LarsonAllen, LLP, to perform City of Scranton independent audit -- single audit for the years December 31st, 2022, 2023, and 2024. We hope to have that by next Tuesday or the following Tuesday . Legislation for appointment to Eileen Cipriani is set to be received in our Council office by tomorrow . Homeless 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 encampment s in the city are being address ed by the Scranton Police Department , Scranton Fire Department , code enforcement , DPW and if needed, Silex Street. That's a dead end street, homeless encampments , homeless entering yards and homes that we'll hopefully be looking into those issues, pavilion area and along the Heritage Trail off of the street. And I believe that Virgil Argenta had brought that up. There's debris, the trash and panhandling happening . So they're going to be monitor ing and looking into those areas. The 600 block of North Sixth Avenue, homeless encampments , debris and trash and also the McDade Expressway near Scranton High School homeless encampments along the expressway . And I also asked you -- I know that I believe code enforce ment went out to 336 Geraldine Court. I had a resident reach out to me about a quality of life issue. I believe that they ordered -- they receive d a citation or warning and gave them two weeks to get that property up to snuff or else there will be fines. In reference to the R6 zoning on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 East Mountain , I will tell you this, that as the zoning ordinance has gone through , you know, many changes , many amendments , a big part of it was meeting with the local neighborhood associations and that did occur throughout the entire city and adjustments were made. And things were removed prior to getting to us. And then a week or two or probably two weeks ago, I know on East Mountain which is probably the most restrictive zoning area in the city, it's got the largest conservation area in the city. It also now limits garden apartments . It will not be permitted , nor double houses. So as far as I'm concerned , I believe we did our due diligence and we listened to the people. And we got the input and amendments were made. And I believe it's where it needs to be for final passage . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY’S ACCEPTANCE AND ADMINISTRATION OF GRANT FUNDS FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR UP TO $500,000.00 TO BE USED FOR THE NAY AUG MULTIPURPOSE COURTS AND PAVILION PROJECT . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , Mr. King, this -- I made an appointment with Eileen Cipriani and also Bob Gattens from the Recreation Authority to discuss location of this project . I had suggested it be put behind the current community building because there is a big space there where they used to have, like, the tiny wading pools were there. Right now there's a old flagpole there. And it's pretty much falling down. But this also includes it says a new pavilion . There is a pavilion existing there if you look behind there. And it's a very large pavilion . So I had suggest ed to take the money from putting a pavilion in instead of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 building two to take the building that is there and connect that with the deck and stairs leading down into the courts so you could get in there from the building and also from the ramp that would be handicap . My reason for that also being behind there is there is water there. There is electric ity there. So all of the utilities are existing in that spot. So that just seemed to be the most likely area to put all these courts. And there will be new fencing and also security cameras. I was told they were to be installed and they would watched from the police department . So hopefully it would keep the area quiet. And the last thing I had, is Council does have -- we have a meeting scheduled with Mayor Cognetti and also Eileen Cipriani to start discussion for the pool area that we all agreed on that we need. So that is also in the works. MR. SCHUSTER : So also on the question to add to Mr. Smurl here, the one question I had on this was what area is that going to be located? I know that's Mr. Smurl's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 suggestion . And I think it's probably a reasonable spot for this. But can we add to that, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could get the administration 's plans on where this would occur and what demolition would have to be done? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ?

VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 227, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH PRESS RECORD COMMUNICATIONS NY LLC TO PERFORM COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING SERVICES FOR THE OFFICE OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT . MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I brought up a couple things when it came up last week at introduction . The original contract was for a six-month period. It seemed very reasonable . It was promoting the City of Scranton . They have a six-month extension . This contract here from what I read seems to be a two-year contract with a one-year extension . Last year we paid $30,000 for six article s and op-ed piece in the paper. I do see some changes in the language . It seems like some of the vision has changed. The last contract was to promote the City of Scranton but in this document I see things like Mayor's point of view, Mayor's perspective , things like that. It seems like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 that vision has changed . I know the recommendation came from the administration with the Economic and Strategic Development Plan. And some things I see here, there's a retainer that does not include cost for contact development . I don't know if that is going to be some added costs, if there's going to be additional requests that they're going to make for additions to this budget, I'm not really sure. So I don't know if it's something that's open to be more than we're seeing here if there could be some added items or if there is a -- well, I'll be voting against this. I didn't really like the vision change. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B. PREVIOUSLY TABLED -- FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 54, 2023 – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR THE LOCATION AND USE OF LOTS, LAND, BUILDINGS , AND OTHER STRUCTURES ; THE HEIGHT, NUMBER OF STORIES , AND SIZE AND BULK OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES ; THE DENSITY OF POPULATION ; OFF-STREET PARKING ; AND SIMILAR ACCESSORY REGULATIONS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA , AND FOR SAID PURPOSES DIVIDING THE CITY OF SCRANTON INTO DISTRICTS AND ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES THEREOF , PRESCRIBING CERTAIN UNIFORM REGULATIONS FOR EACH SUCH DISTRICT , AND PROVIDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF ITS PROVISIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPALITIES PLANNING CODE (MPC), 53 P.S. § 10101 ET SEQ., AS AMENDED . MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development finally , I recommend a final vote on Item 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , President King, I'm going to vote in favor of adopting the zoning ordinance because it would be the right thing to do for the entire city. I didn't have an opportunity last time we were making amendments and stuff to these ordinance s, but I did want to make a height restriction in the civic zone to be reduced from 100 feet to 70 feet. That would include all of the civic zone. That's the space between Moses Taylor and Mercy Hospital . And it would also include -- have include d the 300 block of Colfax Avenue. What we have now is both of those areas you are allowed to once this passes to construct anything 100 feet without going to zoning or having any other approval . That's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 MR. KING: On the question , I would just like to say there's been a tremendous amount of work and time and effort that's gone into this zoning ordinance . It's been well over a year and a half, two years and maybe longer. And I think it's a long time coming. I think that we have it, you know, in the best spot that we possibly can considering everyone in the city. It's never easy to please everyone . My father used to say you could please some of the people some of the time but you can't please all of the people all of the time. I'm sure you all heard that growing up. That's quite frankly true. And I've experienced that in any contract I've ever negotiated to leave with both sides are a little upset. That means you probably got a good contract because each side compromised a little bit. So I think that's what we have here. And I think that this zoning ordinance being 30 years old is long overdue. I believe there was a lot of time and effort and thought that went into this. There were amendments made. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 think it's exciting that we're going to be able to pass this tonight and then forward it off to Dunmore and it sounds like possibly Waverly . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm also happy that we'll be passing this ordinance tonight . It has been a long time coming. And I think that the updates to ordinance will be a positive for the city as a whole. And I'm glad we were able to reach a fair compromise with the resident s on the request that they had for us in the zoning ordinance . MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I just want to say how proud I am of all of you, the Hill Section resident s and Neighborhood Association and the other neighborhood associations throughout the city who came and showed their support for you. What makes our city great is neighborhood associations and residents like you. Persist ence prevails. MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I might as well also say something on the question going back to my year on the Planning Commission in 2012 or actually 2013-2014, I voted against the zoning of the Audubon School when that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 sold. And this fight for me goes back to that day. I was glad that the neighborhood came out and gave their opinions . I'm glad that they got their input added to this ordinance . I'm glad -- I was very proud to hear that some of the other neighborhood associations also supported them Green Ridge -- I might as well say who they are -- Green Ridge, Tripp Park, and the Bulls Head Providence Neighborhood Association , so very proud and thank them for their support . And I'm glad to see that we're happy with this ordinance . MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.

KING: This is a restaurant liquor license and it has been tabled until a public hearing can be held on Wednesday , May 17th at 5:45 p.m. One last comment before I end, I typically don't like to text during the meeting, but I did a few times because my daughter is competing in a track meet. She's a senior. I couldn't be there. And she did very well, ran her best time. So -- but her mother was there and it's Mother's Day weekend this weekend so -- if that's seen on YouTube , so be it. I love my daughter . I'm proud of her. If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
