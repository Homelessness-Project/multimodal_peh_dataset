REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 PARTICIPATION . MR. WECHSLER : Andy Sbaraglia . Citizen of Scranton . Fellow Scrantonians , the Electric City garage came out in the news again. The newspaper had a little -- a couple of lines on that, but they never said it was sold for dollar. I don't know, maybe they think we are going to forget all of these deals that went on with this parking deal. The city actually borrowed $58 million , one of them is a direct loan and the other is a lease. I believe they got like $28 million on the lease and went to court and borrowed the $30 million coming to about $58 million that the city is on the hook for. If anything ever falls apart, we are liable for that but the contracts that were also given out to Burkavage $4.1 million to lease spaces inside of the mall so if you want to pay on the mall just remember you already did pay. The $41 point -- $4.1 million . That's nothing . Now, we are giving $300,000 a year to maintain this so-called garage for 40 years because that's the length of the contract . And then we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 used to make about -- say about $3 million a year between parking meter revenue and fines so we gave that up. That's another $120 million over the life of this contract. Now, let us look at Electric City garage, who is making approximately $300,000 a year which the city already said, well, it's not worth anything , so we are going to force Mr. Burkavage to buy it, which we did come up with a dollar for it. I would offer it, too, but nobody asked me. This is what you passed. If you look at the total cost of this so-called parking monetization they call it, it costs the city somewhere like a quarter of a billion dollars either into loss revenue , taxes or responsibility . How you could have done it, I don't know, I'm not going to ask, that's up for an investigation to look into this. I mean, the money we supposedly got for the Sewer Authority pales in comparison to what we have lost with the parking deal, and I don't know how you can sit there straight face and think that was such a great, great thing for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 the city to do because you all voted for it. I hope when it comes to the roost I hope we get an investigation either from the federal , state government to look into that deal, but I think -- I don't if you find that offensive I guess. You seem to love it, but I can't do it. I'm a realist. I look at costs and what it's going to cost in the future. My future in this town is limited , we all know that. I'm just sorry to see you go so far in around the wrong direction . Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , city resident and taxpayer . I hope you all know that Friends of Scranton Public Library are conducting their quarterly book sale in front of the gym at the Marketplace at Steamtown , so right in front of Crunch gym so if you get a chance between now and Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. Please go and 0support the library . We are selling used books, paperback and hardcover, for one or two dollars . On Sunday, if you buy one of our black tote bags everything you stuff in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that bag will be free. Also, tomorrow night you are invited to a birthday party. It's the 30th anniversary of the Lackawanna County Children 's Library. Now, granted it is the County's facility , but it serves the children and families of Scranton . We are going to have a big cake, we are going to have all kinds of wonderful things. Those of you who have never been there you ought to take a tour. The building is beautiful . It's 102 years old. So come between 6 and 8 tomorrow night, which is First Friday, and see the services we are willing and ready and able to provide to the children of Scranton . Also, if you like that party there will be a bigger party next summer when the Albright Memorial Library on the corner of Vine and Washington will be 125 years old. It's currently closed for renovations through the end of December , but it's got a lot of work to do. They are updating the bathrooms and the circulation desk. They are redoing the mosaic tile floors and also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 after 125 years it's time to refinish all of the interior woodwork . That building is probably one of the most beautiful buildings in the city so patronize it when it reopens in January and you better come to that summer party because that's going to be a blowout. Now, where is my Knowel's insurance list? You thought I forgot, didn't you? I didn't forget and I'm not going to bribe anybody anymore I want my list. And is Rainey & Rainey going to continue to provide assistance to the Business Administrator 's Office for preparation of the audits? Are we going to continue to pay them under contract or is that office ready to operate without training wheels? MR. EVANS: I think Rainey & Rainey is going to continue for well into the future. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I wish they didn't have to do that but so be it. I would more -- I would rather see a partnership with the University of Scranton , have their accounting department come down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 here and teach the personnel what they need to do for themselves . That should be part of their job description . In fact, it is part of their job descriptions but that's just me. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council. Lenny Srebro, Scranton resident . I got some information for you guys that you couldn't get in six months I got in a couple of hours. Lots of maps, copies of deeds for that property , Scranton development , I'm not sure of the technical name, there is satellite pictures , all of the information that you needed, a copy of that. There is an easement on that property , the government was involved , you know, I'm hoping that I can get your pay for the last four to six months you kept saying that you couldn't get that information that I got in a couple of hours with the help of a good friend that I won't mention . How about it, Mr. Gaughan ? Now, three weeks ago you insisted that in one week we are going to have a meeting and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that didn't go through , then the last time I was here two weeks ago, I forget your words, you said you were going to go down there and meet with people, did anything happen? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I left you a message on your answering machine , the mayor has still not gotten back to us other than to say that he was going to be in touch with the DPW director . MR. SREBRO: Okay, I was in touch with -- I'll tell you what, I had the commissioner out there a week ago. I had the city engineer out there a week ago. I had the county engineer out there a week ago, and I had a representative from the Department of Environmental Protection . Geez, I'm getting done what I believe you guys are supposed to be doing, you know? So there you go. Here is all of the things you need and I'm not done getting information for you, so how about I get your pay? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, Mr. Srebro, with all due respect -- MR. SREBRO: You know what, I don't mean it as an insult --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. GAUGHAN : I know, but with all due respect -- MR. SREBRO: I'm trying to have a sense of humor. MR. GAUGHAN : I know, but with all due respect , and I am trying to help you here but, you know, you are giving me this information but I'm not the city engineer , I'm not the DPW director , to me this is like a foreign language . I wouldn't know how to clear a pipe or what material you had to do so what we're trying to do is facilitate all of this information to help you get the problem solved and we have been trying to do that, I have been trying to do that as well and I run into a roadblock , but other than trying to facilitate all of this I can't physical ly go out and do it and I don't know what else to -- MR. SREBRO: What is your roadblock ? MR. GAUGHAN : The roadblock , well, when you were here two weeks ago you wanted a meeting and I agreed with you and that's what I suggested with the mayor, with the DPW director , who I have spoken to, and with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the city engineer to figure out what else has to be done to get this problem taken care of. They were out there before, they spent money to apparently clean the pipe, that didn't work, so we are looking for an alternate solution . I cannot get them into a room all at once. We've asked the mayor. MR. SREBRO: Well, we had them at my property . MR. WECHSLER : We had them altogether , what did they offer you? When they were altogether what they did they offer you? MR. SREBRO: In about two weeks they are going to have some kind of answer, they are digging into it, but the thing is I had these power people out there for -- MR. WECHSLER : Well, congratulations . We have been trying. We have been trying to do this and you are saying that we failed you, maybe we did, and I congratulate you on your success and you had the power players there, congratulations . So if there is anything else we are supposed to be involved in we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 don't to the work. If you had all of those people there and they gave you two weeks, it makes no sense to come back to council in two weeks and say nothing happened . You had everybody there. MR. SREBRO: All right. Mr. Gaughan , so what's your -- what's your plan on what you have said the last three weeks to get together with you all of -- MR. GAUGHAN : We had gotten a response from the mayor and the mayor had said to us that he was going to reach out to the DPW director to assess the situation and he would get back to us. That has not happened yet. I can't force the mayor to do anything , unfortunately . I have been trying to get a meeting . We have sent a letter, we have called, I have called, I have asked and to the mayor's secretary . MR. WECHSLER : Who arranged the meeting that you had, you did that? You contacted all of those people and got them all there? MR. SREBRO: Actually , the commissioner that was here a couple of weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 ago she heard my story and -- MR. WECHSLER : Well, maybe the county is where you have to get this done. We have had no success getting this done. MR. SREBRO: But I believe in that document , as little as I understand how to read it, it's a combination of the government , the state and the city for that development , I think this is the way I understand it once again, but I believe it states that the city is responsible for maintaining that drainage ditch and also that there is an easement that anybody can go in there the state, the federal or the city can go in there to maintain that drain. You know, it's all always the same thing over and over and false promises and nothing gets done. MR. WECHSLER : I'm anxious to see how it goes in two weeks because you are getting the same response that we gave you from that meeting . This is the same information that we got. So right now it's -- to me, now it's in the hands of the commissioner . If she organized that meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 and in two weeks she is going to get you an answer I think it's in her hands. We can't do it here. MR. SREBRO: She wasn't going to get the answer, she was there getting the information . I believe it was the city engineer -- sorry, I can't -- MR. WECHSLER : We'll check with Mr. Pocius and find out about that. MR. SREBRO: You know, that was going to get me an answer to it. MR. WECHSLER : That's what we have been dealing with all along, Mr. Srebro. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council. You know, I'd like to take my hat off to this gentleman , maybe that just goes to prove totally how ineffective and dysfunctional city government is, but you know I'd like to say something about the election tonight . You know, the election is over, and I really think that it would have been a lot better for the residents of this city. I mean, there was really no support behind either candidate but Mr. Mulligan 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 insurance issue I think had to play pretty loudly in this election , but I think the residents of Scranton have to realize one thing, he couldn't give himself insurance , it had to come from the Authority or the mayor or someone . Someone made that possible and it's illegal . Mr. Bolus was in Court for that a few years back about putting people on his insurance policy that weren't employees . And, you, know the stuff going at the Scranton School District with the non-employee getting benefits , you know, you ask yourself where is the Auditor General or the Attorney General and where are the prosecution at, but politics has just reached a point where really law has no standing , politics stands over everything , and it's lead to America becoming a very, very corrupt country with a fallen standard of living and we have to -- I think the people at home should listen to some of the things that Andy Sbaraglia said because he is an older gentleman , we never know how long we are going to live, but listen to the amount of the money, the resident 's money, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 that this council and this administration gave away. It's mind boggling . It's just -- it's criminal is what it is. It's beyond criminal , only nobody will come in here from the state or the federal government and prosecute our elected government for it's incompetence for 25 years. It's just eye opening , and I do realize , you know, that the residents are in fear of their own government because they have told me so themselves , and the amazing thing here is that the city, from reading the newspaper accounts , is trying to bully the county into doing a reassessment to raise property taxes by doing an assessment so the city can gain more income. But, you know, the most troubling thing of all is when Judge Gibbons didn't tell the city to immediately put the alleged overtaxation of it's resident into an escrow account and strip the city of that money until that issue was settled in Court. But, I mean, when you see the pain and the suffering this community has accepted for 25 plus years from a totally dysfunction al 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 government and it continues on and on and on and on, I mean, here is a man that should have a row boat to get to his house and we don't have a city government capable of solving his problem , and you know the funniest thing of this whole issue that I find hilarious is the Scranton Sewer Authority was sold and the city can't even maintain the storm water collection system and had no plan. You know, I have an issue in front of the PUC right now of my own, but I intend to proceed with a second one after I settle one, but I really think that the council itself, even though you -- well, Mr. Rogan, you just won election , it's amazing , Mr. Wechsler , you are going home soon, but I just think you should all resign and I think the mayor should resign and I think we really need a new government here that realizes one thing the people are severely overtaxed. We are getting ready to build a splash park, where the community development money with all of the millions Mr. Doherty spent, the tree house, the bridge that goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 nowhere , all of the money into the parks. Now we are going to spend more money in the parks, for what? Most people don't use parks. They are barely surviving in their own homes because they are so overtaxed they have no discretionary spending of their own and you want more money, and the money that you had you invested , squandered , lost the investment and then threw all kinds of revenue away. Listen to what Mr. Sbaraglia said here tonight about the amount of money that's been thrown into the wind and then look at this council and this mayor and this form of the government and ask yourself one very simple thing, is this government working for anyone at all? It's not even working for itself. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council. I just wish to enlighten council and on something positive for a change. I'm not moving and I didn't drop dead last week, but years ago when the OJ Simpson trial ended the next day or two I have was having coffee with Mr. DeNaples and I was going on and on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 and on about the results Mr. DeNaples told me to be quiet and he said this man is innocent by a jury, by his peers, he said go forward , go on, forget it for the time. So I have decided to do that about this past election . I'm going to try quite being a thorn in Mayor Bill's side, though we have a lot of disagreement -- well, I have a lot of disagreements with his administration but I need to go on I guess. If there is any way I could assist him he knows that he could still find me at the Taurus Club men's room like in the past there. But to get -- this reassessment issue it's not going to die, I can see that. Assessment and reassessment is nothing more in the whole world than a form of revenue . This is the big lie that it's going -- taxes are going to go down. You are not going to borrow lawyer money and you not going to borrow $13 million and have taxes go down. They are not going to stay the same, the only thing that's going to happen they are going to go up in the future. You know, this a big lie what's being told about it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 That's period. They are not going down. Period to you, period to Jerry, period to Mr. Volpe, you people need to -- you need to get the facts and tell the public this is -- the taxes are going to go up for crying out loud. I hear people say maybe it's good. I seen in the -- on the opinions this Ed Cozen we need it, you know. Why don't he just voluntarily give a couple of thousand dollars extra, the rest of them, too, maybe to save someone from losing their house. And I had a gentlemen come over who has a relative at the apartments or had one he told me, why can't -- who wrote a contract without having prices in it? I understand a price control , these people say there is no protection for them. You are talking about a part of our society because I'm part of it, these people they are naive, you know, they are the most vulnerable part of our society and they are being taken advantage of. This company got all of these grants, loans, tax deferments because of the senior citizens and they are not fulfilling their part of the contract . Can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 something -- can't their tax status be rescinded or something ? There out to be some protection for these people, they need to go down to the Bureau of Aging I guess, maybe they could do something . This man didn't even know about the Borough of Aging. I told him I went down there and they did my will for nothing a few years ago, but I don't know what they can and what they don't do but you can't tell me -- you talk about the people, these people sent a man to the moon and back and, look, there is no help to get to save their apartments and their homes anymore . There is people there that -- well, this gentlemen told me they a house, he sold his in-laws house or something , he said they got about half what it was worth over the years and they lived there for, you know, so he was happy, now, they're rent is more than -- well more than they can afford. I think that definitely needs to be looked into by the attorney General or somebody . When this company got -- like I said, the only reason they are there with tax deferments is because of senior citizens and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 now they are evicting them. See what you can do. This is a great sadness for me to listen to these stories . Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. John Morrow. MR. MORROW: Good evening , Council , thank you. I'm here tonight on behalf of the Lackawanna County River Conservation Association . As you all may be aware, for the past 30 years the work that the group has done to improve the river, the City of Scranton , has been exceptional . The state of the river 35 years ago is completely unacceptable and what they have done has brought civic pride back to the city and to the county and they want people to enjoy the river and the outdoors along the river and so we are now in the voting for Pennsylvania river of the year, and I'd like to ask the council support us, ask everybody to vote, we have the information here, and we would love to see the Lackawanna river be voted the river of the year in Pennsylvania for our 30th anniversary which we also celebrating tomorrow evening as part of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 First Friday at the Hilton. We are having rock the river, which is going to be a benefit concert for the Lackawanna River Association and we are also going to be holding our shiverfest in January , riverfest, many other events along the river and would like to thank the city for all of the help with Sweeney beach that you have given us, and the related item under 7-C of tonight 's agenda the LCRA does work closely with the Heritage Valley Authority and I would like to support the city helping to maintain these trails that people worked so hard and it's incumbent upon us when we enter these capital venture projects to maintain them afterwards . I would also like to add before I leave that in anticipation of Ms. Maloney speaking next, I support the resolution being brought before you to speak out against the practice of gerrymandering in Pennsylvania . It's a subversion of democracy that should be practiced by the general assembly and is not -- we here are the 112th district , right across the street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 is the 113th district for representation and the general assembly in Harrisburg and that is not in the interest of Scranton to have our voices split. I'm sure all of you do not live in the city district and so that is also critical that I ask that you do support this resolution speaking out against gerrymandering . And if might share these with everybody . MR. EVANS: Before you sit down, could you also tell us how the citizens can vote for the Lackawanna river? MR. MORROW: Okay. I have the information right here on this slip. If everyone goes to Pariveroftheyear .org, I'll hand one out to everyone . MR. EVANS: You are not on the mic so you may not be coming out so it's Pariveroftheyear .org so if you want to vote for Lackawanna river as the river of the year, well deserved . I am a former board member of the Lackawanna River Corridor Association , so I'm very -- a big fan of all of the work that's being done on the river 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 and it certainly has come a long way. Owe Pariverofthe year.org. MR. MORROW: Thank you very much. MR. WECHSLER : Samantha Maloney . MS. MALONEY : Hello, members of council . I have a handouts for you. First, I want to thank you for your tireless efforts to improve Scranton . My kids and I really enjoy a lot of the different parks. Thank you. I just want to thank you for this opportunity to address council . My name is Samantha Maloney , I'm a resident of Scranton . I provided you with a copy of my statement today with references as well as the resolution that I'm asking you to consider . The resolution is part of a statewide nonpartisan campaign lead by Fair Districts of PA. The League of Women Voters and the PA Council of Churches as well as other nonpartisan groups. Currently , PA legislators draw their own district s without any oversight or standards to fairness . This is gerrymandering . It is not new, it's been practiced for decades by both parties . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 However , it's gotten far worse in the recent years in new mapping technologies and data mining technologies . This allows parties to predict the district 's outcomes with greater precision and, thus, protect their control , maximize their influence and minimize their accountable and keep their seats in office secure. Pennsylvania has the distinction of being cited in the national press as one of the three worst gerrymandered states. In five different widely used mathematical methods , I'm going to hand that out, to determine partisan gerrymandering , PA was the only state to rate in the top five in all of the categories . For example , the seventh district has been determined as one of the ten worst gerrymandered in the county. I have attached pictures of it's transformation over time. It turns from a near triangle to what is described now as a goofy kicking Donald Duck. Also, the 12th district could be mistaken for the boot of Italy and the 6th resembles the State of Florida .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Additional ly, in our area, Scranton , Wilkes-Barre, and Easton are lumped together in the 17th district as not to disturb the 11the district . In 2002, this narrow triangle did not include Scranton and by 2011 the rectangle has grown arms down to Easton and up to Scranton /Wilkes-Barre. Attached are pictures of the 17th district as well as the 113th and the 22nd state manned legislative district . As a result, whether you are a Republican or Democrat , this is bad for us and bad for our democracy . Basically , politicians no longer have to be accountable to all of their constituents . Incumbent politicians , located in the safe district , often do not even have opposition for a reelection and, therefore , results in lack of new ideas. Additionally , legislatures may be easily influenced by party funded superpacks and other outside interest s that target PA because we are a popular swing state. Even amongst all of these negative consequence s contribute to the feeling that an individual 's voice doesn't count at all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 If elected officials and gerrymandered district s can ignore a large portion of the constituents because the votes don't even matter. Citizens can become convinced that democracy doesn't work for them so why bother showing up. Additional ly, even well-meaning politicians can't effectively maintain their offices and effectively can't govern when the districts are so spread out. This is a dangerous attitude that eats away at the fundamental underpinnings of our society . However , many of our elected officials have been working across the aisle to change this. Today, there are companion bills in the Pennsylvania House and State which would establish an independent commission , citizens commission , to more fairly and transparently establish a state congressional district s. Senate Bill 22 is a cosponsored and bipartisan effort by a republican and a democrat . It is currently cosponsored by 13 state senators , including Senator Blake. House Bill 722, has likewise bipartisan support and is cosponsored by 99 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 house members including the reps from the 112th, 114th, 15th, 16th and 17th districts . This proposed legislation is similar to other successful state redistrict ing plans across the nation and it seeks to establish 100 member independent citizen commission . The commission will be independent . No current or recent elected official , candidates , political party officials or their aids or spouses would be eligible . Any PA registered voter that meets independent criteria can apply to be part of the commission . The commission will be transparent . It will establish transparent procedures , follow the strict timetable and provide meaningful opportunity for the public input prior to withdrawing the plans and, again, before adopting the final plans. All information will be available on a publically accessible website and the commission will be impartial and ethically bound. When developing these new district boundaries , the commission will not be allowed to consider prior election results , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the party affiliation of registered voters or the addresses of incumbents or any individual . Because we are fast approaching the 2020 census and because the change is PA's redistricting procedure would require a state constitutional amendment by voters, timing for the approval of the bill is critical . The first step is turning these two slightly different bills into one final piece of the legislation and it needs to happen by July 2018. Each resolution gives our legislators more evidence that theirs constituents desire to change. So far we have only 159 -- MR. WECHSLER : Go ahead. MS. MALONEY : Thank you. So far more than 159 counties , city and municipal government bodies have passed resolution s in support of these bills. Additionally , the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce has called for support of the bill. So I'm asking you, Council, to join your constituents and please consider passing the resolution to support of fair, fully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 transparent and partial process of redistricting . Thank you for your time. I can also answer any questions . Thank you for your support , everyone . MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, I think what we would like to do is review what you gave me -- MS. MALONEY : Absolutely . MR. WECHSLER : -- and then discuss it next week. We are going to meet the 7th and th 14th and see if we can get some consensus on it and go from there. MS. MALONEY : All right. Se you on the 7th. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council. Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxes paid, fees paid. Once again we had a county commissioner here a few weeks back and I was unable to attend last week, but a reading of Fine Print by David K. Johnston and it's investigative journalist , economist at a prestigious college and former tax lawyer and former IRS employee . What began as an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 effort by Kentucky to help a single company in Appalachia raise capital by keeping state income taxes withheld from worker's paychecks have grown to more than 2,700 companies in 19 states worker's paychecks -- when this book was first published , the big banks, carmakers, insurer s, a host of Canadian , European , Japanese companies all get the profit by pocketing the taxes withheld from American worker's paychecks. Since the Fine Print came out in hardback, two more states have joined the trend, Oregon and Pennsylvania . Now, Act 76 prescribes for two more percentage points to be deducted from employees ' paychecks to support schools and I contend that they wouldn't even have enough money that they would stop passing it out the back door. And a little addition , if go to DCreport.org you can find out more about this offer and read many more articles . Now, once again, it was mentioned on PILOTS. PILOTS are sent down a black hole. PILOTS are sent down a rat hole. PILOTS are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 payment s in lieu of taxes, they are usually only 5 percent of what honestly would be owed if it was a private corporation or private property . And where did I get to decide? I felt that the stadium we had was -- the Scranton /Lackawanna stadium was fine enough. We could have done a few renovations and called it quits, but no, we spent $60 million , I think, and raised county taxes 38 percent , and it goes on and on and on. We tear it down perfectly good facilities and put up new ones. Schools , we abandon schools and don't renovate , they just put a new one up and then the taxes go up 25 percent , 38 percent , and the city has been on the same group, so don't complain with money down the rat hole, tax exempt properties , and it wouldn't hurt for the state and the county to start kicking in here. And this issue on gerrymandering , I had an idea where we had a straight order, I don't know if anybody can see this, but they would have to move a border, expand it, have to reduce the population in that district 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 and contract . Say if Billy got more they would have smaller borders , and that's just the general drawing , but they have something similar here where it's more like on line with a circle and instead of an equal lot that hit the wall because you went like this, and it happens to have a lot of rhyme and reason why it looks like that and no more pink hearts, green clovers, yellow moons, and orange stars. They're always after me, lucky charms. Always after me, lucky charms. So, you know, the last election we had the speaker of the House in Pennsylvania stand up and say, well, we guarantee the election for Romney because of our redistricting and that's not right. That's not right. Certainly Romney didn't win and I'm pretty glad, I don't think so. And, by the way, down in Washington forget about your tax deep cuts, pay the bills for a change. Thank you and have a good night. MR. WECHSLER : Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, I would like to question whether you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 people are prepared to really vote on the budget, 7-B on tonight 's agenda. We don't have answers to the questions , and I would just ask one and if any one person can answer it I'll say you are ready to go. How much of the matching funds for the Electric City garage have we expended ? Nobody knows. How can you vote for a budget where maybe if all happens next year there is no money in the budget for that item and lots of other question . Mr. Gaughan , did you get all of the answers to yours? MR. GAUGHAN : I received a copy when I came tonight to the meeting , I haven't had time to review it. They submitted it late this afternoon, so I haven't even had time to look at it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, I think it doesn't have to be done until the 15th of December , I think you need to table it tonight until we have more answers than questions . And then I guess next I just wanted to call to your attention in case you missed it in yesterday 's Times about the park, another downtown park that -- I mean, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I question how many downtown parks do we need? This is not a city project , although I'm sure you will get involved at some point, but I don't think we need the Linden and Wyoming Avenue park at all. We need that back on tax roles. What about the storm water study, do we have a copy of that for public review? MR. WECHSLER : I'll have something to say in comments about that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, thank you. And just a couple of other items, are you all satisfied , are you going to vote on whether you are satisfied with the double -- or with the third party administrator plan that was approved yesterday by the Composite Pension Board? Does that satisfy your requirements for -- MR. EVANS: I think under circumstances it's probably the best we are going to get. MS. SCHUMACHER : Sad. MR. EVANS: Well, it is -- MS. SCHUMACHER : We deserve the best, not the best we can give but the best. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. WECHSLER : They are the only ones that bid on it. We only had one bidder. MS. SCHUMACHER : But that is a far cry from the third party administrator . They are just making appointments essentially , so it's certainly not a -- that was never nationally advertised but if you guys are willing to settle I guess we just need to get used to that. What about the status of the zoning update and redoing the condemnation procedure ? MR. EVANS: Well, I know the application for a grant is in process . I'll check with George Kelly from the county, he is the one that is doing that and see what the status is on that. I'm think we are going to start working on the condemnation policy on the first quarter of next year hopefully . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, hopefully . It's been long promised . MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : No delivery though. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 And then whatever happened to our vacuum trucks? I know we had them because I saw them with my very own eyes, unlike the paving truck, I mean, are they being refurbished so they can be reused? Were they sold? MR. WECHSLER : The vacuum trucks work but they are not reliable and they are in the process of upgrading them, but right now they are not reliable . MS. SCHUMACHER : So are we going to tried them in on new ones or are we just keep bagging and if so I think we need to better educate the public on the -- with the bill, I think that -- MR. ROGAN: I know right now there are two trucks that are operational . I had some discussions with the DPW, two of the four trucks are operational , personally I don't think that's the right way to collect leaves because you run into so many problems . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, okay. MR. ROGAN: But right now there is two trucks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MS. SCHUMACHER : So there is two trucks out of four. MR. ROGAN: Two out of four. MS. SCHUMACHER : When is the ABM meeting ? We are starting the last month of the -- MR. WECHSLER : I'll have that in comments . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, good. On 5-D, I don't know this we should be giving -- as a citizen , I feel that you people are responsible . I don't always like what you do, but you are responsible for protecting our dollars and to give a quarter of a million dollars to Scranton Tomorrow I think is just giving too much power away, if I may finish that thought , I think you need to find a way to do it out project by project so that we know what we are getting and when we are going to get it. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. YOUNG: Good evening , Council. Al Young, Scranton resident . Well, I see we finally got a report from Reilly. Here we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 go again. Twenty months ago I stood here in front of council and asked for your help to repair the hole in the yard. 17 months ago you put money aside in order to have the hole repaired properly . Now the report comes back and it has eight property involved , not two, with four options . Two of them were concrete conduits , two of them are plastic pipe that is passable for code. Now, apparently the way I read this report, and I hope you all have gotten the report. If not, you better get it, and study it hard. I have digested this thing really well, and the way I look at it the city has chosen the worst case scenario , option number four, without even considering going back and talking to any of the residents that are involved in this 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue. And I say, I hope you council members have received this report, if not, please get one and study it. Now, if you know what -- and did get the report and you know what is it in, you can see that option four is not the way to go. It has too many variables . There is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 too many crooks and crannies in the new line the way they have it written. I was always taught that the shortest distance between two lines or that the path of least resistance is a straight line, not come out from Braxton Avenue at a 30 degree angle, travel 20 feet and then take a 60 degree angle to go up through the properties , instead of using the original conduit . Option two has the original concrete -- or the concrete abutment, and option four has too many bends in it. Now, I realize that option two has four garages that have to be torn down, three of them right now are unable -- the are people are unable to use them. The fourth one, I was told by the engineer to be prepared because the way it's going to go the underneath has decayed at that point. So option four says because of the way they are changing the path of the creek they are going to take my deck, my next door neighbor 's deck, my shed and move it. Now, when you move something , tear it apart, it's old, it doesn't go back together properly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 I spent three weeks trying to fit the new deck floor this week so that it looked -- or this past summer so it looked decent. Now, with option four the way it shows in the schematic here that the creek will come within six to eight feet from my foundation . This is not acceptable. Now, they say that they are going to backfill the holes, all right, fill the holes. My hole is big enough you could dump a couple of truckloads in here, the next door neighbor has a hole in here you are going to dump a truck load in, but that leaves a void in every other spot that the fill does not go and then what happens when you get a freeze and thaw down the line? You get a cave in and city is going to say, "Well, we are there and we repaired this, it's your problem ." Sorry, I don't go along with this. So I would hope that the council would consider getting a meeting with the residents somewhere along the lines and sit down with the engineers and explain this thing. The way I look at it it's very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 unacceptable . And then I would like you to, if you don't like what I'm saying I would like you to consider option number five instead and that is repair the Young and Kennedy properties on the old conduit and let the "me too's" that are come along afterwards sit and beg for the 20 months that I have been here pounding on your podium. And, by the way, you are going to need easement s on all of these properties , if you chose option four the Kennedys and the Youngs will not sign it. Thank you for your time. MR. WECHSLER : Anyone else? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Perry? MR. PERRY: I have no motions at this time, I'll reserve all comments for the agenda items. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Rogan? MR. ROGAN: Also nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Evans? MR. EVANS: Wow. I'm going to break 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the string a little bit. I'm just going to comment briefly on the application of Ms. Johns that was sent to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission , it was completed . She worked with the Architectural Heritage Association . We have a letter from city council as well as a letter from the mayor in support so we just wish her well and hopefully that will come back approved . That's all I have. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you. Mr. Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Just on the leaf vacuum, I would just like to get clarification . I know we have two trucks that are going around the city apparently , but what is confusing to people is that they are being told to bag their leaves and then they are seeing the leaf vacuum coming around in certain neighbor hoods, so there is miscommunication and people aren't really sure exactly what to do so I think we need to really get that together . I did receive a complaint about pave cuts in the area of Mineral Avenue so we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 have been in touch with the pave cut inspector and believe the pave cut inspector was in with the gentlemen that reached out to me. I'll be interested to hear about the heating with NDC and ABM, hopefully we can get that done before 2018 because I have several questions , as I think everybody does. There was an e-mail from -- the solicitor for the city solicitor and George Kelly asking for an update on the estimates for remediation of the property at Linden Street and Wyoming Avenue and from what Mr. Wechsler said in the caucus that issue is going to be brought up on whether or not we should purchase that property next week. I have asked this question before and I would like to ask again that we send a letter to Mr. Shrive, the executive director of the Scranton Sewer Authority , on whether or not the authority has insurance . A few months ago, there was an issue where the insurer of the Scranton Sewer Authority had pulled it, pulled insurance on the authority and I don't think whether it's still in limbo, but I would like clarification on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that. I want to congratulate and thank Mrs. Maloney who got up and spoke in support of gerrymandering . I have had several conversations with her before and I also support ending gerrymandering . I would support that resolution and I think generally it's about transparency and it's about fairness so I'm looking forward to being able to vote on that in the coming weeks and I will hold the rest of my comments for agenda items. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . First of all, the NDC meeting will held on Monday, the 4th, at 10 a.m. it will be in the Governor 's Room. For right now that's going to be a meeting for the board of directors only. We are supposed to get the agenda I believe tomorrow for the meeting . That meeting will be a closed meeting as of right now. In regards to the Arcadis study, I attended a meeting last Monday, the meeting withheld the interested party, included the Pennsylvania American Water and the Sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Authority , the city, and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association . The meeting was a lively discussion concerning plans to move forward with the storm water management study, as of current ly right now there is no formal study, there is no study passed out. There is plans and discussions , but right now there is no formal study to be passed out. In regards to the Civil War Museum, we did have an issue with the access to the rest rooms, that's been worked on, but the administration and seeing that all parties are satisfied with that now and the lease is going to be ready to be signed for the Civil War Museum this week. I had a discussion today with representatives from the county concerning the RSF property on Wyoming Avenue. Currently the plans are for the County to submit grants for remediation for that property . Unfortunately , that property is not eligible for grants while it's privately held so my recommendation is going to be that we bring the issue back to city council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 next week for an up or down vote but in order for the any remediation to take place the city or nonprofit has to have possession of that property , so I'm going to recommend myself that we vote for the city to move forward with the purchase and that will allow the county to start applying for remediation grants, and that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Can I just add one more thing just on the NDC and ABM meeting ? You know, I really think that this meeting should be open to the public, and whether whose control that's under I don't know, but we have a lease with them so, you know, we have a vested interest in what is going on with the parking garages and I know that one of the responses is to go to the Parking Authority meeting but that meeting with NDC and ABM should be open to the public and we should be able to attend -- council members should be able to attend and I was under the impression that we would be able to meet with them in an open setting and be able to ask questions and ask for an update on the progress that they have made and what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 going to happen in 2018, so I would ask that we request that they open it up to the public. I don't see what the difference is. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Yes, I mean, we could make that request but you have to remember that NDC is a private company . Just like any other company , they have a board of directors and the board of director s met at their pleasure . I will request that it be open. I have not received the agenda yet so I'm not sure if there is a public portion to it, but all the meetings we had in the past have been amongst the board members only. MR. EVANS: I hate to jump in on your motion, but Councilman Wechsler is correct that was part of the agreement to handle the meetings that way but I think if this meeting is not public then I think we should call our own meeting with NDC and ABM hopefully the first quarter of January . MR. WECHSLER : They are not going to do that. MR. GAUGHAN : And just to add, I was under the impression that that's what we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 doing was asking for a meeting with them in public with council . MR. WECHSLER : We have asked for that and they have not responded . So this is a regularly scheduled meeting of the NDC board. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF TWO MILLION ($2,000,000.00) DOLLARS FROM ACCOUNT NO. 01.101031 (FNCB BANK-SEWER CLEARING ACCOUNT ) TO ACCOUNT NO. 01.100000 (PNC BANK-GENERAL FUND ACCOUNT ) FOR THE NECESSARY CAPITAL BUDGET FUNDING FOR 2018. MR. WECHSLER : At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. ROGAN: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I'm going to vote to introduce this tonight for further discussion , and I'll speak more about this when we get to Seventh Order and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 vote on the budget, but I'll ask next week that we table this because I do not believe that we should be spending any of the proceeds from the sale of the Sewer Authority until we get clear directive from a judge on whether the sale was actually legal and we can expend this money, and I'll talk about that more in Seventh Order but, you know, and I have said this for the past couple of months, I still have a concern that there is possibility we may have to pay this money back so I don't think it's a smart move at this point and if you look at our neighbors in Dunmore they have not spent any of the proceeds of the money, their portion of the sale of the Sewer authority yet because of the litigation . Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. WECHSLER : Aye. Opposed ?

GAUGHAN : On the question , again, I'll be voting to introduce this, but I do have reservations about this whole set up. Number one, because we are using money from the proceeds from the Sewer Authority to fund this initiative -- or not fund it but to give funding towards the $250,000 at this point and the total of $500,000 from economic development funds that are going to towards this project . On top of that, we are funding a portion of this as well for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 $75,000 and that's an increase from the $32,500 that was budgeted in 2017. On it's face, I don't disagree with some of the initiatives that were in the backup and I think overall , you know, I agree with the program , but I don't agree with essentially in my opinion subcontracting out our economic development services for Scranton Tomorrow , but at the same time funding the salaries for people who work in Scranton Tomorrow . We are looking over a three-year period at close to a half a million or half a million dollars in salaries , $70,000 for the executive director , $45,000 for the marketing and events manager and so on and so forth. I also have some additional questions that I'll be posing to the administration and hopefully we will be able to get those answers before final vote. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I'm in full support of this funding . This is an outgrowth of a recommendation from a study done by the National Resource Network . This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 money begin the process of reinventing and probably reinvigorating Scranton Tomorrow in to an organization that will within a three-year time frame lead us to the creation of business improvement district or a BID in the downtown. The rest of the cities across the country and in Pennsylvania have seen the BID concept lead to a more robust, cleaner, greener and business friendly downtown commercial district . BIDS are true economic drivers and I would expect the same from ours when it does happen. Our downtown is the core of our city and it wasn't long ago that our city core was hollowed out and outgoing in the wrong direction , but because of visionary developers like Charlie Jefferson and Art Russo, Don Amato, John Basalyga , the Rinaldi family and others, we are finally moving in the right direction , but it is important that we continue with that momentum and this is one of the ways that we can achieve that. Sometimes the rule of thumb is to facilitate change than just get out of way and think that's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 perfect example of that concept so I will be supportive of this legislation . MR. ROGAN: I couldn't agree more with what Councilman Evans just said, particularly on that last point that this will allow the government to help without standing in the way. Our economic development office is good at some things and there is other things that another organization would be better to handle. This is one of those items. The idea of having a BID, business improvement district , I think would be a home run where you would have tax dollars reinvested back into a particular district and small businesses are going to be what bring Scranton back. We have already seen a number of small businesses open up in the city and doing very well, small boutique shops and some larger medium-sized businesses , but it's the small business person that's going to bring the city back, and I have had a number of meetings with people involved on this project as well as some nonprofits and business interest s as well and everyone is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 very excited about this as I was as well. So be looking forward to supporting this. MR. WECHSLER : As Mr. Rogan stated, OECD does a good job at what they do, but sometimes they are restricted ins what areas they can invest money in because of the low to moderate income requirements . Allowing Scranton Tomorrow be become involved in this kind of opens that up to some more areas that perhaps would not be touched by federal funding . I have attended a few of these meetings also in terms of this project , the committee that's been formed to work on this is a cross-section of our entire region of people working to improve the downtown . It's a great combination of public and private people working together and I think is a good step towards revitalization of the downtown . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A PENSION TRUST AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPOSITE PENSION BOARD TO HOLD APPROXIMATELY $22,910,531.56 OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE ASSETS OF THE SCRANTON SEWER AUTHORITY IN TRUST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS PENSION REFORMS HAVE BEEN ENACTED . MR. WECHSLER : At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. ROGAN: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , in the caucus tonight I asked if we could have a public caucus with the administration next week or before final passage of this item to go through everything for an exclamation and also to answer some questions . Number one, I would like to know if any of the proceeds from the sale of the Sewer Authority that have been put into escrow $5 million for representation and warranties and $12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 million in escrow for easements , if any of that has been drawn down yet and, if so, how much is left in both of these accounts ? And I'm assuming that this money, whatever is left from those two escrow accounts , will be deposited into the pension funds eventually . I'd also lake to know what the schedule of deposit looks like. Will a dollar cost averaging method be used for the release of proceeds into the plan, I'm assuming it will be but I'd like clarification on that. There is also on top of this trust the possible creation of post-employment benefits other than pension trusts, so I would like further clarification on what that will look like and what that process will look like. And I'd also like it know if the Pension Board is enforcing the process of reducing pension payments disabled retirees if they become reemployed . Over the past couple of months, a year or two, we have been talking about the Klodack (ph) Act provision , if someone who has a disability pension goes and gets reemployed some place 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 else how that process works and whose that responsibility lying with, is it the third party administrator , is it the board, is it the existing administrator Anderson & d Associates ? So I would like clarification on that I believe the public caucus will be able to take care of that. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I would definitely concur with that. I have some other questions on what is going to be put in trust as far as performance is concerned . I have been comitted to additional reforms as well as another buy down of .5 percent of the rate of return. I think that's important and we have to make sure that's in there. The former rate of term was 8 percent , it was reduced to 7.5 percent because the COLA is not being paid to retirees, but I would like to see a buy down of another 5 percent so it's down to 7 percent and I want to make sure that's part of the trust, so I would definitely be agreeable to having somebody -- the administration come to discuss that.

ROGAN: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I'll be voting "no" tonight for final passage of the 2018 budget. Let me preface my comments by saying that I think there has been some progress made financially over the last few years on several fronts and the administration should receive credit for that. However , I still have major concerns with this budget and the city's potential 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 exit from Act 47. First of all, I would like to express my displeasure with the budgetary process this year. As a legislative body, we are tasked with providing oversight on the city's finances among many other things. Two weeks ago we are given the budget on a Wednesday , expected to introduce it on a Thursday , on November 8, and then had a half hour scheduled caucus with the business administrator where we are supposed to ask questions without even having really a chance to review the budget. Then that Friday, that was the business administrator 's last day. The following week, I had posed numerous questions asking for some clarification on different items in the budget and I did not receive any answers until late this afternoon and received the adopted document when I came into the meeting tonight without any time to review that information and, you know, in my opinion this is simply unacceptable . As a legislator , you know, we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 putting our name on these pieces of legislation and how can we do that when we don't have all of the information and we don't have all of our questions answered . I believe Ms. Schumacher posed several questions and I don't believe they have been answered because we didn't receive any response on them from the administration . That's also unacceptable because people like Ms. Schumacher come every week and ask questions that are legitimate and they pay our salary. Ms. Schumacher , among others, pay our salary so we should not take those questions lightly or ignore them. As it relates to the budget, my first concern , and I talked about this earlier tonight , is -- and I have addressed this over the last few months on numerous occasions is that the mayor is using $2 million of sewer proceeds to fund various capital budget items when the use of these proceeds may be illegal . A legitimate question , what I believe to be a legitimate question , was raised in a lawsuit recently which claims that the state Municipal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 Authorities Act allows the Scranton Sewer Authority to expend money only for purposes directly elated to it's mission . As such, state law prohibits the Authority from transferring sewer sale proceeds to Scranton and Dunmore for their general welfare . The suit calls for the return of all Scranton Sewer Authority proceeds to the Scranton Sewer Authority . So I don't believe that it's a wise decision at this point to spend any of money and I have been against this before until we can get a clear definitive answer on whether or not it is legal or not and whether or not we may have to pay it back if we would lose that case. Our neighbors , Dunmore , as I mentioned earlier tonight , have decided not spend any of their proceeds from the sewer sale until the lawsuit is resolved, and this decision was lead by Mayor Tim Burk and Councilman Tom Halihan who was quoted in the newspaper as saying, "I think we are siding on the safe side way not spending any of that money."1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 And I also think for once that the city should try to be on the safe side and ensure that it is legal to use these funds. The mayor and the Sewer Authority has decided to ignore my repeated questions as to why the Sewer Authority is still in operation and why the mayor has not filed the proper paperwork , determination certificate based on the resolution that was passed by this council terminating the Authority and dissolving it and filing that paperwork with the state. Keep in mind that ratepayers are still shelling out $130,000 a year for an executive director of an authority with no employees . For this reason alone, I will not be able to in good conscience vote for this budget. My second concern has to do with the pension and MMO payment . In this year's budget, there is a significant decrease of roughly $5.8 million mainly because of the suspension of the cost of living adjustments payments that police and fire retirees . The suspension occurred because of the pension 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 being labeled as severely distressed , which we all know that is by the Auditor General . The three-year exit plan shows a balance d budget each year mainly because of this reduction in pension expenses , and that is a good thing. My concern , however , is that after the sewer proceeds and what's left in escrow for easements are deposited into the pension fund when that happens , if it's even legal at this point we still don't know, at what point does the distressed label for the pension get removed , because when it gets removed the cost of living adjustment increases will restart and that will be an added other expense to the budget. COLA increases , obviously , require more funding and are an obligation the city agreed to under previous contract . The amount of funding that's going to be required , if they restart , I'm not sure because I don't know the exact impact the sewer deposit is going to have on the funds sine I haven't seen an actuarial study yet on that. Another question that I have is whether or not the city will be required to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 provide retroactive costs of living adjustment increases to retirees for the years that that was suspended . So if the retirees end up suing the city will we have to pay them back pay for when it was suspended ? And, if so, should we be accounting for this expense ? So we are seeing a large reduction in pension expenses but if we look down the road and this comes to light that the pension distress label gets removed, then we are right back where we started because we are now underfunding the pension again, at least that's my take on it. So my question is are we kicking the can down the road and ignoring the possibility that at some point the COLA increases are going to start again, possibly within the next three years, and what effect will this have on the budget and most importantly , what effect will it have on our exit from Act 47. And, finally , again this is another point that I have made, neither the budget or the recovery plan take into consideration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 the negative impact an adverse court opinion would have in any one of the pending lawsuits against the city on our finances in exiting from Act 47. So for those reasons , I will be voting "no." Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Real quickly on the budget, I'll be voting "yes". I'm very proud to be voting "yes" for a no tax increase budget for the second year in a row. Obviously , the taxpayers have been overburdened and we need to move that even downward but back-to-back years with no tax increases is something that I know many communities are certainly hoping for. I know last year when taxes didn't go up people said well, it's just because of the election . Well, the election is over and taxes still aren't going up and that's because the city, thanks to the mayor and thanks to the council , is in a much better position financially than we were a number of years ago. There is a still a ton of work that needs to be done but we are in a much better financial position and all in all those are things within the budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 because it just a multi- very thick stack. There are things in there that I think every one of us isn't completely happy with. All in all, this is how much -- and most importantly for the taxpayers is that it holds the line on taxes and actually has a small decrease for taxes on the real estate transfer tax, so I'll be very happy to vote "yes" for this budget. MR. WECHSLER : Yes, just a few comments on the budget. I congratulate Dunmore to be able to not spend any of the sewer proceeds . Unfortunately , Scranton was never in that position . We had several large term bond obligations that had to be repaid. We had -- as discussed this evening , we had to lower the interest assumption on our pension fund. These are things that had to happen now. The concerns that Mr. Gaughan have our legitimate concerns , but the interesting thing about those is four years ago when we got in the pension was out of money, now we are talking about -- worried about the pension has too much money, so that's a good problem to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 and his concerns are legitimate , but none of those are going to hit in 2018. The pension will not be in severely distressed status this year. There will probably not be any COLAs passed out because we are not going to be out of distressed status with that and we should start planning for the future when things may be different , but right now this budget addresses where the city is at this year. It's a real budget. I'm fortunate to attend the last few PEL meetings . The plan that was laid out in 2017 worked fairly well and it looks like we are going to make our MMO payment on time and these are all things that are coming together because of our budgeting process , so although there are some concerns , as Mr. Rogan said, I think this is good budget, it's a workable budget, it has been approved by our coordinator of the Pennsylvania Economy League and in the end it's up to the administration to be responsible for the transition and operation of the budget and I think they are prepared to do so, so I will be voting "yes".1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 MR. EVANS: On the question . Budgets by their very definition are really living and breathing documents . They're at times more heart than even science or math so I view the budget in totality as being a positive document . Is it perfect ? Of course. This document doesn't exist in a world of assumptions and historical data that sometimes is based on some past false premises , but there are some positive takeways in my mind in this budget. There is some small salary increase s, while unpopular to many I'm fully support ive of salary increases to key cabinet members and nonunion personnel . To retain and attract the talent that we really need to move this city forward we must pay them appropriate wage. Many are still at 2003 levels or near that 2003 level. So not to address that issue in my opinion would have been short-sided. There are increases in funding for Scranton Tomorrow in a city that sorely lacks economic development initiatives is positive to me. There is also a funding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 increase to the Shade Tree Commission . Tony Santoli has been operating and maintaining our tree population on budgetary fumes. To me, this is a quality of life issue and I'm in favor of it and I know Tony will do an unbelievable job with any additional funding . The budget puts back a position of the Director of Parks and Rec. Again, this is another quality of life issue and creates an opportunity to have a legitimate parks system and removes this department from under the shadow of the Department of Public Works and, of course, there is a reduction to the real estate transfer tax. That I'll discuss further next week. So I'd like to thank Dave Bulzoni for only crafting this, his final budget, but more importantly or listening to me and all of us on city council though his time on the BA I think that made the world of difference in the last four years with previous budgets and this one is moving forward . That's all I have on the budget. I will be voting "yes".1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 MR. WECHSLER : Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes.

WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , just briefly , I'm obviously going be voting in favor of this legislation and I think it is so important that the city continues to work with the Lackawanna County Heritage Valley Authority . All you need to do is walk down the trail in the spring or summer and see all of the people, all of the families that use that and how important that is so I think we need to continue our relationship and build on it over the next few years. Thank you. MR. EVANS: I couldn't agree more and it's funny the people you see down there, I see Councilman Gaughan there as much as I see anybody else. We are bother regular users of the trail, but as I said, families , seniors , bike riders, it's really a great asset to our community . MR. WECHSLER : Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR.
