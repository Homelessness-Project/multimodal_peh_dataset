CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM TROY & BANKS DATED SEPTEMBER 18, 2020 REGARDING TELECOM AUDIT. 3-E. MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 COMMISSION MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 3, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I had three comments on Third Order items. So starting with 3-B -- and Miss Cipriani is here. So I think she can answer that. I was wondering who the members of the Blight Task Force are. So I think that could be done maybe in Fourth Order. And then when looking at 3-C, the Single Tax Office, I see as of September we're about 420,000 off from last year. Where do we expect to be at the end of the year? And then with 3-E, with the adjustments we made to Act 120 with the employees and their job offers, I assume we're still going to be taking the most qualified candidate s. Is there a current method that we use for taking those candidates and would we still use that system or are we planning on moving to a different or revamped system? MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Does anyone else have any comments on the Third 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Order items? I just want to say one thing. There's a letter, 3-A that was received from Senator Casey regarding the COVID-19 pandemic . I just want to thank Senator Casey publically and his office, especially Amy Wechsler . They have been transparent. They've been open with us. They have taken our calls at any time over the last few months. And I know Senator Casey is doing everything in his power to help the City of Scranton and cities like Scranton throughout Pennsylvania . Unfortunately the CARES Act is just, you know, there are members of the Senate that I don't really know what they're thinking in terms of letting cities just flounder like this during the pandemic . But it's very, very disappoint ing. We did try -- Councilman Donahue and I tried to get a meeting with Senator Toomey. And we never heard back from him, which is again very disappoint ing. But Senator Casey I know is trying his best to help our City out. So I do appreciate that. The second thing I wanted to mention was the correspondence received from Troy and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Banks. I asked over the past few months for an update on the utility bill audit. So just so everyone knows, that is an update on the utility bill audit. We are looking at realizing an annual savings of $2,360.40 based on their audit, not as much as I was anticipating or would have liked but it is something . So I did appreciate the update there from the administration . And that's all I have. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any other comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one announcement . The City of Scranton fall leaf pickup and recycling program will begin next week the week of October 12th. All leaves must be placed -- must be placed in biodegradable brown paper bags. There's bags available at the DPW complex located at 101 Poplar Street and also at the Weston Fieldhouse located at 982 Providence Road. All collections will be from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 curbside of streets and avenues. No collection s will be in courts or alleys, no loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash in leaf bags. Fall leaf pickups will be the week of October 12th following paper, the week of October 26th following cardboard , the week of November 9th following paper, the week of November 24th following cardboard and the week of December 7th following paper. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have an announcement . There's going to be a ground breaking ceremony this weekend on Saturday at 11 a.m. And that's going to be taking place at 715 Cedar Avenue. It's for the Garden of Cedar which is going to be a great community garden in South Side that they are starting to work on. So the public is invited if anyone is interested in attending that. I know that I'll be there because I'm excited about it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Anyone else? All right. I have a few. As I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 mentioned last week, we're making a very slight change to the time of day in which public comment will be received in our office and via mail. We're making a change from 4:30 p.m., to no later than 3 p.m., in order to compile all public comment submission and to enable them to be read aloud during Fourth Order Public Participation . We did start this process this week. So moving forward , any comments and questions should be submitted by the new deadline of 3 p.m., on the day of the meeting which is Tuesday . Also please keep in mind that you should try to keep your written comment s to at least five minutes . October 10th, there is a fall fundraiser book sale at Nay Aug Park sponsor ed by the Scranton Municipal Recreation Committee from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. This is featuring three local authors that are promoting and signing their new books. There will be paperback books, hardcover, DVD, CDs, candles , crafts, raffles and more. Mask and social distancing is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 expected . Gloves and hand sanitize r will be supplied at the event. NDC will attend our caucus on October 20th, 2020 at 5:45 p.m., to provide their third quarter parking update. Scranton Tomorrow will have a caucus with Council that is scheduled for October 27th at 5:45 p.m. And they're giving their quarterly update to Council . Next Monday, October 12th, City Hall is going to be closed for Columbus Day holiday . DPW will also be off this day. Refuse and newspaper and recycling will be one day behind schedule next week, the week of October 12th. And finally , a paper copy of Council 's weekly agenda including a copy of all legislation and backup is able to be reviewed in the City Treasurer 's Office, the first floor of City Hall. The Treasurer , Mary Jo Sheridan has graciously agreed to the weekly agenda being placed in her office for public inspection and review in the event that the public does not have internet access. The agenda is posted to Council 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 page on the City's website each week as well and will continue to be posted there. The paper copy is just another option and a means of striving for full transparency with regard to legislative matters . Also, a legal notice is placed weekly in the Sunday edition of the Scranton Times with Council 's agenda for the next meeting . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And now we'll continue where we left off. Thank you, Director Cipriani and Business Administrator Deeley and Mayor Cognetti , for sticking around here. I'll turn it over to you, Eileen, if you want to talk about the Blight Program . MS. CIPRIANI : Thank you very much, Chairman ; and thank you, Council members for giving me the opportunity tonight to talk about the Mayor's initiative to fight blight in the City. We're taking a multiprong holistic approach to blight. And when we started that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 off with an internal task force. The internal task force is a precursor to having a larger external task force. But currently to answer the question that was asked in the earlier segment , the internal task force currently consists of myself and Rachael Swartz from our office, Don King from City Planning , Tom Oleski from LIPS and Carl Deeley and Megan Preambo who is the Deputy Director in LIPS as well. Those staff members are working together internally . And we decided to work internally before bringing it up to a larger level because we really wanted to look at process mapping and how we were dealing with blight in the City. So we've gone through the process of documenting the entire process . And it was a very valuable opportunity for us because we found issues with some of the process es we have that we've been able to iron them out so that we could take a property from being identified by someone in the public or inspectors and placing it in the process to either hopefully be rehabilitated . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 But at the end of the road if we can't rehabilitate the process or the property , then we'd be able to take it and slate it for demolition . So this group has come together . We've identified 80 properties so far that are part of our blighted list that we're looking to address in the City. We're working now to develop a scoring rubric so that we can prioritize and be as efficient and as effective as possible in address ing this. Like I said before, the idea really -- we want to be able to rehabilitate as many of these properties as we can. Demolition is the last resort. But we do have quite a few properties in the City that are past the point of being rehabilitated . Since May, we've taken down seven properties in the City. OECD has taken down six. One has come down by DPW. So that totals the seven that we've taken down. We have three others right now that are in the process of going to the abatement process so that we can address the asbestos in those properties . So hopefully we will have those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 addressed in the next month or so. Under the current contract we have with our vendor, Brdaric , we might be able to take down two more properties before the end of the year. So we've lined up these properties that we've had and placed them in buckets of funding. That was another priority of our task force. Last year we had $300,000 and we're finishing up that contract right now for demolition . Next year we have 225,000 that's CDBG funding that's slated for demolition . As you know, we've had $300,000 that we have applied for for DCED grant. And I thank you all for pushing that forward for us and supporting us in that effort. We also have what's called Act 98 money that addresses fire structures . So we have quite a few properties that were affected by fire in the City. So we're working in concert with the City Treasurer to be able to address those properties as well. We met just recently with our partners with the Land Bank, with the County and with NeighborWorks so that we can get on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the same page with these organizations to see what their strategies are, what their funding s are and what they were planning to do going forward . In talking to the Land Bank, there are 63 vacant lots in the City of Scranton that they're attempt ing to sell right now. Some of those properties are not properties that are buildable but they are hoping that maybe they could get neighbors to purchase those properties . In addition to demolition though, that's not the only thing that we're trying to do. We have other programs that I'd like to talk about a little bit. One is our Home Rehabilitation Program . In the past five years, we've been able to address 20 homes with that program in the City. And those properties have been taken to -- brought up to code in this program . So it's been really valuable for properties that were in a really dire situation . But as we looked at this program over the course of the six months or so -- last six months, what we realize d is this program is not being utilized and as effective as we would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 like it to be. So right now we're in the process of drafting an RFP so that we could use our community partner s to administer this program . That gives us the opportunity to avail ourselves to program s that they have, whether it's lead abatement , whether it's program s to do medical adaptation s to homes so that we're not working in a silo. It gives a more holistic approach to that. So that's a program that we're working on right now. Another program we're working on is the U.S. Mayor's Conference . Mayor Cognetti has been given the opportunity to support a program to apply for $150,000 grant. So the City is partnering up with NeighborWorks will take the lead, UNC, and SLHDA to apply for this grant. The idea of this program would be -- we'd be able to do smaller programs , some handyman program s that we may be able to help elderly citizens in the City stay in their homes. That's really important that they could take advantage of this program and be able to make those repairs that allow them to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 stay in there potentially medically but allow them to stay in there because of some repair that they can't afford to address . Another great program we have is the Home Buyer Program . In the past five years, 53 homeowners have taken advantage of this program . NeighborWorks is who administers it currently for the City. And we have 17 applicant s in the program hoping to get through and qualify . My favorite program , Building Blocks, two hundred and one households have been able to take advantage of that program in the City. Twenty-five blocks have been address ed. And at a rate of two to one of private funding and public funding together have worked on this program . So Carl Deeley and myself have been looking to put together a way that we could have sustainable funding so that this program could be good into the future. That's a really important goal of ours. I want to apologize . I have two dogs here that decided to make a little noise while we're doing this. Another good program we have right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 now is that just teed up is the Neighborhood Initiative . The Mayor has taken City Hall out into the streets and into the parks and into the neighborhood s and have given City members -- City residents the opportunity to get their questions and concerns addressed and be able to identify issues in their neighborhood , concerns that they want to bring to our attention . It also had given the opportunity for our inspector s to go out and walk around the neighborhood and be proactive in finding properties that may be problematic or potentially problematic going forward . So that's been a huge success . It's also spawned another initiative , the Mayor's Volunteer Corps, which we had a number of people volunteer to come forward and want to help address blight, cleaning up these vacant properties in the City, cleaning up trash and litter around the City. So this program will be coming together in the future. We also talked to NeighborWorks who I understand is putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 together an Adopt a Lot Program which would allow neighborhood groups or community organization s to adopt a property that they could help maintain and take care of. So a lot of good things going on in around blight. I had sent you my remarks earlier . So you do have those. But if there is any question s that I might be able to answer for you, I'd be more than happy to take those questions . MR. GAUGHAN : I just have one question and one comment . My first comment is I think there is a lot of great work going on in OECD now just based on the number of grants that we've seen come through on Council which is more than I've seen in the last few years to be quite honest with you. So that would be number one. Number two, the Beautiful Blocks Program , I saw firsthand the effect that that has on a neighborhood because my block was a part of that. Now, I wasn't a part of it because I thought it would be a conflict . But all of my other neighbors up and down the one side of me and then on the other side of Rock 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 and Rockwell Avenue took part in that and -- over the last two months and the difference the people that are -- were employed on the projects , the difference it made in the neighborhood . The property values definitely went up. A neighbor of mine put a new roof on, new sidewalk s in, put a retaining wall in. You just saw a lot of development . And it really was because people need that extra push. And it was a great thing to not only see that but to see my neighbors come together for that project . So whatever we can do, Eileen, in terms of making that as big as it can be I would be in favor of that because it definitely works and you could definitely see a difference in the neighborhoods . MS. CIPRIANI : I agree with you, Councilman . I met with NeighborWorks last week, week before last. And they're looking at some strategies . You know, we want to go out and talk to some more of the nonprofit s that might be interested in committing to this program . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 But you're right. Everywhere you go when you talk to people they know about it and they really appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, definitely . I appreciate that that's -- that's still the project that's really being focused on. The only question that I had, I get stopped as all Council members do I think on different properties that people want taken down. One specific one is 2939 Birney Avenue. And I know that that was on the list that was submitted with the grant for demolition funding . My only question would be I know that maybe Carl and the Mayor could answer this as well. There was $145,000 line item in the budget for demolition outside of OECD funding . So is there any -- can you give us an update on that specific property , 2939 Birney Avenue and if -- is there any way -- are we utilizing the $145,000 funding for demolition or are we pushing that off because of the pandemic ? MS. CIPRIANI : No, no. We will be using that. LIPS is very much part of this conversation . That's in my group of potential 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 properties if we have enough money left in this contract that we have right now. One of the things that we're doing to try and move from this contract to the next is, we're beginning to draft the next RFP so that even before this is over, we can move into that one. We are now almost maxed out in this contract . So we do have to get another vendor or have it bid out and have this vendor back. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And I was just -- I'm really pleased to see the demolition . There's an uptick in that. There is so many -- when you mentioned , Eileen, about the properties that were affect by fires, there are so many properties that are still sitting there that have gone through a fire. And we get -- I get stopped all the time from different neighbors throughout the neighborhoods throughout the City who want an update on those and want to know what the status is. So I'm really, really glad to see that's going to be a priority . And last question from me would be in the one piece of legislation that was sent down, OECD was looking to get funding to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 demolish several City properties throughout the parks. One of them was in Connell Park. Do we have an idea of -- I know those structures need to be demolish ed. Do we have any idea yet of what -- are we replacing those with something or are we just getting rid of those structures completely ? What's -- MS. CIPRIANI : Right now the DCED grant is just to demolish those. We're doing a park's assessment . So the park's assessment will give us an idea for CDBG funding. And DCNR is opening a grant round at the beginning of next year. That will give us an idea to prioritize which parks we need to address first. So it will be a matter of working through that list. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, sorry, Mayor. Go ahead. MAYOR COGNETTI : To your point a minute ago about the Act 98 and the fires, pulling -- pulling this list together and pulling all of these things together it's been a really great example of how we're trying to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 kind of break down the silos of the different businesses of the City. So you've got the Fire Department , the Treasurer . You've got OECD. You've got LIPS. You have so many different things that were siloed. And by doing this Blight Task Force and bringing all of these teams together , we're able to really get through some of these things. Something like the fire propertie s, it involves , you know, everything from legal to licensing and inspection s. It's very -- something very complicated . But now that we've done the process map -- and we're happy to share any of these very geeky process maps with any of you. It's really helped us figure this out and be able to have this plan going forward . So I'm just so appreciative to the team and to all of you because every Council person reaches out and you guys help us understand what the problem s are out there. So I really see this as a team effort. MR. GAUGHAN : The process -- thank you, Mayor. The process map that you just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 mentioned -- and I know I talked to Carl about this because we talked about how important that is for the public to understand . Over the last few years what I've encountered is, you know, a neighbor will stop a Council man and ask what's the status of this house? You know, it's been in disrepair. The grass is 8 feet high. Did anybody go out and take a look at it? And sometimes it looks like nothing is being done although something is being done. But it's in that process , the process map that you talked about. So I would appreciate if those could be made public, like, even, Eileen, when you're talking about demolishing a house, I think people need to understand the steps that have to be taken first because , like I said, often times they think nothing is going on when we're just in the middle of step two or step three or whatever that might look like. And even in terms of, you know, giving it a quality of life ticket or demolishing a property , condemning a property , there's all of these processes that again, people need to be educated on because I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 remember when I first came on Council , all of these different things can be very confusing. I think that would be very -- the process map idea would be very helpful to me. MS. CIPRIANI : Yeah, absolutely we could actually post it up on our ScrantonWorks website and look at it there. And we'll certainly send it onto Council . One other thing that I don't think people realize that's a very frequent occurrence is that we may have a property that we are scheduling to go through the Housing Appeals Board or it's going to be demolish ed and it's sold. That's a very frequent occurrence . And then we have to start over again. So I don't think people realize the -- and I didn't realize before I got into this how often that happens . MR. GAUGHAN : And I'd love -- that's a great point. I'd love to be able to point people from the public to that website and say, okay, when you're coming to me as a councilman with a problem property , here's what this process looks like. And then people, you know, will be able to understand that better. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 appreciate that point being brought up. I don't have any other questions . I know, Councilman Schuster , it looks like you have a question and then anyone else that wants to jump in. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I will say once I heard the term process mapping I was happy to hear that. I've seen some of them in my own workplace . And sometimes some of those processes are crazier than one would realize . So I think when it comes to say, like, you know, the quality of life things if we get an address or we get a property for demolition , that will definitely help when it comes to putting that in the right place and, you know, sending it to the right channel . I did have a couple questions . Mark McAndrew prepared a statement . So I'll read off Mark's statement . So he said, "Last week during caucus we had technical difficulties which prevented me to pose my question s to the administration regarding the internal LIPS Department assessment and the finding s. So this week because of a contractual obligation as a teacher , I'm unable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to attend tonight 's caucus but would like to pose those questions . So recently I and like clockwork at least twice a year, stories referencing Mr. Bond appear in the Scranton Times and Newswatch 16 Investigates . Both of these report that Mr. Bond continue s to rent unregistered , uninspected and therefore , illegal apartments while owing around 250,000 to the City, School District , and County taxes. Mr. Bond insists that his apartments are registered . The City records insist they are not. Are they register ed or are they not? And I also want to know as well as citizens of Scranton that do pay their property taxes and refuse fees, what is going to be done to resolve this once and for all so that best practices are put in place to prevent this from happening again? Mark McAndrew . MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, so earlier this year we did file a lawsuit against Mr. Bond. So we'll check back in with the Law Department for the status of that. That was in -- I want to say that was in February because that was before the courts closed we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 got that in there. And in terms of LIPS review, you'll see -- so just the things that Eileen just spoke to a lot of those we're piecing together the review -- pieces of the review and some of these other processes . But you'll see right now we're working on reviewing the quality of life tickets and that process and looking at some potential changes to put to Council is one piece. We're also in the new budget as -- we had previewed something with Councilman Gaughan a couple weeks ago and will continue these conversations about the budget with you all in the coming weeks. We're looking at restructuring things a little bit, putting a bit of a different structure in place and putting some of the LIPS organization spreading it out a little bit more and tieing it more to economic and community development . So we'll be sharing those ideas and thought s with you. Those are some of the pieces of that -- us reviewing internally . And that's -- a lot of it is going to be baked into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 this new budget and some of these ideas not just -- not just quality of life but also rental registration . The Law Department is looking into rental registration ordinance s and try to figure out what it is that we need to change to be able to have more teeth really to Councilman McAndrew 's (audio interruption .) MR. SCHUSTER : And then a question that I had regarding a Third Order item, recently we changed the Act 120 requirements when it comes to jobs and job offers with employment with the City. I would assume that we've always been taking the most qualified candidate s. Is there a method or a system of ranking that's currently in place? And do we plan on continuing this system or are we revamping that system as well? MAYOR COGNETTI : I don't want to answer any specific questions to that without having either Chief Namiotka or the Civil Service Commission here. Just absolutely not, we're not -- we're not decreasing our expectations of new hires. We're trying to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 open this up further to more people that would be qualified to join. So this is absolutely not decreasing the quality of candidates . But in terms of the specifics , I'd rather bring on the Chief and/or the Civil Service Commission to answer that. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, and, I mean, to clarify that one, I didn't think we were, you know, lowering the qualification s or anything like that. I understand that we're trying to get -- to get more people to apply there. I just didn't know if there was, you know, some type of ranking system as to -- you know what I mean? MAYOR COGNETTI : There is. And I wouldn't want to misspeak . And my understanding of it is not as detailed as we can get from somebody from the police department . ATTY. HAYES: Tom, there's a formula that they use to rank the applicant s based on the written exam and the oral examination and then -- and then just pass/fail on the physical agility , psychological background and the rest. So there's a formula they have in place.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And that will determine the rank. And then the Mayor at her discretion can select from the top three candidate s or however many hires the department needs. So there is a set formula for that. And that's set forth in the Civil Service rules. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, so, yeah, that answers my questions . So is that going to be revamped or we're looking -- ATTY. HAYES: No. No. That's still in place. It's in the Civil Service Codes, 60 percent written , 40 percent oral. And then the rest of the criteria are pass/fail. I think what the Mayor is saying is, all that they're doing is trying to get more applicant s to open it up so they have more people applying for those entry level positions -- the patrol position so there is a broader field for the Civil Service Commission and the Mayor to select from. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Anyone else have questions or comment s about Director Cipriani 's presentation ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. DONAHUE : I have just -- DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry. You can go ahead. That's fine. MR. DONAHUE : I just have one comment and just two quick questions . My one comment is, I was happy to see that 913-915 Eynon Street was on this list. I know that's been a problem property for the neighbors for quite some time. Myself, Council man Gaughan and at the time Councilman Evans were all over at that property and what those neighbors had to deal with. So I'm happy that that's being taken care of. Do we have a timeline on when we're going to get a progress update on the internal LIPS assessment ? MAYOR COGNETTI : So in that -- that's what I'm talking about in the budget. I mean, a lot of the -- the assessment is -- the results of the -- our assessment changes in the budget, changes to ordinance s that we would be proposing to you, quality of life, rental registration and things of that nature. MR. DONAHUE : I would just -- one thing that I think should be is the process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that's used in LIPS to document certain things. I believe that's an issue we've run into in the past where things aren't properly documented . And then if something goes in front of a magistrate or, you know, we really don't have a case. So that's something -- just because , you know, as I talked to some real estate agents and as we see in our real estate transfer numbers , you know, I think we're getting a lot of influx in from New York and New Jersey because of the pandemic . And we don't want to be in a situation three years from now where we're dealing with 10 Ken Bonds instead of one. MAYOR COGNETTI : Right. Some of these things we absolutely are doing. For example , Megan Preambo has come in. And she has added a lot more process and documentation to the department . Tom Oleski's been doing a great job. Megan's been able to come in and add another administrative layer to that. So we have a new -- we have a new tracking system for all of the inspector s that they are following 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 to supplement -- have another check on what are the properties in their area that they need to be looking at, what's the status of those, when do they need to go back. And it's a shared spreadsheet across departments so that we can all look at that. So that's also something that my office has. That way when a constituent e-mails Scranton 311, for example , we either -- Chris from my office adds to that directly . So that will pop up on the list for the inspector. And Chris can also look at that and update it if, you know, one of you e-mail in and say what's the status of this particular property . He has that information at his finger tips too. As you all know, next year we're wanting to get all of this in real time, real technology format that we're all sharing . In the meantime though, we kind of have this new process that is helping with that. And in terms of documentation , Megan has done a really good job working with Tom Oleski and Billy Lucas to be -- doing a better job of filing things electronically , especially so that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 they're more searchable . Nothing is going to be perfect until we get this new system. But in the meantime , we've made some good strides with some pretty simple fixes on how we label documents , how we label photographs , how we label information for each particular property . So in addition to that on the lot Law Department side, the Law Department is really focused on licensing and inspection so to your point the documentation piece. It's a -- yeah, we still got a ways to go. But there has been great improvement this year. MS. CIPRIANI : Mayor, and if I could add, the list you referred to from LIPS, we've taken that list, cross-referenced it with the demolition list we had with the list that came from the Housing Appeal Board and Treasurer 's list of Act 98 properties so that we've been able to make sure that we have a really good documentation across the board. MR. DONAHUE : And just another -- so a problem in the past is a house would appear or a property would appear on a demolition list. The structure would be torn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 down. And then the property would become overgrown. So, like, are we keeping a list of that to make sure that those properties are being maintained , you know, until they move through the Land Bank or until they move through some other avenue? MS. CIPRIANI : Yes, we will have a list. And we do have a list of the properties that the Land Bank actually have. And we do have a list of the properties that we have demolished . Brdaric , the current vendor has really been doing a good job of levelling the properties and seeding the properties so that they will not be overgrown. And we can maintain them. And it will make it easier for our team to maintain them. And with the advent of the volunteer corps and the Adopt a Lot Program from Neighbor Works, we're hoping to be able to help our DPW Department with a little bit more resources to keep them maintained . MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. And I just -- just, Miss Cipriani , you brought up about housing being sold in the middle of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 going through the demo process . Is there anything on it from a legal standpoint we could do at the front end to prevent that? MS. CIPRIANI : Well, that's a conversation that, you know, we opened up with our legal department . I'm not sure of the answer at that point. We've talked to -- the Mayor and I have talked to the City of Pittston . They have a great program in Pittston . So we're trying to get some lessons learned from them. But that is a really good point. And it's a real weak point in this whole process which sets us back very often. And we're not able to address that house at the last minute when we're ready to take it down. But that is something we'll look into. It's something that really once we have the overall task force together would be a great initiative for them to take up as well. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple things that I wanted to add and a few questions as well. I'll try to be brief. I just want to thank Director Cipriani for giving us an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 overview of the programs that we've had like the Home Buyers Program and Beautiful Blocks. I'm glad to see those programs are working out and helping people in Scranton . I also, you know, appreciate the update on where we're at with the Blight Task Force. You know, I think it's good that we've put these different processes into place that we might not have had before and helping to get more organized . Something that I've noticed that's been problem atic for me and I know I've expressed this before to the administration in speaking about it with the Mayor, I really would hope that in the future that we have a better system for closing the loop with requests and complaints , not only with Council but then with citizens who also make those complaints so people do have an idea of where things are at in the process for whether it be for a particular property , for quality of life or the demolition process because if -- if we don't know, then it's hard for us to give that information then to the citizens . And it's -- I think been making my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 job a little bit harder having to check back on these different complaints . So that's something that I still feel like we need a bit of improvement on. And I think it will help once we have -- if we're using a different system with the computers and the tracking if that changes then that will help too. And I was -- I was going to bring up the demolished properties Councilman Donahue had brought up already . But just to echo his points, I do see that being a problem often times that we have these empty vacant lots perhaps where there was a demolished building or property . And it is becoming overgrown and no one is taking care of it. And it's not really clear on who should be taking care of it. You know, I think it's something that can be prevented if we know to keep an eye on those properties and have that list up to date. And lastly, I have noticed and I'm really happy to see this, props to our DPW Department . I have been noticing them painting pedestrian crosswalks and lines throughout City and over the weekend . They were in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 neighborhood and not only helped the appearance , but most importantly the safety of the neighborhood by having freshly painted crosswalks or new signs. So I really do appreciate their work on that. And I just want to thank you all for coming in for our caucus and for part of the meeting to help give us an update. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. I don't have any more questions . Does anyone have anything else to add before we wrap the -- this portion of the meeting up? Okay. Director Cipriani , thank you so much for coming and the great job that you're doing I think so far and the information that you provided to Council has been very, very helpful . And thank you, Mayor Cognetti and Business Administrator Deeley, for your presentation tonight . And we look forward to continuing -- to continue to work with you, okay? MS. CIPRIANI : Thank you very much. MR. DEELEY: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, everybody . Bye-bye. Okay. And now we'll continue with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the Citizens Participation portion of the meeting . So I'd like to ask now if someone would please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Patricia Nestor, Joseph Healey, Bev deBarros and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question , on the question , I'd like to ask Mrs. Reed now if she would please read those comments from the public into the record. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you, Council man Gaughan . The first submission was from Patricia Nestor as follows : Q: How bad is the housing situation in Scranton ? A: 10:30 on a Saturday night I had a woman I have never seen before knock on my door and ask if I have any apartments available . I don’t and I wasn’t advertising , so I don’t know how she found me. Just letting you know it’s getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 scary out here. Please have the mayor stop telling New Yorkers (and everyone within the sound of her voice) that Scranton has affordable housing . It’s not true. Any financial advisor will tell you that your housing should not be more than 25% of your income. Because of the colleges and universities , rents are sky high and out of proportion when compared to the budgets of working class people, and I mean people who work locally , not remotely from NYC. Again from Patricia Nestor. The second submission is from Mr. Joe Healey as follows : Good Evening Council , I am anxiously writing to you tonight concerning the upcoming November election and the safety of our poll workers and citizens . I tried my best to find the answer to my question , but unfortunately I could not so I am asking council tonight what is the citizens laws concerning "open carrying " of weapons ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 I understand that in general , PA is an open carry state, but it is my understanding that local laws in cities and municipalities can supersede that. I can assure you, my intent for reaching out to you is not to be an alarmist , hyperbolic , or a nuisance . I do however want to implore council to seriously consider enacting laws BANNING the open carrying of any weapons within the city limits if in fact no such laws already exist. Pennsylvania is in the nation's spotlight as one of the most critical swing states in the country that will determine the outcome of this election . If we have learned nothing else in the last 4 years it has been that virtually anything outside the bounds of normal protocol can and regularly does happen. My fear and the fear of many law abiding patriotic citizens is that malevolent forces from both outside and unfortunately inside our area will abuse their 2nd amendment rights in order to intimidate and terrorize poll workers and voters at our polling sites. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 I understand that many have already chosen to cast their ballots via mail, but no citizen who does choose to approach the polls in person on election day should have to fear anything other than the virus itself. I know it could be difficult (and hopefully not impossible ) to pass such a law, but with such a reasonable Council and Mayoral office in power, I know you will do anything you can to keep the citizens you serve safe. I sincerely hope that I am overreacting and that my anxiety is just getting the better of me and that no extra security measures and protections will be necessary . However due to the overwhelming amount of evidence that demonstrates time and time again that these are NOT normal times, I just want to make sure that we've all done our part to be as alert, prepared , and safe as we possibly can be. Thank you for your time and consideration , Mr. Joe Healey The third submission is from Ms. Bev 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 deBarros : Dear Friends ~ this is to agree with and to thank Mr Coyne for his attention to the matter of payment of garbage fees. The billing and accounting for trash fees absolutely needs to be separate from and not included with any other tax (as has been suggested ). For one thing, not every property that is taxed necessarily has weekly garbage collection . Some properties may be only a parcel of land, not occupied . Other properties may be rental units or businesses that employ private trash collectors . The simple way that we have used is the best. A designated trash fee bill with two payment options comes in the mail. Records are clearly kept, and accounting is always transparent . This revenue can be easily tallied and compared to the actual cost of our garbage collection . Hopefully , the DPW keeps separate records for garbage collection and street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 maintenance , etc. Submitted by Bev deBarros The fourth and final submission is from Miss Marie Schumacher : O It was disappointing the technical difficulty kept the scheduled Administration Year-End presentation from happening . It was even more disappointing when the Presentation was not in Third Order of tonight 's Agenda as it had been made clear at the Meeting you would be receiving it during the week. O How will citizens be made aware of #5 of 3b's Scranton Together Neighborhood Initiative ? O Have you ensured the requested adjustment to the telecon accounts been made? O A large orange sign stating "NO TRUCK" has appeared on a utility pole at Prospect and River Streets . Is it for only the 600 block of River or all of River and how are these obtained . O 5C implies Jessica Eskra is no longer working for the City. What is her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 status? O Are uniformed employees included in 5D? O Have any changes been made in LIPS as a result of the in-house review? O Before departing did Chief Graziano establish a prearrest drug treatment program and, if so, how much is budgeted for 2020 for this program . O "... I do think that the intent is commendable . I understand the idea behind it. I just am worried that, as I mentioned a few weeks ago, this will end up being a money pit and something that we won't b able to sustain into the future." This is a quote Mr. Gaughan made almost four years ago and I believe it is still valid in 2020 when the Emergency Services Center was being discussed . On the 1st and 2nd of October the City solicited bidders for the "Simulator Area Improvements of the Public Safety Building ." I believe this is the former Serrent Building . I have read the Mayor's grandiose description of plans for this facility which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 extend utiliization beyond the City. I fear what Mr. Gaughan saw in his crystal ball in 2017 is coming to fruition and I believe we can't afford this and a separate Meeting providing the planned expenditures for the next five year at the Serrenti Center should be conducted as soon as possible from Marie Schumacher . And that concludes the submissions . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? Anyone else on the question ? I have a few things I just want to go through . First of all, I'd like to thank Patricia Nestor, Joseph Healey, Bev deBarros and Marie Schumacher for submitting their comments . There was a few questions in here. Mr. Healey posed a question whether or not the Council and the City can consider enacting laws banning the open carrying of weapons within the City. Solicitor Hayes, I would defer to you on that. I don't think we can. I think that comes down to an issue of preemption if I'm not mistaken . But, Solicitor Hayes, if you know the answer to that off the top of your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 head or if you just want to take a look at that. ATTY. HAYES: I think you're correct , Councilman . That would be an overstep on our part. But I will research it and confirm. I think it's we're limited in what we can do on the regulation of firearms in a municipality . But I will certainly confirm that to be the case and report back to you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And Bev deBarros has comments here as well as Patricia Nestor so we appreciate those. Miss Schumacher posed several questions . I'll just run through the ones that I think I could answer tonight . The presentation -- in her first comment here she asked why the presentation from Mr. Deeley wasn't in Third Order on tonight 's agenda. Unfortunately , we just receive d that before the meeting . I didn't even get a chance to look at it. But we will put that -- Mrs. Reed, if we can put that next week in Third Order so that the public can review that I would appreciate it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 How will citizens be made aware of number five of 3-B Scranton Together Neighborhood initiative ? I know that the Mayor has town hall style -- not town hall but she has updates I think every week. So -- and I think she covers that sometimes . We can certainly ask for an update on that as well to make sure the public is informed . Have you ensured the requested adjustment to the Telecom accounts have been made? I think Miss Schumacher is referring to 3-D there. I don't know that to be the case for sure. But we can double-check. And I think she's referring to the tax issue on several of the Telecom accounts . So we'll send a note to the Business Administrator . 5-C, Jessica no longer working for the City; it's my understanding that Attorney Eskra is going to continue working for the City. She is just going to be the First Assistant City Solicitor , am I correct with that, Solicitor Hayes? ATTY. HAYES: That's my understanding . But she'll -- when Attorney Eskra returns , she will be coming back in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 position of First Assistant City Solicitor . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And the other question that Miss Schumacher had, are uniformed employees included in 5-D? And 5-D was the resolution authorizing the City to enter into a contract with Willis Towers Watson for the consultant benefit broker services for the City. It's my understanding that that would cover all uniformed employees , all employee s that work for the City. Have any changes been made in LIPS as a result of the inhouse review? I think we heard tonight from Miss Cipriani . I think she answered that question . Miss Schumacher also posed a final question here about Chief Graziano establishing a prearrest drug treatment program . And how much is budgeted for 2020 for this program ? I can't remember off the top of my head. I do remember Council voting on this program -- this prearrest drug program treatment program . I was in favor of it at the time. I thought it was really -- we were kind of being ahead of the curve in doing what other cities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 across the country had done in terms of a prearrest drug treatment program . But I'm glad that Miss Schumacher brought it up because , Mrs. Reed, if you could just ask for an update on that. I'd like to see what the success of that -- hopefully the success of that program has been. And then we'll check the 2020 budget. I can't remember off the top of my head if there was a line item in there for that. I think that was all of the questions . Any other ones that I didn't get to I'll certainly pose to the administration . And then in Fifth Order I will go through some of the questions that Mr. Coyne had posed on the IT Department and the license plate reader legislation . Those have come through from the administration so we'll touch on that. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : My only comment tonight would be to congratulate Mary Pat Ward. She's being honored by the Women in Philanthropy . Other than that, that's tall. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Dr. Rothchild any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . And, Council man Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have anything at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few things. First, I want to again thank the Mayor, the Business Administrator and the Director of OECD, Eileen Cipriani for coming in tonight and presenting in caucus. I thought a lot of the information 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 was very helpful . One of the things that came up was in terms of whether or not we'll have a deficit at the end of the year, I'm hopeful in the information that we were provided by the Mayor and the Business Administrator that at this point it does not look like we'll have a deficit at the end of the year. If you remember back to I think June or July when the Business Administrator at that time came in, Pat Sheridan and the Mayor to update us on the financial impact of COVID-19, at that point it looked like we may have a really dire situation on our hands. Now, it is October 6th. Obviously , a lot can change from now until the end of the year. But at this point based on what they had just present ed to us, it looks like we won't be in as rough of shape as we had originally thought . I think a large part of that from what I can glean from the presentation was due to the fact that we really -- the City has really not spent a lot of money in terms of capital project s and other items that they expressed in their presentation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 I think one of the things that we had asked for that is important is a breakdown of what those major project s that have not been funded. I could think of one or two off the top of my head that although we may not fund it this year, at some point we're going to need to invest in that. Like, one of the examples would be the pool liner at Nay Aug. I think it was $250,000 in the budget for that. So I would be curious to see a breakdown because if we don't spend that this year, you know, I would be concerned that we wouldn't be able to open the pool at Nay Aug pool next year. And then what would we do next year with that. So there's those type of things that I think are still outstanding . I was pleased also to hear the information about the healthcare costs. We'll talk more about that in 5-D. And I do have some additional questions . But over the past few years, obviously anyone who has taken a look at the budget can tell that healthcare costs are a huge part of our overall budget. And they have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 continue d to increase year over year. So we have to find a way to give our employees the best quality healthcare while at the same time keeping the taxpayers in mind and making sure that we can be efficient and we can control those costs. So again, I was glad to hear that. Some of the questions we've been getting coming in from the administration , there are still some outstanding . One of the ones that keeps coming up in my conversations with neighbors over in West Side is the Novembrino Park Project . What I had asked for and what I'm hopeful to receive is an update in terms of change orders, in terms of what the total cost of that project is towards what was actually budgeted . And then I had additional questions about the internship program , the status of search for a Fire Chief and a Police Chief. I know we have the acting Police Chief and Fire Chief. But I wanted to know where they were with that. So these are all things that I'm hopeful within the next week or two we'll receive information about. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 The last thing I wanted to say was, obviously we're still in the midst of this pandemic . I had an opportunity to this past week just to talk to a few people who are Scranton residents who, you know, many people may not realize because sometime s we are living in a bubble now that there are people in our City and across Pennsylvania and across the country who are really, really suffering from this pandemic , whether it's due to unemployment , due to having trouble putting food on the table. Our elderly population , I talked to an elderly neighbor of mine a couple of days ago. This is really, really difficult . And I continue to be concerned when I see the numbers that keep coming out of Lackawanna County, out of Pennsylvania and across the country and even the amount of people who have passed away. It's just -- it is unimaginable that we're sitting here in October and this is occurring . So I just wanted to reiterate what I said over the past few months that if you are -- a lot of elderly people watch these Council meetings. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 If you are in need of help, there are people out there who will help you who are willing to help you. So don't feel you are alone during this pandemic . One of the things that the City has put out there is to dial 211 if you need any sort of resources , rent assistance , help with food. There's so many resources throughout our City that are out there to help you. And also any City issues or any help that you need, you could e-mail Scranton 311 at Scranton pa.gov. So I just want to make sure that I said that again because I have spoken to people, like I said, over the last week that are really, really affected by this. And I may not see it. You guys may not see it. Some of us, like I said, are in a bubble. But this has taken an unimaginable toll on some of our -- some of our people in the City. So we want to keep that in mind. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH WILLIS TOWERS WATSON FOR CONSULTANT /BENEFITS BROKER SERVICES FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR A PERIOD OF TWO (2) YEARS. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced the into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm happy to see that this was put out to bid. And I think the number we were given was $700,000 a year in savings. And I hope that pans out. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Yes, on the question , I did have two or three questions here. And I, you know, posed it in Fifth Order because I think the administration would have to go back and compile this information . One of them was I would like a list of the fees that were charged by all 11 bidders . Next week on the agenda you'll see in Third Order I requested documentation that was provided to us by Mr. Deeley. If you notice in the memo to Solicitor O'Brien he mentioned that they did a breakdown of I think the final four companies or firms here which they did provide us, which I do appreciate . So we're going to put this memo to Mr. O'Brien from Mr. Deeley in Third Order. I think that will be helpful for people. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 what I would just like to see is a breakdown , a list of the fees charged by all of the 11 bidders. That will be very helpful . Also, I think moving forward what I'd like to request is a copy of the monthly reports that are issued on the financial perform ance analysis. One of the issues we had in the past -- and former Council woman Dempsey was really on this -- was getting a breakdown of the healthcare costs and of the healthcare savings because they did get -- they were getting out of control . With the previous administration , we were never able to really get any information . So I think it would be important for Council to really stay on top of this. So I would like a monthly report of the financial overview of the plan performance , an actual versus budget comparison and the employee contribution amounts. This is something that they're going to provide to the administration anyways. But I think Council should receive that. Also, one of the other questions I had was -- now this was an RFQ. But one of the things I noticed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 was that it didn't include a disclosure by current contractors . Usually in the RFPs that I've seen over the last few months, one of the items that was in there was a disclosure by current contractor s and that would show any political contribution s that were given to any elected officials within the City. And I have been on the record in the past saying that I really thought that was a good practice for any contract that we enter into just because of the things that we've seen happen here in the past with the previous administration . I think it's very good to be transparent about of that. This could have been just an oversight . I'm assuming that it was. But I would like to find out why that was not in there. And that's all I have. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS.

I just have one more thing -- and I really want to apologize . I failed to bring this up during the regular meeting or caucus rather, because we didn't have any time. But Mr. Finley, Thomas Finley who had submitted his letter of interest and resume for the Ethics Board has withdrawn his letter of interest . So he is no longer going to be up for consideration . I would like at this time to make a motion to have Solicitor Hayes draft legislation appointing Dr. Matthew Myer to the City's Ethics Board to fulfill the term expiring August 31st, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : I'll make that motion. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , so there are two openings here. One of them I'd like to just move forward because we all had time now to review the three letters of interest and resume. Mr. Myer is a University of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 philosophy profess or. He has experience with ethics. I think he taught ethics at one point at the university . His resume speaks for itself. I think he would be an outstand ing addition to the board. I'm really glad he showed interest in it. He is a City of Scranton resident . And I think, like I said, would be a great addition . And then what we'll do is we'll -- well, let's do this and then we'll talk about what we're going to do with the other appointment . Anyone else on the question for Dr. Myer? All those in favor of the motion to appoint -- to ask Solicitor Hayes to draft legislation appoint ing Dr. Myer, signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and, Solicitor Hayes, if you could draft that and then get it to Mrs. Reed I would appreciate it. And now, Solicitor Hayes, I'll turn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 it over to you. There was a question -- and I think Councilman Schuster had asked about it. Mr. Stanilka , the other person who was submitting their name and there was a question about whether or not he would be able to be seated on the board because of his involvement as a member of the City Democratic party. ATTY. HAYES: That's right. So in response to your inquiry , Councilman Schuster , it seems that the applicant currently serves as a committee man or as a -- he serves in a leadership position in the Lackawanna County Democratic party. Pursuant to Section 3 C2 of the Ethics Code, it is my opinion that he would not be eligible to serve on the Ethics Board while he serves in the capacity as an officer for the Democratic party of Lackawanna County. In any event that he no longer serves in a leadership position or any political party or any other political organization , then he probably -- may be eligible to serve on the Ethics Board. But right now he would not be able to serve on the Ethics Board. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you for finding that out. And then as part of the other pieces of the vetting process , he came through with everything else other than that piece? ATTY. HAYES: You know, I'm not aware of -- that may be a question for the Clerk as to whether or not there was any other issues. But I was only asked to review the issue of his involvement as an officer -- or officer holder of the Lackawanna County Democratic party. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. Thank you. I understand . And thank you for looking into that. Miss Reed, do we know if the other pieces of the vetting process he was all right on? MS. REED: I'll double-check, Councilman Schuster , and I'll look for the memo from the Treasurer and I'll forward that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MS. REED: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, then we'll have to decide, you know, what we want to do with this. I would prefer at this point based on what Solicitor Hayes said and just putting out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 another advertisement and see if there is any other interest for the one -- I think the term goes until August of 2021. So we need someone else to fill that based on what Solicitor Hayes said tonight with the issue there to no fault of Mr. Stanilka 's obviously . But I think that we should -- I think we should just put it back out and see if anybody else would like to apply. MR. DONAHUE : And I agree with that and I'd welcome Mr. Stanilka to apply again. But in his letter of intent to state that if he were to get the appointment he would resign from any political organizations . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, thank you, Mr. Donahue . I was going to say the same. I'd encourage him to put in for it again. And, I mean, I think he has a decision to make for himself . Maybe that might give him time to make that decision . DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm in agreement with everyone . I would like to open it back up to see if we have more candidates -- MR. DONAHUE : You know what too, would we be able to put some sort of ad, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 know, what would disqualify you from serving on the Ethics Board? ATTY. HAYES: There's quite a -- you know, there's a number of restrictions . So we'd have to -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah -- ATTY. HAYES: -- identify which ones we think are going to be most -- who would affect the most people but -- MR. DONAHUE : Maybe if we put up all of them on our City Council website and then in the ad say, you know, refer to the website for any restrictions or just a suggestion there. ATTY. HAYES: I think that's a good idea. Yeah, I'll work with Lori on that putting in what we think are going to be the big issues for potential applicants . But the only thing with regard to this particular applicant , I would think that he would have to be -- he could not be in those positions at the time of the appointment because , you know, otherwise , you know, I don't think he's eligible to be appointed if he has -- if he has an office within a political party or political organization . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 So I don't think we can just say he could withdraw -- he would agree conditionally to resign from those positions . I think he has to be out of those positions at the time of the appointment . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. So I apologize for failing to bring that up before we adjourn here. Anyone else have anything before we adjourn ? Okay, if there is further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you everyone . This meeting 's adjourned . Have a good night. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
