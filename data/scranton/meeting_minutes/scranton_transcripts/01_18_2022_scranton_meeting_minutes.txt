SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED DATED DECEMBER 31, 2021. 3-B. CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA LIQUOR CONTROL BOARD DATED JANUARY 12, 2022 REGARDING THE CITY’S REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM ITS ENFORCEMENT OF AMPLIFIED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 NOISE. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two. First, I just want to announce that I think they were released a day early. It was supposed to be tomorrow . But as of now, you could go online to get a free COVID test mailed to your home. It's something that President Joe Biden had announced that the government would be doing is providing those home tests for anyone who wants them. But they're not going to automatically send them to you. You do have to sign up, provide them with your address and request them. Every home in the country is eligible for up to four of those at-home tests. And they usually ship between 7 and 12 days. And the website that you could go to order those is at COVIDtest.gov. And then the other announcement that I had, the City announced that the HUD funding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 application s are now open. And they will accept applications up until February 4th. So that's for the CDBG, HOME, and HESG applications . And they will be different this year because there's a new software that OECD is using for those applications called Neighborly , which can be accessed through our City's website. And these will provide -- the funds will provide support for development of viable urban communities through quality housing and expanding economic opportunities for persons of low and moderate income. That's for the CDBG. The HESG funds will be for emergency shelters for the homeless and other program s to prevent homelessness . And this is the time of year certainly where we need emergency shelters . And then at HOME provides funds to expand the supply of safe, decent affordable housing for low income Americans . And for any questions regarding those program s you can contact Liza Caroll at Lcaroll @scrantonpa .gov or Kelly Kraycer at Kkraycer @scrantonpa .gov. That's it. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Does anyone else have any announcement s? MR. KING: Yes, Mr. President , due to the MLK holiday on Monday, garbage pickup -- DPW garbage pickup will be a day late this week. I just want to remind citizens of that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Does anyone else have any announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First one on the sign-in sheet is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident . I want to start by complimenting the City and DPW in particular and the rapid way they cleaned up at least the downtown streets yesterday morning . I live on the corner of Penn and Lackawanna in Samters. And, of course, all night long you could hear the wind blowing downtown . But around 2:00 or so I hear rumble, rumble, rumble and there's plow trucks going up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 and down both Penn Avenue and Lackawanna . I went to mass that morning and then Abe's for breakfast , came out of Abe's and pretty much the downtown streets were in pretty good shape all things consider ed. Of course, the sidewalks were awful. But that's not DPW's job. So I think, you know, they should be congratulated . Everyone else had the day off and they were there 2:00 in the morning rumbling down the street. Do we have an update on the 2020 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We have still not received it. I'm hoping by the end of this week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. And the collect ive bargaining agreement s for the police and firefighters which expired at the end of last year, are they still in negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. They are kind of on track, no -- MR. DONAHUE : I believe so, yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And that's about all I have for tonight . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next person on the sign-in sheet is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : That caught me by surprise , Joan. That was a short presentation . Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I want to say welcome to Attorney Gallagher -- Solicitor Gallagher and to Bill King. And we're off to a good start for 2022. I wanted to start off by saying that what a responsibility I have and anyone has as we stand here and give our thoughts and concerns about issues with the City. They all talked about the power of the pen, but it's the power of the microphone as well. So there is certain things that I wasn't here for this meeting but was certain things that were said that I thought that's not right. That's not right. And I thought , okay, if it's not right, then you've got to get up there and say what is right because when people are talking and they're giving their -- they're entitle d to their concerns and their voice. So the speaker had said that why does Scranton call Nay Aug Park the gem of the city? Well, now my cackles and my hair went up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 when they said it's not a gem of the city. So I thought , yes, it is. So it's no good with me talking to the TV. So I made a list of what goes on up at Nay Aug Park. We start in October . We start out by saying calling for volunteers to help us to get ready for the light show. We ask volunteers to come. They don't get paid. It's just all volunteer . Then in November we do the light show. We run the light show from November to January . And then in December we're calling for volunteers , calling for volunteers . And volunteers come up in the cold of the night and volunteer to help us make this light show a gem of the city. Then in January and February we're busy thinking what are we going to do for the rest of the year. In February we have a food drive which was very successful . I think we had four food pantries that were helped and stocked with the food that was collected at Nay Aug Park. Then in March and April we start thinking about the summer. What are we going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 to do for the summer to get it ready? Then we had a baby drive on Mother's Day so that the mothers could have, you know, that needed things from St. Joseph's Center. And we had a baby drive. Then we went into thinking about the summer concerts . We have Wednesday concerts . We have two concerts on Sunday afternoon . That takes a lot of work to get those bands up there. Who's going to be there? Who's going to -- what time are they going to be at? Then in May through October -- yeah, from May through October that's when the bands play. During the summer we had a kid's outing. We had all the kids -- we put out the word for the kids to come to the park and we had a day in the park of art. We gave each family a bucket of chalk that they could make art throughout the create portion of the park. There is little things that we gave them too as well. Then we had arts and craft shows where the park was open for all people to see the park. And then we move onto all the other activities that go on in the park. There's the greenhouse . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 greenhouse is there. I go over there for the senior activities and they have yoga and there's Mother's Day is great. There's flowers and everything over there. You go down the trail a little bit further , there's to save cats and dogs where you could take your animals to get them neutered . And all that you could find on a website . And then the trails, you know, there's all kinds of walking trails. I do the very easy ones. If you are really into a robust walk, you know, there's the Davis trail is right there that goes down past the falls and everything . And then to rest yourself, you could go to the coffee house and have and rest with a cup of coffee or any kinds of things or treats that you want. So I got 30 seconds to say thank you to everybody that comes and makes our gem of the city a gem, to the rec department employees , to DPW, to our volunteers , I can't say enough -- a big enough thank you for all the volunteers that come to help us make the City -- Nay Aug Park the gem that it is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 And it's all volunteer and the donation s that come into the park. And that's what I had to say. The other thing -- I know I'm out of time. But I sent you all an e-mail on the other thing that I thought someone said up here that was not true. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And, Mrs. Jeffries, thank you for volunteering up the park too. We would be remiss if we didn't thank you for the time you put in there. I know you're a loyal volunteer up there. MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Greetings Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . I was going to bring up being able to request early the COVID-19 testing kits from the government . And unfortunately , I tried to request mine and it seems my address was already used. There is only me at the address so it's kind of hard for that to be. I think it's a matter of unfortunately this rollout which is still in it's beta phase is being done by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 US Post Office. Unfortunately , my mother in Philadelphia who travels to Florida two years ago used my address as a temporary mail drop. This is long since changed and she actually used her Philadelphia address where she lives as a resident as her shipping for the COVID supply test. So I have no idea why an address in Scranton was set out as already receiving it when obviously there is me there and that's it and no one else at the residence . So there is some difficulty with that site as well as the fact that when you go on that site and you run into an error, it goes to a help section that tells you to just reenter any information and try it again. And then if you need further help it loops you back to the first page where you go to enter the information again. It seems a circle. And I understand that the federal government is going to be putting out a phone number for it. But right now there is some complication s with that site. And I expect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 some of them will be taken and fixed in the near future. But it is not a perfect rollout. Next I wanted to talk about the request for an exemption of the residency exemption . When the person was hired and hired from out of the City, they were informed as part of that hiring process they had to move into the City within six months. When they don't and an exemption is given, it is a reward for noncompliance . We talk about, well, maybe they'll just pay taxes instead of the taxes they would have to pay in the City rather than having to move into the City. I could tell you if I live in the City I'm going to buy gasoline in the City. I'm going to buy groceries in the City. I'm going to shop nearby. If I live in Clarks Summit or I live in Wilkes-Barre and work in the City, I'm not going to buy groceries here. I'm not going to buy food. I'm not going to supply the merchant s here. All of my money is going to go to Wilkes-Barre except for the tax fee. So it's not just the taxes that come in from having the employee work in the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Scranton . It's the taxes plus all the revenue to those businesses who have been severely impacted by COVID. They are getting a cut of the taxpayer 's dollars here to perform a function . Part of the function is living in the community which supplies the community with financial support by them being here. I also look at that and I go if you give an exemption to them at this point, what about the Fire Department ? What about the Police Department ? If a policeman says he's going to move here in six months and then decides not to, are you setting up a precedent where he can then request and he should get because if a political person can get it, why shouldn 't the union fireman or policeman or anyone else? There's a problem when you go and you make modifications and exceptions to the law when someone signed onto the agreement who said I will do this within this period of time. I understand COVID. I understand limited housing . I also understand a number of people that purchased an apartment or a unit down here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 just to move into so they could be in compliance while they dealt with their move. It's not an impossible function to do. I think it was done as a tactful thing to get the employee in. And I cannot say it was maliciously made, but at this point they should be held accountable for the promise they made when they took the job. I do not care how it is and how good of an employee it is. It's not the fact of the job they do. It's the responsibilities to the taxpayers and the law that they agreed to when they took the position . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . First, I'd like to thank, Mr. Donahue and Council , for addressing a problem I had in my neighborhood . And I just wonder if anybody out there is better off today than they were a year ago. Everybody I talk to is complaining about everything . I was going to put these on but I get it -- they get all fogged up, you know. For some reason nobody ever wants to borrow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 these. I saw on Fox News that the children don't want to wear masks because their glasses fog. That's a problem . I don't know how what they -- what they could do. In Saturday 's paper, a gentleman I think his name is Mark Carton{sic} wrote one of the few intelligent letters I've ever seen in the last four years to the editor. He states that the law is you have to read, speak, and write English in order to vote to become a citizen . Now, our Mayor's wasting a half million dollars for interpreters . Interpreters . You're never going to get people to assimilate when you make it easy for them to stay like they are. This is an asinine liberal thing to do. I'm not anti-immigrant . All four of my grandparents came, I don't know, like a hundred years ago came to this country . And as I was growing up, everybody spoke, read, could write English . My grandfather came when he was 16. And when I was real small I used to -- he used to read me the funny papers. He was a young man. His wife came from Poland. And she had a -- she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 used to write letters to her sister in Baltimore and I used to mail them. She wrote perfect English . And my other two grandparents came from Germany . They had no accents . They lived in Chicago . They just sounded like everybody else because they wanted to be Americans . The opposite of what's happening in this country now. Every time I go to -- I go to -- peanuts , they buy peanuts every week over Price Rite. It's just people that can't speak English got all kinds of food stamps. They got nicer cars than I do. I see on the Fox News all the Afghanistans are staying in four star hotels. They have interpreters . They are suppose d to be interpreters and they have to have interpreters . They are eating in fancy restaurants . This country is getting everything backwards. You know, if it was up to me, I'm not anti-immigrant . I'm anti-illegal immigrants. If it was possible , I'd take every last one of them and round them up and ship 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 them back where they came from. It's just heartbreaking to see what's happened to this country in the past year. It's a disgrace . You know, it's not the America I grew up in. And I talk to my six or eight friends on the computer and on the telephone every week. Two of them are staunch Democrats and they still -- they started leaning this way that the country is not going in the right direction . One of them worked for the government all of his life. He's Lewis Murray. And that's the only thing he's ever done is be in our government . I had to take my Trump sticker off my car four years ago when we met to play golf so I wouldn't offend him. Now he's thinking my way. Thank you for giving me a few minutes up here. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: And thank you for last week when you informed me. MR. DONAHUE : No problem . Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I'm going to start where I ran out of time last week because I did want to acknowledge the Recreation Authority and all of the volunteers that put I don't know how many hours. They should have kept track of them because with all the lights that were there, I was amazed. I didn't get there until I think the second from the last night. But it was sort of nice because we were able to go around twice. But it was very beautiful . And they do deserve something , maybe. Maybe -- I don't know. Maybe you could do something for them. I don't know. And also for DPW for the job they've been doing for snow removal and salting . But then there's something else. I thought , you know, for the last -- well, as long as -- since I came back to Scranton , there's only been one goal for this City and that was to get out of Act 47. And now that we're getting out of Act 47, I think we need a new goal, maybe annual goals. But we need something that is measurable at the end of the year other than just, you know, we have enough revenue to cover the expenses and, you know, pin a ribbon on us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 We need something more. And I'm very worried about the rescue dollars . You've already taken 5.5 away for balancing the budget. And as I recall, almost every item in the capital budget had -- that was going to be the source of the funding . So I'm just worried it's going to get trickled away. And I think you should first request of the Mayor some kind of agreement on when you're going to decide when -- where the money is going to be spent. And I think you should also have a public hearing on that. Once you make an estimate , I think people should be allowed to come and comment on how that's going to be done. And also, I mean, my own item would be infrastructure and stormwater . I don't know how stormwater can get kicked -- that can can get kicked down any further than it's been. It's just pitiful . And do we have any encouragement on when something is going to happen? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. So there's still ongoing meeting s with multiple municipalities in discussion about --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MS. SCHUMACHER : SAPA and -- MR. DONAHUE : No, not only SAPA, but in discussions about creating a regional stormwater authority . And I think that that ARPA money will be helpful not only to the City but also surrounding municipalities in terms of startup money to get to that going. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And when do you think that will be known to the public? MR. DONAHUE : I mean, so we're just in the initial stages of discussion s on, you know, what it would like, what the responsibilities would be. But once all that gets worked out, I'm hoping it gets worked out in the next couple months. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well -- MR. DONAHUE : And then we could get into the meat of, you know, what rate structures would like and so on. MS. SCHUMACHER : I would like to request you put your minds around a strategic plan for this year and maybe even three years. It would change, obviously , for the out years. But I do think we need metrics . I think we could use some metrics at the department s where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 there are measurable -- measurable kinds of work. Some of them aren't, of course, but it would be nice. MR. DONAHUE : And I'm hoping to transition into OpenGov . The new operating system will give us more opportunity for more metrics in terms of being able to see what each department 's doing. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, yes, and, you know, it wouldn't hurt. Each of you has a certain part of the City. It would be -- maybe take turns of what's happening and where the bumps are and where the road is smooth ahead. I think that would be very helpful and people would care more about the City. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay, last week I spoke about the redistrict ing. And you may have one more day to get in touch with the Pennsylvania Election Board and oppose some of the slicing up of the Scranton pie and voice your concern s about it. I plan to do so. Last week they basically rammed it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 through on Wednesday . And our Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that that shouldn 't have been done. So we got a little reprieve there. The Governor came out with his plan today which sounds a lot fairer. But I don't know how it affects the state legislative assembly . So why we should be split up four ways is beyond me. It's totally ridiculous . And it does concern Scranton . It's really a shame. And then furthermore , we have Dan Meuser possibly representing Scranton . He voted against certifying the presidential election . I mean, I don't want his representation at all. And that's all there is to it. You know, he won't be my representative . And I know he probably doesn't care about what I think. On COVID, we're up to 850,000. It's time people wake up because we have a plague of the unvaccinated or whatever . And it's really a shame. It's really a shame that people just won't get a vaccination . I've had mild reactions to it. But I'll take two more they're small just like when I used to drink 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 bourbon . Just like when I used to drink bourbon , I'll take two more they're small. And I mentioned on Colfax now, I guess there is one more hangup. I think it's the 300 block or the 400 block. She wants a house similar to what (inaudible ) house. But that's all money going off the tax rolls. And we really need to start having that replaced some day. So I don't know if you people will get the destain of -- until the representatives and people involved with Pennsylvania government , but it's really high time. We can't go 37, 38, 40 percent more taxes -- tax exempt properties . It's just too much. It's way too much. And it services the county and it services beyond the county because of the type of specialist I don't think you would have them up in Pike County, you know, if you need a cardiologist or something like that. You might get a meeting in an office, but you're not going to get a surgery or an interventive surgeon . You're just not going to see it. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 those people have to be housed here. And it's the same with Susquehanna County and probably Wyoming County. And they have hospitals but they are not mega hospital s that could have a big variety of people. And I support expanding medical coverage because I don't want to live in the country no more. I lived there for years. I spent all kinds of time sitting on my ditty box in the car to get home. And if something happened to me, I'd probably just die in the ambulance on the way. So we really need to look at somehow we can get these taxes. And one of the things I mentioned before was TV recycling . I mean, it's illegal to put it on your lawn. And it's illegal to throw it in your garbage . And they're just hanging around. One more quick thing, I noticed since this mail order business , box after box after cardboard box sitting out for the trash with Amazon at least and, I mean, it's big. So we really need to start -- just tell the DPW to leave them behind. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 on that TV recycling , I believe the City is going to be schedul ing a recycling event for sometime in the spring. Once we get more details we'll let you know. MR. DOBRZYN : I'd be perfectly willing to pay to get rid of them. But I keep tripping over them. Thank you PPL and for blowing them up. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any comments or motions ? MR. KING: Yes. So I would just like to mention that 5-F, the appointment of Daniel King, that's my nephew. I will be abstaining from that. I do understand that is really just a nonpaying position just in case the tax collector were to become incapacitated . But I still think it's appropriate for me to abstain from that vote this evening . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : The only comment I would like to make is just to thank DPW for the work during the snowstorm. Other than that, I'll mention it on the question if I have any comment . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just had two things that I wanted to request Mr. Voldenberg to check up on their complaint s that I previously brought to OECD and to LIPS. There were two properties that I had been asking about last year in 2021. One is on the 600 block of Prescott Avenue. I think last we heard we were going to see if that was going to go into the demolition list or not. And I wanted to ask about what's being done with that property now if it is on the demo list. And then the other property was at Vine and Prescott which was the Vine Street Station where the abandon ed vehicle was removed but there's still is plenty of blight there at that property still. And that's everything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have two. Thank you. So a few concerned residents brought to me issues with Ryerson Avenue. Back in 2000 -- they also sent me an article back in 2018 there was an article about the wall on Ryerson Avenue. You know, it's leaning over the retaining wall holding up Ryerson Avenue in Scranton . So along with that article I guess nothing 's been done. Parking is atrocious . Plows can't get by. It's very unsafe. So it's a safety issue. That's why I'm really hitting this one -- hitting this one home. They're concerned with our DPW trucks, is it safe for them to come through . They're not sure if they even do or they backup. They're afraid of the wall collapsing . And what I would like -- and I don't know this is part of the overall Meadow Brook project so what I would like, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would please send correspondence -- send -- I don't know, send it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 to everybody ; send it to the LIPS Department ; send it to DPW, send it to the Police Department because it's a safety issue asking if we can get some type of assessment and are there any corrective action plans in place for this narrow street, the unsafe collapsing wall. And is it part of the plan for Meadow Brook? And secondly , Mr. Coyne last week he spoke to us about retention -- of e-mail retention . So I asked Mr. Voldenberg to please inquire about if we're in compliance and if we're not why and any information regarding that. What do we have in place? The only response I got. I didn't get any response s to are we in compliance or why we aren't in compliance . What I got was, at this time we have no specific -- this is from Mr. Deeley -- no specification retention policies beyond the City's ordinance for document retention . And like, you know, we hear that it's moving forward . So in closing , he put -- it's on our to do list for 2022. So, Mr. Coyne, that's all I got for you at this point. And that is all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just on that point, it is important to point out that we do retain everything that's applicable under law in terms of ordinance s. It's the e-mails where we don't -- e-mail retention where we don't have a policy. But any ordinances , minutes , anything of that nature is retained according to either state law or City ordinance . In terms of Miss Schumacher 's comment regarding ARP, so the final rules were just released last week in terms of how ARP money can be spent. I think the final rules come out to about 400 pages. So our consultan t that was hired for ARP funding is going through those and then determining , you know, what that money could be spent on. And just moving forward I would like to have a public hearing . I mean, that stuff's going to have to be brought in front of Council . In terms of the 5.1 that was put into our budget this year, you're right. That did cover for the most part our capital improvements in 2022 budget. Then plus a little more, but there was a formula that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 federal government came out with to determine that for every year. So our lost revenue for this year was a little over -- that we would have available to spend is a little over 11 million because that account s for lost revenue in 2020, 2021, and 2022. So that's three years combined where then the other eight million would be '23, '24 and I believe '25 separated out. You know, so that was taken initially out of the 34 and a half that we got in our first batch and we are anticipating another 34 and a half. And we do still have to see what type of funds we're going to get from the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was also passed because that will be additional money we should receive there as well. And also, Miss Schumacher , I believe you brought up -- I don't think it was last week but last year about the Chamber of Commerce with the LERTA. So their digital billboard s and conventional billboards were updated in May, 2021. I think you were referring to the digital advertisement that goes around the Chamber building . We were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 informed today that that has been corrected as of this morning . We also have received some complaints regarding 1068 Cottage Avenue and then I know that code enforcement went out last week and actually on January 13th, that property was condemned . So at least they're moving through that portion of the process there. And I believe that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 4, 2022 – AMENDING RES. NO. 36, 2020 “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR EILEEN CIPRIANI IN HER CAPACITY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON UNDER CERTAIN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 CONDITIONS ” TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD FOR THE WAIVER OF THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT . MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so last week I'd like to reiterate the reason why I'm voting no for the extension of this waiver. I also said it's nothing personal with Mrs. Cipriani . But I believe it's personal with hundreds of other employee s that have to live in the City to work in the City. With a population of 70,000 people I truly believe that we could find someone with the skill set and capability to do the job for this position . I believe in growing our own so to speak. So again, I'll be voting no for this. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , last year when this waiver came up there was some -- I'm usually against the waivers but when it came up last year I made a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 recommendation or request that Mrs. Cipriani pay the city taxes, also keep the length of term as to that of the Mayor. The administration did comply with my stipulation s for this. And it is enumerated in this resolution . So as long as that continues I would be in favor of this. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I also think it's important to point out that Miss Cipriani 's wages aren't necessarily paid by City taxpayers . They come in and they're paid through federal funds. So I think that's an important distinction there. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild .
