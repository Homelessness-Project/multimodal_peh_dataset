CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 19, 2024, FROM CITY HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD, PROVIDING LETTER WITH TRIBUTE REMEMBERING RICHARD J. LEONORI , LONGTIME HARB BOARD CHAIRMAN .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 3.B. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 25, 2024, FOR SEPTEMBER 2024. 3.C. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 25, 2024, FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REGARDING BUDGET TRANSFERS . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one comment . The one comment was taking a look at the Parks and Rec overtime that was 122 percent , just pointing that out that it's over budget and it's just the start of October . That's all. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We can't hear you. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : The -- when looking at the overtime report, Parks and Rec was 122 percent . So it will be 22 percent over budget before the month of October . MR. SMURL: And that was, well, naturally because of all the cold nights and stuff. We have to have Parks person down there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 and they didn't -- they had a ton of nights last year. So they'll probably adjust that in this year's budget, I hope. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : No, he just commented on Third Order stuff. You didn't ask for any announcements yet. MR. SMURL: Oh, no, I didn't. He went backwards , okay. MR. MCANDREW : Oh, I'm sorry. MR. SMURL: That's all right. MR. MCANDREW : So I have some announcements . The first one I have is Cooper's is once again selling a quart of crab bisque for $10. This benefits Family to Family and Friends of the Poor, you know, they do great work with the food pantry, so please support them. You can -- the pickup date for the actual bisque is October 24th. But you could reach out and get tickets at the Cooper's itself or on the Facebook page. And secondly , I just want to say I attended the neighborhood fall -- West Scranton Fall Festival , you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 that's part of the West Side Pride initiative at Clover Field on Saturday . It was a great -- it was a great event. The police were there with one of their police cars was pretty cool and also the fire department . And there was many volunteers and activities for the kids. So I thought it was a great job and I would like to congratulate Todd Pousley and his team. They do a great job every year. Also, West Scranton High School Haunted Hallway will this year will be October 12th and 13th, $10 entry. And they say that guarantees a frightening good time. So please support them, if you can. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, so a week from this Sunday is going to be the 27th Steamtown Marathon . We have runners with over -- I think we have 1,025 registered . They're coming from 36 states and 9 countries , pretty excited about the race again this year. It starts at Forest City High School 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 on Sunday, October 13th. And the finish line is right here in front of the courthouse square. It runs through 14 communities . And I just want to remind people that that Sunday morning , October 13th, the first runner typically arrives in Scranton around 10 after 10. So traffic will be a little bit tight between 10 after 10 and probably 1:00 that day. What we do though, the runners are pretty much running straight into the city. So we have traffic control that helps to feed cars across the course if just people could be a little patient . When there's gaps we'll feed the traffic across or if people need to get around to West Side, all you have to do is -- if you're coming into town, you could get on Lackawanna Avenue to get around. And the other places will be the major intersection s. If you are just a little patient , we'll feed people across the course. But we are proud to sponsor this. We have completely volunteer . We have no paid staff. And we've raised 2.4 million dollars for St. Joseph's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Center for this event. So I want to thank my race committee and all the -- there's thousands of volunteer s that work this event from Forest City to Scranton . So we're looking forward to that Sunday, October 13th. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Last week Al Lucas, President of the Firefighters ' Union told me that their union contract was signed. But it's still not on the website . Is there any delay? MR. SMURL: I don't -- they still did not give me a date of when it will be on. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, you don't sign a document unless you have a document to sign. And I presume it was typed on a computer , so that means it's electronic . Okay. Any updates on the status of the annual audit? MR. SMURL: Our audit is, Joan, it is -- all is ready except for the Scranton Parking Authority . And they said theirs will be ready this month. It said October they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 should have it to us. It will take about a week after we receive theirs. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And the Dix Court investigation of the records that were dumped. MR. SMURL: Still nothing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Only six months but that's all right. Item 7-B, Scott Gassenmeyer 's appointment as Director of DPW which was effective September 18th. So that's when his salary jumped up to $76,500. And he's making more than the Mayor. She only makes 75,000. However , is Parks and Rec subordinate to DPW? MR. SMURL: They are independent of each other. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is he also running Parks and Rec? MR. SMURL: No, he had -- we had someone added to it last year to fill a lower position below him. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, then why did he send an e-mail to James Greenfield? Can you move $45,000 from the Parks' capital into the other salary? You know, is that -- I assume 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 that's probably the overtime . But what business has he got on the day after he's left Parks and Rec to be moving Parks and Rec money around? MR. SMURL: I don't know. I could only assume it was the new -- two new positions because they're being directed from Parks and Rec. I don't know if they get paid from there. I'm not sure, Joan, which way they've done that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, that was a very interesting thing. And I did see the overtime , 122 percent . That was quite a bit. Item 5-B, loaning a DPW refuse truck to the school district . According to the backup, it says that there will be no impact on the city. But capital budget for next year under garbage trucks, it says the city plans on purchasing two new garbage trucks in 2025 and one new truck in 2026. The new trucks will be replace aging fleet vehicles , estimated cost for each new vehicle -- each new garbage truck is $310,000. So we don't need the garbage truck because we're getting new garbage trucks or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 should we have kept the garbage truck and have one less cost on our capital budget. I don't know. It's just looking strange to me to see in the legislation that it's, you know, it's not going to affect the city at all, no impact, yet you have a capital budget requiring more garbage trucks. Those things are not cheap. And they do take a lot of wear and tear on a daily basis when they're used. So we shall see. Winter's coming up. You never know when they'll have to be out there in the bad weather . So I just don't understand it. And at any rate, so it will be interesting to see your comments when you vote on Mr. Gassenmeyer , not that you need vote because he's already the DPW Director . So your opinion and your vote is pretty much meaningless . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . You know, we went through a lot of stuff last week with Gaughan and the insults that he put upon the people that we as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 citizens came to talk calling me a felon, this, that and the other and he doesn't have to listen to that. Well, I'd like to see Mr. Gaughan match me in everything I've contributed to this community over my lifetime , employment and everything else that clown so-to-speak and his arrogance thinks he's a dictator in communist China telling the people and insulting each and every one of us -- to match me what I've donated to this community . Show me where he's employed individuals and how to figure out how to make a payroll and how to do all that instead of living off the backs of this community or wherever he taught or whatever he did. One thing he never learned was principles . And that's the sad part because he represented everybody here in government with his comments . I want to read you something from the Child Hunger Outreach, if I may. Dear, Mr. Bolus, your gift will make a huge impact towards creating an entire generation that doesn't know hunger. Thank you so much for your in- kind donation of $150,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 on June 29th, 2023. Your generosity has allowed us to look behind the challenges of food and security and help support our full effort into feeding the community we serve together . We are deeply humbled and privileg ed (inaudible ) of this community . Since the beginning of 2019, Child Hunger Outreach Partners has distributed over 5 million pounds of food locally through food bank distribution and school pantries and pop-up pantries . Our current and future success is providing nourishment to the children is possible through the continued generosity of our friends in the community . In the coming year, Child Hunger Outreach Partners plans to expand our program to reach even more children and their families . We'll keep you updated on the exciting progress . We appreciate your support with deep gratitude , Dani Ruhf, Founder and CEO. That's what I've done to this community . And on top of that, I donated wipes, disinfectant wipes to Weston Field, to Clarks Summit, to a tune of over $250,000 on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 behalf of myself, and my fellow masons. I took a trailer load to Palestine , Ohio. Did Bill Gaughan do it? Did he reach in his pocket and buy -- take a truckload or something out to Palestine , Ohio, $150,000 worth of wipes I donated to Palestine , Ohio, not counting Trump and I, a trailer load of water. Thirty years I've done a Christmas Day dinner that I fully support , fund, and I'm there on Christmas Day for the last 30 years taking care of the people who don't want to be home alone on Christmas . What did Bill Gaughan do on Christmas Day? What did he do a damn thing for this community other than a self-serving attitude and insulting the people of this community . And that's what the outrage is about. I'd like to see him resign. He doesn't belong here. I sued him when he was here when he made his comment s about a skunk and everything else about us. You know, you turn around and just look what we have done in this community . You gentlemen are here. People are here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 We're citizens , each and every one of us. When you walk out that door you are no different than anyone else is, whether you're here -- you're here to see that we govern the people in our community . You're not here. We're not here to insult you. And you are not here to insult us. We're here to have a dialogue whether you believe what we say or you don't. Bill Gaughan has an attitude problem and an anger management problem . And I was disappoint ed in McGloin who I watched as he played football as a quarter back, everything else, had nothing but the greatest respect . I never thought I'd see Matt McGloin led by the nose by somebody like Gaughan to insult the citizenry of this community . We are the community . They are not and it really disappoint ed me. And again, I want to see the Ukraine flag flying, the Israeli flag flying. You had Zelenskyy here. We did all of that nonsense , the Mayor, everybody else. Why aren't we respecting them with the flag again. Since we had him here, let's put the flags up. Let's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 stand up for who we are under that flag there that says we are Americans . We put on uniforms to do one thing, defend our integrity and our country from the adversity that's out there. When we have a dictator in our midst, we need to do something about it. Thank you, gentlemen . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , I don't know if it's hot in here or if it's my blood pressure . I'm awful warm. I wish to convey my disgust of Mayor Paige's unparalleled obsession of creating a Utopia out of our downtown at the expense of the whole rest of the city. It's always grants for unnecessary needless things like this symbolism displays . What is the city going to get out of something like this? We're talking about right now, not 10 or 20 years from now, now. The city needs people to -- need help, all of these problems that are coming up, expenses coming up and nobody seems to think a thing about the future in this administration . All this is for these deadbeat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 developers downtown . First, they always brag about how good property values are and how much everything is being rented to the hill. Then in the next mouth, they come out with they need some tax breaks, things are terrible for them. They are pleading poverty for tax breaks and then they get them. I never talked to a single person in this town that asked for a tax break and got one and didn't in almost 30 years that I've had a house. You know, instead of wasting that money on Dempsey 's sign, someone could have went over to an elementary school and got some fourth or fifth graders to make signs like that free. There is always money for downtown , always. It's endless . But there is no money for Nay Aug, for swimming pools, for sidewalks and curbs for the safety of pedestrians , for street signs, for some three and four-way stop signs to stop speeders , some signs that say no parking on the sidewalks . My neighborhood , from my house to Market Street, you can't walk on a sidewalk . They're parking places for vehicles now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 That's a shame the way this city's been run the last few years. Across the street from the boarding house, the illegal boarding house one block from me, there's a car sitting there for a year. But Mr. Oleski's office stays on my back about a car with a cover on it. It was licensed until maybe a month ago. I took the insurance and the plate off of it because I haven't driven it for two years, maybe. I think our Mayor just should go back to the Abingtons with her phoney snobby friends up there. She seems to think of outside of Scranton the whole rest of the city is nothing but a cesspool . I noticed these new signs coming in, the welcome signs with her name splashed all over them. Apparently she plans to be here forever . People, I know some of you talk to people like I do at the grocery store. Today I was in Quinn's and a lady came over and said she watches us occasionally . And she told me something I thought of years ago about the abuse you people take like from me and others. She said this should be a full-time job up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 there. So somebody likes you all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Rik Little. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , I'm Rik Little from Scranton . The -- it's just a fact that the national focus in the upcoming election is going to be on this area, northeast Pennsylvania . You could see it in the media. You could see it in everything that's happening . And there's been years of talk about election fraud. And I watched the meeting of the Board of Commissioners who I guess from what I understand oversee the Election Board. There's all kind of law stuff that goes in between it, you know, what's legal and what's what. But it was very good -- I could watch it on TV. But I would just like to talk about the every-pressing communism that's going on because I went today to try to find it out because there was election fraud in Lackawanna County. I tried to get into the Daily Morning caller or something like that and you have to subscribe , same with the Times-Tribune . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 There's no way people could easily see what's going on. But it's nuanced . It's deep. It's been going on a long time. And what I -- all the people that spoke, I mean, we have an economy . We have a city economy . We have a county economy . We have a state economy . We have a federal economy . But too many people are freaking out that there's not going to be federal money coming. And so like the Board of Education , you know, and all of these legal things are going on. In fact, the same guy that evicted me is now, you know, a lawyer for Scranton Housing Authority . And he runs the law firm for the school board. But just watching how these boards work, you know, they make laws but, you know, it's a struggle just to have a quorum there to make it legal. People have to learn about the chain command of how to deal with their environment . And this election , I mean, I've talked about the Joe Biden sign and, you know, I go to the Election Board and I read in the newspaper -- and Beth Hopkins is a very, very nice woman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I've talked to her and everything . But when you get down to what you really want to do, you end up dealing with their lawyers . You know, you have to hire an election lawyer. You have to hire a DMV lawyer if you want to get rid of the sign. In fact, you know, what Commissioner Gaughan said, "I don't care how many signatures you get, those signs are staying up." Why are they staying up? Because the focus is right here in Scranton . This is Joe Biden's birth place, I guess. And they are trying to make it like this is the whole town. Yet, it's not a sanctuary city. Well, if it's not a sanctuary city, why are they flying in and bussing in all of these people? Why are they building where the Robinson Brewery was on Cedar, you know, later replaced by a bank and the bank is being renovated for housing , you know, it's for all these little boards, you know, northeast -- there's too many of them. And there's too many people have jobs who are afraid of losing their jobs. But we got to get the government 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 together here because the fact of the matter is, Joe Biden is dead. He was executed in what was it, '18 or '19, same with Hillary Clinton . And these are the people that are from this area. And this is the reason it's focused on. And this is the reason that most people don't know this that -- but I know that it had to do with Burisma . It had to do with the Ukraine . It had to do with the energy. People better start voting right. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in list. Anyone wish to -- MR. KING: Just for the record, I shook hands with Joe Biden. He was very much alive when I met him. Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First off, the low hanging fruit. The Scranton School District paid nearly $125,000 and growing to resolve a Ransomware attack. The district superintendent says that he's going to make sure it doesn't happen again. And the district is going to put in more safety precautions in place. Simple, it should be mandated , isolated backups, period. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 When it happened to the City of Scranton and we paid taxes in the City of Scranton for the school as well, so when it happened here, wasn't that a signal to anyone in the school board, an education of learning to get a clue that they needed to harden defenses , evidently not. Evidently they don't know how to do backups because that's the only way to stop a Ransomware attack is to have a harden system and backups that are not online. Moving on, how to fix the overlook , the intent was to look over the city. So lights and having spotlights up there is a bit silly. But you certainly could have the IR lights. And I would suggest 940 nanometer lights. They are not visible to the naked eye. A few cameras, some IR lights and maybe a remote light that could be switched on with a speaker when there's an issue up there. A white light, how can we do that? Well, just like the non-profits , apply for an LSA Grant from the PA Race Horse Development and Gaming Act. Put the funds to fix it, secure it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 It's historical . So I'm sure they will dump funds into that location . Paperwork is online. City Council can do it. If the city delays, push them to be expedited . It's a national landmark and the money is out there and we keep giving it to non-profits , how about to our treasures ? 3-C as Joan noted, I looked at the attachment and why Scott Gassenmeyer is request ing a move of the park funds when he's now the illegal director of Public Works. I believe the DPW Director has no business in asking for anything for the Parks and Recreation budget as it's not his anymore. Evident in the documentation as he signed it the date on it and it came from the DPW paperwork as him as Director , not as the park service . So there's not even the excuse of he put it in beforehand before he left that office. It's on file. Look at it. I've looked online for the Scranton Home Rule Charter . Why is the charter not available for the public to view anymore? Code 360 of the charter section and it notes amendments will be noted in it, but there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 no such amendments listed. In the Charter section the verbiage has changed . There's no regard of any actions or revisions . Can we have the full Charter as original passed online like Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Erie, Lehigh County, Lancaster , Upper Darby, Monroeville, Greenville , Mount Lebanon , all have the city Home Rule Charters online. Some reason we hide it. Now, the Nay Aug Park light show, bids are in for what we've done free in the past. $109,000 for this year, $165,000 this year and an unknown by DeNaples as it doesn't have a bid amount. It has an hourly fee. So we're looking at $100,000 to $175,000 for something that was done every year by our park service . Boy, we're flowing in money here. Mr. Little had questions on education . Back when I went to South Scranton Junior High School. We had some (inaudible ) intro classes , wood shop, metal shop, print shop and even a little electrical placing of wires together . But the one thing that I was interested in the least but remember the most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 is we had a civics class, how countries became countries , what led up and caused wars to break out. Somewhere along the line we transition ed to American History and then dumbed that down and moved to histories of the month. I'm not saying that some history was better off being ignored . It needed to be put in there and address ed. But the focus on not just the events but how we got there is critical . And we have lost that from the education of our children . Can't we get back to actual civics and teaching our children the history of how the world works? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . Now, you know, we hear a lot about voting here. Well, I'm sorry, the amount -- and it's been investigated by the former president 's own man. There wasn't any significant fraud to upset an election . But yet, he just goes on and on and on. They want to make it tougher to vote. In some states, they swipe people's names off the voting rolls. And if you want to take a day off from work during regular 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 business hours and go down there and reregister and maybe have your boss who's a right winger, find out that you want to go down and register to vote again or whatever and I guess you could do that. But most people can't afford it with the kind of wages this country has been paying for the last 40 years. And that's all there is to it. You know, it leaks out into everything , the amount of taxes that the working class pays, the amount they pay towards supporting Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , veterans ' care. It goes on and on and on. And we always seem to have these activists . Personally , I'd appreciate if you'd keep your nose out of my life. I don't need you. I don't agree with you. I probably don't even like you. We have a bunch of pro-lifers went down on Penn Avenue marching back and forth in front of Planned Parenthood . But when it comes to feeding those kids or whatever or paying taxes for public housing or things like that which they absolutely can afford to keep a house over their heads or buy a house, you know, they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 all (inaudible .) Then it gets down to antivoters. You know, I don't appreciate people calling my vote a fraud. That's all there is to it. It makes me angry. It starts bringing out the Viking in my blood. Okay, now, as far as Mr. Gaughan , I wish he would -- I don't know. I didn't see the incident down there, but personally I think that most people that showed up there are a fraud. One of them is a jailbird and for good reason. The Globe Store, now I watched Jerry Notariani sit through meeting after meeting totally powerless because we had a Democrat in name only and one Republican that wanted to take over the Globe Store. And by the way, we're 18 million dollars short. Well, that's what the cost of the Globe Store was. Did we rob Peter to pay Paul? And, you know, you hear about all of these terrible things that happen like Palestine , Ohio. Well, that newspaper article that I gave you last week if you read it, the trains are longer. They are getting up to even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 two miles long. And they have two engineers at the front of it. It's less jobs for engineers on the railroad . It's less -- it's higher risk. And, you know, they can't see the back of the train. So if there is a problem like bearing housing shooting fire out of it, I've seen that once because it was defective . And, you know, they just don't -- they don't -- they can't see it. You know, so who do we blame? The engineers . As far as the Ukraine flag is concerned our Republican Congress in Washington held up military supplies for eight months. How many people died because of that? How many buildings got blown up? How many -- how much infrastructure was destroyed . Don't complain that we're not waiving the flag out front. Call your Congress man and tell him to take care of Ukraine the way we should. Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I will be brief. But would you explain to me 4-C and D, what are we doing for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the land development for these two private companies ? MR. SMURL: Is it 5-C and D, Marie, 5-C and D? MS. SCHUMACHER : No -- yeah, I'm sorry. No -- four -- five, wait -- yeah, 5-C and D. MR. SMURL: Okay, 5-C and D. It's for the connection of the sewage. Any time a structure gets a new sewer, a new owner of the property , that has to go through Council now. I'm not sure of the whole reason why. But we've had these a bunch of months ago they started to come. MS. SCHUMACHER : But coming to us, that means we're paying for it too, right? MR. SMURL: Paying for it how? MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, isn't this work, the sewage facilities ? MR. SMURL: Well, all we're doing is approving them so they could tie in. That's all we're doing. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. SMURL: The University is a new structure so we normally do new structures . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 But now it's every time it changes hands. So last time they did a building , I think it was on Washington Avenue. It was like a restaurant . And the newer one was a lesser use which was -- I don't know why but it came to us and we had to approve for them to be put in. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I don't understand it, but maybe sometime we can explain it. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: It needs to come through us for approval because they are going to tie into the sewage system any time there's like a new building put up. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight first and foremost I want to talk about the appointment of Scott Gassenmeyer to DPW. My opinion , he was given an extension six months and one day in violation of the Home Rule Charter . That never should have been approved . And because of that, it should not even be on the agenda this evening . Tonight I'm going to talk about my vision of safety in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the City of Scranton . It starts with crosswalks throughout our city. You hear about pedestrians getting hit by vehicles . There was somebody that was hit today in front of Kelly's on Cedar Avenue. I don't know the status. But I know vehicles tend to drive faster now a days as opposed to slower. They don't stop at stop signs. And we have more people in the area that are not familiar with the area. So having crosswalks are very important . Let's start around the schools . In West Scranton , I would like Council to address a stop sign that's needed on North Lincoln and Swetland Streets . It's a block away from the school, Charles Sumner. And I believe it should be part of the mandate. The Mayor does not understand mandates , because if she did, a lot of this stuff would have been taken care of by now. Crosswalks throughout our city are extremely important . Also, let's address the signage like stop signs as opposed to looking at putting a sign up greeting coming into the city. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 know, priorities are important . Safety to our city is important . That also includes the Scranton Police Department . Currently we do not have a Drug Task Force. I believe the city needs two. I truly do. But by doing so, it would allow us to get ahead a little bit with these people that are coming into the area taking a different approach to their actions . Sixty percent of people live paycheck to paycheck . Upon doing so people coming into the area, it would be easier for them to sell drugs and guns not knowing who it impacts. Now, personally I have seen impact. You know, my son died from an overdose very unexpected . Now, I'm going to get justice February 28th, 2025 without a continuance hopefully . But locally , there's families that don't have that option. I spoke with a family at 2:30 one morning on their deck about this very same thing. And that's closure. How could you get closure if the person who impacted your family is not brought to justice ? I could see a local police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 department looking for avenues to make example of these people, bring them to justice , bring a swift justice to our city. There's 74,000 people here. We do not have a Drug Task Force. Two are differently needed. Also, we only have two canines that hit on drugs and guns. We need five. All right. How are we going to pay for all of this? Well, here's the simple answer, hotel tax. Let's use other people's money for a change to fix our problem s that this administration refuses to fix. You know, we got all the bells and whistles up at the University of Scranton as far as crosswalks and all the street signs you're able to press a button and it truly works. You know, these kids are smart at the University of Scranton . They're there for a reason. Now, they know how to cross streets . But yet, it's not good enough for our kids. You know, we're missing the boat here. We're missing the true meaning of what the city is. There's so many good people here. I'm humbled by every experience , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 everybody I ever met over the years. And safety in our city is truly important . You know, our police go to every single call without a problem , you know, looking to make sure that our city is safe. The least we could do is to help them because it's safer. That hotel tax, by the way, 3 percent , the county gets 7 percent . We're missing the boat on about 3 million a year. It could be utilize d the right way for many reasons . The safety of our city is very important . And come next December 31st, she's out of here. That's not a prediction . That's a spoiler. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: A few things. Frank, can you check with the administration about the Home Rule Charter ? That should be accessible on that website . I know it's been a few months since I accessed it. But I was able to access 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 it last time I was there. But now I'm finding out that -- that should be accessible . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, Mr. King. MR. KING: Yeah, I would appreciate that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll let you know. Thank you. MR. KING: There was a mention earlier today that there was no money for parks or street signs. There is money for parks. We're doing Nay Aug Park. The contract 's already been awarded. We've done Connors Park. We've completed Oakmont Park, Capouse Park. Robinson Park is almost done, a few weeks away. Connell Park is being done. Doherty Park is completed . Weston Field is getting a new pool and a skateboard park. And also the street signs as has been mentioned here before, Norma has spoken here that she's starting to realize that the sign project is actually happening . So to say that there isn't money or there isn't money being spent on those things a misnomer . We're fortunate we did get a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 money from the federal government , ARPA funds. And it's being utilized to update our parks throughout the city and street signs and a multitude of other things. But I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I'm going to start by making a motion. We've had the PA Fire Recovery billing services . It's come up from time to time here on Council . So we spoke about it in caucus and I would just like to make a motion for Solicitor Gilbride to research the language of the PA Fire Recovery billing services . So first I'll make the motion. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: We have a motion and a second. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So we discuss ed it in caucus. And we're recommend ing that we take a look into this to take a look at the language that the city is using and where we're going with it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 But Council does recommend ceasing the practice immediately of sending out these billings. And if we don't see any action on it, Council is going to be taking action on it in the near future. MR. KING: Just to clarify , the action that we're looking to take in the future is to actually change the language that exists there. So we're hoping -- we believe that the existing language speaks to the issue. There shouldn 't even be any billing going out to people who live in homes that, you know the fire company comes to put a fire out. Apparently they end up getting bills. That should never happen. And I believe that the existing language address es it. But it's interpreted a different way. So am I correct in saying that -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, the motion is for Mr. Gilbride to take a look into the language so we could make recommendation s on that language . And hopefully we get the practice to cease or we're going to be taking action on it. MR. KING: Very good, yep. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I agree wholeheartedly . We've been talking about this for a couple years. And we questioned the language because no where in the language did it state property , meaning a home. You know, it was amended or there was an addendum to it. I forget how far it goes back. I have nothing in front of me. But I remember that the language for the most part said, you know, a vehicle , fine. If somebody from out of town has an accident and their vehicle is spilling, you know, chemicals , whether gasoline , any other chemical , I mean, it require s a cleanup we should bill them. That's fine when the fire department 's called, that's fine. But a for instance is maybe two years ago -- and, you know, from my understanding I spoke with the firefighters . They don't want to do this. They are not behind this. They are not supporting that. A lot of them told me, you know, this hasn't happened in years. And all of a sudden it's happening 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 with these bills are being generated . But I was told by one resident he got charged -- the amount, don't hold me to it but a couple thousand dollars because their mulch caught on fire. And the fire department used their homeowner 's hose to put out the mulch that was on fire. And there -- was charged like three or four thousand dollars which is absurd. So we had these conversations . We kind of been ignored . I don't know if we're at a standstill. But moving forward , that's just one example . There's many. And I also believe , guess what, in your taxes you pay for the wonderful service we get from the public safety unions. I don't think we should be charged on top of that. And I think most of the firefighter s agree with that. It just came out of nowhere. It was on the books and all of a sudden it was -- I don't know the interpretation has changed from vehicle to now homes. So I'm 100 percent in favor. We've been talking about this. And I'm glad we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 resurrected this and finally we're going to move forward on this and put an end to it for the most part. But we'll go through the channels like we're suppose d to. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Moving on, taking a look at some of the question s I had asked last week, I asked about our recycling services . It seemed that we averaged about 100 tons per month, October , November , December . We were told that 88.26 tons of recycling -- I had questioned that because it seemed that it was about 88 percent of monthly recycling . I asked if it was returned or not returned to the city. So I think that was some confusion .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 But the answer was it wasn't returned to the city. But the answer was clarified that 88.62 tons was charged the new rate of 120,000 -- sorry about that -- $120 per ton rather than the 49. I had asked about a sign. It was brought up in Tripp Park that Neighborhood Association was asked about a sign that was believed to be on recovery authority land on Euclid Avenue and North Main Avenue. I was asked if a sign was to go up there when we had discussed about the signs at entrance s to the city. The answer I got was more time was require d to provide Council with an answer on this. But I was happy to see that in the newspaper this location was listed in the location that signs would go up from the Mayor's interview in the newspaper and also on television . So I'm happy to hear that a sign will go into that area. I asked about we had an MOU or an MOA that was put out for DPW and the firefighter department s prior to the break in August. And I asked if all of that was 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 percent ratified and also if Scranton Police Officers , Fire Department , DPW and Clerical Union workers were now allowed to move out of the city. Both of those questions I received that more time would be require d to provide Council with an answer to that. I asked those questions because the new DPW Director will be living outside of the city. And I wanted to know if our current city employees after those MOUs or MOAs had been signed and agreed upon if they were also allowed to move out of the city at least at this time when we're hiring that new director . So we will need more time to get that answer. It was brought up in public comment tonight about a stop sign at Swetland and I believe North Lincoln Avenue. At this point in time one street that's going -- well, the street that crosses Swetland is a one-way street. So at this point in time it's a two-way stop sign. If we could send it over to Scranton Police Department for a traffic study. Coming down the hill from Cathedral Cemetery 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 moving towards Main Avenue on Swetland there is not a stop sign at the one location . So when you're stopping at either of those two stop signs, the oncoming traffic that's coming down the hill and faster than -- usually those other two routes is not stopping . So it might be an area to look into for a stop sign. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll submit it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I did get another e-mail about 1615 Swetland Street and also the corner of Swetland and Meadow Court. The resident there reached out. It was sent over to code enforcement . But the resident had let me know that no action had seemed to take place at this time if we could just look into it further . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 motions or comments at this time. As you could see I don't have much of a voice right now. So I'll just send e-mails. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So, you know, I'm just going to piggyback on what Mr. Schuster , you know, the response he got about the waiver legislation . I remember it was fast and furious that we had to get this legislation in for removing, you know, the waiver requirements , you know, or you have to live in the city. Then all of a sudden, a question is posed if it's actually happening or being enforced or not enforced or whatever and administration needs more time. That's beautiful . All right. So next, so I have a couple solution s that issues that were brought forward to us over the past couple weeks. I'll start with the outlook -- the lookout at 307. So thank you very much for the pictures , Mrs. Schumacher . And then the next day there was many pictures in the paper. And we have been talking about this for a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 years. You've brought it to our attention . There's been graffiti . There's been issues with some of the stone falling in the past. And I don't think we're consistently taking care of it and that's unfortunate . And, you know, the recommendation for some lights and they're all good. But I thought , you know, out loud maybe a potential solution , we're trying to solve a problem here. So I reached out -- I work at the Career Technology Center. I don't think it's a secret. We have a masonry class. I reached out to the gentleman who teaches it. And I asked him, I said, hey, this would be a great project . You know, we don't need you to redo the wall. How about -- and, of course, we need permission from our administration . And I seek that as well that we could probably take that on or they could take it on, at least fix what's knocked down already . And he took a look at it and he looked at the picture . And he said that's something we could do. And I think it's a great project for the student s, you know, of course. But, of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 course, I also reached out to the union. And, of course, we never want to take away a union job. All right. So I reached out to him. He's looking into it. What I would like to do is, you know, provide -- if you could provide this possible or potential solution to administration to see if they would be okay with that. And we could get that fixed or at least, you know, a short term fix before these continue to get knocked over. You know, once one rock's gone, whoever is doing it is going to keep going. So I think we should at least button it up before the winter and have a great student project for our kids. Secondly, so I have been getting multiple complaint s on North and South Main Avenue in West Scranton from the Tripp House all the way down to Fidelity Bank on the corner of Luzerne and Main. And there are some poles -- and these aren't the hometown hero banners . These are poles that had various flags over the years. I'm not sure how far it goes back. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 goes back a while. There used to be a POW flag here or there, a Pennsylvania flag and some American flags. And they looked really cool. But I'm not -- I don't remember exactly who is responsible or what organization or group. I don't think it matters at this point because I tried to find out. And we can't really narrow it down. But they are tattered and need to come down, all right? They have outlived their beauty and now they're an eyesore . And some of the poles are just hanging. Some flags are hanging . So for two weeks in a row I had Mr. Voldenberg reach out to administration and we didn't, you know, receive anything back yet. And I know there's a little controversy about hanging banners for picnics , state roads and whatever , you know, which -- now we have to almost an act of Congress to get permission to do that now. With that said, another potential solution is I said earlier that I was at the West Scranton Fall Festival . NeighborWorks , they did a great job at that time. And NeighborWorks now is handling the hometown hero banners in West 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Scranton , right, so I asked them. I said, Mr. Pousley , can you help us out here? I didn't really hear anything back from administration . But these poles are an issue. I'm constantly reminded of it by the constituent s in West Scranton . And he said of course he could probably help us out as a possible solution , meaning he has a relationship with Jaworski Signs who has a guy with a bucket truck that hangs the hometown hero banners and he would be more than happy to remove these unsightly tattered flags. So there is another potential option to solve a problem that we keep hearing about if you could relay to the administration and ask for, you know, please advise us or I could move forward on it or they can on both projects that we can take care of. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Do I have one more? Let me see. I do. So this is an issue -- let's see here. So I got a call today or we got a call inquiring when the construction work will be completed at the intersection slash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 corner near the Scranton Housing Authority . It is at Adams and Mulberry and mention ed how traffic backs up to Jefferson Avenue. So could we please -- I don't know if we discuss ed that recently . I'm not sure where we're at with that. Just for clarification -- I don't remember , so maybe if you can shoot me a note and I can relay this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. It's an ongoing project with PPL. I'll get a timeframe for you. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Or maybe you could respond to this e-mail. I think you were copied on it -- or maybe not. Alison has it so we can take care of that. MR. KING: Frank, maybe you could get a tentative conclusion date for that project for Mr. McAndrew and all of us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And I want to think that's it. Oh, maybe the stop sign on North Lincoln and Swetland . All right. Maybe that's a possibility if we could send that to administration . And that's all I have right now. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . This is an update from the finance meeting this past Wednesday . We spoke about the city audit and all but the Scranton Parking Authority is completed . The Parking Authority told us it should be finished by this month and then we'll be able to get it in. The HUP test continues . We're still waiting results from the county and the school district . They are both currently working on it. And it seems to be moving. So we may be close with that. The updated earned interest earned by the taxpayer dollars that we've earned at banks as of last Wednesday afternoon is $828,005.61. And the last thing we spoke of was all department s are going as expected, one was a bit below average which was licensing and inspection . But that goes back to last July when we lowered the fees and we had to lower the fees on all of our inspection fees and stuff because that department is not allowed to make a profit. It needs to break even so we were making too much money there unfortunately . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 we had to lower the fees. It is a bit behind. But we're going look at it before the end of this year to make sure we're going to be closer to breaking even. And if we have to, they may have to go back up again. And the 800 block of Richter Avenue, it is PAWC that is working by Roaring Brook. And all of the stones and everything are for their -- related to their cleanup by that thing. And they said they will put it back to the original condition before they leave. So I will be watching that one too. 2100 block of Cedar Avenue, the city did issue a stop work order related to the clearing of all of those trees and all the brush on that property . It looked like they were building something there. The property owner was asked and he told the Planning Commission and the Zoning Board that there are no immediate plans for that property to be developed . So I don't know why it was torn down, but I guess we'll find out shortly . 1700 block of Dorothy Street, DPW has been requested to revisit that for another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 large pave cut for proper levelling . And code enforcement this week -- part of last week and this week in South Scranton so far they have towed three abandon ed cars, three tractors were removed from houses by code enforcement and three tractor -trailers were relocated by the owners.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 126, 2024 – APPOINTMENT OF SCOTT GASSENMEYER TO THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 18, 2024. MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 of Item 7-B. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , as I stated earlier tonight , I did ask administration if as a result of the MOUs or MOAs that were signed with the Fire Department , DPW, etc., if these individuals were allowed to move outside of the City of Scranton . I did not receive an answer on that. This individual is living in Dunmore . I think it would be the first individual hired under the new waiver of residency in the City of Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : Also -- I mean, on the question , so historically we don't really receive advice and consent before hires, cabinet member hires. This one we kind of do I'm hearing . But if you look in this backup, this gentleman was -- we got a letter on the 18th that said he was acting DPW Director of September . And then the legislation 's entered . We -- it's in here 9/24 last week that he's going to be appointed . So, I mean, technically 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 he's right. But it doesn't feel right to me. So, Solicitor Gilbride , could you confirm to me that the Home Rule Charter is being followed directly with regards to the hiring of -- the code for hiring with advice and consent ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. McAndrew , in accordance with the -- your wishes and the rest of Council 's wishes, I research ed the issue. I, in fact, did. The Home Rule Charter under Section 609, Subsection 15 provides that the Mayor appoint s all members of her staff. That is further enhanced under the City Code, specifically in Section 6, Subsection 5B3 that provide s that the Mayor shall appoint -- the language itself says the Mayor shall appoint all department director s pursuant to the Charter. It does provide that the Mayor is to provide to Council within 48 hours prior to your next meeting . In this case notice was provide d on 9/19/2024 which was actually five days or 120 hours prior to your next meeting that the appointment was to be taking place. At that point it is the duty of Council to consider the legislation . You have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 35 days to do that. If, in fact, you have a right to vote it up, vote it down, or if you do nothing , then the appointment automatically takes place. In addition , under Section 66B7, the Mayor is allowed to appoint acting directors not to exceed 35 days. After 35 days that appointment as an acting director must be approve d by this Board or dismiss ed. So the Charter and the Code have been followed by the administration in regard to this appointment . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. VOLDENBERG : EIGHTH ORDER. 8-A. File of the Council No. 31, 2024. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , that has not been taken from the table. MR. SMURL: If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR.
