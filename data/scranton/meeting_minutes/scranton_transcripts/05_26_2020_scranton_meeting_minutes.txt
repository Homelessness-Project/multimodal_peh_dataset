This will be at the Wright Center's new facility at 501 South Washington Avenue. Please sign up today. Appointments are being given in 15-minute intervals.

That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else? Any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have an announcement . I was going to mention the Salad Shop grand opening tomorrow too. I'm pretty excited about that. I've been wanting a salad place in Scranton for a while now. Over in Wilkes-Barre they have a few good places that I like to go to. And now I'm happy that we'll have one here that I will be able to visit. But there was something else that I wanted to bring up that I was made aware of today. So this past year there were -- there was a TEDx event that was started here in Scranton . And if anyone's ever heard of the Ted Talks, it's similar to that. So TEDx is a program of local self organized events that bring people together to share Ted-like experience . At a TEDx event, Ted talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. And this year they've been approved 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to have an event specifically for women called TEDx Scranton Women. So they are inviting women to apply to be speakers for the event. It wouldn't take place until November 29th. So application s are open until June 6th for anyone interested to apply to be a speaker for TEDx Scranton Women. MR. GAUGHAN : Great. Thank you. If you see me looking to my left my -- we have a gate in my kitchen . And my daughter Mauve is currently haunting me like a ghost here yelling things out. I just have a few announcements . The first one is Council 's regularly scheduled meeting as I mentioned in the caucus for next Tuesday , June 2nd, 2020 has been reschedule d to Thursday , June 4th, 2020 due to Election Day. So we're going to move it from Tuesday to Thursday . If anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comment s in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing LReed@scranton pa.gov. We will accept public comment until the day of our meeting which next week will be Thursday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. Also I wanted to wish a happy birthday to my good friend and a lot of people's friend in our community , Charlotte Ledbetter, a great person who does a lot for the people of the Hill Section , really all over the City of Scranton . And I don't know if anybody saw it on WNEP, but they had a big birthday parade for Charlotte . I was going to be a part of that but then something came up. I felt badly about that. But I did want to wish her a happy birthday . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Bill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Letwinsky , Ann Cammerota , Marie Schumacher , Fay Franus, Norma Jeffries , and Derek Raines. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say a couple things. So first of all, I appreciate Mr. Letwinsky , Mrs. Cammerota , Mrs. Schumacher , Miss Franus, Miss Jeffries and Mr. Raines for submitting public comment . I want to reiterate once again that we really appreciate , especially in this time where we can't physically see people in our meeting s except for the other Council members . And we do appreciate the comment s we get from the public. And we do take them serious ly. We take them into consideration . And any questions that we receive , we are doing our best to get those to the proper departments to be answered . I did have an opportunity to speak to the Mayor today late this afternoon briefly . And she reiterated to me that any of the questions that they have received they are in the process of answering them. Now, in saying that as I mentioned I think two or three weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 ago, I hope that people could understand that we're not as quick in getting answers back because of everything that's going on. Many people have been furloughed . So trying to get information sometimes can take a little bit longer than we're used to. Some of the questions though that came up in the comments that I reviewed, I just want to touch on briefly . So Mrs. Cammerota submitted public comment to all of us about the flooding on North Merrifield Avenue. And this is an issue that I am keenly aware of over the last few years. This is an issue that has just been constant . Every time we get a large rainstorm, either Mr. Srebro or someone from that area will contact one of us. And it's just a recurring issue. And I have met with these resident s on numerous occasions . But this comment here is concerning . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could please forward this to the appropriate departments , I would think our City Engineer , DPW, Mr. King our City Planner and if you could copy the Mayor on it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 The long and short of it is, a vacant property that was once owned by the City and designated as a no build area was sold to a company a few years back. That property was sold to another party and now that party is going to build a home there. So the neighbors here are I think concerned that this is going to add to the water runoff. And it is really, really severe in that area. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could forward that out to the appropriate department . Miss Schumacher asked several questions . Offhand I don't have the information in front of me. Several of them we will once again forward those to the appropriate departments . The one question that she had posed on why was the 2020 real estate tax levy only on land and not improvements . That was done per Mr. Bulzoni 's request , the former business administrator because it would have a less punitive affect on property owners throughout the City. I'll have additional information on that. I have to go through my records and some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 of the comment s that were made during the budget process last year. But I know that that was the case. We also received a comment from Mr. Raines, Mrs. Reed, if we can forward that off to the fire department . It had something to do with fire protection programs for rental departments in the City. And we received some other comments here regarding the waiver and other issues that we'll get to the appropriate department . Again, appreciate everybody taking their time out to send their concerns to Council . Anybody else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd also like to say, Bill, I'm glad that you commented on some of those because I do have some notes regarding Mr. Camerotta 's request . Mrs. Schumacher had a lot of good question s. And I think some of you passed them off to the proper channels . One of them that we might be able to get was she asked that the letter from the county about the voter -- the polling wards be added to Third Order. Is that something that we can move to Third Order? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. We normally -- Mrs. Reed, correct me if I'm wrong, we can do that because I do think it's -- I don't know if we were copied on it or if we were sent that. Usually what we put in Third Order is anything that was sent directly to Council or if we were copied on it and, you know, it's a matter of public interest . But I think in that case, I think you're right, Councilman Schuster , that that is important . So we can, Mrs. Reed, if you could include that for next week in Third Order I would appreciate it. MR. SCHUSTER : In regards to that stormwater , I know that we had the study and the analysis that's being done right now and they're looking into Keyser Creek. But I don't know -- and I'm sure that watershed area there is being taken into consideration because it comes down through the Keyser Valley Community Center, which I feel the piece of property next to that, wasn't that sold by the land bank? MR. GAUGHAN : I can't remember off the top of my head. I do know that at one time the Keyser Valley Community Center I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 believe Mrs. Reed -- Mrs. Reed may have a better memory on this than I do. But they were -- either they received grant money or they were suppose d to receive grant money to redo the parking lot because as everybody here knows who's from that area especially every time it rains it gets flooded . In terms of the property you're speaking of, I can't remember off the top of my head. But I do know that before the last administration went out, there was discussions about conducting an overall study of that area to see what else can be done in terms of alleviating the flooding issues. So we may want to circle back and see where we're at with that. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's right -- Keyser Valley, the Community Center specifically turns into a lake at this point in time. And I was under the impression there was somebody that was going to be used to do some kind of water mitigation there along the -- if you're looking at the front of the building to the right-hand side of it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 And I know maybe after the substation was put up there, houses on Newton Road were flooded which weren't flooded in the past. But that comes right down there from the top of Jackson Street and Price Street coming down into the Community Center and then going -- there's pump houses also in between there, one I think on Keyser Avenue and then that property that Mrs. Camerotta is speaking about is directly between those two. And there's another house that sits in the lowest section there. So, I mean, that's -- the way the water drains is right down there, Newton Road, Jackson Street, Keyser Valley Community Center into that property that she's talking about on 121 Merrifield. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, and we may want to touch base again and the gentleman that worked for the flood control department in the City are really knowledgeable about that area as well because they've been dealing with it for so long. I know there was improvements to the pumping station down there. There was money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 put aside in the budget I believe last year and the year -- last year or the year before, significant upgrades from what I remember for the pumping station . But, yeah, the employees in the Flood Control Program have great knowledge of that as well. So, you know, we'll circle back with them and see where we are with that. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, one quick thing. What I do remember and it might have been February that this issue came up, probably in February and that the City engineer was suppose d to do an assessment. And I don't know where we're at with that -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think -- I don't know if it was the City engineer or if it was -- I think they were going to -- they were looking for grant money or they had grant money. I can't remember off the top of my head now. But, yeah, it was something along those lines so you're correct . Yeah, we'll circle back. I mean, everybody here knows 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 every year that is a major issue over there. So thank you. Anybody else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just real quick, one of Miss Schumacher 's question s is when will the City join all other municipalities in the county and pay property taxes on a single assessed property value. And that's in regard to the separation of land and then structure . So, I mean, the short answer to that one is when the county performs a reassessment . It's easier to, you know, put that into one rate based on current values, not on value, you know, from 50 years ago. MR. GAUGHAN : Good point. Anybody else? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment ) (Bill Letwinsky )1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Questioning residency is ok, however , misters Donahue , McAndrew and Schuster are disingenuous in their denial. “The mayor failed to justify it”, they said. As a tax payer represented by these individuals , I WONT to know the specifics that these individuals believe (not feel) make ms Cipriani 's appointment unjustified . I would appreciate a response at the next council meeting . PS, an e-mail response would help alleviate my concerns that ulterior motives are at work. Thank you. Bill Letwinsky . (Ann Cammerota ) Dear Council Members , As you know, the families living in the 100 and 200 blocks of N. Merrifield Avenue have been subject to severe flooding in recent years. This flooding has been attributed to improper control of runoff water coming from new construction in the higher elevations . Representatives from our neighborhood have attended numerous meetings to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 address this problem . We live in fear whenever heavy rains are predicted . To add insult to injury, a vacant property adjacent to 121 N. Merrifield Avenue once owned by the city and designated as a "no build" area was sold to a company a few years back. Subsequently , this property was sold to another party who intends to build a home there. Our fears are mounting . This property , which for years absorbed at least some of the water runoff, will no longer be able to do its job. We anticipate that this new construction will add to our flooding woes. The last flood brought several feet of water to many of our homes. Any additional water sent our way may very well bring the depth even higher. We implore you to help stop this new construction , so that we may keep our homes safe. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Sincerely ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Ann Cammerota 208 N. Merrifield Avenue Scranton , PA 18504 PS: Please see that each council member receives a copy of this letter for their review. Thank you. (Marie Schumacher ) Compelled to comment that the Scranton Parking Authority and, I believe the Pension Board Meeting , allowed questions from non-members (the public) listening in. Something you might want to consider as it would have the potential to have more citizens participate . How many LERTA applications have been received since the 10 Year City-Wide Program was approved in February 2019 o What percent of the Trash bills have been paid to date? Please provide this information each week. When will those of us "saving" our commingled (blue container ) for recycling 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 rather than the Keystone Trash mountain be relieved of our collection ? What is the holdup and who is responsible for resolving the issue? When will the City join all of the other municipalities in the County and base the property taxes on a single assessed property value? Why was the 2020 real estate tax levy only on land and not improvements ? Last week Mr. Schuster spoke of direction the Scranton School District has received regarding utilization of municipal buildings ; especially for accommodating voting. Please obtain this communication and make it available in Third Order. While I have seen a Legal Notice regarding getting kicked out of our Firehouse and reassigned to another location , not everyone reads the paper and not all who do read the paper read the Legal Notices on a regular basis. As this last minute botch could confuse voters and affect turnout I would like to know if all registered voters in these precincts will be advised by the City by mail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 as it is the City that caused the need for the changed polling place. (Fay Franus) Council Attorney Hayes must most kind in sending me the Pilchesky lawsuits against Dave Bulzoni --I am enclosing some of this law case-- it is very conflicting --so I will narrow my statements regrading this. I want to first thank council persons Donahue Schuster and McAndrew for doing THEIR job to serve the people. I would like to hear their reasons for not seconding this motion to grant Ms Ciprianni a waiver though. I am curious to know their thoughts . But the bottom line is this-- even though it is an ordinance to give a person a waiver to live outside the city while working in the city--it means NOTHING !! The Mayor is the only one who can hire or fire a person in the executive branch of government . So now since there was no motion to second Ciprianni 's waiver she must 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 move back into the city to live within six months or get terminated . Which is just a dog and pony show. The council has never enforced this law. On December 31st 2015 Dave Bulzoni was to be terminated after his six month waiver--what did the council do? They ignored it and gave him a waiver to work in Scranton without moving back for as long as he worked in the city. Nice huh? So the people in this city know the games council plays. When Council president Weschler stated he would be fired by December 31st if he did not move back, I like many fools believed him. Having further investigated council can not fire anyone. Of course Weschler never mentioned that. Another matter I find quite interesting , at this time Bill Gaughan was in favor of people who worked in Scranton must live in Scranton period! Better yet I will quote him here from the newspaper : Gaughan said he again opposes the residency waiver on principal because it's “unfair to every taxpayer in Scranton .” He 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 said every other city employee has to live in the city. He noted that Bulzoni 's annual city salary is $90,000. I sure would like to know what changed Bill Gaughan 's mind. I agree with Bill from his past statement above. You do know council has NO POWERS! So come six months down the line when Eileen Ciprianni still lives in West Wyoming are you going to say she must move to Scranton when in reality she does not have to because Mayor Cognetti will NEVER fire her? This city is a complete joke. Why don't you have a long discussion on why you never ever enforce laws. Example the garbage fee ordinance where DPW workers do NOT have to pick up garbage if the person has not paid their bill or the garbage can lid bill where every person must have lids on their garbage cans no bags loose or the truck ban law I got created in 1995 banning all trucks over 10 ton from traveling on all of Bellevue streets . I still never heard if Lawyer Eskra still gets her #12,00 raise Wayne Evans gave her last year for doing extra work in her 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 hour work day. So tonight IF you discuss this waiver why don't you just simply tell the people the whole truth--YOU AS A COUNCIL HAVE NO POWER TO FIRE ANYONE if by chance Ciprianni does NOT move to Scranton it does not make any difference because if the mayor wants her to stay working she will and you can't do a damn thing about it--case closed-- Two days ago I helped rescue a loose Pit Bull who was a sweetheart . He was lost and roaming around. I brought him food and played with him with a ball until Griffon Pond shelter showed up--My dog Emerson played with him which also tells you that Pit Bulls can play nicely with other dogs. So lay off laws against pit bulls and if you make any laws make them against the owners. Read below the law that I enclosed about waivers for people who live outside the city: Fay Franus-- (scroll down to read) If the Mayor decides to seek a waiver of these residency requirements for a potential 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 candidate or candidates for employment by the City, then such an appointment to any and all employment positions within the City shall not be made unless the advice and consent of Council is secured prior to employment of the potential candidates for employment in the same manner as cabinet departmental heads and solicitors are confirmed . City of Scranton Admin. Code, ch. 6, art. III, § 6:6-1(4) (emphasis added). Second, the Code also provide s, in relevant part: On or after March 1, 1980, any new employee of the City of Scranton who is not a resident of the City of Scranton at the time of the commencement of employment shall have six months from the time of commencement of employment to acquire a bona fide residence within the corporate limits of the City. Such residence must be maintained during continuous employment by the City or be a cause for immediate termination of the employment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 relationship between the City of Scranton and the new employee . Id. At § 6:6-1(2). Additionally , the parties agree on all material issues of fact. Specifically , shortly after he assumed office in January of 2014, Mayor Courtright neither sought nor obtained a residency waiver from City Council prior to his appointment of Bulzoni , a nonresident of Scranton , as the City's Business Manager . Mayor Courtright eventually did obtain a residency waiver for Bulzoni , still a nonresident of Scranton , on February 2, 2015, approximately one year after his appointment . The waiver expired on December 31, 2015, and Mayor Courtright obtained a second residency waiver for Bulzoni , still a nonresident of Scranton , on February 4, 2016. This second residency waiver expires only when Bulzoni 's term as Business Manager ends. The parties disagree on the interpretation of and interplay between Section 6:6-1(4) and Section 6:6-1(2) of the Administrative1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Code. Defendants argue that the language of Section 6:6-1(4) does not require that the Mayor obtain a residency waiver for a potential nonresident employee prior to the potential nonresident employee 's appointment . Rather, they assert that the Mayor need only secure the advice and consent of City Council prior to making such an appointment . Defendants do not challenge the plain language of Section 6:6-1(2), and they concede that Bulzoni has not established a bona fide residence within the City to this date. Conversely , Pilchesky contends that Section 6:6-1(4) mandates that the Mayor secure a residency waiver for a potential nonresident employee prior to that potential nonresident employee 's appointment . A plain reading of Section 6:6-1(4) indicates as much, but fails to account for the six-month grace period provided to newly appointed , nonresident employees by Section 6:6-1(2). Specifically , Section 6:6-1(2) allows nonresident employees “six months from the time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 of commencement of employment to acquire a bona fide residence within the corporate limits of the City.” City of Scranton Admin. Code, ch. 6, art. III, § 6:6-1(2). Furthermore , and relying on the subject language of the Administrative Code, it can be argued that once Bulzoni was appointed Business Administrator under § 6:6-1(2), Bulzoni was no longer a “potential candidate for employment ,” making § 6:6-1(4) inapplicable . Though there is no dispute that Mayor Courtright did not acquire a residency waiver for Bulzoni either before his appointment or at any point during the six months from the time that Bulzoni 's employment had commenced , we cannot definitively conclude that the Mayor was required to obtain the waiver prior to his appointment of Bulzoni . (Norma Jeffries ) Re: Appointment of Eileen Cipriani to the position of Executive Director OECD. During the last few months it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 been a challenge to gather all the points that are discussed at the Caucus and the Council meetings without going back to rerun the meetings . At the previous meeting , it was great to hear Eileen Cipriani lay out her vision for the future of Scranton . With the anticipated loss of revenue for the city, this is a time, more than ever, to look at the qualifications vs where someone lives. Looking at the background of Eileen, I certainly feel she is more than qualified to accept the duties of the position . Why hold her back because of her residency . This is the 2nd time within the last 3 years that this question of residency has been an issue of concern . If someone is bringing to the table those skills and experience that will greatly benefit the city, it is time for a change. If I am reading the Home Rule Charter correctly , it became effective January , 1976. Maybe there is an update to the Home Rule Charter that I did not see on the City Website . We are in uncharted territory because of the issues resulting from Covid 19. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 No way was it even a thought that we would have revenues in jeopardy because of a virus. Therefore , it seems time to take a look at the Home Rule Charter . This residency issue is not going to go away. Just to say ”no” that a person cannot have the position because they do not live in the city, seems obsolete and not keeping up with the times. Let's get our Home Rule Charter updated on the residency issue.!!! (Derek Raines) City of Scranton , City Council , With the recent increases of fires in multi family homes, is it time for the city of Scranton to upgrade it’s fire protection programs for rental apartments . Especially now with the increase of illegal fireworks usage in the city. This would include fire extinguishers and smoke detectors . Ultimately the property owner is responsible for the safety of the inspector . These requirements are clearly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 specified in the National Fire Protection Association NFPA 101 life safety. Can these fire safety requirements be looked at by the city Fire Inspectorate ? Derek Raines Certified occupational safety and health specialist United States Army retired (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to make a comment . I had several but we covered some of those already on the question with the last -- and also in caucus. Last week during Fifth Order I think I spoke about drafting correspondence with the Mayor regarding the appointment of Mrs. Cipriani . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Two of the things in specific were payment of taxes in the City, the IT tax as well as having her tenure coincide with that of the Mayor's. I did speak with the solicitor . And I know he spoke with the administration . He was looking at drafting some kind of legislation there with new wording . With that, I think Mr. Hayes might be able to speak on that a little bit more. But with that, I think I'd feel more comfortable if that came from the Mayor per se to reintroduce that rather than ourselves. ATTY. HAYES: Council man Schuster , per our discussion , I drafted what will be revised language for the resolution that would grant a waiver from the residency requirement which would contain two conditions . The first condition would be that Miss Cipriani be required -- or the City rather would withhold and pay the earned income tax for Miss Cipriani 's salary at the same rate as is withheld and paid for employees who are residents of the City. And the second condition would be that the waiver that expires on January 3, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 2022 which is the end of the current term for the Mayor and the current administration . So I did draft language and circulated it for your review and comment . But it certainly could originate from the administration if that's where you -- obviously they would have to get on board with whatever we propose in terms of that resolution . MR. SCHUSTER : From my perspective I think I would feel more comfortable with it coming from them. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. So if you sign off on what was -- what I drafted I could send that to them or I could ask them to propose their own language , whichever you would prefer. MR. SCHUSTER : Anyone else on that? Anybody else want to weigh in? MR. MCANDREW : I'm okay with that because it initially came from administration . So I'm okay with that. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I would agree with that. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm fine with that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 too as long as I'm hoping that it's brought back here in some way. I'm glad to see that those conversations are had and that hopefully we can move forward with it. So that's great if it comes from the administration with those changes . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anything else, Councilman Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I just want to report out, I mean, it was -- we discussed it in caucus that after five weeks I finally got some type of correspondence from the labor firm regarding the hours being generated I guess right now. That's the correspondence we got generated in the form of an invoice . So I just want to report out to everybody that, you know, we should hear soon, I guess. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I have a few today. They're all pretty much regarding the same issue. A resident had come to me last week and asked if I could stop by their property on Sanderson Avenue to take a look at some neighboring properties that have become a problem for that neighborhood . And I was happy to do that. And I went by to see what the issues were. And there were plenty that are quite a concern . So I wanted to send a few correspondences to the LIPS Department . First of all, there is a property at 1358 Sanderson Avenue that was condemned about a year ago. So I just wanted an update regarding that property and if there are demolitions planned and, if so, for when to let the neighbors know. And then there are two other properties on that street that are both owned by the same person. And those people also own two other properties in Scranton on another section of town, so four properties total. And I'll just describe a few of the complaints regarding the property at 1352-1354 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Sanderson Avenue. It had previously been rented out but it hasn't been occupied since January . When those tenants left at that time, there was a lot of garbage put out in the front as happens when renters leave properties . However , there is still litter and trash around from when they left including a like a wet cement bag and other things that are just needlessly in the way and not attractive to the street. The property has had an issue with rats. There is a broken window. I think a broken door as well in the backyard . There is just a stove sitting out there -- a kitchen stove in the backyard . Everything is overgrown with the grass in the backyard and the front yard. It looks like nothing has been done with the property in a long time. And these are issues that I think the neighbors have had for quite a long time with this property . And they've asked the LIPS Department about it several times and they have not received responses on what is going on, if there's been fines to the owner. And to top it off, they also have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 another property on Sanderson that is also in disrepair . And they owe money on taxes and refuse bills. It looks like -- let's see from -- for that one property at 1352-1354 from years 2007 to 2019, the refuse bills have not been paid. So they owe over $12,000 just on that property alone. And then the other property that they have on Sanderson Avenue at 1360 Sanderson , there's $9,600 overdue in refuse bills spanning from 2003 to 2019. So these are not responsible property owners. And I'm well aware that this is a widespread problem throughout our City and something that we have not solved that I am very interested in working on because we need to have pride in our City. We need to make sure that property owners, especially ones that are renting out to other people are responsible . Not only that, but I think they also said the renters previously told -- the tenants previously told them that they had paid a fee for garbage to the owners but then the owners didn't pay the garbage fees. So how that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 works, I have no idea. And it's just frustrating to see, you know, a lot of neighbors , a lot of people trying to maintain their properties and to have this going on in streets . And I want to make sure that something is done about it. So I would like if Mrs. Reed could send correspondences , one for 1358 Sanderson Avenue as I mentioned earlier asking if that condemned property is planned for demolition and for any updates regarding it and then updates on 1348 -- or, I'm sorry, 1352 and 1354 Sanderson Avenue if there is anything going on with those properties . And this also brings to mind the assessment that we hired Barry Isett for the LIPS Department and I would like to make a motion to request an update from both LIPS and from Barry Isett regarding the department review and where we were with that. We did have a holdup with the contract s being signed that I remember . There was a delay from when the new Mayoral administration took over. And those were signed and were suppose d to be started on as of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 March 2nd. And 3 months or 12 weeks from March 2nd was yesterday . So I think we've had enough time. And although a lot has happened in March and April with COVID-19, I don't think that that should have prevented any work on this review. So I would like to see an update on that. And I'd also like there to be a deadline included in that request for one week from today which will be the second of June. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. We have a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, Councilman Donahue seconded it. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , would we just be able to add to that request too if just to see if, you know, the current pandemic has affected the deliverable on that contract at all meaning the timetable of it? And because I think a part of that was suppose d to be for them to send in people anonymously to go through different processes within LIPS to assess it that way. And I don't know how the deliverable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 has been affected by that. So that would be my only addition to that request is just, you know, has their timeline changed at all, you know, due to the pandemic . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. No? Or Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. That's all for my comments and motions . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just a few. Just to followup -- just a couple followups on some of my requests from last week. I want to thank Chief Graziano for getting back to me with an update on the status of the Serrenti Center. He responded that to date, the roof has been replaced and the exterior of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 building has been sealed and some mortar repair completed . Currently the plumbers are completing the new water service in the building which should be completed this week. There is a signed contract in place for interior work which involves painting, new ceiling tiles, floor refinishing , trim work, etc. So far all the above costs are covered by grants and the final portion of the project is the heating and air conditioning upgrade s for the office area. There was already heat in the open bay area. This is suppose d to be covered by the City Energy Project Funding which the Chief understands has been delayed . In the meantime , we, meaning the police and fire department are currently utilizing the building for our specialty equipment storage and for some training purposes . Even though there's a signed contract and funding in place for the interior work, that work ideally would not be completed until after the heating and air conditioning work is completed . However , right now we're waiting on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the funding for that specific work before we can be 100 percent complete . Please let me know if there's anything that's needed. Mrs. Reed, would we just be able to see what the delay is in the City Energy Project Funding ? MS. REED: Sure. Yes, Councilman Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And then just another followup from last week. I know we haven't received a response regarding the status of Northeast Revenue . But I would just like to reiterate my position that it's completely unconscionable that a company is still under contract with the City, a company that was named in multiple federal indictments regarding political corruption and pay to play schemes . I know this Council requested that they be terminated immediately about nine months ago and we're still here today. And they're still under contract as far as we know. A couple questions I have that I hope Mrs. Reed could pass along to the Fire Chief, the first is in an article that appeared 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 in the May 17th edition of the Sunday Times regarding sick time request for City police and firefighters staying flat despite the current pandemic . There was a paragraph in the article that stated City firefighters are restricted to the fire station that they were assigned to at the time the March 13th plan went into effect. But the administration is -- also been browning out Truck 4 on North Main Avenue or shutting that station down on days when there is not enough firefighter s to meet the minimum manning requirements . And those are usually filled by calling someone in for overtime . And I think that's why they are being browned out because they're trying to control the overtime fund. On days when Truck 4 is shut down, it's my understanding that the remaining firefighters are all assigned to different firehouses throughout the City. So just to me, those two things sort of contradict one another . So I would just like to send a request to the Fire Chief asking to clarify how that's being handled . Also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 another one for the Fire Chief, for over two years I requested time and again a copy of the City's Emergency Management Plan without any response only to find out at the end of last year that the City didn't actually have an Emergency Management Plan. This is not the fault of the current administration or the current Fire Chief. But it was my understanding that the new administration was going to begin the process of develop ing a plan. So I would just like to request a progress report from the Fire Chief on where we're at in regards to the development of that plan. I'm only asking because respond ing to any sort of natural disaster presents its own set of challenges and normal times. But those challenges will be dramatically increased if God forbid, you know, the City would have any sort of natural disaster and have to respond to that in the middle of a pandemic . So I just want to make sure that we're prepared on that front. And then finally , since the City is still in Act 47, every year the City has to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 petition the Court of Common Pleas for approval to triple the LST Tax. A hearing was set -- or originally set on the City's petition for March 19th. But that hearing has been delayed a few times because the Courts have been closed because of the current pandemic . The problem with that then becomes the City is technically not authorized to collect the LST starting May 1st which goes into one-third of the year. So you're collect ing that one-third you're initially authorized to collect , but then we still have to get the permission to collect the other two-thirds. So it's my understanding I believe that the administration was putting the funds collected since May 1st into an escrow account until a hearing is held. So I'd just like to request from the administration a balance of that account to date and also regular updates on that account balance until that petition is heard and a hearing is scheduled . And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comment s. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 first is good news that Council received . We had a resident of the Hill Section who wrote to Council to express her gratitude and offered accommodation to the tree removal crew and the workers of the Scranton DPW from May 11th to May 13th. The removed a dying center rotted tree which threatened this woman's home and vehicles for 23 and a half years. She states in her letter that the workers were courteous , friendly , professional , punctual and funny is always good. She writes please extend appreciation , accommodation , kudos in recognition for the lovely job they did with such kindness and grace. She would like us to recognize these men, Supervisor Chris Jenkins , Crew Chief Kevin Eiden, the crew, Max Sensi -- I hope I'm pronouncing his last name right, Bruce Fenton, Judd Roth, Ryan Benjamin , and Justin Krukowski. And she states, in this type of shutdown and pandemic , they truly stood up and did a phenomenal job. So I also want to thank them. That's always good to hear. And they do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 a wonderful job. I also want to say that my thought s and my prayers really go out to the family that lost their home in the plot to that tragic fire. Thank God that no lives were lost. But from what I understand , it was a close call on several fronts. So again, my thoughts go out to that family and all those families in that area who were affected and who had damage to their home. And I would like to thank the fire department who did a wonderful job and the neighbor s who stepped up to help out other neighbors . I have a few quality of life concerns that I received from residents that I'll pass along to Mrs. Reed. Resident of East Mountain is concerned about the catch basins covered with debris. So we'll send that along to DPW. 358 Ferdinand Street, I received multiple calls about quality of life issues at that property . One of the things that I did want to mention that I think we should keep in mind -- and I know I was talking to Dr. Rothchild earlier today about this is once the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 warm weather starts, Council gets numerous requests from the public in terms of quality of life issues. And I had a conversation with Tom Oleski who is the Director of Licensing and Inspections . And the one thing that I would like people to remember out there is they're taking all the concern s that are coming their way and they are prioritizing them. But they're -- since staff was furloughed , they're not at full capacity . So they're being inundated with request s and they are trying to get to them as expeditiously as possible . But that is taking, you know, somewhat longer than they would like. Also 1452 West Locust Street, if we can just check in with DPW to see if the issues there have been taken care of yet. I also want to just once again talk very briefly about the pandemic and the coronavirus . One hundred fifty-five people in our community in our county have tragically passed away from this virus. And even though it seems the cases are going down and we are moving, I guess, into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 the yellow phase relatively soon from the red phase, this is still a very serious issue. The one thing that I want to say to people that may be watching this meeting tonight and may be listening to it is that there are agencies and there are people out there who are willing to help you. One of the tragedies of this virus along with the death and economic destruction it's caused, is the destruction it caused on people who don't have other family members with them or to take care of them. Reading the paper today really broke my heart. Some of the tragic stories of people who are, you know, dying alone without anyone around them, whether it's from the coronavirus or just of natural causes or another disease . We may not see it as Council members . We may not see it because , you know, I live with my wife and my children . I'm able to communicate with people and my neighbor s and being outside . But there are an awful lot of elderly people who live alone who don't have the ability to communicate as often as they would like. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And that really is one of the great tragedies of what's gone on here because they're alone. But what I would like to tell people is that there is help out there for them. And they don't have to be alone. If they're hungry or they need help, they need some kind of support, there are several resources and I want to mention them. And this has driven home to me today because I got a call from a very lovely woman who lives in Mulberry Towers who watches ECTV and watches the Council meeting s and gets a lot of information from these meetings . So if you are in need of any sort of social service , if you are out there and you're watching and you don't have somebody to talk to, you're lonely, you're sick, whatever the case may be, you need food, you need help with something , you could pick up your phone and dial 211. And that will get you to someone to help you. You could also call 570-348-4101. That's the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office is taking any and all requests and will kind of funnel you to the right place if you need help. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Also, if you do have access to a computer , you could e-mail Scranton 311@scrantonpa .gov. I do have to say that the Mayor and her administration has been very responsive to people who have e-mailed me the address there and needed help in whatever form or fashion . And if you do have a computer and you could get to our City website www.scrantonpa .gov, there are a number of resources there. There's a whole resource guide for people. There's a whole section on food resources , resources for your utilities . So again, I know that the numbers may be going down and we're moving from one phase to another , but there are still people who need help. And I know that in my neighborhood and in other neighborhoods throughout the City, you know, people are checking on those who are elderly in their neighborhood who may not have the resources that we all have. So, you know, I'm really pleased with what I've been seeing as a community in terms of us sticking together and trying to ride this one out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 And finally , yesterday as everybody knows was Memorial Day. I want to thank all of our veterans for their service and sacrifice , especiall y my dad who served in the United States Marine Corps. So Semper Fi to him. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONSTRUCTION EASEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF SCRANTON AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ALLOW THE CITY TO ENTER THE PROPERTY TO REMOVE, REPLACE , AND MAINTAIN A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE FOUNDATION AND BASE OF WHICH ARE LOCATED ON THE PROPERTY AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE CONSTRUCTION EASEMENT ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT “A”. (EMERGENCY CERTIFICATE ATTACHED ). MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , for those of you who may have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 been watching the caucus tonight , I just want to take a brief second to explain what this legislation is. There's a traffic light at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Linden Street. This legislation is authorizing the City to be able to go on the property of the University of Scranton to replace and maintain that traffic light and to move the traffic light back so that it's not in the way of traffic , which has over the last few years cars have actually driven into this pole and caused some real destruction there and some safety issues. So this is a busy intersection . This issue is a major hazard. So the plan is to place the light set back further from the roadway as quickly as possible to protect our citizens .

DONAHUE : I make a motion to suspend the rules and have -- to move Item 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Orders based on the attached emergency certificate . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I would just like to request to the administration maybe try to get some of these resolution s down quicker without the emergency certificate attached . I mean, if it's about, you know, responding to the current pandemic , I have no problem with it. But I don't want to get -- Council to get in the habit of approving these things with an emergency certificate . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Okay.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING SECTION 13 (AS AMENDED BY ORDINANCE NO. 29, 1994 AND ORDINANCE NO. 195, 2003) OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENTITLED “APPROPRIATION ” IN ORDER TO REQUIRE COUNCIL ’S APPROVAL PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER OF AN UNEXPENDED BALANCE OF AN APPROPRIATION ITEM TO FUND A NEW JOB CLASSIFICATION OR INCREASE THE BUDGETED SALARY OF A JOB CLASSIFICATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this legislation as I mentioned in the caucus tonight is simply amending the Administrative Code to require City Council 's approval prior to the transfer of any unexpended balance of a line item in the budget, whether it's to fund a new job classification or to increase the budgeted salary of a job classification .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 And there's really two goals here. Number one, it's very important to me that this Council and any future Councils -- so those who will come after us here to maintain our role as a check and a balance to the Mayor and administration so any future -- this Mayor and administration and future Mayors and their administration . It's also very important that the public have a say in the changes that are going to be made in terms of increasing salaries and adding position s outside of the budgetary approval process that we all go through in November . So this legislation accomplishes both of those goals. And I want to thank Solicitor Hayes for drafting it. And I'm please to be voting for it tonight . Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I would like to mirror your comment s and agree with all of them and thank Mr. Hayes for the work he's done on this and thank Council for pushing this through and thank Mr. Hayes for the other work that he's doing for us as well. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I mean, I like the fact that we'll have the power or maybe I shouldn 't say power. But, you know, when there's money left over or there's extra money, why does it have to go to a salary or create a position ? Why can't we just have some saving for once -- realize these savings instead of trying to give it to someone . I'm very happy with this. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.
