MR.ROGAN:Yes,before Igetinto theBoscov loanissue,twopositive items I'dliketomention .Earlier thisweek whileleaving ameetingatcityhallIran intostudents fromtheUniversity of Scranton ,firstyearfreshman whoweredoing atourofScranton ,andthetiming wasvery wellandthemayorandmyself wereoutside andwewereabletospeaktothestudents andletthemknowaboutmanyofthegreat things thatareavailable intheCityof Scranton outside ofjustbeingonthe University ofScranton campus soIenjoyed theopportunity tospeaktothosestudents . Also,thesamedayWNEPdidavery nicestoryaboutbusinesses inthedowntown, newbusinesses relocating tothedowntown1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 andexpansions .Itwasverynicetoseea positive storyaboutthecitydowntown ,and ifyoulookatwhat'shappened it'sreally allstarted withthemall,withJohn Basalyga 'sinvestment inthecityandweare starting toseethatsnowballeffect. Thepaving thathasbeeninthe downtown aswellascertainly gonealong waytowards making thedowntownmore friendlyforpeople tocommute inand,you know,thereismuchmoreworktobedonebut thereisalotofprogressonthatfront. Getting intotheBoscov issue,as lastweekIbrought upanumber ofquestions regarding we'llcallitBoscov's,they're technically called Steamtown MallPartners andSteamtown MallAssociates ,buttheyare loansinregards totheSteamtown Malland AlBoscov asnotedwastheprincipal on thesepartner ships. Sothefirstquestion wasregarding theamount thatwasowedintotaltothe CityofScranton andit'slisted as Steamtown MallPartner saround $22,700,000. Steamtown MallAssociates is$4,638,000for1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 agrandtotalof$27,332,000.Inaddition tothat$27million ,thereisanadditional Boscov Section 108loanfor2008whichwasa principle loanof$3million .Thecurrent balance onthatloanisaround $2.5million ofthatloancurrently Boscov'sispaying thatcorrectly toHUDanditiscurrent but ifthereisdefault onthatloanthecity hasguaranteed thatloanastheyhavethe otherSection 108loans. Thesecond question wasprovide a breakdownofeachloan,whichIwillget intowhenIgiveittothespreadsheetin thebackhere.Thenextquestion was regardingthe108swhichthecityis responsible forpaying back,again,Iwill gettothatinoneminute.And,finally , whichwasoneofthemorepressing questions thatmyself andIknowsomeofmycolleagues raised aswellwashaveanydonations been received fromMr.Boscov andifsoinwhat frequency ? Andthereplythatwereceived is that"Scranton 'sOfficeofEconomic and Community Development hasnoknowledge of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 theCityofScranton receiving donations fromtheSteamtown MallPartners ,the Steamtown MallAssociates and/orBoscov's Department storeotherthanthepersonal contributions fromaBoscov'sDepartment StoreonDecember 4r,2014,intheamount of $713,00topayforanoverdue Section 108 loanthatwasownedbytheSteamtown Mall Partners .Thatamount wasaround $613,000 inprincipal and$102,000ininterest ." Sosincethatonegoodfaith donation hasbeenmadetothecitythere hasn'tbeenanyelsethatfollows . Asabreakdown oftheloans,asI mentioned ,therearetwotypesofloansthat areinvolved here.Thereisonetypewhere ifthey'redefaulted uponthecityisnot responsible forpaying them,butwedolose thatprogramming income coming intoloan outtoothersmallbusinesses orforother projects within thecity.Thesecond type ofloan,whichismuchmoredetrimental to thecitywherethey'redefaulting onthe Section 108loans,andthetiming forthis isverycoincidental thattonight weare1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 alsointroducing the2017Community Development andBlockGrantfunding ,whichI willgetintoinaminute,aspayment for oneoftheseSection 108loansthathasbeen unpaid.Sonottogointotoomuchbecause thereisquiteanumber ofloansherethat havebeenpaidoff,refinanced ,ifyou remember Ibelieve itwasmysecond yearon council Mr.Boscov cameinorhesent attorneys inasking forIcalled ita bailout,others called itaremodification ofhisloansomanytimestheseloanshave changed theformtheywerein,sothe current totalthatthecityiseither outor onthehookis$27million butthatcould increase toalmost $30million ifthe Boscov'sloan,108loanthatiscurrent is notpaid. Sothatisthetotalofwherewe currently standregarding theBoscov's loans,andIdothink,andmycolleagues agree,weshould sendcorrespondence to Mr.Boscov asking iftherewillbeany future donations madetothecityaswas promised atthecaucus thatcitycouncil had1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 thatMr.Boscov waslooking forforfuture loans. MR.PERRY:TheonlyitemthatI wouldjustliketoaddisifwewouldcould seewhattimeframewhenthenextdonations wouldbemade. MR.ROGAN:Absolute ly,andIalways saythisandsometimes people willstopme onthestreets andsayI'mbeingtoohardon Mr.Boscov,andIalways preface my statements withIsayhehasagreatstore. Idon'tthinkthereisanyone thatcouldsay thatBoscov'sisn'toneofthebeststores inthearea,butthestores andhis financial dealings withtheCityofScranton aretwocompletely different things.Ihave longbeenaBoscov shopper ,iftheseloans continue togounpaid andthetaxpayers are outmillions ofdollars Ithinkitwillbe hardformyself andmanypeople intheCity ofScranton tocontinue shopping at Boscov's.

MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou.Just afewitems.LastweekIaskedwhen Colliery Avenue andCedaravenue wouldbe pavedduetotheextensive pavecutsthat havetakenplaceonthesetworoadsandon thepavecutinspector informed usthatthe utility companies wouldbepaving both streets inthespring.Iwashoping thatit wouldbedoneearlier because Ibelieve that thisisgoingtomakeforroughtravel during thewinter. Councilmen Wechsler andIattended atmeeting inthe400blockofPhelps Street inregard totheflooding thathasoccurred1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 therethisweek--orrather theflooding thatoccurred previously ,weattended the meeting thisweek.Thedamage tothisblock isabsolutely astounding andunacceptable . People lostcars,therewerecarsthatare floating downthestreet,waterheaters , boilers ,andmanyotherthings thatcannot bereplaced .Togiveyouanexample , Pantuso corners ,whichisrightonthe corner there,hadwellover$200,000in damage andaswestoodthereonthatblock myheartbrokeforthosepeople because they literally havenorecourse whatsoever .They can'tgetfloodinsurance because theyare notnearabodyofwaterandalotoftheir insurance doesn'tcovermanyofthethings thattheylostandsomeofthedeductibles areabsolutely ridiculous . Councilman Wechsler andIinvited AJ Magnotta tothemeeting whoworksasan engineer onbehalf oftheSewerAuthority andheexplained whatsomeoftheissues wereinthisarea.Apparently ,theyneedto doanextensive cleaning ofoneofthelines thatmaybeblocked andcausing theflooding1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 butthismaytakemonths because ofbidding procedures .I'dliketofindoutifthere isawaythatwecanpossibly speedthis process because thesepeople cannot afford togethitwithanother disaster . Also,weneedtoinvestigate if thereisfunding available tothesepeople torecoup someoftheirlosses andforthat matter allpeople across Scranton whohave lostmanydifferent things withsomeofthe disastrous flooding .Thisisanabsolute tragedy thathashappened tothisblockand thesepeople andhopefully something canbe donetohelpthemout. Wealsorequested thatPPLgoout andcutthetreesinthe400blockofPhelps Street.Thereislotofdifferent hazards andhopefully PPLcangetoutthereandcut thosebacksotheycangetoffofthelines. Iwasinformed thisweekby Mr.Wechsler thatthemayorwillnotbe attending acaucus incouncil chambers to giveusastateofthecityupdate.Heis apparently working onhisstateofthecity address andwillgiveitatsomepointto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 theChamber ofCommerce . Imentioned thisbefore therecess, butIthinkthatthemayorneedstositdown andreview thequality oflifeticketing programinthecity.Irequested lastJuly howmanytickets hadbeenissued todatein 2016andtheamount ofmoneyhasbeen collected asaresult ofthesecitations , andIdidreceive theinformation andthe numbers seemtoextremely low.Justtogive youanexample ,January 53tickets ,February 65tickets ,May87tickets ,sowearenot issuing asmanytickets asIthought we should bebasedonthecomplaints weget everyweekfrompeople intheneighbor hoods aboutallofthethings thataregoingon. Webudgeted $42,500anditdoesn'tlooklike wearegoingtohitthatamount. Now,saying that,Idon'tbelieve thatthisprogram isjustaboutgiving people aticket sothatthecitycancollect themoney.Rather,findoutwhatthe problem isandtrytoworkwiththeperson togetitcleaned upandkeepour neighborhoods clean.Oneofthethings that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Imentioned thatIthinkhasbeendone before anditwasverysuccessful is saturation patrols withallcityinspectors , police department ,andtheneighborhood groups,sofocusononesection ofthecity instead ofkeeping theinspectors spread out.Ibelieve youcanmakemoreofimpact thatway. SoIdefinitely thinkthatthereare moreefficient waysthatthisprogram canbe successful andwecanaccomplish someof thesegoals. I'dliketothanktheDPWfortaking careofaverydangerous situation onOlive Streetthatwasimpeding pedestrian traffic . Theycleared somebrushtherethatblocked . Itwasverydangerous forstudents from Lackawanna College traveling downtothe stadium andtoScranton HighSchool students . Also,aswasmentioned ,council received theRFPforapreliminary storm wateranalysis andproposals willbeopened Monday,October 31,at10a.m.incouncil chambers .AndthatisallIhavethisweek.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr. Gaughan .Thisevening mycomments are really goingbeingbasically following up pretty muchoneverything thatwassaidby mycolleagues ,verywellspokenasitwas. Mr.Perrymentioned thestormwater planandtheSewerAuthority plan.Ithink asacitygovernment ,andespecially administration working withcouncil ,iswe really havetostartseparating thesayof SewerAuthority andthestormwater management plan.ThesaleoftheSewer Authority isonatrackofit'sownandit's either goingtobesuccessful orit'snot goingtobesuccessful ,thepowers thatbe willdecide that.Thestormwater management issueisourproblem .Thecity holdsthestormwaterpermit andit'supto usascitygovernment officials togetthis planmoving either thePlanAworking with thenewownersoftheSewerauthority or PlanBworking onourownorPlanCworking withsometypeofhybrid agreement between thenewowners,oldowners andthecity.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Butweareseeing --starting tosee problems withtheneighborhoods as Mr.Gaughan andIsawandpartofthe problems thatweareseeing iseventhough weheartonight thereisnothing happening inthecity,therearealotofdevelopment s nowinthecitythatarecausing more parking lotstobebuiltandmorebuildings tobebuiltandtheyareimpacting theold, obsolete system thatwehaveinourhomes. Following uponMr.Gaughan 's comments ,whenwewereoveronPhelps Street thisweekend --thisweek,I'msorry,the thingthatstruck meisthesearejust working people.Thereisno--wehearfrom thepodium allthetimeaboutspecial interests andweareonlyserving thisone andwe'reserving thatone,Icanhonestly saythatIhavenevermetoneofthese people atpolitical function sandneverseen thematapolitical function ,don'tknowif they're"R","D's,"I's"ornotregistered atall,butwhenyoutalktothemtheygoto workandtheyfearthatwhentheycomehome theirproperty isn'tgoingtobethereor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 whentheygotobedatnighttheyfearthat theycan'twakeupintimetogodownand rescue theirvehicles andtheirproperties . Thesearethepeople thatneedarehelp. Thesearethepeople thatweneedtomake surearetakencareof. Oneofthequestions thatcameup whilewewerethere,andIamgoingto request thatwegetincontract with Director Barrett ,ifthereisapossibility thattheSewerAuthority isputting offwork whilewaiting forthesaleoftheSewer authority theseproblems existtoday,and justasIsaid,wehavetostartlooking at thiscitywhether intermsofwhereweare today,notiftheSewerauthority issoldor notiftheSewerauthority issold.That wouldbeverydisappointing tohearthat thereareprojects beingdelayed whilethe SewerAuthority iswaiting toseetheir status withtheSewerAuthority because thesepeople needtobeserved.

Also,following uponMr.Rogan's comments aboutthegoodnewsinthecity. Onceagain,wehearhowbadthings arenow, beingaccused ofnotbeinginthe neighborhoods ,councilmen areinthe neighborhoods allofthetime.Idon'tsee thespeakers whereI'mat,Idon'tseethem thereandweareallintheneighborhoods . OnSaturday ,Councilman EvansandI andthemayorweattended aunityrallyat themallthat,youknow,thosepeople weren'tthere.WewereattheSweeney benefit wherethereweresomanypeople theretheyranoutofraffle tickets to sell.Onceagain,anoutpouring ofpeople positive andthemajority ofthosepeople wereScrantonians there,dedicated1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Scrantonians trying tohelpafriend and theywillcomeoutwhenyouneedthem,so maybeIhappen togotodifferent places and getabetter feelforthenegativity out there,butIreally believe ifsomeofour people thatarenotseeing agoodtheyneed togetoutandtrytogotosomeofthe places wheregoodthings arehappening .
