Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Lee Morgan spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any comments or motions tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Just on something Marie brought up. Back in June after Marie discovered the Electric City classification had not been changed to taxable from tax exempt, I did send a letter to the county deputy director of assessments asking the following questions : Why was the Electric City garage's tax clarification never changed from an exempt to taxable ? Has a countywide review after all tax exempt properties ever been performed to insure they meet the requirements of a tax exempt classification . And what, if anything , is being done to recoup taxes that were not paid on the property for 2016 and 2017. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I have still not yet received a response so, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send a follow-up letter to Mr. Foley posing those questions again? Could you also copy each commissioner on that? I'd also attended a South Side neighborhood meeting last week so I will be forwarding along their concerns to the proper departments . This afternoon I received a petition to revoke, appeal outdoor patio at Jo-Jo's at the Donkey from residents of the Plot so I will be passing that along. I gave copies to my colleagues and also be forwarding it to the administration . And, lastly, with regard to Mr. Hinton's proposed coffee shop at Nay Aug Park, the mayor still hasn't weighed in or stated his position on the issue. I think the citizens of this city deserve to know what the mayor's position on this issue is so I would like to make a motion for council to send a letter to the mayor asking what his position in regards to Mr. Hinton's lease of city-owned property for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 purposes of operating a coffee shop while also continuing to serve as Director of Licensing and Inspections , does he believe that is ethical , and will he allow this to happen? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor and a second, on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I agree with Councilman Donahue 's motion for several reasons . First of all, you know, we have asked for the mayor, you know, what the mayor thinks about this. Don't forget this is the mayor's employee . He is not covered under a collective bargaining agreement . I approached the mayor about this situation about a month half ago and he told me it was a personnel issue just like he has given the same answer to the local media, which is ridiculous . It's time for the mayor to stop evading his responsibility as an elected official and give an answer. Is he going to let this happen under his watch. A city employee running a coffee shop out of a public building at a public park, which I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 find ridiculous . Also, on top of that, I had sent a letter to Mr. Hinton who said he wants to be open and transparent about this process August 13 and then again on September 5 asking several questions , additional questions about the lease with the Recreation Authority , still have not received a response . So if the mayor and Pat Hinton would stop hiding and give answers and be transparent as they said they would be, and if the mayor could come forward and give a statement to this council about his opinion if he is going to let this happen and if he agrees with it and where has been over the past few years with an announcement that this was going to take place, I would appreciate it and I think my colleagues would appreciate it. And if he continues to ignore this council I think it is a dereliction of duty. He sends legislation down from the law department every week that he excepts this council to vote on, yes when we ask him a very, very simple question you can hear a pin drop. He 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 doesn't respond . So it's time for the mayor to come forward , give his an answer. If he agrees with it, I don't agree with it, but that's fine, but give us an answer. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question , we did discuss this, not the motion but the coffee shop idea several weeks ago and, you know, I was on the record where I don't believe it -- it doesn't pass the eye test but it is as of right now all done legally , but as I would be in favor of sending a letter to the mayor and asking his opinion on it as well. We have all weighed in our opinion on it, so I would only think it would be fair for his as well and we can see where it goes from there. MR. EVANS: I might as well weigh in. As I have stated before, I was extremely disappointed that the mayor allowed this to get this far so I think it's appropriate to send a letter and get his opinion on the matter once and for all. MR. PERRY: We have a motion on the floor. All those in favor signify by saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments tonight ? MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. Earlier this year, I discussed the importance of the arts to our city. At that time, I stated that I have the utmost respect for the creative class and that we all should appreciate the talents and sacrifices of those that make the arts their calling . This week the 2018 Scranton Fringe Festival begins. There will more than two dozen events spread across at least ten downtown venues. I personally have scheduled these eight shows on my calendar and am looking forward to some very enjoyable experience . The diverse lineup contains everything from children 's programming to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 comedy and improv to some shows with maybe a more mature consent . And, yes, there will be some shows that will dress some timely and maybe controversial issues but isn't that what the arts are all about, sometimes stretching the boundaries, sometimes not, sometimes just entertaining ? At all times we want our art to be thought provoking. But to me it's ultimately about the freedom for all artists , those that paint, those that act, those that dance, those that play music, to express themselves through art and the freedom for the rest of us to decide if we enjoy that expression . As an elected official , we should always strive to rebuff any attempts to stifle, control or minimize the arts and, of course, then there is the monetary sides of the arts. From a purely economic standpoint , embracing the arts just happens to be good business . For a city like ours, the arts creates excitement , commerce , and creativity . So with that said, if you can, please check out the 2018 Scranton Fringe Festival in downtown festival running 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 through September 30 and remember on-street parking in downtown parking is free after 5 p.m. daily and all day and night on Saturday and Sunday, so I'm just saying about that. Some may know I have been attending the meetings as far as the blight task force over the next several months so I would expect some very sound and progressive ideas and suggestions to come out of that task force over the next few months. It will be up to this council to lead on this issue through new and revised legislation . As I have stated many times, in the fight against blight the status quo simply is not working and it's time for new ways to address the negative impact of blight on our city. Some other news, there will be a meeting on October 9 with SAPA and community officials and steering community members to discuss the RFPs for the consultant to undertake zoning ordinances for all of the SAPA communities . At that meeting , the group will decide which consultants should move to the interview process . City planner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Don King has been our designated committee members . Business administration Dave Bulzoni and myself also have regularly attended SAPA meeting s and have been a part of this process . And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I agree with Ms. Schumacher on one point that she made and that's next week at 4:30 with the Aracadis group coming in regarding storm water and the meeting is supposedly being held on the Governor 's Room. You know, I just actually spoke to a gentleman today after I got out of a work about the storm water issues that he is having on his property , and I told him that this group would be coming in and we would be getting an update. Unfortunately , he can't make it down here so I do think, I don't see a reason why Arcadis couldn't come and just give their presentation and council chambers with the cameras rolling because people do watch these meetings , they do pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 attention and this is a major issue that has come up time and time again since I have been on council in the last five years, so I would hope that my colleagues would agree not to have this meeting in council chambers not in the Governor 's Room, for a number of the different reasons . As I just mentioned , number one, more accessible when it's on television . Number two, quite frankly , it's hard to hear. It's hard for the public to attend to hear anything that goes on that room because of acoustics . So I would hope that my colleagues would agree to have that meeting in council chambers and ask ECTV to publicize that because of the importance of the meeting . MR. EVANS: Excuse me, I don't like to interrupt in motions , but I want to comment on that. Originally the thought process was there may be an opportunity that one of the members wouldn't be able to come and we have the ability to do a conference call in the Governor 's Room that we don't have here, so if everybody is in attendance next week and that's not going to play out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 we will certainly ask them, but that was the plan to go in the Governor 's Room just in case we had to have the opportunity to use the phone for the conference facilities . MR. GAUGHAN : The 300 and 400 blocks of Leggett Street in north Scranton , Mrs. Reed and I have been in contact with the Pennsylvania American Water Company about sewage backup, especially discharge when there is a large rainstorm , so I want to thank the Pennsylvania American Water Company , they did go out and cleaned up both blocks be and the sewage that was in people's back yards, and they did send us a letter, and I just want to read a portion of it because this will effect residents in this area. "Currently , Pennsylvania American water company has received all of the regulatory permits necessary to upgrade the sewer system from Leggett Street near the intersection with Leggett 's Creek in north Scranton to Wells Street near the intersection of the Lackawanna river. The project has an approximate cost of $1.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 million and is scheduled to begin construction in November of this year with an anticipated completion date of August 2019. The project will include the replacement and upsizing of more than 5,000 feet of the sewer pipe which once complete will prevent future manhole surcharging issues in this area." So by August 2019 that problem hopefully will be rectified so I appreciate the response from Mr. Hall from the water company . Also, we did get the 2016 fall paving list from DPW that will administered by our Office of Economic and Community Development , so there is a few streets in West Side, South Side and the Hill Section . In West Side we have Washburn Street to Sloan Street, Parrot Avenue and Fellow Street, sections of those areas. South side we have Cedar Avenue from Davis Street to the city line. The 1200 block of Donnelly court. In the Hill section we have Kressler court, 400 block of Mahan court and Wolf court, 500 and 600 block of Forrest court 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 between Ash Street and Myrtle Street, so that should be taking place son. Also, we got a response after the public caucus with OECD last week. We got a response from Mrs. Aebli, and I want to thank her for her quick response . I had asked about the available funds for demolition . Between 2016, 2017 and '18 we have $259,061.51 left in the account for demolition and that's not on top of what they put in for this year. Also, as Mr. Donahue had mentioned , we did receive a petition and I received several complaints on this, on this establishment , down in the plot and I have forwarded those to the Licensing and Inspections Department , but there still is a major issue. So I appreciate the neighbors getting together and putting this petition and hopefully something can come of this and some kind of resolution because these people that live down here are suffering with noise and a lot of other things that are detailed in the petition . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . And I only have one update for today, a couple of weeks ago we had an issue with some misleading signage for some bridges from South Side going into West Side. Since that time, Mr. Pocius and DPW have taken care of it. They have moved signs in a more appropriate place and then have labeled them on which street those signs actually apply to. So, again, I want to thank DPW and Mr. Pocius for the quick turn around on that and that's all I have for this evening . MS. REED: 5-B.

GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Just on the question , I want to remind everybody that this is -- from the beginning of the meeting , we will have a public ear on this next week at 5:45. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ACCOUNT NO. 02.229635 ENTITLED “2018 CAPITAL BUDGET” FOR RECEIVING AND DISBURSING CAPITAL PROJECT FUNDS DESIGNATED IN THE 2018 CAPITAL BUDGET. MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I had a question this afternoon after reading this legislation from Mr. Bulzoni and I just want to read his response . He said, "The capital budget transfer is purely an accounting function . Out of the $2 million assigned to the approved capital budget for 2018, the city has $1,622,849.86 remaining in an account which continues to be classified as a general fund account . The $377,678.25 was used to settle the litigation on the Linden Street property and to acquire the property . The city tried to open a capital budget fund midyear but for whatever reason the accounting system would not allow them to open up a separate fund. They are going revisit the matter at the beginning of the year, but in the interim they are moving those dollars to this special cities account to avoid inclusion in the general fund." Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. PERRY: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A BROWNFIELDS ASSESSMENT COALITION MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF LACKAWANNA , LACKAWANNA COUNTY REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON REGARDING THE PENDING SUBMISSION OF AN INDUSTRIAL SITES REUSE PROGRAM GRANT (ISRP) FOR THE FORMER RSM PROPERTY SITE, WYOMING AVENUE AND LINDEN STREET, SCRANTON , PA. MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I also asked Mr. Bulzoni about this project and I think this will answer Mrs. Schumacher 's questions , the perspective cost of remediation is estimated at $448,000. The 25 percent match is $112,000 which would be the city's responsibility . The ISRP remediation grant will be sought by the county in partnership with the city. The initial plan, according to Mr. Bulzoni , will use part of the $400,000 Keystone Communities Grant allocated to Scranton Tomorrow for remediation . The Commonwealth of the Pennsylvania would not allow Scranton Tomorrow to assign any of those dollars to remediation . Those dollars are for park improvements only as well as the approximate $35,000 received from the Scranton family estate. The city recently received notification of a $50,000 grant from the state specifically to offset those costs of remediation . Notice was recently provided by Larry West, the chief of staff for Senator Blake. The city is working on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 formal grant application . Therefore , the source of the funds for the project would be as follows : $336,000 would come from the Groundfields grant remediation . $50,000 would come from the Keystone community grant. $62,000 from the general fund allocation from the 2019 budget, which is going to be put in there. $400,000 from the Keystone communities grant from Scranton Tomorrow construction and improvements , and then $35,000 from the Scranton family estate for park improvements and that's for a total of $883,000. Mr. Bulzoni said that he does not expect the park improvements will amount to $435,000 since the concept is basically for green space, but they do not have a design yet and, therefore , a cost estimate . So he believes worst case the budget commitment to the project without a grant offset is $62,000. And then he did attach a memo so the timeline it looks like they are looking at a spring 2020 green space park grand opening after all is said and done so I can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 provide you with the documentation on that. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ?
