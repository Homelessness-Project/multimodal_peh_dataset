Itdoesnotmandate anumber,alltheydid wassaythatthetermsofthatcontract were enforceable and,therefore ,thedecision to openthecontract andchange themanning was uptotheunion,nottheCourt. Also,wereceived fromtheSingle TaxOffice,andI'msorry,Ishould have leftthisforMr.Evans,butwedidreceive fromtheSingle TaxOffice anupdateon collections ,andjustveryquickly ,real estate taxesareincreased --year-to-date anincrease is57.8percent ,whichispretty comparable towhatthetaxincrease was,you know,prioryears.Delinquent realestate taxesup11.4percent .LSTup0.8percent , andbusiness privilege andmercantile taxup 1.0percent . Finally ,asfarasthecaucus was concerned andpeople whohave,youknow, criticized having acaucus inthebackroom, it'smyintention thatcouncil members get1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 information thattheyneedinordertomake anintelligent voteand,therefore ,the caucus washeldintheback,itwasopen.
