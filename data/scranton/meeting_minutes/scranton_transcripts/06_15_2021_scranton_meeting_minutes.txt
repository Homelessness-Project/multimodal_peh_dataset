I just have one comment . 3-A is the letter that the Mayor had sent to the Auditor General requesting a performance audit of the Single Tax Office. And 3-B is a letter from the School Board President Katie Gilmartin in support of that. Council received information from the administration in regards to a letter that was sent on June 9th from the Auditor General to Mayor Cognetti in which he thanks the Mayor for her letter and then responds that they have no authority to audit the Scranton Single Tax Office under their primary statutory audit mandates or otherwise . Their authority is strictly limited to taxes that are to be reported and transmitted to the Commonwealth . Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcement s at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one announcement . So the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association will clean the islands on Capouse and Electric Streets weather permitting Saturday morning , June 19th between 9:30 and noon. Anyone interested in help with the cleanup if you could bring your own lawn equipment , please. That is all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. I have two. So first one is the Mary Mother of God Parish in North Scranton is having their annual block party. It's going to look a little different because of the pandemic . They're going to have a drivethrough event that's held at the Holy Rosary church grounds at 316 Williams Street. And that's going to be held Friday, June 18th and Saturday , June 19th, 4 to 8 p.m. on both evening s. There's going to be great food and basket raffles.

And this was advertised in the newspaper twice and this past Sunday. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . I'm happy to announce that the Albright Memorial Library at 500 Vine Street is expanding its hours of operation starting this Sunday, June 20th. It will be open Monday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 through Thursday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and reopening now for Sundays 1 to 5 p.m. In addition , the library is now accepting donations of gently used books, audiobooks, DVDs, and CDs for its future book sale. The next book sale is scheduled for Saturday , July 10th right in front of the library on its sidewalk from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Okay, now old business from questions I submitted the last two weeks. With regard to my prior questions concerning Leach Creek and its allegedly undersized pipe, do you have any information to report on that situation ? You can answer in Fifth Order. Next, anything to report on the City's dispute with Lackawanna County's Tax Claim Bureau with regard to the collection of delinquent property taxes. Did the City's leadership meet with the county to resolve this issue? And if not, is a meeting schedule d for the future? Next, what is the status of the 2020 audit, specifically what is the projected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 completion date and how long will the City continue to pay Rainey and Rainey to do the audit prep work? Next, has the City done anything to ensure it complies with all federal and state COVID-19 guidelines like the county has hired an auditor to do that? That's important . And under the category of new business , I applaud Robert Saul of AHT Insurance for his gift of furniture for the Mayor's office. Have the details on this gift been forwarded to the Ethics Board to ensure it complies with the City's Ethics Code? What is the estimated monetary value of the gift which consists of eight chairs, two tables, one bookcase and two coat racks? Remember , all gifts have to be quantified and approved . Next, I was pleased to see that three of the City's labor agreements are posted on the City's website . Those are the Collective Bargaining Agreements for the Clerical Union, the Police Union and DPW. In the past, there were two additional agreements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 on the website , one for the Single Tax Office and a memorandum of understanding updating the Firefighters Collective Bargaining Agreement . The Scranton Tax Office document and the firefighters ' document are gone. So why are the current labor agreements for the Single Tax Office and the Firefighters Union not posted on the City's website ? Also, are personnel in the Single Tax Office not covered by the Clerical Union's contract ? And next, what is the City doing to ensure that future labor agreements comply with the City's Ethics Code? Are all the unionized employees which are more than 90 percent of the City's workforce exempt from the code? If you read the code, you will see that it specifically says in the event of a conflict between the Ethics Code and Collective Bargaining Agreement , the Collective Bargaining Agreement takes precedence . I see no point in having an Ethics Code for less than 10 percent of the workforce. And since the police and fire contracts are in negotiations right now they expire at the end 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 of this year. That should be addressed so that the two are reconciled and do not conflict . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , residents of Scranton . Last week I came here and I spoke about revisiting the Home Rule Charter . And I still haven't received any written response from the Council or the Mayor at this point. And I did present them before COVID hit with a request for such a response . Now, I want the people in the City of Scranton to understand a couple different things, okay? Government represents you. But we have a President of the United States right now which -- who probably isn't capable of performing his job functions as President and he's tearing the heart out of our country in my opinion . So I brought two documents with me here today, one is the Constitution of Pennsylvania that I think every resident of Pennsylvania should read and understand ; and the other document is the Constitution of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 United States. And not only do I think they should read those documents , but I think they should research them and find out how they were written , okay, and what led to the way they were written because I think this country has very seriously forgotten its history . I mean, considering that the Democratic party is off on a tangent where allegedly systemic racism is everywhere . And I guess it's being put to sleep in a lot of places in this country . And I'd just like to remind also the people here that, you know, we have a state that has decided to defend its own border which is the state of Texas because we have so many people illegal ly crossing our border from countries all over the world. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Morgan -- MR. MORGAN: Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : -- just for a second, can you try to direct your comment s toward City business ? MR. MORGAN: No, I'm not going to (inaudible ) the Courts already ruled on that and this is City business . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. GAUGHAN : This -- no -- MR. MORGAN: No, no, this is City business because anything that happens in America has to do with the City. But if you want City business -- MR. GAUGHAN : There you go. MR. MORGAN: Why haven't you respond ed to my letter in regards to putting the Home Rule Charter on the ballot? The ball's in your court. MR. GAUGHAN : I don't remember receiving that letter. MR. MORGAN: Well, you did. And it's notarize d and the Mayor has one too. So maybe you should have your clerk look for it in your record because I handed it to you. And I -- my question I have for you is, why shouldn 't the resident s of the City have a say in the amount of taxation they pay and their Government ? Because obviously over 30 years this government hasn't functioned for them. Now, you take a look at all of these labor agreements , you know, the police and the fire and the rank and file members of these unions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 need to ask their pension board has the City pension fund ever been totally funded ever in its history ? And if it hasn't, how much value has that fund lost over its history ? And how much has it cut your benefits , okay? But now, let's get back to the President . Now, the President of the United States, we're going to name streets after this man and he won't defend our border? He gets up around the world, he can't remember what he's talking about. I think the major problem we have in this country is that the American people have lost sight on whose country this is. And the government should function for the people but it doesn't. You know, there's a new statistic . The new statistic is that America has more debt than the whole world combined . So when you look at that and you ask yourself why isn't the State of Pennsylvania funding the Scranton School District because the state Constitution said they're obligated to do that; why are we selling people's home if the state isn't going to meet its obligation under the Constitution ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Why does the Council not follow the Home Rule Charter ? Why doesn't it want to put it on the ballot and let the resident s determine what changes they want to make to the government ? But you know what's going to happen, the people are going to have to go out and get signatures . And we're all so concerned about COVID, but you're going to force people to go out and get the signatures they need to put it on the ballot. But yet, you say that you represent the residents ; but you don't want them to make any changes to the government that represent s them. Doesn't make any sense. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident . First off, well, less than two weeks ago we had our street sign replaced. So I thank Councilman Donahue for getting that taken care of. They put a whole brand new sign up, so really good. Next thing, I wasn't going to come here tonight but I bumped into a neighbor of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 mine the other day, asked me if I was coming. I said no. But then he told me two neighbors parked in front of the house the wrong way for like five minutes and both of them got $25 tickets . I said, oh, that's ridiculous . I said that happened to me a couple years ago. And I came and paid it all in change. I said to the person, I said, what is wrong with parking in the wrong direction ? Yeah, well, it's a safety thing because if you're parked the wrong way then you got to look both ways. Well, if we're so concern ed about safety, why don't they take care of where the University of Scranton kids park? And Norma Jeffries brought this up a couple weeks ago. Before the pandemic , I worked for over two years at CK Auto. And I went up and down Vine Street a bunch of -- many times a day. And all the signs -- these kids are parked right up to the corner. And I brought this up before COVID, you know I came here. They're parked right to the corner. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 And a couple years ago before COVID hit again, I told one of the parking enforcement people from that area and nothing 's been done. I go by there, see the same vehicle in the same spot for days right to the corner, no tickets on the car. So if they're so concerned about safety, work on the Hill Section by the University . Don't bother the people in Tripp Park that are taxpayer s when these nontax paying kids are getting away with murder. That's a safety hazard. Going up and down Vine Street you're taking your life in your own hands. You have to stop at the stop sign and just edge out because you can't see because they're right to the corner. So let's let -- and one of these people that just got a ticket is one of my neighbor s a 40-year fireman . So that's the respect he's shown. Next thing, a few weeks ago I bumped into a City employee , long story short, this person told me they basically don't have health insurance . I said, What do you mean? They said, Well, I have health insurance but the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 deductible is $7,000. I said, What? So the person said she -- they basically don't have health insurance because they have a $7,000 deductible . That's ridiculous . How can our City have employees pay the first $7,000 of their health insurance ? I don't think any of you up there would be able to do that. It's outrageous . Lastly, Councilman Gaughan , you brought up about the landfill . You said you were disappointed and I hear all these other people say they're disappointed . But nobody has a solution . Where is our garbage going to go if they don't expand the landfill ? Are we just going to throw it out on the streets ? Nobody has a solution . Where do they expect our garbage to go? And I was talking to one of the guys that picks up my garbage every Monday and he said the same thing. He agrees with me. Where do these people expect our garbage to go to if they don't expand the landfill ? Do you have an answer, Councilman Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Look at what they do in other parts of the country , out in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 California , out west they are almost down to zero waste. There's ways you could be creative . I'm not saying that it will end tomorrow . You're going to need for -- certainly for the next few years. But to allow the expansion to go on for decades the size of the Empire State Building and we're taking everybody else's trash, I have four small children . Do you think I want a landfill to be the symbol for the northeast Pennsylvania to be the symbol for Dunmore and Scranton in this region? It benefits one family. It does not benefit anybody else in this region. It's time to look at other avenues rather than taking everybody else's trash from out of state and dumping it in our backyard because -- to benefit one family. I think it's outrageous . So I'm not thinking of myself now -- MR. SPINDLER : Maybe we should stop taking garbage from other states. And sending it to California does not sound really feasible . MR. GAUGHAN : I didn't say sending it to California . I said look at what those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 states are doing with their waste. There are other ways to look at this. We have to look at other avenues rather than just dumping it in our backyard . MR. SPINDLER : All these people that complain , I don't hear them -- all they do is complain . I don't hear any solutions . Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is John White. MR. WHITE: John White, beautiful historic hill. Good evening , Doctor and gentlemen . I hope all of you -- I hope you and everyone you love is safe and healthy -- excuse me. As I do that I think of my first point, a suggestion , whatever . One of them was I wonder if we can't have a box of tissues here and a clock there so nobody thinks you're cheating them on time -- one with a secondhand . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we have one right there that -- MR. WHITE: Right there so I could see it. MR. GAUGHAN : There's one right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 there. Could you see the one on the dais? MR. WHITE: There would be better just saying. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. WHITE: The road -- my avenue hasn't been cleaned , washed. But it's understandable the paving crews are staging their equipment there. And the avenue is going to be beautiful actually , Wheeler Avenue. But I hope when it's all done to keep it beautiful that it could be cleaned once a week. And again, University of Scranton I'm sure if they're watching this tonight are ready and willing to help the City out to do that if for whatever reason we can't do it on our own. The noise has decreased drastically in the hill where am I. I thank you for that for whatever intervention you did do. Stipp Court is looking good. Looks like the neighbors there are keeping it clean and that's a good thing. But it seems to me like most of our speakers speak about macro issues, budgets , policies , all of that stuff. I tend to look at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 micro issues, individual , neighborhood stuff like that. So what I consider a dangerous situation at Wyoming and Lackawanna continues . The little green man -- little white man, whatever color he is comes up for pedestrian crossing . But going south on Lackawanna Avenue you could make a left, and I think I told you a few weeks ago I picked a woman up that -- she wasn't hit but she was frighten ed and went down. And the guy -- person, whatever just kept on going. And I did mention on Jefferson and Linden there's an automatic little white man that comes up with -- in the crosswalk . And you could jaywalk . You could dance across if you wanted to. And students do dance in the jaywalking situation . It's kind of fun to watch. And it's safe. It's safe. Wyoming and Lackawanna isn't. So, jeez, I guess I don't have anything else. Thanks for all your hard work. Keep well and safe. And if I could yield time to the next person I would do that. I don't think I could but thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Ronnie Ellman, Council , also known as fat Ronnie lately. I ran into the Mayor downstairs . The first time I ever seen her. She's a pleasant lady. You know, in the paper last Friday was an advocation I guess you could say, a reassessment . It was devoid of the facts. I think it was misleading . As I've said and people said before me, the only reason for reassessment is to raise taxes, period. It gives a false impression to what the City is worth. And we already -- we already were told this like 2 million dollars from Gerard Cross. He never upped it since he made that statement last year. You know, reassessment like I said before it's only going to hurt minorities , poor, what we consider lower income neighborhoods . And soon as one of these LLC's take over a property , there's your decline of the whole neighborhood . You can go down Wayne Avenue and see it. A year ago -- a little over a year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 ago on Wayne and School Street was an apartment building . I don't know how many of you know where Wayne is, but I've taken it a lot of times to go to Parker Street. A year ago this building looked nice. Now it's loaded up with really low caliber people. It looks like a dump out front, junk cars and a boat. This is what happens to every single neighborhood these LLC's are getting away with murder in the City. They live on loopholes. They thrive on loopholes. And you people are in a position to end it. You know, they -- there's -- LLCs buy a property and they drag things out for a year or two while it's rented. And the rest of us have to pay our money. This needs to be challenged somehow . I don't know the legalities . But it can be stopped . I'd like to say one other thing real quick. I was talking to a Taylor policeman at the Price Chopper in Taylor Saturday or Sunday. And he told me you could still get a free gun lock. There isn't an excuse in the world for these children or anyone being injured or worse when you could get a free gun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 lock. And it ought to be some kind of city or state law that they have to have a gun lock on these pistols . One other thing, I was at the Dollar Store a couple weeks ago with my old wooden cane that I've had, I don't know, over 10 years. And I noticed it wasn't in my basket. So Rosie went to the cashier . And the cashier said -- a senior lady I should say walked out with it under her arm. What kind of low life would steal somebody 's cane? It couldn't have fallen out of the basket. Now it's sort of funny but at the time I was really -- just makes you wonder about people sometime s. And about the guns, I know there is some kind of law requiring -- needed. We hear about this all the time, almost every day about an accidental shooting . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Voldenberg , can you track down Mr. Ellman's cane for next week? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Kidding . David Dobrzyn , next speaker .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Last week we got off on trash fees. And I seem to have had trouble finding ordinances and stuff. I'll handle that later. I'll have to go back online. But in other words, will these trash fees for this year fall due next year with our property taxes? Is that how it's -- so you're actually paying them a year later. And -- MR. DONAHUE : No. You're paying them in the current year. They just come on your tax bill instead of a separate bill. MR. DOBRZYN : Well, I paid my taxes and I didn't notice any difference . Maybe I did -- I'll have to research it, okay. But anyway, the $300 or a little less if you pay early or whatever it is, actually 's a deal. And I agree with you a thousand percent on the New York trash and New Jersey trash. And I had a New Yorker move next door to me. He was just a working class dude. And he asked me about recycling . And I told him, well, you have to take it out the front. We have like 32 steps to our front door. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 put it in a trunk and take it around. And I'm not doing that. Okay. So you're not doing that. So we're stuck with it I guess. I'd like to see people forced to recycle . I'd love to see it. We don't do it. And I know we are talking about our school system earlier . Well, our school system seemed to run into trouble with a certain Republican Governor Corbett . That's when the extra money stopped flowing in along with our Republican legislature . I think I read something about the court case to get that money back on the agenda because we have an underfunded school system, granted ; but we're supposed to get a lot more money than what we do. And, okay, this is concerning Scranton because eventually these laws are going to leach in, Mastriano from Pennsylvania was out to Arizona to check out the fraudit {sic.} And you have these uncertified and unauthorized people playing with voting machines . And they want to start this in Pennsylvania , bring it to Pennsylvania -- the cyber ninjas.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 And by the way, once they tamper with those machines they have to be replaced. So if they did that in our county and they already did under Giuliani in one county in Pennsylvania , that county has to buy brand new voting machines . It's not like it doesn't cost you. And there's a new line I have, it's called Call Your Senator Daily. It's free 888-453-3211. And when you hang up after the first call if you call back they put you through to the other Senator . So first I got Casey. The next one I got Toomey. And I advised both of them gently to please act in the American way. I know Casey would be all for that. The other numbers are 202-224-3121. And that's probably -- just takes your address , your zip code. And the 202-225-3121, that you could possibly ask for other senators from other states. And it's time to apply some pressure to Mr. Manchin . He has people from Texas mock marching his headquarters yesterday . And we're all with this racial teaching and so forth, I'm all for it. We need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 to study because back in the 1800s no working class was treated very much better than slaves. If you wanted to move from the colliery you paid your bill. If you didn't pay your bill you went to prison. And the company store I owe my soul. Thank you. Good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? That exhausts the sign-in sheet. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne. Unfortunately , one of the people who was addressing Council has left the body. One of the interesting things when it comes to the Home Rule Charter is whenever I have question s or don't know anything about the Home Rule Charter in particular , all I need to do is pick up the phone. My mother was actually one of the few people who were present and instituted the Home Rule Charter . And the major question with the Scranton 's Home Rule Charter was the difference on how this government would be brought in, whether it would be a Mayor and City Council as a representative or the equivalent of the county commissioners , just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 different structure of whether or not we would have the equivalent of a cross checking on bodies, legislative and an executive or whether we would have commissioners who come in there and be voted in for terms who would run the entire organization . So the main push of the Home Rule Charter back then was to define what type of governing body would best represent the residents of the City of Scranton . And in doing that, we have to take a look at how this body has represented the City of Scranton compared to how the county commissioners with their taxing laws and what they have done to the county on a whole has represented the same population . So part of the evaluation on the Home Rule Charter , look at both -- look at both parts of the ruling bodies that you have present . Do you want to have county commissioners similar to city commissioners similar to Lackawanna County, then change the Home Rule Charter . If that's not working, then it's something other than just the Home Rule Charter . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 I've yet to see a street sweeper back in my neighborhood , period. I've watched my security camera get the trash trucks every Tuesday and recycling . But I have yet to see a street sweeper come down there. Landfill , I've said to Council beforehand about both a clean incineration and plasma gasification . There are solutions . They are expensive . They turn our trash into energy. They wind up providing pretty much the amount of energy that we put in trash comes back in electricity . And we're not filling up landfill s. There are solutions out there that could get us out of that and actually by making a larger plant, we could start taking trash from surround ing counties because we would have excess and start making a revenue stream for the City. There are places that have put this in place who are now making -- not only emptying their landfill s, but are increasing the revenue stream for the city. Parking , the parking tickets for directional are being enforced wrong. We had them on our block. And I actually questioned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the Parking Authority lady and she said it was based on -- the parking direction was based on state law. The state code actually reflects that you have to park in the direction of traffic . Many of these streets are bidirectional because they are too small. There is no direction al traffic . Specific directional parking is for Pittston Avenue where you have two lanes or two one-way streets to not go against it. When you have one lane in the center, it is bidirection al. There is no parking against traffic . The delay in sending paperwork down for the position s in Scranton , simple. Mayor delays it for three weeks, deny the job. Gone. You don't want to send it for approval , we've unapproved it. Find someone else. And that would stop the delay because if jobs were cut it would stop it. Last, Harry Potter always uses the you know who or he who must not be named. The landfill with DeNaples , DeNaples ' name is hardly ever brought up. Also, Scranton Salt, the land -- which is a vacant colliery , CSY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Incorporated is also DeNaples . Looking at that, there is a back way out of there. It's more expensive and it doesn't have to go through the neighborhood in West Scranton . You could actually run a road off Taylor Avenue to Depot Street to North Main Street. And the City owns the property at the Lackawanna Trail that would have to put the easement on the train track corner to provide access. It would cost DeNaples and the Salt more money but that exit is there. It would stop bridges . It would stop houses being impacted . It's a solution . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s tonight? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just have two quick updates . The first being the trucks that I spoke about that were parked on South Washington Avenue for several months, those are no longer there so I want to thank the SPD for their help in that. And the other thing I hadn't mention ed it here yet but I did inquire about the Old Vine Street Station that's in the Hill Section on Vine and Prescott . And I pass by it frequently . It's been closed for a number of years. And it's a blighted property . And I wanted to take a look into that. And we received a response that that's something that the DEP is actually addressing because of some environmental issues. So I'll continue to update the public on that piece of property as I receive more information . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly , one of the answers for Joan's questions regarding the audit that we got back in terms of what is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the status to the 2020 audit, the response we got back from Carl Deeley was that the 2020 audit preparation s are currently in work. We anticipate completion in September . The City finance team will meet with our auditors Kohanski later this month to agree on the specific timeline for the 2020 audit publication . And in terms of your second question is the City still paying Rainey and Rainey to do audit prep work? If so, why? The answer was, yes, Rainey and Rainey continue as our audit prep support . And the City does not have the capacity to complete this work internally . Those were the answers that were provided to us to your questions regarding the audit. Mr. Hayes, in terms of Mr. Coyne's point about bidirectional streets and state law, would we be able to look into that because that is an interesting theory, you know, what I guess regulate s how we enforce our park enforcement . Is it a City law or is it the state law? Thank you. And I would just like to say to, Mr. White, I wish we were able to have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 street cleaner come out every week. I wish we were able to have the street cleaners come out every week. But we only have three street cleaners in the City. That's an upgrade from a couple years ago where we only had one. I'll talk to you about street cleaning after the meeting , okay? And then, Mr. Ellman, if you could provide address es for properties or even the hundred block that you see these issues on, please provide them for us and then maybe we could get them taken care of. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I have quite a few items tonight . The first I just want to mention the Rules of Council . So Article 5 under regulations in Council it states: Any person authorized to address Council shall be limited to speaking exclusive ly on matters of concern to the Council that are contained in Third, Fifth, Sixth or Seventh Order of the meeting agenda and may speak on nonagenda items of concern to the Council . Now, I try to be as fair as possible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 in running these meeting s. And I don't really -- you know, I don't want to be heavy-handed. Everyone has their opinions . But I will gavel the speakers out of order if they stray too far from what is of concern to this Council which is national political issues that don't have anything to do with Council . There are different forums for that. This is not one of them. And I don't really want to get into debating immigration , abortion , the death penalty doesn't have -- unless you could somehow tie it to City business , I will be enforcing Article 5 of the Council rules. The second thing I wanted to address tonight and Councilman Donahue and I spoke about this last week was the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection 's June 3rd approval of Keystone Sanitary Landfill 's application to expand its facility in our county. This approval as we know will allow Keystone to continue to accept out of state trash for the next four decades, 40 years. That means that for the next four decades, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 City of Scranton will have over 100,000 gallons of leachate per day running under our neighborhoods . That means that for over the next four decades, over 3 and a half million gallons, that's the equivalent of the contents of over five olympic sized swimming pools of leachate per month will flow through and be discharged in a facility in South Scranton . As the elected official s who are entrusted to represent the residents of Scranton , I believe very strongly that we have an obligation to determine whether the process for approving Keystone 's expansion application was appropriate and conformed to the law. We know for certain that the Department of Environmental Protection ignored the overwhelming opposition to this expansion from the resident s of host municipal ities and the many, many public official s elected to represent them. We know that the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board has already determined that the DEP has not consistently exercised vigorous oversight of the landfill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 consistent with its regulatory and constitutional responsibilities with just as much concern about the rights of the landfill 's neighbors as the rights of the landfill . We know that DEP has failed us and now it's time that we know why they failed us. In light of this, I will now make a motion that City Council send a written request to the Pennsylvania Department of Auditor General to conduct a performance audit of the Department of Environmental Protection 's process for approving the expansion permit application of the Keystone Sanitary Landfill . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , in addition to my comment s, I hope that other municipalities in Lackawanna County will join us in this request . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 I just want to check through a couple citizens complaint s. I've actually gotten quite a few in the last few days. One of these we've already been in contact with the police department . But I'd like to circle back around, Frank, if we could, the woman reached out to me today. 728 Brook Street, this woman was denied a handicap parking pass. Now she does have a parking lot -- there's parking in the back of her home. But there's a hill. She has cancer. She can't get up it. It's tough to get up there in the winter and she does have a legitimate medical issue. So we did ask the Chief of Police if there was any sort of recourse for this woman to appeal the decision by the police department . And the police department is just following the rules. I'm not saying that they did anything wrong. But we are just asking for clarification to try to help this woman. So if you could just circle back around with them, Frank, and see if they came to any conclusion on that. The other call about 2309 Rockwell Avenue, dangerous trees in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the City right of way that this gentleman believes should come down. So if we could contact Tony Santoli and Don King on that. There is also trees at 740 Cherry Street that are on City property that were planted years ago I believe by the City and they're ripping the sidewalk s and they've become really dangerous . So we can also include that in the request of Mr. Santoli and Mr. King. 1642 Sanderson Avenue is a property that I've gotten complaints about over the years since I've been on Council . I received a complaint again from several neighbors out there, drug deals, blight issue, garbage in the yard. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we can send that over to the police department and Licensing and Inspections as well. One of the questions that I'd like to ask tonight of the Parks and Recreation Department , we made sure to put $50,000 in an account in the Parks and Recreation budget for casual employee s to help cut grass and maintain parks during the summer. This is a program that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 instituted years ago in the DPW and Parks and Recreation Department . And I don't believe that this year it's been instituted . I don't know that those funds have been used and I'd like to know why. That's the whole reason that we put the money in the budget. And I do think that would be worthwhile . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out to DPW and Parks and Rec Department and get an explanation on that. Also, I asked last week for a complete update on the Meadow Brook Creek project . We did not receive that yet. I'm hoping that we do by next week. Neighbor s are calling me and asking and they've reached out to Councilman Schuster and Councilman Donahue as well why their properties and their backyard s are still in disrepair and when they're going to be repaired. They obviously -- anyone would not want to go through the whole summer with your backyard ripped up. So if we could get an answer on that I would appreciate it. And then, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out to Charlene Doyle from the Pennsylvania Northeast 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Regional Railroad Authority , there are several people and groups that want to do a cleanup of the area near the railroad and down on the Olive Street underpass . They want to make sure they have permission first. I spoke about this back in May. There is an area if you're travelling from Scranton High School right before you get under the bridge if you look to your right there is just a dumping ground for garbage . We actually travelled up above that where the railroad is. And I've never seen so much garbage in my life. It's definitely a hazard. So we just need to find out who we can get permission from to get that cleaned up. We did get a response from the Department of Environmental Protection . It will be in Third Order next week. There are pages and pages of documents that were provided regarding the flooding on Leggett Street and Leach Creek -- Leggett Street and specifically the woman that lives on Yard Avenue who I'm in touch with quite frequently . I'm going to ask Mr. Voldenberg to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 set up a meeting between myself and anyone else on Council who wants to be involved and all of the neighbor s who are affected by the flooding. I'd like DPW and DEP to be involve d, Mr. Voldenberg , so that we can all get on the same page. There seems to be conflicting information , and I just want to make sure that that gets taken care of. And I do have the names and addresses and numbers of all the neighbors who are involved . And as it pertains to the pipe, that's still an outstanding question . When you look at the documents next week, Miss Hodowanitz , you'll see that the DEP is saying one thing and the City is saying another thing. So it's not really clear what they're going to do with that. I know they have until June 30th to come up with a plan to fix the issues that DEP identified in their Notice of Violation . In that vain, we did get a note from Mr. Preambo , the DPW Director . He actually called me late this afternoon but I was rushing to get down here so I couldn't -- I didn't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 a chance to call him back but that he was going respond to my request for information regarding the flooding in these areas. One of the things that I requested from DPW was just a road map of what work has been done and what work are they planning on doing. So he said he's waiting on some documentation from LaBelle Associates and that he will provide an answer and that will be put in Third Order. There were several other things that I wanted to touch on tonight that residents had asked about. One of them was Bedrock Technology . That's the company that the City had entered into under -- a contract the City entered into under an emergency declaration . So I can't remember who asked these questions . But one of the questions was, how many team members are currently assigned by Bedrock to our IT Department ? Mr. Deeley responded there are currently seven Bedrock staff assigned to City support . The other question was, what was the ending date to the Bedrock service contract ? And he stated that the current contract will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 expire in August, 2021. And one of the other -- the last question was, are any duties present ly performed by Bedrock and can they be handled by City IT employees ? His response was the City has the capability for a subset of tier one support at this time, hardware , install and replacements , user access and software install s. So that was his response to those questions . One of the issues that I had raised was regarding DPW overtime in the administration . And my concern there really stemmed from a lookback at the budget since I have been on Council since 2014. From 2015 to 2019 and years before that, there was hardly any money ever budgeted for overtime in the DPW administration account . In 2020 when the Cognetti administration took over, there was only $250 which was budgeted. $5,861.91 was spent. This year to date, there's been almost $8,000 that have been spent in overtime . We only budgeted I think $2,250. We are on track now if you cost it out to spend almost $20,000 on overtime in DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 administration . So I had asked the DPW why that was that we're spending that much money. You know, when Council approves a budget and we made several changes to the budget, we would expect that department s would try their best to live within the means that we set. And for the department to just blatantly go thousands of dollars over and we're not even in July yet, that's -- I don't believe that there's any excuse for that. Mr. Preambo did respond . And I want to read his response into the record. He said the reason for overtime being charged in DPW administration is not due to a new policy or change in policy. However , it is due to filling an open position in the hiring of a fleet services supervisor in August of 2020. Prior to this hiring, the department did not benefit from a position that would supervise auto service staff and provide management support for our fleet equipment services inventory and supplies within the DPW complex and operations . It has been historical with operations in DPW to have foremen supervisors 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 work overtime when the operation al staff is on duty providing public services . I had to question that statement because as I just stated here, there has been -- as far as I could see, there was no money spent on supervisor s in the DPW. So I don't know -- I still don't understand why we're doing this and the amount that we're doing it. He also states that the fleet services supervisor is no exception and has been cross training in other operation s in order to cover for vacations and other absences . The department has a 24/7 on-call service for weather emergencies . And supervisor s rotate for off hour coverage . The department also works 11 schedul ed Saturday s per year due to holidays . I requested a breakdown of the overtime by employee in this department . I still have an issue with this. I do plan on speaking to Mr. Preambo and the Mayor about it. Again, as I stated, if we're going to pass a budget and we're going to set an account at a certain amount and they're just going to ignore it, then why are we up here and what are we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 doing? We set it at an amount. They've blown through the budget and we're not even -- we're almost halfway through the year. So it doesn't make sense. It still does not make sense to me. The next thing I had was a resident had asked about Portnoff Law Associates and a question about their performance to date. We did get a response from Mary Jo Sheridan . She reported that the City of Scranton 's Treasury Bureau collect ed $609,321 in delinquent refuse fees from January 1st, 2021 through May 31st, 2021. For the same period last year, NRS collect ed $509,225. She also stated that City officials met with Portnoff reps last week. And this e-mail is June 11th to finalize the transition of Portnoff taking over collections . She also stated that the timing of the transition has been impacted by the need for additional data and information from NRS. They are anticipating receiving the information then need by next week and they'll let us know as soon as Portnoff takes over collections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 officially . As for the letters of interest and resumes for the zoning board, as I mention ed at the top of the meeting we did receive three letters of interest and resumes. You have until Friday at 12 noon to get them to Mr. Voldenberg as I stated in the beginning of the meeting . So anyone out there who's interested and wants to serve on the board, this a great opportunity . And I would recommend that you do that. And it will be very helpful to the Council . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I did ask Mr. Hayes to look in -- or check with the administration during caucus to see if we should do this just by position and not include people's names, therefore , it would just be, you know, that position has the ability to represent the City in terms of any interaction with Berkheimer . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? We are required to do this per Act 511. Act 511 mandate s the -- actually mandates Berkheimer to transmit confidential tax information to the municipal ity. We have to appoint certain people to entertain that information .
