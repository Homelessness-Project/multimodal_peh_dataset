Now,thereareotherissues.As longasIdecided tosendaletter tothe outside auditors ,therearematerial weaknesses ininternal county controls that Ihaveidentified through theotherworkI havedone.Ihavenotseen,although ,Iam trying togetacopyoftheauditor 's management letter toseeifwhatIhave foundtheyfound,butI'malsogoingtoput thatintheletter because Ibelieve that someofthesethings areproblematic .For example ,thereisoneindividual thatis responsible foraccepting information , recording theinformation ,recording it, billing it,andcollecting it.Asingle individual .Thatisamaterial weakness in internal accounting control .Iwill,of course,copyallofyouinthatletter. Allofoperating expensesofthe citymaynotbeinthe2016financial statements ,veryspecifically ,Ifollowed withsomeinterest thedialogue backand forthinthepaperbetween themayor, Shrive,andothers astowhowasresponsible1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 forthelegalfeels,veryspecifically ,the Abrahamsen fee.WhatIhavefoundthat thoselegalfeesarerecorded onthebooks oftheSewerAuthority whichwouldleadme tobelieve theyarenotrecordedonthe city'sbooks,although ,Shrive hassuggested theyarethecity'sresponsibility andif that'sthecasethenIknowthatthereis potentiality thattheoperating expenses in thefinancial statements areshortbyat least$200,000.ForallIknow,theremay beotherprofessional feesthatwerepaidby theSewerAuthority andthatareonthe SewerAuthority 'sbooksbutrightfully belong onthecity'sbooks.Now,Ididnot wanttogothrough thattodaybecause this justahead'supIwillbecorresponding withthecity'soutside auditors .Theymay wellhavetocomeback.

MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Perry. Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,acouple ofbrief items.Firstregarding the2016audit, although wehaven'thadachance toreview theauditindetail atthispoint,Idowant tonotethattheauditforthefirsttimein alongtimewasontime,andregarding setting budgets ,thecityneedstohavean audittodoabudget andthat'swherethe citywentofftrackforanumber ofyears having audits thatcameoutafterbudgets wereevenwritten ,sohaving achance to reviewtheprevious year'sauditbefore1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 writing nextyear'sbudget iscertainly something thatwillbehelpful inthe budgetary process . Idoagree,andIforget which speaker brought itup,butIdoagreethat council should haveasession withthe auditor stogooverthesummary oftheaudit andinparticularly anyfindings thatarein theaudittoletusknowexactly where things needtobetightenedup.Iknowthe administration ,theFinance Chairand council generally haveit,butIthinkall fivemembers ofcouncil should havethat chance tomeetwiththeauditors andgo through allofthosedocuments andanswer anyquestions thatwehaveaswell. Thedouble pension scandal was brought upagaintonight ,andIthank Attorney Minora forhisworkonthis.I assure youIwillbecontinuing toworkon thisissueforthemonthofAugust.Ithink Attorney Minora isgetting sickofmyphone callseveryotherdayasking whenarewe goingtoreceive thedocuments ,butIknow heisworking diligently togetthose1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 documents tous.Theconcern thatIdohave iswhatwecandowiththosedocuments when wereceive them.Iknowtherearegoingto berestrictions placed onhowmuchwecanor can'tsayregarding what'sfoundinthose reports ,butIamveryanxious toreadthem andhopefully willbesomething through August wewillandbeabletoaboutthrough andprovide somesortofreport ifwe legally canwhenwecomebackintosession . Oneofthespeakers brought upon taxes,particularly school property taxes, andthisisissuethatIhearallofthe timefromalotofsenior citizens who haven'tachildintheschool system in decades orpeople whonevermarried ornever hadchildren ,thattheyarepaying veryhigh school taxesandtheyarenotreceiving anything fromit.Andtheyoftensay,well, myneighbor rents,theydon'tpayproperty taxes,theyhavesixchildren andtheyare notpaying andI'mpaying forthem.That's something Iheareverydaythroughout the city,andaseveryone knowsyourschool taxesarethehighest portion ofyourtax1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 bill,theyalways havebeenand, unfortunately ,thefinancial situation with theschool district saying itlookslikeas thecityfinances areimproving theschool districts finances are,unfortunately , deteriorating ,butthereissomething that canbedoneandthisisonthestatelevel. AndI'mgladthiswasbrought up,Ihaven't brought itupinanumber ofmonths,therea Senate Bill76whichwouldeliminate school property taxesintheentire Stateof Pennsylvania andreplace themwithan increased income taxandincreased salestax onnon-essential items.So,forinstance , yourfood,yourclothing ,allofthoseitems wouldstillremain completely taxfreein theStateofPennsylvania ,butluxury items, itemsthataren'tnecessities people willbe paying taxes. Thebeauty ofthislaw,whichwhatI really loveaboutit,ittakestheburden offofsenior citizens andtakestheburden offofhomeowners ,butanyone whoisgoing outandmaking purchases ofnon-essential itemswillthenbepaying school taxes,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 whereunderthecurrent system that'snot thecase. SoIwouldencourage everyone to contact yourstaterepresentative andstate senators andaskthemtosupport Senate Bill 76andsomesortoftaxrelief fromthe statebudget. Finally ,reassessment wasbrought up again,andIhavespoken atlength about thisissuefornumerous weeks.Idowantto reiterate onepointthough,andthisiswhat really bothers memostaboutourcurrent system,eveninaperfectworldifschool property taxesweredoneawaywith,asI suggested ,youstillhaveacitytaxandfor purposes ofreassessment westillhavethe county tax,andthecounty taxisreally whereIthinkthereassessment isunfair to theCityofScranton nothaving a reassessment isunfair totheCityof Scranton .Therehasbeentremendous building outside ofthecityinthelast40 yearssincethelastassessment andthat's notbeingtakenandaccounted for.Itneeds tobebalanced out.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 Andtheotherissuethatreally bothers meaboutthecurrent system is individuals whohavethemeans,whohavethe money,whohavetheconnections ,the attorneys theyarelining updownatthe county courthouse toappeal theirtaxes wheretheaverage person whohaslivedin theirhomefor10,20,30,40yearsinthe citytheydon'thaveanattorney ,theycan't afford anattorney andtheydon'tknowhow tofiletheappeal tohavetheirtaxes possibly reducetheirassessment .Thatis oneofthethings thatreally doesbother me aboutthecurrent system,andIdoknowI thinkthecommissioners proposed ,andI thinkitwasrescinded ,increasing thefees toappeal yourtaxesandthat'ssomething I certainly oppose. Iampleased thatthevoters of Lackawanna County inScranton willhavethe finalsayregarding reassessment .Ithink theremightbesomecourtchallenges whether thatdoesgoontheballot ornot,butat thispointitdoeslooklikethevoters will havethelastsayandwhether weagreeor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 disagree themajority isgoingtoruleand that'showitshould be.SothatisallI havefortonight .Thankyou.

And,finally ,Iwanttotalkbriefly aboutthenotification ofalawsuit against Councilman Gaughan forslander bythe mayor'sspecial council .Thislawsuit is wrongandifsuccessful itcouldhavea dramatic andchilling effect onthevery principle offreespeech,especially asit relates topublic officials andthe fundamental rightofeveryelected official toaskhardquestions anddemand accountability ofothers whileweare representing thetaxpayers andthecitizens1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 ofScranton .So,fortherecord,Istand withCouncilman Gaughan .That'sallIhave. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Evans. Mr.Gaughan . MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou.Just afewcitizen 'srequests .Thereareseveral quality oflifeissues inthe700blockof BrookStreetinSouthScranton sowesent thattotheLicensing andInspections Department .Ididreceive several complaints fromresidents intheareaofthe 100blockofSouthBromley Avenue.Theyare having issues withacondemned homethereso wearegoingtoalsosendthattothe Licensing andInspections Department . Wesentasecond request for flooding issues onEastMountain inthe1300 blockofBirchStreet.Wearestill researching thesignage forparksdetailing rulesandregulations .Thisrequest came fromtheEastMountain Neighborhood Association meeting thatCouncilman Wechsler andIattended . Mrs.ReedandIhavebeentrying to correct aproblem onalongThirdAvenuewith1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 afencethatisverydangerous .Agentleman whoreachedouttousoverayearagois continually hearing concerns .Theland apparently isownedbytheScranton Redevelopment Authority andweareworking withtheSRAtotryandresolve thisissue. Mrs.Jefferies ,whospokethis evening aboutstreet signage ,Idon't understand whythesignsthatyouhave identified ,whichIdon'tthinkwere--I thinkitwasmaybeover20,somewhere inthe areaof20,yeah,Idon'tunderstandwhyin theinterim theyjustcan'tsimply be replaced orbeputup,soIwouldaskthat wesendaletter totheDPWasking themto dothat,toputthosesinceupandtorepair theonesthatMs.Jefferies hasidentified , because Idoagreewithhertraveling throughout thecity,especially theHill Section ,isverydifficult ifyouarenot fromtheareaoryouarenotfamiliar with theneighborhood tofindoutwhereyouare going,sohopefully theycantakecareof that. AsforMr.Evansrequest onthe$121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 million ,youknow,Ijusthavetosaythat thefactthatwehavetocontinue toaskfor thisinformation repeatedly timeandtime againisappalling anddisgraceful .The letters thatwe'resending out,I'vefound thisoverthelast31/2years,theyare aboutasworthlessasthepaperthatare written on,andIthinkIhaveabetter chance oftalking tooneofthemayors or getting information outonethemayors in oneofthepicture frames hereonthese wallsincitycouncil chambers ,andIdon't takethatlightly atall. Inregard tothenotice ofthe potential lawsuit thatmaybefiledagainst meforslander byNedAbrahamsen Ijustwant toreiterate mybelief thatthislawsuit is notonlyfrivolous ,butit'sclearly an attempt tobullymeandtoputamuzzle on mesothatIstopasking questions .Thisis notgoingtowork.AndIwanttothank Councilman PerryandCouncilman Evansfor standing withmetonight . Thislawsuit willnotdetour mefrom demanding transparency forthetaxpayers of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 thiscityand,quitefrankly ,Ibelieve it wouldbeadereliction ofdutyifIdidnot question everything thatcomesbefore meas acitycouncilman .Iamsimply doingthe jobthatIwaselected bythepeople ofthis citytodo.Thispotential lawsuit isnot onlyanattack onmyability tospeakfreely atcouncil meetings ,question andscrutinize things,butitisanattack oneveryelected official throughout Lackawanna County who maydarequestion thoseingovernment orin aposition ofpowerandinfluence . Youknow,theironic thingabout thispotential lawsuit isthatitcost Mr.Abrahamsen who,bytheway,hasbeen detailed thathemade$400,000asspecial counsel tothecitycosthimnothing tofile thislawsuit ,butitmaycostthetaxpayers ofScranton alotofmoney. I'mgladMr.Abrahamsen 'sinvoices havefinally beenreleased forwork performed onthesewersale,butIfindit extremely unfortunate andconcerning that MayorCourtright andtheSewerAuthority disregardedmyrequest andmycolleagues '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 request forthisinformation formonths. I'mstillreviewing theinvoices ,butI anticipate I'llhavefurther questions . Oneofthequestions Ihavebasedon myinitial review iswhenwasthedocument detail workperform performed onthesewer salebyMr.Abrahamsen ,whosubmitted itto theScranton Times,generated .SoIwould liketoknowwhenthatdocument wasexactly generated .Thedataonthedocument says July17.Wasthisworkbeingdocumented as itwasperformed orafterthefact? Also,whatdate,timeandplacedid themayorandMr.Shrive tellMr.Abrahamsen togotowork,ashewasquoted inthe newspaper,andwhenwastheofficially hired bythemayorandMr.Shrive asspecial counsel ? Icontinue tobelive thatthisis badgovernment tohavesomeone make$400,000 without anactual contract detailing what workwouldbeperformed .And,finally , lawsuit ornolawsuit Iwillcontinue to standmyground andIwillnotbackdown. Thankyou.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 MR.WECHSLER :Yeah,Ialsowould request thatAttorney Abrahamsen dropthis suit.Scranton CityCouncil asabodyhas beenpursuing thisissuesinceJanuary .We havehadbeenwriting letters ,goingto meetings ,requesting theAuditor General, requesting theStateAttorney General to lookintoit,andMr.Gaughan isasking questions thatwehaveallasked.It'sall thesamequestions .Thereisreally no different questions thanweaskedin January .Thebestthingformewouldbeto suggest thatweneedtorelease everything .
