Brian Matson poke on city business .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, just quickly . Last week there was a question of fireworks and with the state changing their ordinance s and where does the city stand so we did get some clarification for everybody . This came from Deputy Fire Chief Al Lucas and basically to sum up his conversation that he had with us was that there were changes to the Pennsylvania state laws as we know and the city will follow the state law. Now, there is a city ordinance back from 1990, that was the last time the city wrote any kind of ordinance based on fireworks, but as of right now the city is going to fall in line with the states, the states new legislature on fireworks and I'm just kind of just sum up some things that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 are included in the new state law in case there was any kind of confusion . Stands that sell fireworks in Pennsylvania , which includes the City of Scranton , they obviously need a new license and permit. They obtain that permit through the Department of Agriculture . They can only sell consumer grade fireworks. So, you know, we are not going to have any kind of Montage level fireworks going on or stuff that Mr. Hetman sets off, his beautiful displays , but they will have consumer grade fireworks for sale in Scranton and Pennsylvania . They will not be allowed to sell any kind of explosives like quarter sticks, M-80's, things of that nature, still totally illegal . A couple of -- well, three bullet points in the state law, also. You have to 18 years of age to purchase . You cannot -- not only to purchase but to also execute and to light off the fireworks, you need to be 18 years old. You cannot be under the influence of alcohol during this time of setting off the fireworks and you must be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 150 feet away from any structure . You cannot light them off in-between two buildings . It's got to be 150 feet. So that is the how the state law is written a the city is going to fall in line with that state law just in case there is any confusion out there. And that's all I have for today. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Just briefly , I touched on the immigration issue a little bit last week and I came across a pretty interesting message that was on a message board on a church in New York City called Madison Avenue Baptist Church and the message on the board was, "Rather than a wall, American needs to build a giant mirror to reflect on what we have become." And I just think that's something we really need to ask ourselves during this time. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 First, one of the things I brought up in caucus tonight and we discussed I would like an answer on from the administration I came across a contract that council received June 20, 2018, maintenance of the City of Scranton street lights effected from date of execution for a period of 24 months, two years, for the attached bid proposal and Scranton specification s and the contract is with Urban Electrical Contractors out of Dunmore . My question is why did council not vote on this contract ? Since I have been on council now we have voted on contracts like this, in fact, I think we voted for this one twice. If there was a decision made that this is no longer going to be the policy and the case why was council not notified and why is this decision made? I feel that a precedent has been set since I have been on council that we vote on these contracts as a matter of transparency and, you know, if this is the case I think we just went from being extremely transparent to stepping back into the shadows and I do not agree with that. So, Mrs. Reed, if he could please 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 find out from the administration and the mayor's office and the city solicitor what is going on here I appreciate it. We will be having a meeting with Mayor Courtright , our business administrator , the Pennsylvania Economy League July 30 at 11:45 a.m. in council chambers . It will be televised by ECTV and the purpose of this meeting is to go back and take a look at the three-year exit plan that council passed last summer, last July, so we are going to receive an update from the mayor and PEL on that and those initiatives so we look forward to that. I mentioned this last week the 1000 block of the Hitchcock Court there are several bags of garbage in the alleyway . Mr. Reed, if we could send another message to the DPW and ask them if they can go out and pick this up. I been contacted again by several residents who were concerned about that, and it's strewn all over the alleyway . I attended a Bull's Head neighborhood meeting this past -- last week actually , several concerns there from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 residents . One of them, 2501 Boulevard Avenue there was a major runoff issue with water in a gentleman 's back yard and flooding . There is also a big drop off in the backyard . The city was out there years ago to try and take care of this and this gentlemen is having issues with it again. So, Mrs. Reed, if he can send something out to Mr. Gallagher and ask him if he will go out and take a look at that I'd appreciate it. 1213 Blair Avenue, residents are reporting some issue with address and couches on the porch. Rear 1206 Blair Avenue overgrown grass and garbage all over the place, the neighbors showed me pictures of that so if we could send something to Licensing and Inspections . There was a gentlemen that contacted me and we did reach out to DPW about a hidden driveway sign before 1107 Kane Street so we sent that out and hopefully that's taken care of. Also, for those residents in Greenridge who are curious about an update on the castle house, I think last year a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 woman that was interested in repairing it and updating it had come before council . Pat Hinton updated me that the alleged brother of the owner is in town and wants to get out some personal items of the owner. He has no rehab or maintain the house. The owner is actually still over in Russia. The city is currently dealing with Chase bank regarding maintenance and ownership of the property , very difficult to deal with. There is numerous fines and actually a warrant out for arrest so the city at this point is waiting for the green light to demolish the property , so that was an update from Mr. Hinton. That's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just one item that I wanted to discuss tonight , and it's very good news for the residents and lower Greenridge area, I attended a meeting today with the developers of the Scranton Lace Works project as well representatives from the city fire department and the city police department and I know the Lace Works project is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 something that has been discussed quite a bit at our meeting s for the last few weeks. I remember a few weeks ago the residents brought up concerns that they would see some action on -- particular ly on the dilapidated buildings that are beyond repair, so our meeting focused actually on the beginning of the demolition phase of the project . I'm pleased to announce that demolition will be beginning any day. If you drive up the equipment is actually already there, so the developers did discuss safety issues with the police and fire department s. Chief DeSarno was on hand as well as Al Lucas and it was a very productive meeting . I appreciate the developers keeping the city in the loop especially on the safety issues when they are tearing down these old dilapidated buildings . And just to give everyone an update on the project , what will be going on, there are a number of phases of this project , but phase one is if you drove by there is a number of buildings that are literally almost falling down already . Those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 buildings , unfortunately , could not be saved. They are a huge safety hazard and that's what the majority of the complaints that we have received have been about, those sections of the property that are beyond repair, so phase one is going to completely demolish those part of the Laceworks while preserving the parts that are going to be rehabbed . Townhomes are going to be built all on the riverbank which I believe they are going to try it retrofit some of the materials from the parts of Laceworks that could not saved into these new townhomes. There is plans for a DayCare , a bakery, numerous apartments , so it's really going to revitalize that entire neighborhood and even though we are very happy that this project is taking off it doesn't look like there has been much progress over the last few weeks but there really has. The amount of money and time that was invested by the developers just in the remediation of asbestos and lead and hazardous materials within those buildings is astronomical . They are already millions of dollars into this project and by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 driving by you wouldn't see it but prior to beginning any sort of demolition or construction all those environmental hazards had to be taken care of, so that was much of what has been going on over the last number of years. Now we are going to be able to see true process . You are going to see those dilapidated buildings that we've had so many complaints about coming down. You are going to start seeing construction on the old Laceworks getting renovated and you are going to see brand ow construction townhomes being built. So I'd like to thank the developers for their openness with council . I know they have been in to talk with us a couple of times already , I think we might want to schedule them to come in again to give us update as things progress . I do know they are also go be meeting with the neighborhood associations over the next week or so to keep them up to date on what's going on, but it is very good new and a very historic building , probably one of the most historic buildings in the city that's in dire need of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 repair. So I'll keep it all positive tonight and just talk about the good news and that's all. MR. PERRY: Mr. Rogan, I forget that I had something ? MR. ROGAN: Sure. MR. PERRY: I forgot, the first speaker of the day Madilyn came in and talked about the smoking situation , and I'm not familiar on state regulations on where you are allowed to advertise and where you're not allowed to advertise so, Mrs. Reed, if it's possible can I get sent a copy on the state regulation on advertisement as it's referred to -- as it refers to schools and the regulations based on are they allowed to sell next to schools or are they allowed to advertise or not allowed to advertise . Are they allowed to sell it in certain areas. I'm not familiar with it. I know there are certain bans, but I don't know enough about it to speak intelligent ly about it, so if I could get a copy of that that might help us go forward on answering any other questions that she or her group 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 may have.

MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , two weeks ago I asked several questions from the gentlemen that came in from NDC and presented in our caucus and I just want to read into the record their reply. One of the questions that I had was regarding the Electric city garage and the Steamtown garage and the work that has gone on there, and this reply came from Mr. Trevisani from NDC and he says, "Regarding the Electric City and Steamtown Mall garages , Steamtown 300, LLC, as owner, is required to maintain and make necessary capital repairs to the garages as per the 2015-2016 Desmond Associates site survey. The owner has been providing regular maintenance of the garages as confirmed by ABM, but have made minimal capital repairs to our understanding , they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 include some joint repair in the mall garage and LED lighting upgrades to both garages . We also understand the owner has been meeting with structural engineers as is required to prepare the project scope but has not been informed at to the status of their arrangement . The owner has not disclosed the dollars spent to date on any upgrades. The owner remains behind the schedule outlined in the Desmond survey which indicates a two-year timeframe for completion of the initial improvement . We have requested and inspect a more detailed update with a revised schedule for the owner by Monday, June 25." I also requested financial information and at that point on Wednesday , June 20, Mr. Trevisani said, "Regarding the request for financial information , the CDPS board has informed staff that any requests for financial information from the city be directed to their respective representative on the board. Scranton City Council representative is Wayne Evans. Bud and I have been staying in close contact with Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Evans since his appointment by council and, in fact, I have a briefing this afternoon to see he is formally be appointed to the CDPS board at next week's meeting . CDPS is a private Delaware corporation with its principal offices in New York City and the entity that entered into the 45-year concession lease for operation of the facilities . As CDPS is not a public body, the board believes this protocol is the most efficient method of communication to insure transparency and consist ency. Bud and I will let Mr. Evans know you've inquired and will likely reach out to him. Thank you." I then replied , because I didn't find that answer satisfactory being that we have the legislation on our agenda that I would be making a motion to table this legislation if we did not receive the financial information . Mr. Trevisani then replied to me on June 25 that they did have a meeting , they discussed at their board meeting the communication protocol with CDPS staff that will provide parking program updates including financial performance to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 city council on quarterly basis. It was agreed that Councilman Wayne Evans would be the point of contact with CDPS staff to provide support and then he says that he is available to discuss . So he did provide answers to my questions and I am glad that we are going to be getting updates on the finances of the garage. Revenue that is collected from the parking offered at the mall garages to date, total revenue from Steamtown garage is $159,357 through May 31. This is $6,902 better than the budget. Total revenue from Electric City garage is $55,267 trough May 31. This is $12,173 worse than what was budgeted . Total revenue from all parking activities including off-street garages and on-street meters is $1,786,562 through May 31. This is $115,136 better than the budget. Total expenses from all parking activities , including off-street garages and on-street meters if $988,261 as of May 31. This is $105,797 worse than budgeted mainly due to start up costs associated with the implementation the mall revenue control 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 equipment . Overall the system is operating at $9,331 better than budget before debt service net operating income. So, again, I want to thank the gentleman from NDC for providing that and I will be looking forward to the financial performance updates and the program updates to council on a quarterly basis. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. PERRY: Yes, just on the question , the meter system that's kind of dead technology . Right now the kiosks are the future, so I really have no issue with that. The one thing that we did talk about was the amendment with the residential parking and we felt that solved two issues, one it -- you know, it is going to capture more revenue from the downtown residents and encourage them to use the parking garages instead of the meters and by doing that that would free up more on-street parking for local businesses to utilize because any thriving downtown , which are we thriving , are we getting there? But we can't push the envelope without parking that's just, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 know, that's a backbone of any city. So I think this will help two issues. It will help the residents with some parking and it's also going to help the businesses as well. MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please? MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. MR.
