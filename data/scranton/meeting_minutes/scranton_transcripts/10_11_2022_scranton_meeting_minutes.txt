MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY REGULAR MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 7, 2022. 3-G. MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 6, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I just have one comment on Third Order items. I see in Item 3-G the minutes of the Civil Service Commission , there was retest question s that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 were asked during that meeting . Mr. Voldenberg , can we send correspondence to the administration as well as the Civil Service Commission to find out if there is an update on any testing issues that have occurred and if there's going to be any retests because I think there were issues there that needed to be cleared up. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone. Any other comment on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have a few. Number one, I want to thank the Scranton Police Department , DPW, and all the volunteer s that were involved with the Steamtown Marathon this past weekend . It was a huge success . We had over a thousand runners register ed. About 874 runners started the race in Forest City and 865 finished the race. And it was just a great community event that involved 14 communities . And the culmination of the finish line here on North 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Washington Avenue and, you know, after we pay all of our bills, we'll figure out how much we're going to be able to donate to St. Joseph's Center. We've raised 2.1 million dollars in the first 24 years. So we're hoping to increase that. And but to put on an event of this magnitude requires a tremendous amount of collaboration , cooperation , and volunteerism because we have no paid staff. So -- and I'm talking up and down the line, every EMT company , every volunteer fire company , the police departments , Carbondale and Forest City and Vandling all the way down through Peckville and Throop and Dickson City, Mayfield and Jermyn, all of those communities cooperated along with our own city. So we had runners from 35 states and five countries . So it's was a nice representation . A lot people came and stayed at our hotels, ate at our restaurants . It was a nice economic benefit to the City as well as a huge benefit for St. Joseph's Center. And it's promoting health and fitness , which is a great thing. So I just want to thank everyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that was involved to help make that happen. I also want to announce there's going to be a tire recycling event at 101 West Poplar Street in Scranton on Saturday , October 15th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Fees for collection will be all residential tires are $4 per tire. Tires with rims will be $10 per tire. Tires with water/motor debris $5 per tire. No industrial sized tires will be accepted . On site contact number is 570-348-4170, extension 15. For non-Scranton residents , Lackawanna Countywide tire collection , October 14th, October 24th. This is a residential noncommercial event. And those people can call 570-963-2017. And the last thing I'd would like to announce is just a congratulations to Kyle and his wife Mary Kate on their delivery of their new little baby on Saturday , Claire Helen. So congratulations . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. KING: That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple. First, I just wanted to recognize that today is National Coming Out Day which is a day to celebrate coming out and build awareness and visibility for the LGBTQ community . I know that I don't have to point out that I'm an out-lesbian sitting here on Council . But it's still important to because by one person coming out or living their life out, they could help a lot of other people. So I'm happy to do that. And I wanted to mention that the Deutsch Institute is having a Champaign Celebrity Brunch that will be taking place on Sunday, October 30th. And that will be at St. Mary's Center on Mifflin Avenue downtown . And this will be -- it's $30 for adults. It's going to be honoring Joyce Tressler and the late Roseanne Novembrino . And I believe it's starting at 10 a.m. If anyone is interested in purchasing tickets , you could call the Deutsch Institute at 570-348-1968 or e-mail them at support at Deutsch Institute dot org. And there will be some tickets available at the door.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 And lastly, I just wanted to mention the City's wellness program that Dr. Saxena our Public Health Coordinator has been running . And they've been doing wellness programs throughout the City at housing developments . I had the chance today to be able to go to the one that took place at the Adams High Rise downtown here. And it was a great opportunity . They had a lot of people come through today. We've been able to partner with the University of Scranton actually with their physical therapy department in order to perform blood pressure and vital checks and fall risk prevention screening . Other partners included the Scranton Primary Healthcare Center, Pennsylvania Department of Health, Neighborhood Centers , Child Hunger Outreach Partners , Maternal and Family Health Services and the Friends of the Poor. And so it's been a really great opportunity I think for the City to partner with those different organizations and to provide resources and screening s for people within their housing developments and places 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that they live. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any announcements ? Like Councilman King mentioned , my wife and I were thrilled to welcome our baby girl Claire Helen into the world on Saturday night. She's happy. She's healthy . We brought her home yesterday . Her big sister is struggling to adjust a little bit. But she's getting there. But, you know, once again, I was reminded that I do believe my wife is superwoman. And I'm just extremely lucky to have her by my side. So I just want to thank her for everything she's done for not only me but for both of our girls. And then secondly , the parks or the Scranton Recreation Authority is hosting a pet food and pet accessory drive to benefit local shelters . That will take place at the Nay Aug Park Community Room on November 5th and 6th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day. They're looking for food for cats and kittens, food for dogs and puppies and then any supplies such as, you know, whether it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 toys, cat liter and such. They will also accept cash donation s or gift card donation s from Amazon. And that is on -- reminder , that is November 5th and 6th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., each day at the Community Room at Nay Aug. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Item 6-A, the DPW contract , did you get any specific numbers on that contract from the administration in terms of what the salary increase is and other costs? MR. DONAHUE : We were hoping to receive that to put in Third Order for next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. Because I'd like to see, you know, the salary increases for at least this year since it affects this year's budget and the pension plan, their contributions that the City is making which brings me to what is the status of the other union contract negotiations ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still under negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : When those come forward , the administration should also give hard numbers not simply that, you know, we're giving them competitive wages. And then what does that 2 percent translate or that 3 percent or whatever the number might be. And any progress on the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : Not that I'm aware of. Mr. Schuster , do you have any -- MR. SCHUSTER : Since last week I think I did see some correspondence . Someone reached out to say, hey, let's get this meeting back together to reenergize the group and continue the discussion . But other than that -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, you're only five weeks out from having the draft of the budget. So when I die, I want on my tombstone the following epitaph : "Show me the money" because that's what an audit is. And that's why we should have visibility and transparency on how money is spent. MR. SCHUSTER : I've been making my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 attempt s to stay on top of that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, which brings me to an article in the Times on the 6th of October . Businesses sued for late taxes. Scranton Tax Office is going after people who are delinquent on their Business Privilege and Mercantile Taxes. Cathy Wechsler is getting aggressive and -- well, she should which then brings me to my next comment . I mentioned a couple weeks ago that we have the database for the refuse and garbage fees on the City website . But that's a static document . It's as of the 1st of August. It's not current information . But we should have on the City's website the databases not only for that but property taxes and the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax and the new Payroll Preparation Tax, all of that information should be right on the City's website . I know it will take time for them to get that ball moving, but that's what the citizens need to know. And that's what the taxpayers need to know because ultimately it's the taxpayer s and the citizen s that provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 oversight of their government . If they don't, then they get what they deserve which is usually a bad deal. MR. DONAHUE : And I know they are working on making that more of a living document . MS. HODOWANITZ : All the tax and all the fees should be -- MR. DONAHUE : Yes, but, I mean, for the refuse definitely . But to my point there then too it's -- the complication right now is just making sure the systems are able to talk to each other. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Item 5-C, PMA management self-insurance compensation contract . I saw in the backup that it's $74,000 a year and then in the contract from PMA it says 77,000. Which is the correct number? MR. DONAHUE : 74. So we did ask about that. There will be additional backup in that legislation for next week that we received today. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : And, you know, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 e-mail did say the contract has been negotiate d down from the original bid of 77-K flat fee to 74. MS HODOWANITZ : Okay. That's fine. And how many years will that contract run? MR. DONAHUE : Three years. MS. HODOWANITZ : And Item 5-I, the Middle Mile Broadband Program , it said the deadline was September 30th for application . That got extended ? MR. SCHUSTER : That was a question that we were going to ask tonight . MS. HODOWANITZ : -- overtime almost 100 percent as of the end of September . And Lackawanna College , nothing after October 6th for them to be playing on Chick Feldman Field. MR. DONAHUE : So there is going to be an updated schedule released . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I'm done. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening, Council , Les Spindler , City resident . When I was here two weeks ago I talked about our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 corner again getting fixed by DPW. And, Councilman Donahue , you said that you had a response and you would talk about it in Fifth Order. And I stayed and listened and you didn't talk about it. MR. DONAHUE : I apologize . MR. SPINDLER : Do you have any -- MR. DONAHUE : So I believe it was put -- Mr. Voldenberg , correct me if I'm wrong, but it was put on their list and their plan was to get out there. I'll follow up with them again. MR. SPINDLER : I've been hearing that since last year. MR. DONAHUE : I'm just telling you what -- MR. SPINDLER : We're getting towards the cold weather again. And I have no faith that it's going to get fixed this year. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I'll follow up again with them tomorrow . MR. SPINDLER : Thank you. Okay. You're not going to be happy with me now. I was away last week. I had to be out of town. And I was told that you guys beat up on Ron 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Ellman pretty good. I'm not here to say that what he said a few weeks ago was correct . But according to the United States Constitution , we can come up here and say almost anything we'd like. And Council Rules do not supersede the US Constitution . Example is Doherty administration , me and a lot of other people came to this podium. And when Judy Gatelli was Council President , she tried to silence us. ACLU was contact ed, came to these meetings and I think it might have even been taken to court and we won. They said we could come here and say almost anything we want to. You can't threaten people or anything like that. And I'm not saying what Ron said was right. But, Council woman Rothchild , you said two weeks ago you're 50 Jewish. I'm 100 percent Jewish. And I have people that were in the -- family members that were in the Holocaust . And I took it with a grain of salt. If you want to sit up there, you have to have thick skin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And like I said, the ACLU said we could come up here and say almost anything. You might not agree with it. You might not like it, but you have to put up with it. MR. DONAHUE : Just because you can, doesn't necessarily mean you should either. MR. SPINDLER : I'm not saying that. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. SPINDLER : But the Unites States Constitution says and the ACLU came and they told us we can do that. I wouldn't say stuff like that. But if somebody wants to, that's their prerogative . And like I said, Council Rules do not supersede the U.S. Constitution . That's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello, Council . If I had said last week that Council I assume you assume my words were of great interest . I imagine each of you would think I was some kind of fool or jackass or something for assuming anything you assume. This -- this would involve reading one's mind. But in the editorial , a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 professional puts in writing he assumes what I assume. I think he needs his head examined for putting such nonsense in writing . And then he calls me ignorant . About -- I think it was two weeks ago there was a heartbreaking little article in the paper about the Peters family. I don't know if any of you noticed it. It was a little short thing in the middle of the paper. Mr. Peters was -- is 75 years old and financially embarrassed I guess is a good word and was looking for a position and his health isn't the best. Here is an American , people, an American -- it seems like we're forgotten about. He's achieved the American dream, his home and he's on the verge of losing it while a short distance away just in the very same area are 10 people on welfare , six kids in school, don't speak English so they can't work. This is their American dream. And now we can thank all the bleeding hearts for this. You people, most of you don't know it, I am a deplorable dyslexic. I know it's a bad defense , but I so often have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 problems with -- I say things backwards, upsidedown, sideways and all. I think that's why I misread what I had written down a couple weeks ago. But in a couple short weeks I guess we'll see what kind of America the people want, an immigrant America or America like it used to be. Let me tell you something . Last week I went to have a couple cocktails . I could have sat there for the rest of the night and people would have bought me drinks that saw this program what I said. Those are Americans whether you like to hear it or not. MR. DONAHUE : We're all Americans , Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: And that's the America that I believe in and I came from and I hope we go back to. I don't know what you were going to say. MR. DONAHUE : I said we're all Americans , Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm trying not to be controversial or get in any problem s for you. This isn't America no more. And while I'm at it, I wish Council would look up the gas and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Diesel Act of 2008 about parking and working on anything over 10,000 pounds. It's forbidden . My neighbor used it against me, but it doesn't seem like I could use it against tractor -trailer s parked in my neighborhood . I got three of them now. MR. DONAHUE : Are they back, Mr. Ellman? MR. ELLMAN: I didn't hear you. MR. DONAHUE : Are they back? Are the tractor -trailers back? I know they were moved. MR. ELLMAN: I was told by -- that this is City Code. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. We'll pass that onto the police department because I know they went out and ticketed them a few weeks ago. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, sir. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Next on the list, Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi, I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I was wondering why isn't the Mayor here? That's just throwing that out. It seems like that there's a divide. Well, because I've been asking for years like going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 back seven years, like, who runs this place, that place and, you know, I call 311. No one gets back to me. Anyway, I was here a few weeks ago talking about a Right To Know thing where we'd all get to find out who knows what. And I sent the Right To Know to Scranton Housing Authority and they denied everything . And so I have a feeling that the City of Scranton and the County of Lackawanna are what they call third party interest in all of this. And I'd like to -- I don't know if this is proper; but I appealed their thing today. Can I turn in papers here to some sort of Law Department ? MR. DONAHUE : So the City does have a Right To Know officer . We could get you that person's information . MR. LITTLE: No, I've already been through that -- what's her name -- and she referred me -- oh, we have to go -- it's all explained here in the appeal. I'd like to give the appeal. It isn't documented yet but just to give you more time to look at it. I mailed it today.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 ATTY. GALLAGHER : Okay. But if you mailed it, I don't know what -- MR. LITTLE: It's undocketed yet -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : Where did you appeal it to? MR. LITTLE: Harrisburg . Are you the lawyer for the City? ATTY. GALLAGHER : No. I'm just trying to help you out here. MR. DONAHUE : Attorney Gallagher is a Solicitor for Council . He's not the City Solicitor . MR. LITTLE: Solicitor means lawyer, right? MR. DONAHUE : He's the Council 's lawyer. MR. LITTLE: Well, I don't know. I have the appeal and legal matters . They're saying I'm just harassing them. But definitely the City -- MR. DONAHUE : Do you have a copy of that yourself? MR. LITTLE: Yes. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Okay. I don't know what -- well, if you appealed it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Harrisburg , that's the right person. MR. LITTLE: Right, but if you're a third party interest -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Little, can you, please -- thank you. MR. LITTLE: This is just a courtesy thing. Give you time to look at it. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, no problem . MR. LITTLE: Because I believe they are serious interest s of Lackawanna County the way they run Scranton Housing . They have a manager who only has a first name. And they delegate all of this stuff and there's no record of anything . And they've been evicting people, lots of people, including me. And the courts aren't running right. They're not using the Pennsylvania Criminal Procedure . I know this because I learned the law in New York State going through my -- working in the family courts. Courts are business . And what I've seen happening is great abuse of the elderly who are the greatest population in downtown Scranton . It is elderly people and it seems like this SHA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 agency, which I'm trying to run for board commission there and work it out within the system rather than sue them in federal court or something like that which I am capable of doing. But I love the City and I'd just like to see it work out. And one last thing, Pope Francis in the AP talked about German Nazi concentration camps. But he used the word lager, L-A-G-E-R, just like Yuengling beer lager. I think a lot of words and the whole freedom of speech thing, words like equality , democracy are just overdrilled , you know, too many people think they know what this means or that means. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Little. Your five minutes is -- MR. LITTLE: Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . I do think about two weeks ago I mentioned a property on Mulberry Street across the court from the fire station . I think it's worth looking into. And maybe I'll mention it again some day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Audits, I think we should start announcing the people and organizations of the City government that are tardy. And a few weeks ago Lackawanna football team came up. I would prefer that Lackawanna College spends their money on students instead of football . I know somebody that attended there with a medical assistant course. And all they had was a rubber arm was to practice to draw blood from. In order to certify as a phlebotomist , you need to have a clinical . So they really need to find other things other than sports as they're probably -- it would take them another 25 years to get big enough to even play on a real field. Before we talk anymore about swimming pools or things like that, we should be worried about the contracts . And, you know, we have to know what we have left after to do anything . And voting is coming up. Personal recommendation , vote down any Pennsylvania amendments to the Constitution . They're all a bunch of phooey. That's just going to throw it in the hands of the legislature so they could argue back and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 forth forever while people drop over from COVID or something like that. They just overruled the Governor 's ability to on the COVID the declaration from masks or whatever . I wonder where people get their ideas from. Now I'm concerned about undocumented aliens and what have you and refugees . Fifty years ago a lot of progressive people wanted to start funding under UNICEF family planning for the third world. And the population continued to grow because certain groups were against it. And it was immoral . It was this. It was that. And now the population is doubled and we have climate problem s and we have wars. And we have what have you, people like Viktor Bout flying around in his C130 transport selling AK 47s to everybody under the sun. There's an article I seen. Flynn's reawakened road show brings with it the army of God. And they're calling people haters of Jesus because they don't see it their way. They're the army of God. And those who are considered evil include government officials and democrats . They're calling people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 pedophiles with no basis in fact at all. And by the way, you know, they're probably a 501 C3. Now a few weeks ago I watched a documentary on QAnon and the one preacher was taking in 85 grand a week, 85 grand and probably just sticking it in his pocket, you know. Multiply that by 50 weeks. It comes out to about 4 million dollars , probably . Here's demonic, anybody that doesn't agree with them. And it's headed by General Flynn, by the way our famous -- why I have to pay his pension is beyond me because if anybody is unAmerican , he is. Thank you. I'll talk about this again. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening , Joann Williams , City resident . I'm here this evening to speak on once again the CMC Geisinger expansion . About a month ago some neighbors along with myself met with Mr. Ron Bear{sic} one of the executors of GCMC. He told us of their plans and he listened to our input. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 He explained how the parking garages -- he explained about the parking garages . What he had said is the garages on the 400 block of Colfax would only be three stories high, some pocket parks, and Mr. Bear would ask the neighbors for some input on those parks. They would fix the lighting to LED lighting and motion lighting . He also said that traffic is a big thing and that a traffic study will be done. Now, quite a few neighbors asked me if I trusted them. And, well, I would -- I lived by this hospital for 68 years. Now, the noise like I have said before and the traffic are problems at times. But otherwise , you know, I thought back about things and they haven't been a bad neighbor . And a few weeks ago I had to go to the emergency room myself. And I worked in skilled nursing back in the 90s and I was so upset when I was in that ER and I saw patients on gurneys in hallways . They were well taken care of, but the need for this hospital is to grow. You know, I really sat down and thought about it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Mr. Bear had explained to us the need to grow. And a few neighbors asked about building downtown . Mr. Bear made it clear that the hospital started up here in the hill years ago and the plan was to stay put. He did elaborate about a new mental health facility that would be built down towards Pittston or Wilkes-Barre. Now, my main concern in the 200 block of Colfax, I own a home partially there where if this does turn to civic they want to build an eight-story parking garage. So the only thing that I ask of CMC is to consider buying those. They tore three down this week on the two on the even. Next week they're going to tear the three on the odd side. So it leaves five houses left on the even side of Colfax which is my homestead partly owned by me. All I ask for CMC is to, you know, buy those houses because how are we going to sell them or how are we going to live there with an eight-story parking garage there? Let's see. It's been heartbreaking to see these houses coming down this week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 They are very dear and near to my heart. But the time is we need to focus on better healthcare and saving lives. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I just want to make a note that evidently the DPW has missed the south Minooka section at this point today. Usually they're there at the crack of anywhere between 6 a.m. and 8:30 in the morning . And as of driving over here, everything was still out there on our section . MR. DONAHUE : So by the south side, do you mean on the other side of Davis? MR. COYNE: Other side of Davis Street down Moosic. I expect them to catch up on it. I just wanted to mention that for some reason they didn't get around to that section today. And Section 3-E, it notes that OECD wants to contract with the Institute to perform Scranton ARP Programmatic Evaluation Services . And the scope of that is to make sure that the company who I thought we hired to plan out, to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 map, and to make sure that all the spending is done correctly and documented , it seems that we need another company to make sure that this company does the paperwork properly because they're both doing the same services of making sure the documentation is in place, making sure money is assigned properly and double checking it. So we're hiring two companies for the Recovery Plan to make sure the documents are in place? Seems a little odd that we need a company to watch a company -- unless I'm in error. And you could respond to that in Fifth if you choose to. Under G, the Scranton Parking Authority , do we really need a position for the Scranton Parking Authority ? It's been handed over for the next -- as of the contract for the next 45 years. So we have a position out there for an authority that really has very limited power because all of the spaces by the Authority had been handed out to a contractor . So it seems like a redundant authority to keep afloat and to put anyone in that position . Under Section I, the Middle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Mile Broadband Program , do any of you know what dark fiber is? Dark fiber has been put out there for many, many years in many cities. It was fiberoptic that was made by the government that is not being used. It was put through -- for example , Baltimore has fiber running through it but they never connected it to local residents , one, because they don't want to interfere with places like Comcast who serve them lots of money -- old monopoly . But also, the biggest problem with any fiberoptic and running services is the last mile. That point from where the fiberoptic hub is to people's house. And I understand that what they're trying to do is -- in it supply the universities and 14 colleges . What's interesting about that in that act is if you go and take a look at 7-D the contract with the Institute for the performance of Scranton American Rescue Program Plan, it's very interesting that that group is 15 hospitals Geisinger , Johnson , Keystone , Lackawanna College , Luzerne , Marywood , Misericordia , Penn State, University of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Scranton and the Wright Center. It's interesting that we are taking broadband for businesses and colleges . And we're putting the group to manage funding and overseeing it to the universities who it's going to serve, not that there's a conflict of interest with a group of 15 universities deciding where broadband should go that will serve 15 universities . I don't see a conflict there. Last of all going back to DPW, I hope in looking at the contract that you do have a chance to not rubber stamp it and ask them to put the change in there so that any unauthorize d use of equipment is grounds for termination . We had the water -- we had the sprayer taken away and used as a private business . That should not be allowed under the contract . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I was -- lost track of time because I wanted to get down here and hear the presentation that was going to be made. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 forgot my cell phone. I forgot my glasses . So I'm hoping that maybe you guys could help me out. One of the things that I had on my cellphone that I wanted to talk about was the activity that is going on at Nay Aug Park this weekend on Saturday . There's going to be a -- for lack of another word I'll say pow-wow with Indians . And they're going to give a history of the Indians and how they -- their affect on Nay Aug Park and how it became -- why it's Nay Aug Park, why it's named Roaring Brook and all of those things. And that's going to happen on Saturday . And there's also going to be a 5-K race. It's a different event. And I had all of that on my phone but I left it at home. MR. DONAHUE : So I know the 5-K race is -- it's called a 5-K. It's a benefit for mental illness . And I think there will also be trunk or treating involved with that. MS. JEFFRIES : Yes. You know, so the whether should be nice on Saturday . So maybe everyone could come up and support those two events that are going on up there on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Saturday . MR. DONAHUE : I'm going to see if I could find information on the other one. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, and maybe put it out there. Also, two weeks in a row the caucuses have run very late. And I could turn over at 6:30 tomorrow morning . But there's a lot people whose schedule s are affected by the late running of the caucuses and how they affect Council meetings as well. So I was just wondering is it poured in concrete that it has to be at 5:45 or can it just be pushed up to 5:30? I wasn't sure why 5:45 and not 5:30. MR. DONAHUE : So when I first got on Council , the caucuses were only 30 minutes . We did extend them I believe a couple years ago to the 45. You know, I think there were a couple times when we did extend that out. But the problem there is we advertised that in the beginning of the year. And that's our -- so if we were to change our schedule to start earlier , we do have to take out a special advertisement . MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, so something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that could be looked at come next year. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. JEFFRIES : Because , you know, to anyone that is coming to Council and wants to participate or has, you know, they have to wait until the caucuses are finished . And it's very good, the caucus, especial ly the one tonight , you know, because that's my -- one of my hot buttons for four years since I've been back in Scranton . I have my little tablet and I took lots of notes. And it was good to hear that you're not going to -- it's not going to be on the agenda until -- did you say three more weeks? MR. DONAHUE : So for the decriminalization of it -- is that what you're talking -- MS. JEFFRIES : Well, just all the things. I took a lot of notes here that I have questions on. MR. DONAHUE : So the parking concession agreement is in Sixth Order tonight . So it would be up assuming it passes Sixth Order tonight it would be up for a final vote 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 next week. The decriminalization part of it which was the barnacle -- where they're talking about putting barnacles , that hasn't -- we haven't even received that legislation yet. I think they just included that in as a -- as a here's what's coming. MS. JEFFRIES : Well, then how do I get all my questions answered before you're going to put it up for final? MR. DONAHUE : On the concession agreement ? We'll talk after and -- MS. JEFFRIES : Yeah, because one of the things that the gentleman kept saying was about the lack of uses of the garages. And I don't feel secure in those garages at night. I don't know if they have cameras in there or if there is anyone there to oversee . It's very dark in those garages at night. And I'm not sure if that's what he was referring to. But he kept referring to the fact that the garages were not utilize d as much as on-street parking . And I could see that because any time I use them I don't feel comfortable .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, and I think that the goal of that too is during the day to utilize more of the garage parking at the rate so that, you know, it does open up some premium parking in areas where, you know, if you were going to pick up lunch or stop in a store. MS. JEFFRIES : And one other question I have -- I got 22 seconds . Has there ever been a study on the business es downtown and the affects of parking meters and the kiosks on their business ? I know I like to go to -- I don't know if I should say this name or not -- the Commonwealth down on Penn Avenue and all of those stores down there. And you've got to really watch. And I know that they have the app that you could put on your phone and everything . It's one of those things that I say I'm going to do, I'm going to do. And I haven't gotten around to doing it yet. But, you know, as he was speaking I was wondering have we done a study on just how the kiosks have affected the businesses because I know I don't go down -- if I'm going to meet the ladies, I say let's go out someplace where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 we can park. MR. DONAHUE : I could reach out and ask them that. The kiosks are relative ly new compare d to the parking meters but we'll reach out and ask him. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I think the security question too if you could add that to the list. That was a valid question . MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. JARMAN: I wasn't originally planning on speaking today -- or tonight . However , several people that have come up here to speak tonight have felt the need to emphasize the importance of the First Amendment and the right of individuals to speak regardless of how offensive their words may seem. Although it is true that City Council officials and government officials are limited in their capacity to condone speech and chastise speech, I'm not a member of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 government in any capacity . Those restrictions don't apply to me. So I would like to use my time tonight to condemn the hatred and vitriol and disgust that has been directed towards immigrants in our community . These are people who have come here, some fleeing violence , some simply looking for opportunity to provide for themselves , to provide for their families . They want nothing more than to find a place where they could live their lives in peace and that anyone feels the need to come up here and call them useless, disgust ing -- I'll keep my language clean tonight . But it frustrates me to no end, especially hearing it from someone who has been coming here for years to complain about matters that have no relevance whatsoever to the City Council , to come up here and complain about immigrant s after spending years coming to these meeting s complaining about matters like your ex-wife, complain ing about alimony payments . Every single problem in your own life you want to come here and complain to your City Council as if that has anything whatsoever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 to do with them. And you want to blame immigrant s for all of it as well. I'm under no illusion s of the failure s in our government's past to provide and protect the vulnerable . I'm not going to deny or pretend that the United States government didn't turn boats away when we should have been welcoming them. But the matter of fact is this -- never again means never again. And I will not allow that type of speech to go unchallenged under any circumstance . And for all of those who wish to continue defending such speech under the guise of first amendment rights, it's very obvious that you're just too cowardly to say it yourselves . You want to hide behind decorum because you're too afraid to be seen as hateful and ignorant just like the speech of the person that you chose to support . You could have just as easily done the exact same thing that I'm doing right now condemning that hatred but you chose not to. So I just want to make this clear. This city and this country will never under any circumstance go back to whatever imaginary past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 such people might think it once was -- some utopia where it was all white people living in harmony, no queers, no minorities , no immigrants . That future -- that past will never be realized . That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, I want to congratulate the Chairman -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : -- and his growing family. Can anybody up there tell me how many unfilled positions there are in the City? MR. DONAHUE : At the moment, no. I know we got an update a couple months ago. You know, it's fluid, right, so -- I don't have it right in front of me. But if I could find it for Fifth Order I'll let you know. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. The reason I ask is because somebody came up and I think it might have been Tom last week said if we haven't filled positions for a certain length of time, then maybe we should do away with those positions and put the money someplace else. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Now it looks as though we desperately need a lot of money because if you read your 3-B, I believe we have -- we are using overtime like -- well, I believe it was $35,000 and change is all that was left at the end of September . So I believe you're supposed to have appropriated money before you spend it. So how are you guys going do that? I think scraping up all that salary and fringe benefit s that have not been utilized might be a good place to start. But I expect next week that you will have a transfer or whatever you have to do to cover what you think the overtime will be for the rest of the year. Either that or say no more overtime. We don't want to do that. That's our fire and police mostly. So look forward to that next week. Would it be possible for the five of you to get together and say what you -- the top three priorities that you think the City has for 2024? MR. DONAHUE : 2023? MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : 2023 or 2024? MS. SCHUMACHER : Both, because , you know, we have planning to do and we have prioritization ; and I don't think we're doing it right to be honest. I spoke last week about the concern about Court Street which is a quarter of a block at the most. Meanwhile , Lackawanna Avenue has the horrible , horrible wall that needs to be fixed and the sidewalks . And how much are we -- the combined amount for -- that Lackawanna County has and that we have -- MR. DONAHUE : I think we were about $800,000 short. MR. SCHUMACHER : $800,000 short? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MS. SCHUMACHER : Don't we have enough of that money in the Rescue Plan? MR. DONAHUE : So first off, I don't believe that majority of the Rescue Plan money could be used there because it's not low to moderate income -- a low to moderate income area. I will double check that, but I believe that's the case there. So it could only be pulled from a certain pot and that would be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 loss revenue item. But I'll look into that and also, Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to follow up and see -- because I don't think we ever got a response when we forwarded along that information . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't think that was even in the capital budget fixing that. It looks terrible . 8-A, we have to come to the point where that I think the state is being awfully generous with us granting us all of this time that we have to fulfill what we're suppose d to do. So when are we going to have that brought back? MR. DONAHUE : We're hoping by the end of the year. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Oh, and speaking of the end of year you said -- MR. DONAHUE : 8-A, right, is that what you're talking about? Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. And quickly -- well, I'll hold it until next week. MR. DONAHUE : I know stormwater I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 said hopefully by the end of the year for stormwater . MS. SCHUMACHER : You said hopefully , you said it would be by the end of the year. MR. DONAHUE : I was hopeful it was by the end of the year. We can't force anybody to do anything . We could make suggestions , right? MS. SCHUMACHER : We'll see. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I do not. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : A few. First of all, I'd like to make a motion to pull 5-H from the agenda. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second to pull 5-H from the agenda. On the question ? On the question , I know that Solicitor Gallagher brought up some issues with this that he would like to discuss with the City's Law Department before we even introduce this. Solicitor Gallagher , would you like to expand on that at all? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I just want to make sure they don't have to rebid. They want to amend the contract . But the bidding threshold is 19,400. They want to include other services . I want to make sure they don't have to rebid to include the service s. And also, there was no fee schedule associated with it yet. So that was missing as well, so just a conversation with them. I'm sure it will get ironed out by next week. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So also on the question , I mean, I have the same concern s as Solicitor Gallagher . Just a small question is, who is completing these legislative cover sheets? I'm not sure if they're coming through the departments . I would imagine that's where they're coming from. It seems like the last several we had have been incomplete and have had many mistakes . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just ask who completed the legislative cover sheet for 5-H? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. I'm in total agreement with my colleague Councilman Schuster . We've been receiving a lot of legislation that's sloppy, that's incomplete . And I don't know who is proofreading this. I know that when our office -- Mr. Voldenberg does a fantastic job of doing this type of work for us. We would expect the same from our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 administration . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of pulling 5-H off the agenda signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, second, Mr. Derek Raines, he's a regular here at the Council . And he's a champion for ADA. He lives over at 919 Monroe Avenue, has an issue that still has yet to be resolved that is affecting him more than ever. And this issue he's been bringing up for at least two years. Two weeks ago when we received a lot of rain the county bus had difficulty picking up Mr. Raines in his driveway. The bus actually received some damage because the driver could not see what was beneath 6 inches of water going into his driveway because of this concern that remains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 for years. All right. The issue stems from the poor stormwater drainage at this part of Monroe. This issue was bought up multiple times. He told me that representatives from both the water company and the City have visited him. He said both were very nice. But the water company has claimed to Mr. Raines that it's not their responsibility but the City's. The City told Mr. Raines that the City has no resources or money to fix this. With all the ARPA infrastructure money flying around, I have trouble understanding why this can't be correct ed. Mr. Voldenberg , please send correspondence to the administration and request an answer in writing for the reason why this issue cannot be resolved . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Second, so I got some more calls about Portnoff Associates . So -- and they're the collector of the delinquent trash fees -- Scranton trash fees. They are sending out incorrect billing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 to residents and filing liens on taxpayer s that are not delinquent . I repeat not delinquent . So this guy told me that the Treasury Department was very helpful in fixing one incorrect bill but he received another delinquent bill from 2020 a week later that is not owed. Now that the delinquent refuse trash fee database is back up and running , I would hate to see residents ' names on here as delinquents in error. Mr. Voldenberg , please forward these concerns mentioned to Portnoff Associates . I think this was a problem last year too. There wasn't a database up, but I know that people were being contacted for fees that they were not delinquent with. This should have been rectified by this year. Also, in addition to vandalism that recently occurred at the Falcon football field that I know the police are investigating that issue, there is another issue that was brought to my attention that someone is parking all of their equipment like bobcats and dumpsters -- or a dumpster on this property which is ours. It's the Falcon field. So maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 we're doing work there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please inquire if the City's equipment located there is ours doing work there or if it's someone else is storing equipment without permission . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next, I would like to make a motion. I would like to make a motion to reopen City Hall to the public and operate it as it was prepandemic instituting , you know, a proper security measure without the necessity of locked doors, barriers or appointment s needed for the public to complete City business . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , just to expand on it because I want to keep the motion short. City Hall is not just a municipal building . It's a historical landmark . Two, there are other ways to secure the building without infringing on people's right to their government . And three, there is no other government building in the county in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 which you need to make an appointment . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So just on the question , I agree with my colleague here. I don't think any appointment should be necessary to gain access to this building as well as to gain access to other city departments . These essential services and departments need to be open so all city residents can visit them in person and have walk-in services without appointment s. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I'm all for opening City Hall. And I believe this is the people's building . There is no two ways about that. I would like to see it open with some type of still paying attention to safety somehow if we could set up a situation where -- I don't know if there's a police officer that works in the building , a constable , someone that could meet and greet whoever is coming in, state their business what have you and, you know, permit them to come in.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 So that I am still concerned about the health, safety, and welfare of everyone working in this building . And I know that I want people to have access. I absolutely do. And they deserve that access. It's just -- I would just like to see the administration take some steps to try to improve how that happens . And quite frankly , for people that are already in here visiting City Hall to protect them as well to just have some type of security measures that would -- whether it's a meet and greet at the entrance to people, state their business , what department they were planning to go at or what have you but just some type of procedures . I know that there was an incident up in Monroe County several years ago and, you know, someone came in and I believe someone was murdered at a Council meeting or -- and, you know, that's a concern . So my point here is this. There has to be a balance . I believe we can open City Hall back to where it was but still, you know, provide some level of security . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just on the question with that just to speak to Mr. King, I do agree with him here on that one although City Council really doesn't run day-to-day operations . I think once City Hall is open, the administration can find a way to provide what it is that you're stating . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm in agreement with Councilman King. I also believe that City Hall should be up open to the public without locked doors. However , I believe it's prudent to first figure out the security measure s and to determine those prior to doing that. If we don't have a plan in place for that then that needs to happen first before opening it up because that's -- that is a real concern . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: Can I propose a friendly amendment to your motion? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. MCANDREW : And what would that be? MR. KING: To request that within a week or two that the administration come back with a plan to open City Hall that would meet some of the security measures that we requested and, you know, if that plan is not received within the two-week period then we move forward with the original motion. MR. MCANDREW : I guess, but administration requested the concerns by the people a few weeks ago. Nothing has progressed . We were asked who said it, why. We provided that information didn't we, Mr. Voldenberg , to the administration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. MCANDREW : -- questioning why it should be reopened. We received nothing , no -- that's why I brought it up because what happens here is we're pacified for months, weeks and then nothing occurs. So that's why I want to tighten the motion and then the responsibility like Mr. Schuster said is we're not the day-to-day people but we represent the people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 The people want the building open. It's the administration 's responsibility to figure out a way to do it with some safety measures . MR. SCHUSTER : So with that being said, I would only be I think (inaudible ) to that amendment if we could make it a week. I did pose this question three weeks ago and as Mr. McAndrew was saying, I have not to receive an answer yet. So we have about three weeks that we've been waiting for security answers to the building . We haven't gotten them yet. I think possibly a week would be sufficient getting it to us before our deadline for our next meeting . MR. KING: I would be agreeable to that. MR. DONAHUE : So there's a motion on the floor and a second. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 ayes have it and so moved. MR. SCHUSTER : So just to clarify , that date would be? MR. DONAHUE : Next week. MR. SCHUSTER : Monday by noon? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : Monday by noon. MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. President , can we ask Mr. Voldenberg if he could forward that information to the administration ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . You know, Frank, we'll touch base about that after the meeting . But can we also just send the followup questions to Mr. Trevisani and also to Ben Anderson who wasn't able to make it tonight -- represents ABM regarding what security measures are taken especial ly at night in the parking garages . And also, has there been any study and/or analysis on the affects the kiosks have had on downtown businesses ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have for this evening . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

And then the second page of that when it's under funding sources, I'm sure it's contained in document behind it. But it's not contained in that legislative cover sheet so we just have to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 careful with these that we're making sure someone is proofreading them.
